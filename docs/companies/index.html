  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Andrea Beskers</a></p><p>When Leonardo Morales from Siemens first attended the European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021, he tried to gather experience and knowledge from others to avoid common mistakes on his IAM journey.&nbsp;Now he is giving a keynote speech <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5022/3">Siemens AG: Real-World Enterprise IAM at Scale</a> on Wednesday, May 11, at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2022">European Identity and Cloud Conference 2022</a> to help others overcome the same hurdles.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked&nbsp;Leonardo some questions about his presentation.</p>
<p> </p>
 Why is IAM important? 
<p>IAM is important for Siemens to do business and be a better competitor in the market. Siemens needs to move from the intranet to the Internet. We need to implement architectures to verify authorised access from anywhere and from any device for the purpose of security in our hybrid environment, but also to automate the provisioning of new employees. Therefore, we need a very well implemented IAM system that also has the responsibility to verify the authenticity of people in relation to their identity and to perform the appropriate lifecycle processes according to business and control regulations. This is why IAM is so important for Siemens.</p>
<p></p>
 What are the biggest challenges you’ve faced so far?  
<p>Yes, I remember when I started this journey, I thought we knew what we were going to do and how we were going to do it. But we hadn't considered the biggest challenge, our data quality and the many processes around identity and account management. That was a nightmare. We were dealing with more than 100 identity data providers, more than 200 Active Directory providers and different processes. And we've had to find out time and time again that not all of them are compliant. This is because of the data, incorrect and inconsistent data that requires continuous data cleansing. That was the biggest challenge, to create reliable and trustworthy automated processes.</p>
<p></p>
 What is the most common mistake organizations make in IAM projects? 
<p>This question is very good, because I have to think about our start. It was not just about choosing a simple process or tool, but more than that. It's a really holistic perspective, an assessment that everyone has to make in order to meet the right expectations. The biggest mistake at the beginning of the project was that we didn't have a clear idea of what we wanted to achieve, and we found that out quite late. The second mistake was underestimating the effort and the costs. I think it is obvious that it is not a one-time implementation, but a process that goes from the beginning of the project to the enforcement and implementation of new processes and regulations that become part of daily working life. That, in my view, is the biggest mistake.</p>
<p></p>
 What is the one thing you would like people to take away from EIC? 
<p>Yes, when I first participated in the EIC, I tried to gain experience and knowledge from others to avoid making the same mistakes or falling into the same traps. For me, it was important to know and learn from others. Therefore, I would like to share our experiences, recommendations and future expectations on the topic of IAM in a large company like Siemens, which has different business units in many countries and is constantly changing.</p>

<p>This week’s roundup of FindBiometrics’ top stories features news and discussion around some of the more consequential applications of biometrics in the real world, in addition to a bit of more straightforward business news concerning a biometrics startup.</p>



<p>Starting with the heavy stuff, readers showed strong interest in an item about one of the consequences of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Canada has opened its doors to Ukrainian refugees, waiving many of the usual requirements pertaining to applications for temporary residency in the country. But it’s still insisting on the collection of refugees’ face and fingerprint biometrics, which means refugees will still need to visit a Visa Application Centre in person:</p>



 <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/canada-opens-doors-ukrainian-citizens-032103/">Canada Waives Most Immigration Requirements for Ukrainian Citizens, But Biometrics Must Be Collected</a> 



<p>Then there’s the issue of how police should use facial recognition technology – a branch of biometrics discourse that has become fraught in recent years. Seeking to get an accurate picture of how the American public sees the matter, Pew Research Center surveyed over 10,000 US adults about questions like whether the widespread use of facial recognition by police would be good or bad, and whether it would curb crime rates. And it delivered some striking results:</p>



 <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/pew-police-use-of-facial-recognition-study-503211/">Pew Asked 10,000 Americans How They Feel About Police Use of Facial Recognition: Here’s What They Said</a> 



<p>The increasing use of facial recognition and the emergence of new privacy laws governing the technology were important topics that came up on the show floor at this week’s ISC West event in Las Vegas, where FindBiometrics’ Doug OGorden spent some time <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/podcasts/">talking with a number of industry leaders</a>. In a particularly popular interview, OGorden dug into these heavier considerations with Jake Parker, the SIA’s Senior Director of Government Relations:</p>

<p>Important issues related to this discussion, such as the matter of privacy and data protection, also came up during FindBiometrics’ recent Year in Review Virtual Identity Summit. A replay of the entire, full-day event, helpfully broken down into session-focused videos, is now available, and our post for the downloads has been getting heavy traffic:</p>

<p>Finally, on a lighter note, AuthID.ai got some attention this week with its announcement that it had raised $22.5 million in financing. The biometric identity verification and authentication specialist also reported year-over-year revenue growth, and suggested that despite a heavier net loss, its new financing has put the company on track for positive cash flow in 2024:</p>

<p>Apple’s mobile ID has finally, officially launched, making Arizona ground zero for what is poised to become a sprawling digital ID program.</p>



  



<p>First announced in June of 2021, <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/apple-mobile-id-cards-including-drivers-licenses-wallet-app-806091/">Apple’s mobile ID system</a> is designed to let iPhone users add virtual versions of the driver’s licenses and state ID cards to the mobile device’s Wallet app. Further details trickled out over the ensuing months, as the initial launch date of the mobile ID system was postponed from late 2021 to early 2022.</p>



<p>Now it’s here, and Arizonans can not only add their government-issued IDs to the Wallet, but can already present them as official ID at TSA security checkpoints in the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.</p>



 A Smartwatch Surprise 



<p>The news also brings a development that was not widely anticipated: mobile ID functionality via the Apple Watch. While an iPhone must be used in the initial onboarding process to get a user’s digital ID set up, a paired Apple Watch can subsequently be used for identity verification at the airport. The smartwatch or iPhone needs only to be tapped at a security checkpoint identity reader device in order to confirm the user’s identity, prompting a biometric authentication request via Touch ID or Face ID, Apple’s fingerprint and face scanning systems.</p>



<p>The process does not require the user to actually present their virtual credentials to a TSA agent, or even to unlock their device – a remarkable feat of user experience engineering, given stringent airport security practices. </p>



<p>Apple’s success in obtaining the TSA’s cooperation on this aspect of the mobile ID can surely be attributed, at least in part, to the system’s rigorous onboarding process. The end user is asked to upload a selfie along with images of their official identity document, and facial recognition is used to match them. But it also goes a step further, prompting the user “to complete a series of facial and head movements”, as Apple explained in its announcement. This appears to be a kind of active, gesture-based liveness detection mechanism.</p>



<p>The mobile ID solution offers a number of data privacy advantages to end users. Only the information needed in a given interaction with state authorities will be shared in a given interaction, based on what the user’s authorizes; and, as mentioned above, encrypted communications with the identity reader mean that the user doesn’t need to show an actual credential to an agent. A lost iPhone or Apple Watch containing a digital ID can be remotely locked and even erased.</p>



 Beyond Sky Harbor 



<p>As for interactions with authorities beyond the airport, such as state police, it isn’t yet clear whether Apple’s mobile ID will be accepted as official identification. Apple’s announcement focused solely on airport applications.</p>



<p>“We’re thrilled to bring the first driver’s license and state ID in Wallet to Arizona today, and provide Arizonans with an easy, secure, and private way to present their ID when traveling, through just a tap of their iPhone or Apple Watch,” said Apple Pay and Apple Wallet VP Jennifer Bailey. “We look forward to working with many more states and the TSA to bring IDs in Wallet to users across the US.”</p>



<p>On that note, Apple’s announcement brought new revelations about which states it was working with to deliver further launches of its mobile ID system. In addition to the <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/apple-delays-mobile-id-rollout-hints-at-retail-venue-access-features/">handful of state partnerships</a> that were previously announced, the company noted that rollouts in Colorado, Hawaii, Mississippi, Ohio, and Puerto Rico are coming “soon.”</p>



<p>This week also brought a report that Apple representative had met with the New York DMV Deputy Commissioner in the latter half of 2021 to discuss the mobile ID program.</p>

<p>Clearview AI has launched the latest version of its controversial facial recognition platform. The enhanced platform comes with improved image enhancement tools, as well as better reporting features that ostensibly give administrators more oversight over the use of the platform.</p>



  



<p>Clearview 2.0 also doubles the size of the company’s massive image database. The company was <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/clearview-formally-patents-controversial-data-harvesting-system-020102/">boasting that its database contained 10 million images</a> in February of this year, but is now claiming that law enforcement officers will have access to 20 billion images with the second generation of its platform. That suggests that the company’s database is expanding at an unprecedented rate, despite numerous <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-google-youtube-send-cease-desist-letter-clearview-ai-020601/">cease-and-desist orders</a> and despite the fact that <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/france-becomes-latest-country-censure-clearview-ai-privacy-violations-010305/">several countries</a> have ruled that the company’s <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/australian-information-commissioner-finds-clearview-violated-privacy-act-110901/">data collection practices are unlawful</a>.</p>



<p>At the moment, Clearview is marketing its platform exclusively to law enforcement and government agencies, though it has hinted that it <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/oosto-stands-against-clearviews-private-sector-expansion-022406/">wants to return to the private sector</a> at some point in the future. The company’s client roster currently includes more than 3,100 agencies at the federal and local levels. The new version of the Clearview platform is already being rolled out for those existing clients, with additional training to make sure that the individual agents with access to the platform are following the proper verification and reporting procedures.</p>



<p>On the technology front, the new image enhancement tool will allow investigators to generate matches with low-resolution images, and with images captured in poor lighting conditions. They will also be able to find matches when a face is partially obscured. Clearview described Clearview 2.0 as “the most significant upgrade since the release of its initial platform.”</p>



<p>Clearview’s recent investor pitch deck indicates that the company is <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/clearview-leaked-pitch-deck-biometrics-expansion-plans-502182/">planning to have 100 billion images</a> in its database before the end of the year. The company’s facial recognition algorithm has <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/clearview-does-well-another-nist-test-112904/">performed well in NIST testing</a>, though the company was recently hit with a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/italian-regulators-issue-e20-million-fine-against-clearview-ai-031505/">€20 million fine</a> for violating Italy’s data privacy laws.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gettyimages.ca/">Getty Images</a> is updating its model release forms for a biometric era. In that regard, the company noted that biometric data (and facial data in particular) is increasingly used to <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/onfido-retraining-biometric-algorithm-reduce-racial-bias-082105/">train the algorithms</a> that are used in AI and machine learning applications. However, legislators have tried to protect people’s privacy rights in the past few years, and are starting to pass more laws that prevent the commercial use of biometric data without the individual’s consent.</p>



  



<p>That creates a major and potentially costly liability for a company like Getty, which operates a massive marketplace filled with pictures of people’s faces. The new release form is designed to make it easier for businesses to comply with the new wave of data protection laws, since models who sign the form will be giving their employer the right to use their biometric data for commercial purposes.</p>



<p>“We hope for it to be widely adopted and signed by models who feature in new commercial images and videos on the Getty Images and iStock websites,” explained Getty Advocacy Director and Legal Operations Counsel Paul Reinitz. “We must recognize that the increased use of biometric data contained in imagery to train AI/ML applications requires the need to ensure that we have obtained the model’s permission to use their image and data in this manner and Getty Images is at the forefront of addressing these very real concerns.”</p>



<p>In that regard, the new release seems like it was put together to provide legal cover for businesses, and not necessarily to protect individual privacy rights. Having said that, signing away image rights is the norm in content creation, insofar as models and actors usually know that their likenesses will be shared somewhere before going to a shoot. With that in mind, the practices that are standard in that industry might not be applicable to the general public.</p>



<p>Getty suggested that the new release is the first form of its kind, and stressed that it was developed in collaboration with the Digital Media Licensing Association to make sure that it would meet the latest legal expectations. The international data protection landscape is still shifting, though <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/illinois-supreme-court-face-statute-limitations-decision-on-bipa-031006/">Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act</a> and the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-institute-updates-privacy-guidelines-reflect-gdpr-standards/">EU’s GDPR regulations</a> have now been in effect for several years and are informing <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/california-proposes-stricter-data-privacy-regulations-022102/">similar bills in other jurisdictions</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fingerprints.com/">Fingerprint Cards</a> (FPC) has passed another major commercial milestone. The company revealed that its fingerprint recognition technology has now been featured in more than 600 different smartphone models all over the world.</p>



  



<p>According to FPC, that figure speaks to the strength of the mobile biometrics market, and the rising demand for fingerprint solutions in consumer handsets. The company cleared the 600 device threshold just over a year after <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/more-than-500-smartphone-models-now-feature-fpc-technology-012102/">crossing the 500 mark</a>, which it did in January of 2021. That means that FPC added another 100 devices in roughly the same amount of time that it needed to stack the previous 100, since it <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/400-smartphone-models-feature-fpc-biometric-sensors-811121/">broke the 400 device barrier</a> in November of 2019.</p>



<p>That suggests that the mobile biometrics market is growing at a steady rate, and that there will plenty of interest in devices with fingerprint sensors moving forward. That obviously bodes well for FPC, which recently placed one of its curved fingerprint sensors in the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/new-xiaomi-phone-features-curved-fpc-sensor-7022207/">Redmi K50 handset from Xiaomi</a>.</p>



<p>“We have witnessed accelerated demand for biometrics in smartphones over recent years,” said FPC Mobile, PC, and Access China President Ted Hansson. “Biometrics are now the natural choice for manufacturers seeking to increase security and convenience for the whole world of mobile phone users. To see Fingerprints’ sensors in 600 different smartphone models is proof that our products are trusted globally and are paving the way for biometrics’ use across a range of other industries, improving the ease and security of our daily lives.”</p>



<p>While the mobile market remains a top priority for FPC, the company has taken steps to diversify its portfolio in the past few years. Fingerprints is particularly interested in the PC market, and believes that more than <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/fpc-expects-pcs-to-embrace-fingerprint-biometrics-909254/">two-thirds of PCs</a> will come with a fingerprint sensor by 2026. The company made its way onto <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/microsoft-lists-fpc-approved-windows-hello-technology-vendor-030201/">Microsoft’s approved vendor list</a> earlier this month.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bioconnect.com/">BioConnect</a> has picked up a prize at the <a href="https://www.iscwest.com/en-us/seminars/sia-new-product-showcase.html">New Product Showcase Awards</a> for the second consecutive year. Presented by the <a href="https://www.securityindustry.org/">Security Industry Association</a>, the New Products and Solutions Awards were handed out on March 23 on the ISC West show floor in Las Vegas, and are designed to recognize products that are at the forefront of security innovation.</p>



  



<p>This time around, BioConnect is being celebrated for its Trust Platform for Small Spaces, which was the winner in the Key / Equipment Assets Management Solutions category. The Small Spaces offering gives organizations a way to extend their enterprise security credentials to smaller storage areas like safes and cabinets to ensure that only those with the proper authority are able to gain access to critical resources. The solution allows employees to take advantage of the same credentials that they use at the front door, and is flexible enough to work in both online and offline settings, or while on the road.</p>



<p>“BioConnect is thrilled to accept this award from SIA for our Trust Platform for Small Space Solution,” said BioConnect Chief Technology and Security Officer Courtney Gibson. “This technology will provide additional layers of security when securing and transporting both important keys and controlled substances. We are proud of the work we have done, and we are honored to be selected as the winner amongst a competitive category of impressive solutions.”</p>



<p>“SIA congratulates BioConnect for standing out among the impressive field of entrants in this competitive flagship awards program,” added SIA CEO Don Erickson. The winners of the SIA New Products and Solutions Awards were chosen by a panel of 30 expert judges, and were presented in 25 different product categories.</p>



<p>BioConnect <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bioconnect-completes-acquisition-medixsafe-090904/">acquired the small space security provider MedixSafe</a> in September of 2021. The company’s Enterprise 5.0 solution, meanwhile, was named the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bioconnect-enterprise-5-0-platform-wins-isc-west-new-product-showcase-award-062402/">Best Convergence and Integration Solution</a> at ISC West in 2021. <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bioconnect-emphasizes-unified-mobile-access-latest-version-enterprise-platform-102107/">Enterprise 5.0</a> is part of the company’s broader Trust Platform for biometric access control, which was being showcased with a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/suprema-bioconnect-show-off-new-product-integrations-isc-west-032203/">series of Suprema product integrations</a> at this year’s ISC West event.</p>

<p>This Dev Pulse is a short one, just two Holochain releases and a few new hApps and libraries — plus one bit of big news: Holochain now has a roadmap!</p> Holochain 0.0.130: Versatile links, cell shutdown fix <p><a href="https://blog.holochain.org/big-performance-boosts/#a-second-note-about-breaking-changes">Breaking changes</a>: HDK<br>HDK version compatibility: 0.0.125</p><p>Links got a big change in last week’s release (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1266">#1266</a>). There are two main differences:</p>  The base and target address no longer need to exist on the DHT in order for the link to be valid. This means that you can do fun things like use a string constant as a basis for a link, say, <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/5_links_anchors/#case-study-a-music-sharing-app"><code>"all_user_handles"</code></a>, get its hash, and use the hash as a base for links that point to individual user handle entries — all without creating the <code>"all_user_handles"</code> entry in the first place. This saves steps, like ‘ensuring’ that the base exists before trying to link to it, which was always subject to eventual consistency glitches that could result in multiple agents trying to create the same entry. Note: while this does not by itself break compatibility with your existing code, it does relax the host’s built-in validation behaviour. If you want to get the old behaviour, your link validation code can simply call <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.125/hdk/entry/fn.must_get_entry.html">`must_get_entry`</a> on the base and target.  Breaking: <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.125/hdk/link/fn.create_link.html">create_link</a></code> now takes a <code>link_type</code> parameter. This is simply a <code>u8</code> value that your code can use to create link types, similar to entry types. If you don’t care to type your links, you can simply pass <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.125/hdk/link/enum.HdkLinkType.html#variant.Any"><code>HdkLinkType::Any</code></a>.  <p>Finally, there’s one bug fix: errors in a workflow are logged rather than causing Holochain to abort the cell they occur in (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1279">#1279</a>). This fixes a case in which an <code>UnresolvedDependencies</code> error thrown when committing entries during cell startup would kill the cell; it probably fixes other cases you’ve encountered too.</p><blockquote>And finally, this is the first release that features a fully automated release process! This has been in the works for a while; the DevOps team (Stefan and Jost) has been creating, refining, testing, and fixing the build scripts for a while. They’re delighted to let computers take over the boring work and are excited to apply their creativity and skill to more appealing challenges.</blockquote><p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.130/CHANGELOG.md#20220316022611">Read the full changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.131: Efficient network rejoining <p>Breaking changes: none<br>HDK version compatibility: 0.0.125, 0.0.126</p><p>Aside from some excellent documentation about <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.126/hdk/hash/index.html">how Holochain hashes are constructed</a> (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1299">#1299</a>), the networking module has gotten one small change: when a cell starts up and rejoins a network it already belongs to, it remembers prior arc sizes of all of its peers (also called its ‘neighbourhood’), and starts off with those values (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1287">#1287</a>). This reduces a bit of network chatter contacting neighbours and finding out how much of the DHT they’re holding.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.131/CHANGELOG.md#20220323023956">Read the full changelog</a>.</p> Delivery zome: send private messages asynchronously <p>Damien Douté, Holochain core team alumnus and developer of the <a href="https://github.com/glassbeadsoftware/snapmail">SnapMail</a> intranet email hApp, has released a library called <a href="https://github.com/ddd-mtl/delivery-zome">delivery-zome</a>. This is the first library that I’ve seen to implement the <a href="https://forum.holochain.org/t/mailbox/1084">Mailbox</a> and <a href="https://forum.holochain.org/t/asynchronous-private-messaging/1085">Asynchronous Private Messaging</a> patterns, which let you send public or private messages to other users when they’re offline. (Can you call them patterns if they’ve never been implemented before? I don’t know. I needed some sort of name for them when I first wrote about them.) It also implements delivery receipts and large message chunking, and will in the future implement read receipts, recipient-to-recipient sharing, automated mailbox polling, and DHT-free delivery using third-party drop-off points.</p><p>Damien warns us that this is an early release and hasn’t had a security review, so please use with caution. I’m sure that code reviews and pull requests would also be welcome!</p> Neighbourhoods MVP (Memeable Viable Product) <p><a href="https://neighbourhoods.network/">Neighbourhoods</a>, a prominent Holochain project stewarded by <a href="https://sacred.capital">Sacred Capital</a> (itself a member of the <a href="https://economikit.org/">Economikit Alliance</a>, another prominent Holochain project), has <a href="https://youtu.be/OaaK6oXL6Ls">released</a> its first working demo hApp. They’re calling it <a href="https://github.com/neighbour-hoods/nh-mvp">MVP</a>, or Memeable Viable Product. This hApp is a very entertaining demonstration, using emoji votes on meme pics to show how their <a href="https://github.com/neighbour-hoods/rep_lang">rep_lang engine</a> and <a href="https://github.com/neighbour-hoods/social_sensemaker">social_sensemaker zome</a> can be used to define the reputationional currencies that a particular group of people might find meaningful.</p><p>Custom algorithms let you tailor your feed using the MVP community’s two basic reputational currencies: funny and mind-blowing. You can choose your own preference from four default community algorithms or create your own using <a href="https://github.com/neighbour-hoods/rep_lang/wiki/USER_GUIDE">rep_lang expressions</a>.</p><blockquote>We talk a lot about what’s wrong with social media, and feed-shaping algorithms usually come out at the top of the list of bad guys. Neighbourhoods’ reputational infrastructure plans to do something about that by giving communities and individuals the power to tailor their social media experience to their values.</blockquote>Neighbourhoods MVP (Memeable Viable Product) demo Status module <p>This zome library, <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/status">status</a>, is yet another product of the <a href="https://discord.gg/GsSxDvq9wW">dev.hc community</a>’s weekly Wednesday Workshops. It’s simple but useful, giving your app the power to track and display users’ online status. The algorithm is straightforward: at a regular interval, each agent ‘pings’ the peers they’re interested in tracking the status of. If they get a ‘pong’ back, that means the peer is active. Both the zome and the UI get involved, using only asynchronous <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/9_signals/">signal</a> passing to communicate status.</p><p>This ping-pong pattern also shows up in Lightning Rod Labs’ <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/where">where</a> hApp, which lets users communicate not just their online status but also their presence on a map (whether that’s a traditional geographical map, or a map of current mood, geographical leanings, or pet preferences, etc).</p><p>This is also the first Wednesday Workshop that got recorded and posted publicly. If you’re curious about what these sessions are like, have a watch!</p>DEV.HC Wednesday Workshop – Building the status module Holochain Roadmap is now live! <p>As Holo announced in their <a href="https://press.holo.host/212551-holochain-roadmap-holo-milestones">recent update</a>, Holochain now has a <a href="https://www.holochain.org/roadmap/">public roadmap</a>. I’m thoroughly excited about this, and I sincerely hope it helps you, dear hApp developers, get an idea of where we’re heading — and plan your development trajectory accordingly.</p><p>There are a lot of milestones planned, including ephemeral storage (non-permanent DHT data) and pub/sub (subscribe to DHT change events), but I want to call out one in particular that’s simultaneously the least and most interesting: Stable Validation.</p><p>What does this milestone mean? In short, there will be two HDKs: an Integrity HDK and a Coordination HDK. You’ll still be able to keep developing your hApp as you always have, using the entire HDK. But if you decide to use the split HDKs, here’s what will happen:</p><blockquote>You’ll be able to build a stable, long-lived core for your hApp, based on a stable Integrity HDK that defines the bare minimum of features needed for entry validation. This will help you avoid most of the unpleasant migrations that would normally come with changes to business logic or HDK version bumps. Only this core will affect the DNA hash.</blockquote><p>In order to support the stability and longevity of your hApp’s DHT, the dev team is making a commitment to changing the Integrity HDK as rarely as possible. This also means reducing the number of third-party dependencies in the Integrity HDK; that way, there’ll be fewer bug fixes and security patches to force us to bump the HDK.</p><p>This also frees up the Coordination HDK to change more frequently and give you access to new features, as changes to zomes marked as coordination zomes won’t affect your DNA hash (you'll even be able to <a href="https://asciinema.org/a/I8CFisDTh9UjHPIjSAuMDhbrG">hot-swap</a> them).</p><p>I plan to talk more about this when it's included in a release — just wanted to give you a taste of what’s to come!</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@anniespratt?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Annie Spratt</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/map?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

			  Ben Bishop is a Full Stack Software Engineer at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			<p></p>
 Who are you? 
<p>My name is Ben, I was born in the UK and grew up near Bristol in the south west of England. I have always been fascinated by technology and their inner workings; in short, a nerd. My career started in 2003 as a junior web developer, but I started playing with code as young as 8. I currently live in Sant Cugat Del Valles, north of Barcelona in Spain.</p>
 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>I was invited by a previous developer to the team; tired of working for agencies on simple projects, I leaped at the opportunity and challenge presented by Tokeny. Initially as a contractor, but converted to a full time employee, because I believe in the mission!</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>It is the best job I have had, I am given a lot of freedom to apply my passion, when and where I choose. The team is very friendly and always open to ideas and discussion, and the scope of the Tokeny vision brings challenges I’ve never seen before.</p>
  
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>Ever since I was a child, I’ve broken things apart (to the annoyance of my parents) to understand how they work. This has pushed me to learn about many topics from astrophysics and quantum mechanics, to psychology and philosophy. I also have a drive towards efficiency and accuracy, which lends itself well to my career.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>To transcend my mortal form and explore every time and space in the universe. More seriously, to help where I can to make life better, to be able to support myself and others.</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>To make people more reasonable.</p>
<p>“The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.”<br>

<p>The LEI ecosystem is constantly evolving, with new cases and realised benefits driving increased adoption globally. As part of RapidLEI’s Partner Spotlight series, I caught up with Darragh Hayes, Group CEO at LEI Worldwide, to discuss how LEI Worldwide is responding to these increased opportunities.</p>
<p>LEI Worldwide is a Registration Agent (RA) with coverage of all global jurisdictions. It is a virtually based business with staff located across Ireland, connected through its cloud-based operating model. Read more about LEI Worldwide’s partnership with RapidLEI and Ubisecure in our <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/news-events/rapidlei-lei-worldwide/" title="press release">press release</a> (July 2019).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Q: First up, tell us a little about LEI Worldwide. 
<p>A: LEI Worldwide is an Official LEI Registration Agent, one of the first Registrations Agents approved by GLEIF since the inception of the LEI. We provide expedient, streamlined and client focused LEI management services globally. Our client base includes financial institutions such as banks, asset management and law firms. We have a portfolio of global entertainment providers and a growing client base in the blockchain, Decentralised Finance (DeFI) and crypto project space. These are some of the core sectors that sit alongside other regulated entities which are required to use the LEI as part of their regulatory obligations.</p>
<p>Securing &amp; maintaining LEIs has previously been a disjointed and a risk-fraught process. We in LEI Worldwide try to make it easier and faster to apply for LEI numbers, manage large portfolios, and reduce the risk of non-compliance or failed transactions.</p>
<p>Thousands of organisations around the world trust our solution, enjoy our client-focused service, to quickly and easily register LEIs, often on behalf of their clients. Using LEI Worldwide allows them to meet their regulatory obligations in a timely manner. The LEI is also being used to facilitate faster on-boarding of new clients by streamlining existing KYC and AML processes by leveraging a globally trusted identifier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 LEI adoption is growing exponentially. What do you see as the key drivers behind this growth? 
<p>The rate of LEI adoption has been generally consistent over the last 6 months, with roughly 20,000 new LEIs being issued per month. We have observed adoption since 2018 and it has primarily been driven by regulation, but as the marketplace is now becoming more familiar with the versatility and interoperability of the LEI it is being voluntarily adopted to add an extra layer of standardisation around a traditionally fragmented and challenging piece of the identity puzzle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>“As the marketplace is now becoming more familiar with the versatility and interoperability of the LEI it is being voluntarily adopted.”</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why is this growth occurring now? 
<p>Digital ecosystems and the e-commerce arenas are not new to the world but the recent two years has enflamed the activity of the global population with e-commerce platforms to a new height. Dependency on global supply chain has never been higher. For certain corners of society, income has never experienced such fragility with repetitive lockdowns and business closures. It has distilled focus of every purchaser from retail to institutional to the identity and traceability of the vendor. In addition the rise of cybercrime, scams and phishing has the general public in a frenzy about identity and trust that the vendor they send their money to, does exist and will deliver. E-Commerce and the role of the LEI, Small &amp; Medium Enterprise and the role of the LEI are new waves of adoption that will surpass the financial world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What are some drivers of ‘voluntary’ adoption of the LEI as opposed to regulated? 
<p>The LEI is now being used in developing economies where some companies may find it difficult to access high quality documentation, which is a barrier to securing funding from heavily regulated economies such as the EU or the United States. Many of our clients request LEI Certificates to generate trust around their legal status, and therefore the LEI is going a long way towards enhancing financial inclusion and stimulating the global economy as a whole.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The LEI is going a long way towards enhancing financial inclusion and stimulating the global economy as a whole.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The world has truly become one big digital marketplace, and it is time that businesses settled on a single source of corporate identity verification across all industries; the LEI is exactly that.</p>
<p>Adoption will grow as regulators, private sector companies and governments come to realise new use cases for a globally standardised form of corporate identity, I spoke previously about its “swiss-army knife” like functionality and one possible use case being Central Bank Digital Currencies and blockchain applications. Possibilities for innovation are endless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What’s needed now to push LEI adoption even further, and how is LEI Worldwide preparing to facilitate this growth in adoption? 
<p>The wider benefits of a global identifier such as the LEI are only realised when it is being widely used. Two things are required in order to drive LEI adoption to a point where this can happen.</p>
<p>The first is continuing to promote and educate relevant bodies such as governments and large GIFIs (Globally Important Financial Institutions) on the benefits and savings in resources and time that can be gained by leveraging the LEI fully. We have seen countries like India take this approach, and LEI Worldwide are doing our part to educate and inform. This January I was in Dubai at a meeting with the UAE Ministry of Finance to discuss the LEI and its potential to bolster the already great work they are doing with regards to AML.</p>
<p>The second is to develop the systems capable of handling the large volume of LEI processing requests that would come with an enhanced LEI adoption rate. LEI Worldwide has released its new system for registering and managing LEIs called RAMP 2.0. RAMP (Registration Agent Management Platform), and is a proprietary software tool for managing the entire process of LEIs including maintenance of all corporate data linked to each LEI.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How does RAMP reduce risk associated with LEI management? 
<p>One principle we are trying to engender to the marketplace is the operational risk and its likely compensation impact of failing to renew. Particularly in financial markets, where the mantra is No LEI No Trade, this is critical. We have coined the phrase Renewal Risk for this. Dependency and speed is increasing exponentially, the permeation and impact of Renewal Risk is asymmetric. The asymmetricity between the cost of a renewal and financial trading compensation can be astounding. We see it as a company mission to highlight the avoidance of this unnecessary chasm of impact by the frugal cost of the renewal. We acknowledge it’s not the cost of the renewal is the catalyst to Renewal Risk, it’s the user experience and ease of executing the renewal. RAMP 2.0 manages that for clients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s not the cost of the renewal is the catalyst to Renewal Risk, it’s the user experience and ease of executing the renewal.”</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How does RAMP work to achieve scalability and how is it different from other solutions? 
<p>RAMP has leveraged automation to put our clients on what we call ‘the happy path’ to their LEIs. The system is capable of processing huge volumes of LEI applications, and automates previously clunky manual processes such as generating Letters of Authorisation and LEI Certificates. Most other RA solutions are jurisdictionally based, whereas RAMP offers global LEI coverage.</p>
<p>This means RAMP can also be used by banks, e-commerce platform providers and other financial institutions to import their existing LEIs into a single control account. We have often seen multinational or international firms have their LEIs scattered across providers, offering little visibility into the health of their LEI portfolio.</p>
<p>So, we are well prepared to play our part in facilitating this global move to the LEI as a standardised form of corporate identification and well prepared for the growth in adoption. Our engineering has tethered our processing engines to RapidLEI via API protocols. It is this form of digital partnership that, in a very mutually beneficial way, augments the marketplace for LEIs, where the end beneficiary is always the client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How does RapidLEI technology help LEI Worldwide with its mission for automation and scalability? 
<p>LEI Worldwide spotted early on that RapidLEI was innovating in the space and bringing fresh ideas to the table. This is testament to the fact that RapidLEI have now surpassed traditional Local Operating Units such as Bloomberg and the London Stock Exchange in volume of LEIs ordered.</p>
<p>LEI Worldwide’s RAMP solution is powered by the RapidLEI software and acts as the engine that affords us connectivity to company registries data globally and use that data to provide LE-RD that is of the highest stands in the industry as shown in the GLEIF data quality reports.</p>
<blockquote><p>“LEI Worldwide’s RAMP solution is powered by the RapidLEI software.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Everything we do henceforth is to remove friction in manual processes by streamlining with new approaches, and we view our partnership with RapidLEI as key to achieving the level of scalability required by the LEI ecosystem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Do you have any final thoughts you’d like to share with our readers? 
<p>Yes, we would like to share that LEI Worldwide aligns itself with the mission that the GLEIF has set out and the roadmap it has created to achieve it. We will continue to play our role in supporting the frameworks brought forth such as the vLEI and Validation Agent (VA) system. We have already constructed our first VA solution called VA-Assist and will be making announcements about it in the near future about our first two mandates.&nbsp; In the meantime, please feel free to reach me directly for any questions or queries and I will be happy to assist.</p>

<p>In recent years, increases in fraud and criminal sophistication have led to strengthening regulations. It has never been more important for financial institutions to ensure compliance with this – both to protect themselves and avoid regulatory penalties.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer (KYC) is the process of verifying a customer.</a> This takes place throughout the customer relationship and is vital to <a href="https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/money-laundering/overview.html">help prevent fraud, money laundering and other financial crime</a>. Fortunately, regulation for KYC is in place in most countries, but what’s the best way to get KYC processes in place? For financial institutions, a three-step approach to this is the best practice.</p>



 KYC for financial institutions 



<p>As a quick recap – why do you need KYC as a financial institution? Checking and staying aware of customers’ identity and activity is important in many industries – especially for financial institutions.</p>



<p>Criminal activity in this sector can affect not just the financial institution involved but other individuals, customers and the wider economy. Financial institutions are therefore tightly regulated, with strict KYC and AML requirements they must adhere to. There are <a href="https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/01/us-and-uk-regulators-take-lead-on-aml-fines-for-2019/">stiff penalties</a> and likely <a href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2019/01/23/515533.htm">reputational damage</a> if they do not.</p>



<p>Regulations are in place in many countries to enforce and regulate KYC processes. These were first introduced by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in the 1990s, and the most recent implementations began in the US with the Patriot Act in 2001. In total, over 190 countries follow FATF guidance for KYC.</p>



 







 The 3 steps to implement KYC and set up a KYC process 



<p>While the exact implementation process is left to the financial institution, a three-step process for KYC is standard and specified in many countries’ regulations. This is often referred to as the three components or pillars of KYC, and involves:</p>



  Customer Identification Program (CIP)  Customer Due Diligence (CDD)  Ongoing Monitoring  



 Customer Identification Program (CIP) 



<p>The first step in KYC processes is to establish that the customer is who they claim to be. This requires any customer – both individual and corporate – to have their identity verified.</p>



<p>For all individuals involved (including the identified beneficial owners for corporate customers), identity details must be obtained and verified. There is a scope for financial institutions to use the documents most appropriate for their customers and that they can be verified. This will usually include:</p>



  Name  Address  Date of birth  Government-issued identity number  Other government-issued identities (such as passport or driving license)  



<p>For corporate customers, verification documents also include a business license, articles of incorporation, partnership agreements or financial statements. Financial institutions also need to establish the company’s ownership structure and identify the Ultimate Beneficial Owners (UBOs).</p>



<p>Proper collection and use of this data is also part of CIP requirements. Institutions should be able to verify it – and do so in a timely manner. Procedures for doing so should be well documented and followed by all staff involved.</p>



 Customer Due Diligence (CDD) 



<p>Customer Due Diligence (CDD) takes verification further and asks whether financial institutions trust the customer. CDD is about establishing a customer’s risk level and to what extent they can be trusted.</p>



<p>There are three levels of CDD. Basic due diligence is carried out for all customers to establish their level of risk. This can involve collecting additional information, establishing the location of the customer, and types or patterns of transactions. For corporate customers, due diligence needs to be carried out for all individuals that are identified as UBOs.</p>



<p>Simplified Due Diligence (SDD). For customers and accounts deemed to be at very low risk, SDD can be used. With this, the full checks of CDD are not needed.</p>



<p>Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD). On the other hand, much more analysis is done under the EDD approach for a customer thought to be at higher risk. This could include obtaining more information from customers, additional checks with agencies or public sources, and further investigation into accounts and transactions.</p>



<p>Regulators specify the need to carry out EDD, but will not detail the exact steps to be taken. Thus, it is up to individual financial institutions to establish the level of risk as appropriate.</p>



<p>CDD is an ongoing process, not just carried out when onboarding a new customer. A customer’s activity and risk profile can change over time, and periodic CDD monitoring should be conducted. Full CDD and EDD records need to be kept for internal or regulatory audit purposes.</p>



 Ongoing Monitoring 



<p>KYC is not just about checking new customers during onboarding. This is important, of course, and will establish the identity and initial risk level of the customer. Beyond this, financial institutions must have a program in place for ongoing KYC checks and monitoring.</p>



<p>Ongoing monitoring should pick up changes in the customer or activity that warrant a shift in risk profile or further investigation. The level and frequency of monitoring will depend on the customer’s perceived risk and the institution’s strategy.</p>



<p>Monitoring should look at factors including:</p>



  Customer transaction types, frequency and amounts  Changes in customer or transaction locations  Inclusion on <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/politically-exposed-person-pep/">Politically Exposed Persons (PEP)</a> or sanction lists  Adverse media coverage  



<p>As with CIP and CDD, financial institutions should have well-established processes in place to handle ongoing monitoring. This should include the raising of concerns relating to suspicious activity as appropriate.</p>



 







 Connect with a KYC service provider 



<p>The KYC regulations, and the standard three-step approach, provide a good grounding for KYC. There are many more detailed requirements and technical steps needed for full implementation, however. A KYC service provider can help establish best practices and technology for this. They will also ensure that you stay up to date with changing regulations and meet the latest regulations in different countries.</p>



<p>As a global leader in the identity verification industry, IDnow has developed <a href="https://www.idnow.io/aml-screening-monitoring/">solutions for KYC and AML</a>. These offer a full range of features and meet the regulations in a growing list of countries.</p>



<p>Specifically, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent</a> offers fully compliant automated onboarding using video, biometrics and identity verification. Regulations differ between countries regarding whether verification should have manual involvement or be fully automated. However, AutoIdent allows both and is fully compliant in several jurisdictions, including the UK, Europe, and the UAE.</p>



<p>KYC and AML are not just about meeting requirements, though. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/customer-onboarding-banking-balance-security-ux/">Financial institutions want to ensure that solutions provide a reliable and positive user experience.</a> Customers want to see that banks take security seriously and carry out appropriate checks, but they do not want to be held back or inconvenienced by this.</p>



<p>Onboarding and KYC provide the first experience with a financial institution and its brand – which should leave a good impression. Thankfully, IDnow solutions are designed with this in mind.</p>

<p>ShareLedger, the underlying blockchain to the ecosystem of ShareRing, will be undergoing a hard fork on 28 March 2022. This ‘update’ will take ShareLedger to Cosmos SDK v0.44.0 and Tendermint v0.34.14, which will further enhance, and release a series of new features to the blockchain. This provides ShareRing with stronger foundations in anticipation of new products to be developed in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, what new features does this hard fork offer?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Intercommunication protocols and modules</p>



<p>An introduction of new protocol buffers will bring about significant improvements to our blockchain state and wire communication within the Cosmos SDK. Additionally, we have implemented the Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol as a module, which facilitates transport across sovereign blockchains, meaning that ShareLedger is able to communicate with other heterogeneous blockchains.</p>



<p>Validator nodes – Single application binary</p>



<p>Validators and nodes now only need to download a single application binary to operate, whereas previously, separate binaries were required. This improves the overall efficiency of the process required to run a masternode.</p>



<p>Simplified fee management for SDK users</p>



<p>We’ve introduced two new modules that simplify the overall fee management process and grant more control to those who use our SDK. Let’s look at the example of ‘document issuance.’ With this new module, the issuer can pay for gas fees using a pool of funds within predefined limits. Furthermore, issuers are able to grant arbitrary privileges between their own accounts, so that grantee accounts can execute certain actions. For example, messages on behalf of the granter.</p>



<p>Chain upgrade process efficiency</p>



<p>Chain upgrades were historically done with the Cosmos SDK by creating an upgrade proposal, halting the chain at the given height, exporting state to a JSON file, making the necessary JSON file changes, and creating a new chain with the modified JSON file as genesis. This procedure is tedious and could take up to several hours. Not to mention that ALL validator nodes must be completely stopped for it to work.</p>



<p>This hard fork introduces a new way of handling upgrades. When an upgrade happens, instead of starting a new chain, the new binary will read the existing database and perform in-place modifications of the store. We expect this method to reduce the migration time significantly.</p>



<p>Removing the risks of ‘denial of service’ and ‘false witnesses’ with block proposals</p>



<p>The upgrade to Tendermint v0.33.6 essentially mitigates the risk of having block proposers sign for wrong blocks, which results in the invalidation of proposed blocks and, as such, a halt to the network (denial of service.) With this hard fork, a ⅔ majority of signatures must be verified for the block prior to committing it to the chain.</p>



<p>In relation to false witnesses, this hard fork removes the risk of proposed blocks not containing 100% verified signatures. Prior versions would have accepted proposed blocks that contained two-thirds majority verified signatures, which resulted in an increased risk of proposers including arbitrary data for the remainder third of signatures.</p>



<p>Denomination system</p>



<p>By nature, blockchains don’t deal with fractions. The minimum amount we can spend for transfers or transaction fees is 1 SHR. As a result, we have faced several issues related to decimalization. For example, staking/reward calculations are calculated by various formulas, and as a result, the user’s reward would sometimes be less than 1 SHR (the numbers are rounded down). With this upgrade, we introduce two new denoms as alternatives:</p>



  nSHR: Nano SHR. Our base and native coin for now. 1 SHR = 10^9 nSHR. It solves pretty much all of our issues. The rounding still happens but at a very, very small scale so that it can be ignorable.  



  CENT: Same story. 1 SHRP = 1 USD = 100 CENT. Prior to this point, we have to keep two different denoms (SHRP and CENT) in our chain, which can be troublesome. Now with only CENT, we reduce some conversion-heavy liftings, thereby increasing performance.  



<p>With the introduction of the two new denoms users are now able to transact in fractions, for example 9.5 SHR.</p>



<p>Governance module</p>



<p>The concept was introduced back in 2016 in Cosmos SDK whitepaper. It is now implemented, and we’ve decided to plug it into ShareLedger. This module allows for the future development of governance features, for example:</p>



  Proposing some changes to the parameters or features  Voting  ShareLedger upgradability  Until now, whenever we wanted to upgrade ShareLedger, we needed to completely stop the chain by communicating with all stakeholders (validators) and requesting them to stop their nodes. With this module, this is no longer the case.    



<p>Block Explorer</p>



<p>In conjunction with the hard fork, we also wanted to take the chance to upgrade our Block Explorer. This new explorer is still built on top of BigDipper, one of the most known open-source block explorers, but using version two.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new version is a complete rewrite with many improvements in terms of both UI and performance. The block parser is now written in Go, which can directly use types and interfaces from our Shareledger, making it seamlessly compatible with all structs we implement. This also means it would be very easy for us to scrape more data and include more UI pages for our own modules.</p>







<p>What key existing feature improvements are being made?</p>



<p>We’ve made quite a few improvements. Below is a list of all the updates to existing features:</p>



  ADR-028 addresses: a new specification for deriving addresses for all kinds of addressable accounts to cover a security risk, due to address space collisions.  Better support for multisig transactions.  Transaction fees are now saved on-chain and configurable. We can adjust the transaction fee whenever necessary without updating the binary.  Better modularization on some of our modules. Gentlemint module will now only take care of token-related tasks like load tokens, burn tokens or fee handling, etc. electoral module takes care of authorization.  Transaction fee will be automatically calculated based on the on-chain values (if not supplied.) Clients can submit higher fees if they want to.  Automatically load SHR by SHRP when there is insufficient balance for transaction fees.  Backports improvements to state synchronization and ABCI performance under concurrent load, and the PostgreSQL event indexer.  Allow state sync fetchers and request timeout to be configurable.  Retry requests for snapshots and add a minimum discovery time (five seconds) for new snapshots.  



<p>What key bug fixes are being made?</p>



  Sometimes a user’s input fee is unexpectedly overridden by the application default fee. This is now corrected.  Transfer tokens accidentally minted the same amount of tokens to the module’s balance (each module has its own address), causing inconsistent total supply values.  When the balance is equal to the transaction fee, the transaction is rejected. We now allow spending of ALL available balance, making it zero.  There is a substantial bug in evidence handling where evidence could sometimes be broadcast before the block containing that evidence was fully committed, resulting in some nodes panicking when trying to verify said evidence.  Sometimes peers (nodes) try to send messages on incorrect channels, causing errors that could terminate the process.  A bug with incorrectly handling contexts that would occasionally freeze state sync.  A memory leak in the evidence reactor.

  <p>Here in part three of our decentralized identity series, I’ll describe the key parts of a decentralized identity architecture without diving too far into the technical details. It takes a village for this kind of ecosystem to work – as you’re about to see – and the concepts discussed here are industry standards that anyone can research and implement. If I succeed, you’ll be able to explain the design pattern behind this architecture and have enough information to look up the underlying specifications, if you choose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quick background: We started this series with the 5 guiding principles for decentralized identities. Then, we looked at why we think that the Direct Presentation model gives us advantages in moving towards our goals. Now comes the FUN part – we get to dig into the technical mechanisms that we think could underlie decentralized trust for individuals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part I: <a href="http://aka.ms/identityprinciples">The Five Guiding Principles</a><br>Part II: <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/identity-standards-blog/decentralized-identity-the-direct-presentation-model/ba-p/3071981">The Direct Presentation model</a> <br>Part III: The Basics of Decentralized Identity &lt;-- You are here<br>Part IV: Deep Dive: Verifiable Credentials<br>Part V: Deep Dive: Anchored Decentralized Identifiers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 A story of three documents 
<p>At the most basic level, decentralized identity is the story of three standardized documents: a proclamation, a letter of introduction, and an endorsement. That’s it! The rest is just tying up loose ends. Because I hate to leave you all in suspense, I’ll give you the technical names for each of these documents up front - but don’t panic! We’ll define them in context right away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A DID document is a proclamation that helps strangers verify communications are authentic.</p>
<p>A verifiable credential is a letter of introduction by an issuer containing authoritative statements about a subject.</p>
<p>A verifiable presentation is an endorsement of a subject at the time a verifiable credential is passed to a verifier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can think of this architecture as a feudal letter passing scheme, with just as much intrigue but a lot more math involved. We open our feudal saga in a mythical land, long ago…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Chapter 1: The proclamation 
<p>Rose Abbey is known throughout the land for its beautiful gardens. The main building is something of a famous landmark: everyone knows where to find it, and those who do can find a proclamation nailed to the door with a wax seal attached that only this abbey can produce:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>A paper with a wax seal in the shape of a flower that says: “Hear ye hear ye: All messages from Rose Abbey will be sealed with wax mixed with rose petals that can only be found in the Abbey. It looks like this”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two interesting properties of this proclamation document.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First is the provenance of the proclamation. It’s clearly a proclamation from Rose Abbey because it’s nailed right to the door, for all to see. Anyone can find Rose Abbey on a map, walk to the door, and read the document to learn about the wax that verifies a message is from the Abbey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second is the verification method within the document. The proclamation provides the recipe that explains how anyone can compare the exact composition of wax affixed to a given message to the one on this proclamation, and verify the message was created using wax from the roses unique to the Abbey. Let’s go one step further and say that any attempt to melt and re-form the wax changes the color so that only the Rose Abbey artisans are able to achieve a unique seal from specific raw ingredients. What will Rose Abbey do with this magic superpower?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rose Abbey needs shoes for their monks. Cobbler Jan is the best around, working from her pushcart which she wheels around the village. Luckily, Jan has a proclamation too - but Cobbler Jan isn’t as rich or established as Rose Abbey. Jan doesn’t have a fixed, well-known storefront. Instead of hanging on a fancy door, Cobbler Jan’s proclamation is posted among other merchants’ proclamations on a board in the town squares:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>A paper with a wax seal in the shape of a boot that says: “Hear ye hear ye: All messages from Cobbler Jan will be sealed with a handmade one-of-a-kind wax seal made in the cobbler’s shop. It looks like this”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With these proclamations, Rose Abbey and Cobbler Jan can start corresponding with a guarantee of message integrity, each signing messages with the resource only they control, and verifying the other’s message using the public proclamation document. As long as Cobbler Jan can reliably find Rose Abbey’s proclamation and Rose Abbey can reliably find Cobbler Jan’s proclamation, they should be able to evaluate the unique signature represented by each other’s wax and know they’re the true originators of the message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A DID document is the digital equivalent of a proclamation nailed to the door of Rose Abbey. DID documents contain statements about how to securely interact with an entity. Message recipients who want to validate a message need to know two things: 1) how the DID document can be located and 2) what exact proclamation to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the case of Rose Abbey, this is easy; they use the time-tested “front-door” method to locate their proclamation, which involves opening a map, looking for a building called Rose Abbeythen proceeding to the front door of the largest building at that address. If you get to an address, look at the front door, and the proclamation doesn’t say “Rose Abbey,” you know you’re in the wrong place or don’t have the right proclamation. In the real world, you would encode both pieces of information into a &nbsp;DID. The amazing thing about the DID is that that it’s self-contained, holding both the “how” and the “what.” For example, the DID for Rose Abbey could be did:front-door:RoseAbbey. Anyone who sees a message from did:front-door:RoseAbbey knows to get a map, find Rose Abbey, and to read the proclamation containing the identifier did:front-door:RoseAbbey on the largest building.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Cobbler Jan’s case, you would visit the commons to find their proclamation among those posted. Cobbler Jan has fewer resources than Rose Abbey but still has a DID. A message signed using the “town-square” method such as did:town-square:CobblerJan is just as valid, but the instructions are different. Instead of opening a map and looking for a direct address for Cobbler Jan, the town square method instructions say to find on the map, and search for the proclamation posted at the commons with a matching identifier. Note that no matter what method the DID uses, the DID document produced has the same standardized contents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2: Verifiable credentials: The letter of introduction 
<p>Now that Rose Abbey and Cobbler Jan know they can correspond securely, they negotiate for the contract to make shoes, and Jan is awarded the job. Rose Abbey creates a new credential document that Cobbler Jan can use to purchase supplies. This is a document standardized throughout the land – here's a before and after of Rose Abbey filling out the document:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>A form-based letter of introduction with blanks where four values can be filled in. The letter says “To whom it may concern, blank (the issuer) says blank (the subject) is blank (claims). Signed, blank (a signature).”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The same form-based letter of introduction filled in to say “To whom it may concern, did:front-door: RoseAbbey says did:town-square: CobblerJan is an authorized buyer of leather. Signed, wax seal in the shape of a flower.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cobbler Jan is now in possession of an authoritative statement that can be used to buy leather for the Rose Abbey boot order! But notice this letter doesn’t say “the bearer of this document is an authorized buyer.” It states that Cobbler Jan is an authorized buyer. Because of this, leather merchants won’t release leather to anyone who presents this credential, only to someone who can prove they’re the person explicitly named. Cobbler Jan can’t sell the letter or give it away because they would have to give up the secret recipe to their handmade wax.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The modern equivalent to this letter of introduction is a verifiable credential, or VC. In this case, Rose Abbey has wrapped an entitlement to buy leather into a container that is coded to their DID and signed cryptographically. Anyone who wants to confirm the VC really came from Rose Abbey can use the embedded issuer DID in the VC to find a public cryptographic key in the associated DID document and do the math to confirm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Time to go buy some leather!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 3: Verifiable presentation: The endorsement 
<p>This brings us to the morning that Cobbler Jan arrives at the leather shop. They must do two things:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Produce the letter of introduction signed by Rose Abbey that shows entitlement to buy on behalf of the Abbey. 
 Prove in the moment that the entitled party mentioned by Rose Abbey is the same party that is present in the shop. 
 
<p>Cobbler Jan accomplishes these two steps by opening the document from Rose Abbey and stamping an endorsement onto the credential, attaching the cobbler’s own unique wax seal only they can produce to prove they’re the same Cobbler Jan that the Rose Abbey credential refers to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The previously shown letter of introduction with an additional note sealed by a wax seal in the shape of a boot that says “Endorsed by Cobbler Jan on April 22”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the most important part! The leather merchant could be looking at fraudulent documents that look convincing. Only by verifying the wax on both seals against the wax in the proclamations of each party can the merchant be sure they’re not giving away leather to the wrong party. If, for example, Cobbler Fred (a competitor) creates a fake letter of Introduction claiming to be from Rose Abbey using his own identifier and authoritative seal, when the leather merchant looks up the seal that is authoritative for Rose Abbey they’ll see that it doesn’t quite match the seal on the endorsement that Cobbler Fred handed over. One difference between our feudal world and modern times is that Cobbler Fred might be smart and talented enough with an inkpot and quill to steal the original letter, and alter it convincingly while keeping the seal intact. Luckily, modern digital doesn’t rely on human perception, so this risk is mitigated today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This endorsement of Rose Abbey’s letter of introduction could happen many times. Cobbler Jan could visit various leather merchants and prove each time that the entity referred to in the letter of introduction is in fact the person there in the moment. As long as everyone protects their secret wax formulas, and everyone faithfully validates the documents there’s reasonable protection against counterfeit letters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The modern equivalent of this endorsement process is a verifiable presentation, or VP. A VP can be considered a “proof of possession.” Here’s how it works in some truly medieval pseudocode:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If:</p>
<p>a VP and VC are presented together</p>
<p>and the issuer of the VP and the subject of the VC are both Cobbler Jan</p>
<p>and the VP signature can be validated with Cobbler Jan’s DID document verification method</p>
<p>and the VC signature can be validated with Rose Abbey’s DID document verification method</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>it can be assumed that the VC was issued to the entity that issued the VP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The big picture 
<p>And that, my friends, is the basic model behind DID. We have fancier terms and we can use modern cryptography instead of wax seals with unique ingredients, but the fundamentals are the same. All parties involved must safely manage the ingredients needed to produce a signature that can’t be replicated, and must all proclaim a signature verification method using a mechanism that’s well-known. When credentials successfully validate, they guarantee message integrity, and that guarantee allows secure conversation to begin, a key layer for trusted commerce. Credentials can be issued to a subject, then presented and endorsed by that subject, enabling the exchange of goods and services as a result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But where is the decentralization?</p>
<p>If you’ve made it this far, you may have noticed we aren’t talking a lot about decentralized concepts. You might also be itching to point out that this story is just a tale of a secure messaging scheme based on asymmetric cryptography, and that signed messages have been around for almost as long as Rose Abbey. You’re absolutely right. There's nothing about the model or standards we’ve defined that forces decentralization or excludes centralization. The DID and VC specifications are intentionally agnostic to the properties of the specific trust anchors that might be implemented, which is a big part of the reason we think they can be successful. The difference between any old, secure messaging scheme based on asymmetric cryptography and this messaging scheme based on asymmetric cryptography, is the layer of abstraction that allows old and new, decentralized and centralized - and anything we come up with in the future - to work alongside each other. We’ll talk more about this in the next installation of this series.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To quickly recap: DID documents are the posted proclamations that enable VCs. VCs are the “fill in the blank” authoritative statements of attribution of entitlement that are issued against a subject identifier. are endorsements at the time of presentation that prove that the entity showing the credential is, in fact, the named party. The system looks something like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>A diagram showing rose abbey on the left with a title of “Issuer”, Cobbler Jan in the middle with the title of “Holder” and a leather shop on the right with the title of “Verifier”. &nbsp;Below each entity is a DID document and there are arrows that show 1) a verifiable credential passing from Rose Abbey to Cobbler Jan, 2) Cobbler Jan verifying the Did document of Rose Abbey, 3) a verifiable presentation passing from Cobbler Jan to the leather shop, 4) the leather shop verifying Cobbler Jan’s DID document and 5) The leather shop verifying Rose Abbey’s DID document.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few important things to note here: Everyone has a DID document (even the leather shop didn’t cover in-depth) and the content is standardized. But the method by which the document is fetched can differ. DID documents could be world-readable and searchable like Rose Abbey, but others could be shared privately at the time of first interaction, or even ephemerally created once and then discarded. Every entity can make its own choices about which method works best in each context. We can also support emerging options for DID document storage without requiring a rewrite of the entire architecture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, there’s a lot more to end-to-end architecture than just the documents that fly around. How are the documents delivered? How are the exact contents and types of letters negotiated to match the context? Can you selectively disclose part of the letter without revealing all the details? How does everyone know the rules in any given village? And, how do people know who to trust and for what?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The answers are… stay tuned! Feudal metaphors were not built in a day. I’ll be back in the next installment to discuss fascinating topics, like whether Rose Abbey uses couriers on horseback to deliver their documents, or how Cobbler Jan can choose between African or European carrier pigeons to send different portions of the letter of introduction, depending on whether or not a given monk wants to be sure their shoes are made only from vegan leather. If you can’t wait that long, you can cheat a little and – it’s a long list but that’s the fun of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about these topics and the technologies that fill out all the steps in the process, you’re in luck! Our next installment in this series is a DEEP DIVE! We’ll take our feudal tale and outline the industry stack we’ve implemented at Microsoft, including W3C Decentralized Identifiers, the OpenID Foundation OIDC4SSI Transport family, and the W3C VC Data Model 1.1. If you’re still here after this fantastical feudal adventure, I salute you and thank you for joining me on our quest.</p>

  <p>Take a look in your physical wallet.&nbsp;Maybe you have some credit cards and probably identification of some kind.&nbsp;Do you have a roadside assistance card, perchance? The cards we carry and present every single day feel different than many common digital credentials (such as federated credentials) that identify us and communicate our attributes online, but that gap is narrowing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the identity ecosystem looks at emerging paradigms for trust and individual agency in our online interactions, we see use cases where the federated identity model we know so well in the real world might work to provide more digital autonomy and control.&nbsp;We call this model the “presentation model” because an end user collects and controls the presentation of their credential when and where they choose.&nbsp;The presentation model does not replace online federated models, but instead, each model can be used where most valuable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part one of our series introduced our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/10/06/microsofts-5-guiding-principles-for-decentralized-identities/">5 guiding principles for decentralized identities.</a>&nbsp;In this and subsequential blogs, we will continue to dive deeper into the technical basics of decentralized identity. Read on for part two of this five-part series on decentralized identity.</p>

<p>Part IV: Deep Dive: Verifiable Credentials</p>
<p>Part V:&nbsp; Deep Dive: Anchored Decentralized Identifiers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we use identity-related credentials in the real world, they often have different properties than digital credentials. There are two separate ceremonies in most cases: issuance and presentation.&nbsp; If you have spent any time at a department of motor vehicles or a passport office, you’ve seen what an issuance ceremony can be – it is usually an intensive process, but the tradeoff is that once you have a credential like a driver’s license or passport, you can use that credential for multiple purposes, at multiple places, over a long period of time. You, the “holder” of the credential, can choose to present your credential as a (mostly) voluntary exchange, in which the verifier of your credential can grant you access to some kind of resource - for example, they might allow you into a nightclub, or allow you to check out a library book.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s use a concrete real-world scenario: roadside assistance. Many of us are members of automotive clubs which advertise national and international coverage in the case of vehicle mishaps. After a sign-up song and dance and giving them my annual fee, they issue me a card I stuff into my wallet and forget about. Until one fateful night when my car breaks down in a location I am unfamiliar with. In this case, a miraculous thing happens – I can pull my auto club card from my wallet, and present that card to a garage that has never heard of me before, and a tow truck will arrive to help me. This issue-then-present credentialling model that has long powered the physical world is ready for adoption in the digital world too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The technical name for the model at work here is called the Direct Presentation model. A credential is issued, and then held for a long period of time with intermittent voluntary presentations to many different verifiers. To put that back into our example, my auto club issues me a card, which I hold in my wallet for years (maybe decades!), and I might choose to show that card to a garage when I need a tow, or possibly to a store to get a discount.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now let’s switch gears (see what I did there?) to look at the digital world as you use it today. Rather than giving me a card I can store in my wallet, websites (and other services) create a user account. My resource access is tied to this account, and I must prove I own the account by authenticating to the website. After I have authenticated, there is a limited amount of time where the website “knows” who I am and can vouch on my behalf to applications and to other domains, introducing me to resources while sharing data about me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This process of an authoritative Identity Provider who redirects me to resources and introduces me as a valid account within their domain with certain attributes and entitlements is called the Federated Presentation model. Going back to my night on the highway, instead of presenting my road service card to the garage, I’d have to borrow their point of sale (POS) terminal to authenticate to the auto club website, then be redirected to the garage website - with my card information included in the redirect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both of these models got me my tow truck. They both have important qualities, and there are a number of use cases where either could do the job. But each has a few use cases where they can really shine. In the case of federated presentation, enterprise scenarios such as single sign-on (SSO) provide a compelling combination of convenience and security. Likewise, the digital version of the direct presentation model has great applications - where users benefit from increased agency in their dealings with businesses, governments, and even each other. We’ll cover the key qualities of the direct presentation model in the rest of this blog, and then in our next blog, we can talk through what high level architectural requirements we foresee. Remember, my car has broken down, I’m in a remote and unfamiliar place, and I need to leverage the roadside assistance that I have purchased in advance to get service from a garage that I have never previously done business with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Common qualities of the Direct Presentation model (Real-world and digital) 
<p>My choice of when and what gets presented</p>
<p>As I sit in my broken-down car, I have options. I might have roadside assistance coverage from multiple providers. I might even have a coupon for a free tow I picked up from the roadside diner or prefer to use a credit card. If I do, I can debate which offers the best deal, and present what works for me. This sounds like a simple thing, but it is tougher to do in the federated model because I can’t look through my wallet to remember which clubs I’m a member of or what coupons I’ve squirreled away. Instead, the garage would have to try to help me remember which auto clubs I might be affiliated with by showing me logos until I see one I recognize.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything goes through me</p>
<p>When I interact with the garage, I’m the person presenting my credential and I’m the person getting a receipt back. No real-time interaction is needed with the auto club, which is lucky because it’s the middle of the night. But I am aware of the interactions in real time, and if I want to, I can compare my receipts from all the breakdowns my car has had, see trends in what kinds of transactions I’ve been a part of, and even find places where I’ve been overcharged or where the promises of the transaction haven’t materialized. This is because I was an agent in the direct presentation. In a federated model, the logs of what data was passed about me are likely available but I would have to collect those logs from many different places – if they’re made available to me - to see the full picture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Present it anywhere</p>
<p>Imagine the case where every garage had to have a separate contract with every regional auto club whose members might want to use their services. The overhead of such a system would be high. Instead, the garages and regional clubs all agree to abide by a common association’s trust framework that establishes the rules and practices that everyone must follow. In the direct presentation model, standards help establish the rules which allow easy establishment of associations, and there’s a potential for direct presentation to make it easier to set up common trust frameworks. This is what allows me to present my membership card from Alberta on a dark highway in North Dakota – where both I and the driver can be confident in the transaction. If everyone uses a common presentation model, it opens the doors to make it easier for trust frameworks to be formed and governed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Unique properties of the Digital Direct Presentation model 
<p>There are few things that couldn’t work for me as I sit in my broken-down car with a physical auto club card, but that could work if I were using a digital credential.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Selective disclosure</p>
<p>When I hand my auto club card to the tow truck operator on the dark highway, I cannot prevent that person from reading everything printed on that card. If the card were to show my home address, the truck driver would know where I lived. But with a digital credential, I can choose what to release (and what not to) during presentation – in this example, I can simply release the fact that I qualify for a tow, and nothing else. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My wallet has a brain</p>
<p>Another unique quality of a digital direct presentation is that because software can help, my wallet has a brain and can be a trusted advisor. As I sit in my car, shivering, I might make a bad choice about which garage to call. A digital wallet might cross-reference my choice in garages with the Better Business Bureau and suggest I choose a business with a rating higher than one star, saving me from a bad experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 But what IS the digital version of Direct Presentation? 
<p>There are several important initiatives already underway that qualify as direct presentation – including mobile Driver’s License projects based on the ISO 18013 specification, as well as various ePassport initiatives. Vaccine passports are another case where the direct presentation model is emerging, with initiatives such as <a href="https://vci.org/">VCI</a> and <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass (GHP)</a> gaining traction.&nbsp; In the identity world, we at Microsoft see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> specification as a Data format with long-term potential to let the industry move towards multi-purpose direct presentation. We hope to see some of the models converge over time as they mature, and we’ll deep dive on each of these options over time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Federated Presentation and Direct Presentation are complimentary 
<p>You might be wondering: do we see the direct presentation model replacing federated models? No. We believe that federated and direct presentation models will co-exist, and that each model lends itself to solving different problems. Federated presentation is a modern workhorse when it comes to use cases like enterprise single sign-on, and there will continue to be many places where involving the user in a presentation ceremony will never make sense. The good news is that we have specifications that can help federated and direct models to co-exist, and we are working in the <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID Foundation</a>, the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>, and other standards bodies to find an interoperable balance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want a sneak peek, check out Kristina Yasuda and Torsten Lodderstedt at the recent OAuth Security Workshop, talking about some of their work that leverages the&nbsp;Self-Issued Identity Provider section of the OpenID Connect specification. This work truly bridges the worlds of Direct and Federated Presentation models.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 But wait, what does this have to do with Decentralization? 
<p>If you’ve noticed that we’re not talking a lot about decentralized tech here, don’t be shocked. Microsoft sees unique and differentiated value in how decentralized technology can fulfill many of the criteria listed above, and we’re excited to dig deeper into what decentralized technology can deliver in later posts! But our goals center on both human and business outcomes. As such, we can and will use decentralized technology where it’s needed and useful, and we’ll do our best to discuss with the community the trade-offs and advantages in the process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What’s next? 
<p>Now that we have a foundational understanding of the Direct Presentation model and its place in the digital world, our next installment will discuss how we build a reference architecture that could deliver on our principles using the Direct Presentation model. We’ll start with a high-level architecture and slowly drill into the various parts of that architecture, describing the standards at play and how we can see those standards pushing us closer to the 5 guiding principles. There are quite a lot of standards – we’ve constructed a <a href="http://linktr.ee/decentralizedidentity">handy linktree</a> to let you easily index into the various specifications we are participating in and/or implementing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is going to be fun!</p>

<p>Watch Dock’s first webinar as Nick Lambert and Grant Thomas discuss in detail:</p>  Credenxia’s need to move towards a decentralized solution  Why they chose to collaborate with Dock  The ease of integrating Dock’s technology into their workflows  Dock’s latest releases and future roadmap  <p>Back in October of 2021, <a href="https://blog.dock.io/credenxia-leaps-into-the-future-with-docks-api/">Credenxia worked with Dock</a> to move towards a decentralized solution for creating and managing employee credentials. This move towards a decentralized solution was needed to keep Credenxia competitive and relevant to workplace needs. &nbsp;</p><p>After some time of Credenxia integrating with Dock’s technology, we decided to host a webinar to provide details of this collaboration and give real-world insight into the benefits of decentralization. </p><p>Nick Lambert, CEO at Dock was joined by guest speaker Grant Thomas, COO at Credenxia in February 2022 to discuss how the collaboration formed, how Dock’s technology has future-proofed Credenxia’s organization, and more. </p><p>Previously, Credenxia provided a centralized solution with verification through their cloud-based portal. Thanks to Dock’s technology, Credenxia now offers a decentralized solution that gives the control over data and identity back to the user and allows for instant verification of credentials. </p><p>Nick Lambert opens the webinar by explaining the basic concepts of Verifiable Credentials (VC) and Decentralized Identity (DID). Decentralized Identifiers are globally unique identifiers that allow the owner to prove cryptographic control over them. Anything from a person, organization, to data models or abstract entities, can have DIDs. Verifiable Credentials are an open standard for digital credentials, they are tamper-proof credentials that can be cryptographically verified. They represent things found in physical forms such as a driving license or passport, and things that have no physical form such as ownership of a bank account. VCs incorporate digital signatures that make them tamper-resistant and more trustworthy than their physical counterparts. </p><p>He goes on to explain why individuals and organizations should care and want to benefit from the use of VCs and DIDs, from users being able to take back control over one's identity and data, to it being instantly verifiable. </p><p>Over to Credenxia</p><p>Grant Thomas follows on by giving the viewers a detailed brief on what Credenxia does, how the verification is done, and how organizations benefit from their services. Credenxia works with organizations in mining, oil and gas, public transportation, and construction to name a few, acting as a third-party verifier. &nbsp;</p><p>Credentials are checked for each worker depending on the environment they are working within. Everything from an individual's degree, trade certificates, and licenses are checked and verified by Credenxia, on behalf of the organization the individual is working for. Dock’s technology allowing for the creation and issuance of tamper-proof verifiable credentials has streamlined this process where the credentials can be instantly and cryptographically verified. </p><p>Nick Lambert and Grant Thomas go on to explain the process of Credenxia integrating Dock’s technology and the tremendous benefits of Dock’s blockchain and Dock Certs API. Grant goes into detail on the challenges Credenxia faced from the downsides of running on a trust model to the manual verification required. Dock’s Certs API allows Credenxia to mitigate these challenges. Dock’s W3C compliance and wealth of knowledge facilitating interoperability with other open source technologies gave Credenxia trust in the technology. </p><p>Drawing to the end of the webinar, Nick Lambert highlights Dock Certs, our no-code solution for creating, issuing, and verifying credentials. He outlines Dock’s future roadmap and what our community can expect to see in the next month before closing off.

 What is Thymeleaf? 

<p></p>

<p>Thymeleaf is an open-source server-side Java template engine for standalone and web applications, that was created by Daniel Fernández. The templates look like HTML and can be integrated with Spring MVC and Spring Security among other popular development frameworks. Although documentation about integration with Spring WebFlux is hard to find, it is currently supported and the Thymeleaf starter dependency performs the <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web-reactive.html#webflux-view-thymeleaf">auto-configuration</a> of the template engine, template resolver and reactive view resolver.</p>

<p>Among its features, Thymeleaf allows you to:</p>

 
   Work with fragments: only a part of a template will be rendered. This can be useful for updating part of a page from responses in AJAX calls. It also provides a componentization tool, as the fragments can be included in multiple templates. 
   Handle forms with model objects containing their fields 
   Render variables and externalized text messages through its <a href="https://www.thymeleaf.org/doc/tutorials/3.0/usingthymeleaf.html#standard-expression-syntax">Standard Expression Syntax</a> 
   Perform iterations and conditional evaluations 
 

 Create a Spring WebFlux application with Thymeleaf 

<p>Create a simple monolithic Spring Boot reactive application, that will use Thymeleaf for page templates.
You can use <a href="https://start.spring.io/">Spring Initializr</a>, from its web UI, or download the starter app with the following HTTPie command:</p>

   <code>https -d start.spring.io/starter.zip bootVersion==2.6.4 \
  baseDir==thymeleaf-security \
  groupId==com.okta.developer.thymeleaf-security \
  artifactId==thymeleaf-security \
  name==thymeleaf-security \
  packageName==com.okta.developer.demo \
  javaVersion==11 \
  dependencies==webflux,okta,thymeleaf,devtools
</code>   

<p>Extract the Maven project and some additional dependencies. The <code>thymeleaf-extras-springsecurity5</code> dependency is required to include security conditionals in the templates, and
<code>spring-security-test</code> has mock login features that will help when writing controller tests.</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.thymeleaf.extras&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;thymeleaf-extras-springsecurity5&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;3.0.4.RELEASE&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.security&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-security-test&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   
 Add authentication with OpenID Connect 

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>

<p>Select Okta Spring Boot Starter. 
    Accept the default Redirect URI values provided for you. That is, a Login Redirect of <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta</code> and a Logout Redirect of <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: 
  /path/to/app/src/main/resources/application.properties
</code>   

<p>Open <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>
   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.client-id=0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
okta.oauth2.client-secret=NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/springboot/create-okta-application/">Create a Spring Boot App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>The Okta configuration is now in <code>application.properties</code>. Rename it to <code>application.yml</code> and add the following additional properties:</p>

   <code>spring:
  thymeleaf:
    prefix: file:src/main/resources/templates/  
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        provider:
          okta:
            user-name-attribute: email

okta:
  oauth2:
    issuer: /oauth2/default
    client-id: {clientId}
    client-secret: {clientSecret}
    scopes:
      - email
      - openid
</code>   

<p>Notice the <code>profile</code> scope is not requested for the first test. Only <code>openid</code> is a <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-basic-1_0.html#Scopes">required scope</a> to perform an OpenID Connect request. The <code>thymeleaf.prefix</code> property enables the hot-reloading of the templates, when the <code>spring-boot-devtools</code> dependency is included in the project.</p>

 Add some Thymeleaf templates 

<p>Create a <code>src/main/resources/templates</code> folder for the templates you are going to create. Create a <code>home.html</code> template with the following content:</p>

   <code>&lt;html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;User Details&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;!--/*/ &lt;th:block th:include="head :: head"/&gt; /*/--&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body id="samples"&gt;
&lt;div th:replace="menu :: menu"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="content" class="container"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Okta Hosted Login + Spring Boot Example&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div th:unless="${#authorization.expression('isAuthenticated()')}" class="text fw-light fs-6 lh-1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you're viewing this page then you have successfully configured and started this example server.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This example shows you how to use the &lt;a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot"&gt;Okta Spring Boot
            Starter&lt;/a&gt; to add the &lt;a
            href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/authcode/main/"&gt;Authorization
            Code Flow&lt;/a&gt; to your application.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When you click the login button below, you will be redirected to the login page on your Okta org. After you
            authenticate, you will be returned to this application.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div th:if="${#authorization.expression('isAuthenticated()')}" class="text fw-light fs-6 lh-1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Welcome home, &lt;span th:text="${#authentication.principal.name}"&gt;Joe Coder&lt;/span&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You have successfully authenticated against your Okta org, and have been redirected back to this 
          application.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;form th:unless="${#authorization.expression('isAuthenticated()')}" method="get" 
          th:action="@{/oauth2/authorization/okta}"&gt;
        &lt;button id="login-button" class="btn btn-primary" type="submit"&gt;Sign In&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;!--/*/ &lt;th:block th:include="footer :: footer"/&gt; /*/--&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>In the template above, the commented out <code>&lt;th:block/&gt;</code> allows to include a header and footer fragments defined in <code>header.html</code> and <code>footer.html</code>. They contain the Bootstrap dependencies for the templates styling. There is also a menu fragment that will replace the <code>&lt;div th:replace ...&gt;</code> element.</p>

<p>The <code>th:if</code> and <code>th:unless</code> conditionals are used to evaluate the authentication status. If the visitor is not authenticated, the Sign In button will be displayed. Otherwise, a greeting by username will be displayed.</p>

<p>Add a <code>head.html</code> template:</p>

   <code>&lt;html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org"&gt;
&lt;head th:fragment="head"&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"/&gt;
    &lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"/&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"/&gt;
    &lt;link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" 
          integrity="sha384-1BmE4kWBq78iYhFldvKuhfTAU6auU8tT94WrHftjDbrCEXSU1oBoqyl2QvZ6jIW3" crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap-icons@1.8.1/font/bootstrap-icons.css"&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing to see here, move along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>Create a <code>footer.html</code> template:</p>

   <code>&lt;html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing to see here, move along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;footer th:fragment="footer"&gt;
    &lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"  
            integrity="sha384-ka7Sk0Gln4gmtz2MlQnikT1wXgYsOg+OMhuP+IlRH9sENBO0LRn5q+8nbTov4+1p" 
            crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>Then, add a <code>menu.html</code> template for the menu fragment:</p>

   <code>&lt;html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org"&gt;

&lt;body id="samples"&gt;
&lt;nav class="navbar border mb-4 navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light" th:fragment="menu"&gt;
    &lt;div class="container-fluid"&gt;
        &lt;button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse"
                data-bs-target="#navbarSupportedContent" aria-controls="navbarSupportedContent"
                aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation"&gt;
            &lt;span class="navbar-toggler-icon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarSupportedContent"&gt;
            &lt;ul class="navbar-nav me-auto mb-2 mb-lg-0"&gt;
                &lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;&lt;a class="nav-link" th:href="@{/}"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;form class="d-flex" method="post" th:action="@{/logout}"
                  th:if="${#authorization.expression('isAuthenticated()')}"&gt;
                &lt;input class="form-control me-2" type="hidden" th:name="${_csrf.parameterName}"
                       th:value="${_csrf.token}"/&gt;
                &lt;button id="logout-button" type="submit" class="btn btn-danger"&gt;Logout&lt;/button&gt;
            &lt;/form&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

 Create the first controller class 

<p>A Controller is required to access the <code>home</code> page. Add a <code>HomeController</code> class under <code>src/main/java</code> in the <code>com.okta.developer.demo</code> package, with the following content:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.demo;

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.security.core.Authentication;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.reactive.result.view.Rendering;
import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;

import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

@Controller
public class HomeController {

    private static Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(HomeController.class);

    @GetMapping("/")
    public Mono&lt;Rendering&gt; home(Authentication authentication) {
        List&lt;String&gt; authorities = authentication.getAuthorities()
                .stream()
                .map(scope -&gt; scope.toString())
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
        return Mono.just(Rendering.view("home").modelAttribute("authorities", authorities).build());
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The controller will render the <code>home</code> view and will set the authorities as a model attribute, for security checks that will be added soon.</p>

 Tweak the security configuration 

<p>The default Okta starter auto-configuration will request authentication to access any page, so to customize the security, add a <code>SecurityConfiguration</code> class in the same package as before.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.demo;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.method.configuration.EnableReactiveMethodSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.reactive.EnableWebFluxSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.web.server.ServerHttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.web.server.SecurityWebFilterChain;
import org.springframework.security.web.server.authentication.logout.RedirectServerLogoutSuccessHandler;
import org.springframework.security.web.server.authentication.logout.ServerLogoutSuccessHandler;

import java.net.URI;

@EnableWebFluxSecurity
@EnableReactiveMethodSecurity
public class SecurityConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public ServerLogoutSuccessHandler logoutSuccessHandler(){
        RedirectServerLogoutSuccessHandler handler = new RedirectServerLogoutSuccessHandler();
        handler.setLogoutSuccessUrl(URI.create("/"));
        return handler;
    }

    @Bean
    public SecurityWebFilterChain securityWebFilterChain(ServerHttpSecurity http) {
        http
            .authorizeExchange().pathMatchers("/").permitAll().and().anonymous()
            .and().authorizeExchange().anyExchange().authenticated()
            .and().oauth2Client()
            .and().oauth2Login()
            .and().logout().logoutSuccessHandler(logoutSuccessHandler());

        return http.build();
    }
}
</code>   

<p>In the configuration above, access to the home <code>/</code> page is allowed to all with anonymous authentication, which is required for the authentication expression in the Thymeleaf <code>home.html</code> template to work. An authentication object must be in the security context.</p>

 Run the application 

<p>Run the application with Maven:</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Go to <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and you should see the home page and a Sign In button. Click the button and sign in with your Okta credentials. After signing in, you should be redirected back to the home page and see the content for authenticated users.</p>

<p></p>

 Protect content areas with authorization 

<p>Let’s add a <code>userProfile.html</code> template that will display the claims contained in the access token returned from Okta, as well as the authorities that Spring Security derives from the token.</p>

   <code>&lt;html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;User Details&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;!--/*/ &lt;th:block th:include="head :: head"/&gt; /*/--&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body id="samples"&gt;
&lt;div th:replace="menu :: menu"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="content" class="container"&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;My Profile&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hello, &lt;span th:text="${#authentication.principal.attributes['name']}"&gt;Joe Coder&lt;/span&gt;. Below is the 
            information that was read with your &lt;a 
            href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/oidc.html#get-user-information"&gt;Access Token&lt;/a&gt;.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This route is protected with the annotation &lt;code&gt;@PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('SCOPE_profile')")&lt;/code&gt;, 
            which will ensure that this page cannot be accessed until you have authenticated, and have the scope &lt;code&gt;profile&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;table class="table table-striped"&gt;
        &lt;thead&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;Claim&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;Value&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/thead&gt;
        &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr th:each="item : ${details}"&gt;
              &lt;td th:text="${item.key}"&gt;Key&lt;/td&gt;
              &lt;td th:id="${'claim-' + item.key}" th:text="${item.value}"&gt;Value&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/tbody&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;

    &lt;table class="table table-striped"&gt;
        &lt;thead&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;Spring Security Authorities&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/thead&gt;
        &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr th:each="scope : ${#authentication.authorities}"&gt;
              &lt;td&gt;&lt;code th:text="${scope}"&gt;Authority&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/tbody&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;!--/*/ &lt;th:block th:include="footer :: footer"/&gt; /*/--&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>Add the route mapping in the <code>HomeController</code>:</p>

   <code>@GetMapping("/profile")
@PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('SCOPE_profile')")
public Mono&lt;Rendering&gt; userDetails(OAuth2AuthenticationToken authentication) {
    return Mono.just(Rendering.view("userProfile")
        .modelAttribute("details", authentication.getPrincipal().getAttributes())
        .build());
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>@PreAuthorize</code> annotation allows you to define an authorization predicate that can be written in SpEL (Spring Expression Language). It will be checked before the method execution. Only users with the authority <code>SCOPE_PROFILE</code> can request a display of the <code>userProfile</code> page. This is server-side protection.</p>

<p>For the client-side, add a link in the <code>home.html</code> template to access the <code>userProfile</code> page, below the “You successfully …” paragraph. The link will also only display for users that have the <code>SCOPE_profile</code> authority.</p>

   <code>&lt;p&gt;You have successfully authenticated against your Okta org, and have been redirected back to this application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p th:if="${#lists.contains(authorities, 'SCOPE_profile')}"&gt;Visit the &lt;a th:href="@{/profile}"&gt;My Profile&lt;/a&gt; page in this application to view the information retrieved with your OAuth Access Token.&lt;/p&gt;
</code>   

<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: The authorization conditional is implemented in this way, because authorization-oriented expressions like <code>${#authorization.expression('hasRole(''SCOPE_profile'')')}</code> are restricted in WebFlux applications due to a lack of support in the reactive side of Spring Security (as of Spring Security 5.6). Only a minimal set of security expressions is allowed: [<code>isAuthenticated()</code>, <code>isFullyAuthenticated()</code>, <code>isAnonymous()</code>, <code>isRememberMe()</code>].</p>

<p>Run the application again. After signing in, you still won’t see the new link, and if you go to <code>http://localhost:8080/profile</code>, you will get HTTP ERROR 403, which means forbidden. This is because in <code>application.yml</code>, as part of the Okta configuration, only <code>email</code> and <code>openid</code> scopes are requested, and <code>profile</code> scope is not returned in the access token claims. Add the missing scope in the <code>application.yml</code>, restart, and the <code>userProfile</code> view should now be visible:</p>

<p></p>

<p>As you can see, Spring Security assigns the groups contained in the claim as well as the requested scopes as authorities. Scopes are prefixed with <code>SCOPE_</code>. <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code>, and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups are created by default when you create a client application with Okta CLI, and your user is assigned to them.</p>

 Prevent CSRF when submitting forms 

<p>CSRF stands for Cross-Site Request Forgery, and is a form of cyber-attack through the submission of a form from a malicious site to a known site, exploiting the browser behavior by which the malicious request is sent along with the known site cookies, passing as an authenticated request.</p>

<p>Spring Security CSRF protection is enabled by default for both Servlet and WebFlux applications. The predominant protection mechanism is the <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/features/exploits/csrf.html#csrf-protection-stp">Synchronizer Token Pattern</a>, which ensures each HTTP request must contain a secure random generated value, the CSRF token. The token must be required in a part of the request that is not populated automatically by the browser. For example, you can use an HTTP parameter or header.</p>

<p>Let’s verify the CSRF protection is active by creating a quiz form to the application. Create the template <code>quiz.html</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>&lt;html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Thymeleaf Quiz&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;!--/*/ &lt;th:block th:include="head :: head"/&gt; /*/--&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body id="samples"&gt;
&lt;div th:replace="menu :: menu"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="content" class="container"&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Select the right answer&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;form action="#" th:action="@{/quiz}" th:object="${quiz}"
          method="post" class="col-md-4 fw-light"&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li th:errors="*{answer}" /&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;div class="col-md-12"&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;What is Thymeleaf?&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="col-md-12 form-check"&gt;
            &lt;input class="form-check-input" type="radio" th:field="*{answer}" value="A" id="check-1-1"/&gt;
            &lt;label class="form-check-label" for="check-1-1"&gt;
                &lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt; A server-side Java template engine
            &lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="col-md-12 form-check"&gt;
            &lt;input class="form-check-input" type="radio" th:field="*{answer}" value="B" id="check-1-2"/&gt;
            &lt;label class="form-check-label" for="check-1-2"&gt;
                &lt;strong&gt;B.&lt;/strong&gt; A markup language
            &lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="col-md-12 form-check"&gt;
            &lt;input class="form-check-input" type="radio" th:field="*{answer}" value="C" id="check-1-3"/&gt;
            &lt;label class="form-check-label" for="check-1-3"&gt;
                &lt;strong&gt;C.&lt;/strong&gt; A web framework
            &lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="col-md-12 mt-4 mb-4"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Your CSRF token is: &lt;span th:text="${_csrf.token}"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="col-md-12"&gt;
            &lt;button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary"&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;!--/*/ &lt;th:block th:include="footer :: footer"/&gt; /*/--&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>The CSRF token is available as a request attribute and will be displayed in the <code>quiz.html</code> template for learning purposes.</p>

<p>Add a template for the quiz result with the name <code>result.html</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Thymeleaf Quiz Submission&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;!--/*/ &lt;th:block th:include="head :: head"/&gt; /*/--&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body id="samples"&gt;
&lt;div th:replace="menu :: menu"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="container" id="content"&gt;
    &lt;div class="text-center"&gt;
        &lt;i class="bi-balloon-heart-fill" style="font-size: 6rem; color: green;" th:if=${quiz.answer=='A'}&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
        &lt;i class="bi-x-circle-fill" style="font-size: 6rem; color: red;" th:unless=${quiz.answer=='A'}&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
        &lt;div class="panel mt-4 text-center"&gt;
            &lt;div class="panel-body"&gt;
                &lt;h4&gt;Your selected answer is &lt;strong&gt;
                    &lt;span th:text="${quiz.answer}"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
                &lt;p th:if=${quiz.answer=='A'}&gt;Good Job!&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="panel mt-4 text-center" th:unless=${quiz.answer=='A'}&gt;
            &lt;div class="panel-body"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It is not the right answer&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a th:href="@{/quiz}"&gt;Try again!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;!--/*/ &lt;th:block th:include="footer :: footer"/&gt; /*/--&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>Add a <code>QuizSubmission</code> data class, for holding the quiz answer:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.demo;

public class QuizSubmission {

    private String answer;

    public String getAnswer() {
        return answer;
    }

    public void setAnswer(String answer) {
        this.answer = answer;
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Add a <code>QuizController</code> for displaying the quiz and processing the form submission:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.demo;

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.http.MediaType;
import org.springframework.security.access.prepost.PreAuthorize;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PostMapping;
import org.springframework.web.reactive.result.view.Rendering;
import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;

@Controller
public class QuizController {

    private static Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(QuizController.class);

    @GetMapping("/quiz")
    @PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('SCOPE_quiz')")
    public Mono&lt;Rendering&gt; showQuiz() {
        return Mono.just(Rendering.view("quiz").modelAttribute("quiz", new QuizSubmission()).build());
    }

    @PostMapping(path = "/quiz", consumes = {MediaType.APPLICATION_FORM_URLENCODED_VALUE})
    @PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('SCOPE_quiz')")
    public Mono&lt;Rendering&gt; saveQuiz(QuizSubmission quizSubmission) {
        return Mono.just(Rendering.view("result").modelAttribute("quiz", quizSubmission).build());
    }
}
</code>   

<p>In the new controller and templates, the quiz is authorized for users that have <code>SCOPE_quiz</code> authority. Add a protected link to the <code>home.html</code> template, below the profile link:</p>

   <code>&lt;p&gt;You have successfully authenticated against your Okta org, and have been redirected back to this application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p th:if="${#lists.contains(authorities, 'SCOPE_profile')}"&gt;Visit the &lt;a th:href="@{/profile}"&gt;My Profile&lt;/a&gt; page in this application to view the information retrieved with your OAuth Access Token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p th:if="${#lists.contains(authorities, 'SCOPE_quiz')}"&gt;Visit the &lt;a th:href="@{/quiz}"&gt;Thymeleaf Quiz&lt;/a&gt; to test Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection.&lt;/p&gt;
</code>   

<p>Before running the application again, let’s verify CSRF protection with a controller test. Add <code>QuizControllerTest</code> to <code>src/test/java</code> under the package <code>com.okta.developer.demo</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.demo;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.web.reactive.WebFluxTest;
import org.springframework.http.MediaType;
import org.springframework.test.web.reactive.server.WebTestClient;

import static org.springframework.security.test.web.reactive.server.SecurityMockServerConfigurers.csrf;
import static org.springframework.security.test.web.reactive.server.SecurityMockServerConfigurers.mockOidcLogin;

@WebFluxTest
public class QuizControllerTest {

    @Autowired
    private WebTestClient client;

    @Test
    void testPostQuiz_noCSRFToken() throws Exception {
        QuizSubmission quizSubmission = new QuizSubmission();
        this.client.mutateWith(mockOidcLogin())
                .post().uri("/quiz")
                .exchange()
                .expectStatus().isForbidden()
                .expectBody().returnResult()
                .toString().contains("An expected CSRF token cannot be found");
    }

    @Test
    void testPostQuiz() throws Exception {
        this.client.mutateWith(csrf()).mutateWith(mockOidcLogin())
                .post().uri("/quiz")
                .contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_FORM_URLENCODED)
                .exchange().expectStatus().isOk();
    }

    @Test
    void testGetQuiz_noAuth() throws Exception {
        this.client.get().uri("/quiz").exchange().expectStatus().is3xxRedirection();
    }

    @Test
    void testGetQuiz() throws Exception {
        this.client.mutateWith(mockOidcLogin())
                .get().uri("/quiz").exchange().expectStatus().isOk();
    }
}
</code>   

<p>In the test class above, the first test <code>testPostQuiz_noCSRFToken()</code> verifies the quiz cannot be submitted without the CSRF token, even if the user did sign in. In the second test <code>testPostQuiz()</code>, the CSRF token is added to the mock request with <code>mutateWith(csrf())</code>, so the expected response status is HTTP 200 OK. The third test <code>testGetQuiz_noAuth()</code> verifies a request of the quiz will be redirected (to the Okta sign-in form) if the user is not authenticated. And the last test <code>testGetQuiz()</code> verifies the quiz can be accessed if the user has been authenticated with an OIDC login.</p>

<p>As <code>quiz</code> is not a standard scope or a scope defined in Okta, you have to define it for the default authorization server before running the application. Sign in to the Okta Admin Console, and in the left menu, go to Security &gt; API, the choose the default authorization server. In the Scopes tab, click Add Scope. Set the scope name as <code>quiz</code> and add a description, leave all the remaining fields with default values and click on Create. Now the <code>quiz</code> scope can be required during the OIDC login.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Run the application without adding the <code>quiz</code> scope to the <code>application.yml</code> file, sign in, and you should not see the quiz link yet. If you make a GET request with the browser to <code>http://localhost:8080/quiz</code>, the response will be 403 Forbidden.</p>

<p>Now add <code>quiz</code> to the list of scopes in the Okta configuration in <code>application.yml</code>. The final configuration should look like this:</p>

   <code>spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        provider:
          okta:
            user-name-attribute: email

okta:
  oauth2:
    issuer: /oauth2/default
    client-id: {clientId}
    client-secret: {clientSecret}
    scopes:
      - email
      - openid
      - profile
      - quiz
</code>   

<p>Run the application again and you should see the quiz link “Visit the Thymeleaf Quiz to test Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection”. Click the link and the quiz will be displayed:</p>

<p></p>

<p>The CSRF token is displayed, but if you turn on developer tools, you can also find it as a hidden attribute <code>&lt;input type="hidden" name="_csrf" value="..."&gt;</code> that Spring Security adds to the form.</p>

<p>You can try the POST request with HTTPie, and you will again verify the POST request is rejected without the CSRF token.</p>

   <code>$ http POST http://localhost:8080/

HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate
Content-Type: text/plain
Expires: 0
Pragma: no-cache
Referrer-Policy: no-referrer
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1 ; mode=block
content-length: 38

An expected CSRF token cannot be found
</code>   

<p>The interesting fact here is that it seems CSRF protection takes precedence over authentication in the Spring Security filter chain.</p>

 Meet the Team — Kevin Boehm, Head of&nbsp;Product Kevin Boehm<p>Meet the Team is our ongoing series of employee profiles. It’s an opportunity for our users and partners to get to know us a little better. As a remote company with employees around the world — from the U.S. to Slovenia to Spain to New Zealand — it’s also an opportunity for our team to get to know each other a little&nbsp;better.</p><p>We’re thrilled to introduce Kevin Boehm, Head of Product at GlobaliD. Kevin’s an MIT-trained engineer who cut his teeth in consumer finance before moving to Amazon and ended up as an early team member on a little project called&nbsp;Alexa.</p><p>Now, he’s helping us build the future of digital identity. In our wide spanning conversation, Kevin talks about the thread that connects everything he’s worked on so far, the core principles he abides by, and what makes GlobaliD different from anywhere&nbsp;else.</p> Introducing Kevin&nbsp;Boehm <p>Kevin: I’m Kevin Boehm, Head of Product. The best way to summarize my role is that I look at the universe of opportunities and the portfolio of products that we can build and ultimately make sure that we’re making progress to deliver digital identity that people, businesses, and developers want to&nbsp;use.</p> On the themes that drive him — including rocket&nbsp;science <p>There’s a couple themes that jump out in terms of the work I’ve done or the jobs I’ve found myself in. They’ve all typically been related to technology or some sort of large scale or optimization problems. They almost always involve multiple stakeholders, whether that’s developers and end users, buyers and sellers, or advertisers and publishers.</p><p>I studied mechanical engineering at MIT. I just enjoy tinkering, taking things apart — learning how really, really complex systems like heat exchangers for a nuclear reactor work, and then breaking it down into: Here’s the 12 sub-problems that allow this to function. How do we figure out how to optimize each part, and which part should we start optimizing first?</p><p>Some of the research work I did in college was around non-destructive testing of aerospace components, including figuring out how well new technologies can identify defects in parts like engine blades. It allowed me to zoom in really, really deep and optimize a single process that has life or death consequences. By learning to work at both breadth and depth, I got comfortable that no problem is too large or difficult to approach.</p> What the credit card game taught him about data and feedback&nbsp;loops <p>I ended up at my first job at Capital One — I don’t want to say by happenstance — but I didn’t know that much about credit cards or lending coming out of school. The big thing there that was interesting and shaped the way I think: Capital One actually invented the concept of credit cards with tiered pricing. Up until the late 80’s, almost everyone got the same interest rate around 20%. Capital One was the first company to say, Hey, let’s start looking at users differently, A/B testing, and optimizing.</p><blockquote>The big thing I learned at the bank was: How do I take billions of rows of data around hundreds of millions of users and figure out a hypothesis that we can&nbsp;test.</blockquote><p>Here’s someone who we can give a 10% rate or 25% rate. Their whole culture and DNA was around: Test, segment, optimize — all the way down to the mail that you&nbsp;receive:</p><p>What envelope?</p><p>What color is&nbsp;it?</p><p>What’s the call to&nbsp;action?</p><p>What are the product&nbsp;terms?</p><p>What’s the signup incentive?</p><p>All of that is something they test; they learn. They have a feedback loop. I developed this assumption after two years working at the bank that everyone in the world has measurements, goals, and success criteria.</p><p>The big thing I learned at the bank was — I hate the term big data so I try to actively not say it&nbsp;: How do I take billions of rows of data around hundreds of millions of users and figure out a hypothesis that we can test? I like to joke that it was kind of like being a private investigator. You had all the evidence and clues in front of you. It was just a matter of putting together your business hypothesis.</p> How Amazon’s culture showed him the big&nbsp;picture <p>I moved to Amazon after two years at the bank, and I went from owning a really narrow piece of how credit cards work to owning an end-to-end credit&nbsp;program.</p><p>What was really exciting was that I got to transition from just trying to understand how credit cards work — and being a nerd and having dozens of credit cards — to understanding how I can leverage the assets that Amazon has. There’s so many users. It’s like a giant Petri dish, having the ability to carve that up and say, I’m going to run this test on 5% of Amazon users. I had millions of opportunities to test something.</p><p>That feedback loop between having an idea, implementing it, and seeing how much money you’re making was 15 or 30 minutes — not days or&nbsp;weeks.</p><p>There was one really cool experience I had at Amazon. I was working on a new program, kind of an internal startup, that was on pace to make hundreds million a year. We shut it down — what, at a normal company, would have been a crazy, irrational decision — because there was a competing opportunity we could focus on with the potential to make billions of dollars a year in&nbsp;profit.</p><p>We looked at it and said, Here’s an opportunity that’s 10X bigger than the other. Let’s shut it down right now. Yes it hurts, but once the decision is made, there’s no second thought. You just move on and focus on the big thing. That was something that was ingrained in the culture; everything is constantly changing, and it’s your job to adapt and evolve and solve the biggest problems for the business&nbsp;overall.</p> Joining the Alexa team early&nbsp;on <p>The last role that I had at Amazon was working on Alexa. I got to join early on, about a year after the first Echo device launch. At the time, Amazon had invested several years into developing Alexa, solving the science and engineering problems to make a smart speaker work and figuring out: How do we build this into a business?</p><p>Back in 2015 or 2016 — there were a limited number of things a user could do with Alexa. But in the long term, we had all these aspirations about how to make an operating system that is everywhere — in people’s homes, computers, hotels and cars. How do we use this to drive long term value of the&nbsp;company?</p><p>Amazon’s very long term focused and specifically focused on driving value for end users. This was even taking that to an extreme and saying, 10 years from now, we might start making a profit off of this. What are the things that matter most between now and&nbsp;then?</p><blockquote>When I think about GlobaliD, we have some use cases now, where it’s like: Let’s make this work so users understand digital identity. Even if all the partners and players aren’t there yet, let’s deliver value to users today wherever we can do better than the current solutions.</blockquote> On building for the future — lessons from&nbsp;Alexa <p>In terms of things that shaped my thinking and are valuable at GlobaliD, this lesson stands out: You need to provide and illustrate value to users as quickly as possible.</p><p>For Alexa, some of our first use cases we supported were prominent features like ordering a Domino’s pizza or an Uber. While we didn’t necessarily think these would be the killer app, we believed that users, developers, and businesses could understand, get excited, and start imagining how they could incorporate it into their lives in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>It was on us as a company to figure out: What are the five or six cases that people will get — even if it’s not something they’ll do all the time. Otherwise, they’ll use it for a day, unplug it, and throw it into the&nbsp;closet.</p><p>When I think about GlobaliD, we have some use cases now, where it’s like: Let’s make this work so users understand digital identity. Even if all the partners and players aren’t there yet, let’s deliver value to users today wherever we can do better than the current solutions.</p><p>Another piece that was really instrumental was building things in the scrappiest and cheapest way possible. One of the benefits we had at Amazon — because we were spending probably about a billion dollars a year on the program — was that we would have three or four teams building competing solutions for the same problem. They were building in different ways.</p><p>More often than not, the team that was most successful was not the one that started off using the latest and coolest forms of machine learning and data science; it was a team that did things really scrappy to test and continuously iterative solutions to solve user problems.</p> Core principles #1: Focus on the end&nbsp;user <p>The first principle is always being focused on the end&nbsp;user.</p><p>Knowing what they care&nbsp;about.</p><p>If they’re going to wake up and want to engage with us, then we need to know what they wake up and think about in terms of their biggest problems.</p><p>That customer focus — whether that’s when we’re building, designing, or selling — that’s number&nbsp;one.</p> Core principles #2: Moving fast or&nbsp;slow <p>Number two is realizing — and I’m going to sound like such a shill for Amazon here — but realizing what we call one-way door versus two-way door decisions.</p><p>When something is easy to change, let’s not spend a lot of time talking about it. Let’s make the best decision and move fast. We can always go back through the door and change our decision.</p><p>When something is going to be expensive or impossible to change, that’s when it’s worth us spending time to get it&nbsp;right.</p><p>There are so many decisions we have to make every single day, it’s about figuring out which ones are worth the extra cognitive burden.</p><p>Moving fast when it’s smart, and then taking time where the stakes are&nbsp;higher..</p> Core principles #3: What matters&nbsp;most <p>The third is just being willing to say — I don’t want to say throw stuff away — but ruthlessly prioritizing what matters most&nbsp;now.</p><p>The predominant belief of, I want to keep doing this instead of admitting defeat, is counterproductive. You are losing if you’re letting your less valuable ideas get in the way of the more important ones.</p><p>If a scientist or an investor sticks with 100% of their hypotheses in the face of contradictory evidence, they’re likely not in the top of their field. As a business, if you’re not throwing away your worst ideas, you’re either a genius and correct 100% of the time, or you’re unintentionally starving your best ideas from succeeding. In my experience, it’s usually the&nbsp;latter.</p> The road to blockchain is paved in economic incentives <p>I went down the Bitcoin and blockchain rabbit hole in — was it 2017? It was one of the Super Bowls where the Patriots won, and I actually had some money to cash out. I had previously read about Bitcoin, and once I used it, it piqued my curiosity. How does this actually work? This led me to start reading white papers, learning about encryption, protocols, and projects.</p><p>What I really, really appreciated was — I don’t want to just overuse the term decentralization: The ability to build a functioning system resistant to participants who are actively trying to screw each other over. That’s about as close to perfection as it gets when people are trying to collude, trying to steal — and the system aligns economic incentives accordingly.</p><p>As soon as I saw the potential value there, I became interested in exploring and identifying where future business applications could&nbsp;be.</p> “Anything that I care about in the next 10 years is going to be bolstered by identity.” <p>Outside of payments, I did a lot of research into projects and took a course through MIT’s executive education program. Some of the use cases that were covered included some early identity providers. None of them are still around today because they were a bit too early or they pivoted since then. But having learned about the concept, I was intrigued. Intrigued but also skeptical. It’s a tough nut to&nbsp;crack.</p><p>What ultimately led me back here when I was looking at my next opportunity: I landed on identity because I couldn’t&nbsp;choose.</p><p>I was really interested in payments, fintech, and the crypto space. I knew I was going to do something adjacent to that. I was also exploring companies in insurtech and insurance, which ultimately comes back to identity. The third was a lot of stuff in advertising and data — but the data optimization space.</p><p>All of these revolve around individuals, their data, and the ability to connect products and goods to those individuals. I could say this in two ways. One, I figured out that identity was at the hub of all the things I cared about. Another way to put it is, I was too indecisive to pick a single&nbsp;field.</p><p>So I said, Why don’t I pick the one that has the most applications? I thought to myself, Anything that I care about in the next 10 years is going to be bolstered by identity. So why not go solve something that heavily shaped my&nbsp;mind?</p> The GlobaliD difference <p>When I think about where we stand and the other players in the space, I think about the common themes that exist beyond GlobaliD. As a human race or as users of technology, we definitely want to have as much control as possible.</p><blockquote>What I think is different about our approach is not just that we’re taking this long term focus — lots of people can say they’re taking a long term focus. But it’s us starting with the most meaningful and high stakes problems (in terms of overall reach) that ultimately revolve around money (and as a result, put us into a highly regulated, highly inspected space).</blockquote><p>Where I see us coming into play along with a lot of our competitors is providing users a new way of doing things, a new way of interacting with other individuals, online businesses, peers, enterprises — and doing so in a privacy-preserving manner.</p><p>These are going to be the table stakes&nbsp;terms.</p><p>What is different about our approach and what ultimately led me to pick GlobaliD versus any of these other competitors is the time horizon that we’re looking&nbsp;at.</p><p>The kinds of problems that we’re looking at solving require a certain long term focus but also a certain type of stubbornness. It’s not necessarily looking at a one-off problem we can solve. It’s looking at what we would seek to change on a 10-year time horizon. What are the big biggest problems for us to solve in order to do&nbsp;that?</p><p>What I think is different about our approach is not just that we’re taking this long term focus — lots of people can say they’re taking a long term focus. But it’s us starting with the most meaningful and high stakes problems (in terms of overall reach) that ultimately revolve around money (and as a result, put us into a highly regulated, highly inspected space).</p><p>And it’s not just our focus around payments. (Most of the identity companies I’ve seen that have picked a lane to start in have chosen payments or healthcare.) It’s the combined focus on solving an immediate problem today, while knowing that if we continue to solve the second, third, and fourth problem — if we connect these four or five pieces together — we can actually fundamentally change the way that commerce happens, the way that people bank, and the way that people interact.</p><p>It comes down to having the long term approach, having the regulatory focus, and constantly seeking out where there’s immediate end-user value. If it’s just the first two, I’m not as excited. With the third, that’s where we’re going to be successful.</p> What we’re most excited&nbsp;about <blockquote>The huge opportunity for us is if we can make this ability for people to share info in a privacy-preserving manner intuitive. It’s our best shot at becoming a&nbsp;verb.</blockquote><p>There’s two areas I’m really excited about. They’re related but pretty different.</p><p>What I’m really, really, really excited about is making digital identity accessible and understandable to a mass market audience. When I talk to people — my friends, my family, people I grew up with — I tell them that the general idea of what we’re trying to solve is how they can interact with someone or a business and prove information about themselves without revealing their identity.</p><p>Every single person I talk to is like, Sign me up. This sounds like a better way. How do we do&nbsp;it?</p><p>The challenge for us is that at no point in solving this for the user do they need to understand hashing encryption, zero-knowledge proofs, or credentials standards. In the same way, when I look at jokes on the Reddit homepage, I don’t need to understand what protocols are happening in the background.</p><p>It’s just: I want to do this thing, and it’s as simple as possible.</p><p>The huge opportunity for us is if we can make this ability for people to share info in a privacy-preserving manner intuitive. It’s our best shot at becoming a verb. You don’t search for things, you Google things. What would it mean if you were to GlobaliD someone? It’s not to say the overarching goal is to become a verb — but it’s the ultimate sign that you’ve solved a problem in an intuitive way.</p><p>That’s our biggest end-user-facing or consumer-facing opportunity. The bigger one for us as a business is figuring out how we can start solving problems for developers in this growing web3 space. There’s nothing but problems and opportunities in any emerging&nbsp;market.</p><blockquote>It comes down to knowing the end user, knowing what their problems are, and then it’s our job to solve them now while looking ahead and deliver solutions to problems they don’t even know they have&nbsp;yet.</blockquote> GlobaliD’s biggest challenge <p>Our biggest challenge is that the areas we can add the most value today and the areas we want to be providing value in the long term are related but not necessarily translating one-to-one to each&nbsp;other.</p><p>Specifically, if we believe we can make these new financial instruments with regulatory compliance in a privacy-preserving way, the problem is that developers and users won’t wake up and say, How can I be more compliant today? It’s just not top of mind for&nbsp;them.</p><p>So today, if all we’re doing is trying to sell them compliance, compliance, compliance, it’s kind of like saying, eat your vegetables. Vegetables come great as a side dish for a lot of people. It’s on us to figure out what the main protein or entrée is. How do we gradually introduce these vegetables, and before they know it, it’s part of their&nbsp;diet?</p><p>It comes down to knowing the end user, knowing what their problems are, and then it’s our job to solve them now while looking ahead and deliver solutions to problems they don’t even know they have&nbsp;yet.</p> We’re hiring!   <a href="https://www.global.id/about/careers/">Careers at&nbsp;GlobaliD</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/meet-the-team-kevin-boehm-head-of-product-27e1f21cf580">Meet the Team — Kevin Boehm, Head of Product</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				  Digital Identity Convenience 
<p>by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/martch/">Christine Martin</a></p>
<p>I just had two different but related things happen with my 18-year-old daughter regarding her identity…</p>
<p>This week, I took her to the DriveTest Centre to get her G1 (driving license). Since she’s 18, I left it up to her to ensure she had all the necessary documentation. She brought her Ontario Health Card and Canadian Passport. When it was her turn, she went to the counter and presented her documents. The representative looked over the papers and let us know the passport was expired, and thus she could not accept it. She asked if she had another piece of identification, like a birth certificate. Of course, she did not have this with her. As we left the DriveTest Centre, I mentioned that we wouldn’t have had this problem if she had a digital wallet that could store her identity documents. She would have had all her credentials on her phone to prove who she was. She told me, in short, that it wasn’t a better alternative because she just watched a movie on digital identity, and we are all going to turn into tracked and controlled robots of Big Brother if we let that happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>My daughter opened a new bank account online, but she still has to present herself in person to finalize things. With a digital wallet holding credentials and verification via biometrics, she could have completed that step online and had access to the new account immediately. Why does the bank offer the option to open an account online?</p>

 You’re already at risk. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe it’s because of the nature of my job in decentralized identity consulting, but lately, I’ve been seeing a lot of conspiracy theories on social media about Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). People criticize the way it’s being implemented and warn about the negative consequences it will have. It’s almost as if people don’t realize that organizations are already monitoring and influencing us and that Google and social media algorithms have been instrumental in this.</p>
<p>Right now, Facebook owns your identity and <a href="https://bigthink.com/the-present/social-media-algorithms-manipulate-you/">essentially decides what you see in your feed</a>; and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/north-america-science-technology-business-ap-top-news-828aefab64d4411bac257a07c1af0ecb">Google tracks your every move</a>. These companies claim our data as their asset and make money off it. </p>
<p>“Many acts of ‘digital misdirection’ are happening before our very eyes every day, and we are starting to become more aware of them. Every action we perform online has become a piece of data which is used to coerce and constrain our digital experiences. We see it in the ads that show up across all our devices following an Internet search, in the ever-narrower set of content we’re shown on our social media sites, and in the increasingly compelling, and sometimes spooky, product recommendations we receive. This digital misdirection goes on to the point that we begin to wonder whether we can still exercise any free will online at all.” –<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/"> The Rise of Surveillance Capitalism</a></p>
<p>What if you could monetize your identity? What if you could share extra preference data with Facebook and allow them to share that data with a third party for a fee? You could charge $0.50 for every additional set of preference data you share. Self-Sovereign identity can give you control over your data and generate passive income. Why wouldn’t you pick this option?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How can we trust them to be honest stewards of our data? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/03/google-sued-for-misleading-users-over-location-data-privacy/">lawsuit has been filed against Google</a> that stems from investigations dating back to 2018 by Princeton University and the Associated Press. The lawsuit alleges that “Google falsely led consumers to believe that changing their account and device settings would allow customers to protect their privacy and control what personal data the company could access. The truth is that contrary to Google’s representations it continues to systematically surveil customers and profit from customer data.”</p>
<p>What else are these media giants doing that we haven’t figured out yet? <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/how-bad-is-the-global-data-privacy-crisis/">How Bad is the Global Data Privacy Crisis?</a> And you want them holding your information? I’m confused.</p>
<p>Platforms like Facebook and Google aren’t fond of losing access to people’s data; having less control over the user data makes it far less valuable for monetization. I’m not sure why people aren’t more concerned with this aspect.&nbsp; I can’t help but come up with my own conspiracy theory: the Facebook algorithm suppresses positive news and advancement in SSI while pushing misinformation.&nbsp; With digital identity, you (the holder) will be able to control your identity and decide which credentials to share with whom.&nbsp; That’s a significant loss for big tech.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 SSI Architects care about privacy and security 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I saw a <a href="http://www.continuumloop.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-23-at-7.00.36-AM.png">Facebook post</a> shared with a photo of a copy of <a href="https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Advancing_towards_Digital_Agency_2022.pdf">The World Economic Forum – Advancing Digital Agency</a> report with the quote, “Digital ID, it isn’t just a rumour, people. WEF wants to control everyone’s life. SHARE“. The WEF report is more about protecting users, the challenges of broken trust, and data intermediaries instead of controlling everyone’s life.&nbsp; There are many benefits to Digital Identity, particularly with vulnerable and marginalized groups (refugees).&nbsp;</p>
<p>We care about privacy and security; we have the same concerns. Organizations like Evernym/Avast want to embed <a href="https://www.evernym.com/blog/eu-digital-identity/">eIDAS</a> in their products, but only if it <a href="https://blog.avast.com/eidas-2.0-avast?_ga=2.188632365.442058729.1646653922-1048450645.1646653922">addresses these four problems</a> and maximizes opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Something crucial for laymen to remember is that governments cannot build and implement these frameworks without help from the private sector. That includes SSI consultants like us here at Continuum Loop. We’re regular members of society; we have friends, family and children that we care about and want to protect: now and in the future. We are involved because we care and are aware of the negative implications and aspects; we can help mitigate these factors, build these frameworks, and make them beneficial for all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Hold, own, and control your credentials/identity. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital ID is nothing new; it’s been around for a while in one form or another. However, the COVID pandemic has caused a “digital acceleration” event where our reliance on technology has catapulted forward. The pandemic has accelerated the adoption in many ways, like the increased use of QR codes and contactless payment to mitigate the risk of exposure to the virus. In particular, it has helped to raise awareness of the need for such a system and its benefits.</p>
<p>You will take back control of your identity and hold it. Not Facebook, not Google, and you will decide what credentials to share on a need-to-know basis. We don’t have to be scared of the shift; we have to ensure the architecture is built ethically for all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Privilege of Hesitation. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are privileged to be able to be so critical of these emerging technologies. We take for granted that the college or university we graduated from will always be there or that our government institutions will always be in place and functioning to provide us with the services we need. I can’t help but wonder how a current refugee, who had no time to take paper documents, would feel to have the ability to easily prove their identity while starting over in a new county. All we have to do is look to Ukraine and see <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ukraine-why-centralized-identity-systems-can-cause-problem-freitag/">why centralized Identity systems can cause a problem</a>.</p>
<p>Many Ukrainians have been displaced and need to apply for new documents to be able to travel and access services in other countries. The centralized identity system can make it difficult for people to get their records. As different groups seek refuge, they face unique challenges. Many Ukrainians of Roma origin, for example, suffer discrimination in Ukraine and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/7/ukraines-roma-refugees-recount-discrimination-on-route-to-safety">may not have any documentation</a> indicating their identity or citizenship. Being undocumented as you flee conflict and navigate foreign countries can lead to many dangers like human trafficking. Desperation can lead to refugees bribing government officials to get their documents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In contrast, <a href="https://e-estonia.com/solutions/e-identity/id-card/">Estonia has a practical but highly-centralized digital identity system</a> that makes it easier for people to access the various services they need. While it is centralized and questionable from a privacy and surveillance perspective, this system allows for secure and transparent transactions that make citizens’ and e-residents’ lives more convenient and secure. The Estonian government has been using this technology since 2001, and it has helped them become one of the most digitally advanced countries in the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this implementation of digital identity is not ideal for many reasons, it’s a step in the right direction, and we can build from it. The flaws within the system (e.g. privacy, centralization) can be handled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Rebuilding Trust 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These technologies cannot move forward without the general public’s adoption. Organizations must rebuild trust for this to happen. Those building the framework architecture are fully aware of this challenge; the general public has lost confidence in the way organizations hold and use their online information.</p>
<p>There are many possible ways to rebuild trust. One way is to give people more control over their information. With Self-Sovereign Identity, they can choose what information they share and with whom, and they can also see how their data is being used and change their settings accordingly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another way to rebuild trust is to ensure that the technology is secure. People need to know that their information is safe when shared online. Organizations need to ensure that they use the latest security technologies, Blockchain Technology, to protect people’s information.</p>
<p>Finally, people need to know that the organizations they trust with their information are reputable and honest. Organizations need to be transparent about using people’s information and their steps to protect it, and Verifiable Credentials will facilitate this. </p>
<p>In a world where corporations and governments are constantly harvesting our data, it is more important than ever to take back control of our identities. Self-sovereign identity is a new way of thinking about identity that puts the individual in charge of their information. We should embrace it and use it to create a more just and equitable society.

Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>XR Today — “<a href="https://www.xrtoday.com/virtual-reality/the-hottest-trends-in-metaverse-technology-for-2022/">The Hottest Trends in Metaverse Technology for&nbsp;2022</a>”</p><p>“Described by some as the future of the internet, and others as the next major tech platform, the metaverse is taking the world by storm. Though definitions of the metaverse are still somewhat varied, experts agree this new landscape will help to bridge the gap between our digital and real-world identities. In other words, we’ll be closer to a computer-enhanced world than ever&nbsp;before.”</p><p>As we move into the next iteration of the internet, decentralized identity solutions and privacy preserving technology are becoming increasingly important for the secure expansion of decentralized networks. Ontology’s EVM will facilitate the creation of privacy preserving technologies within a more mainstream developer group. These developers will be able to leverage ONTO Wallet, the gateway for a seamless Web3 experience which has a base of 800K users, as well as ONT ID, Ontology’s decentralized digital identity application which reached over 1.5 million users last year.

<p>Analytics isn’t new. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/insights/artificial-intelligence">Neither is AI</a>. But the combination opens up a whole new playing field.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/05/data-science-machine-learning-business-analytics.html">Analytics</a> is the domain of processing data to derive insights. Computations are done on data, relying heavily on statistics and data science fields to identify patterns previously unseen. Analytics is very useful in business, as the insights it yields helps decision makers understand their organization and its performance. Analytics is often used to optimize marketing or product performance, better understand consumer behavior, measure employee productivity, risk of various types, or to gauge the security status of your organization.</p>
 How AI is Changing Analytics: the fundamentals 
<p>Predictive analytics exists without AI/ML too. It uses historical data to assign a probability to potential future events. Predictive models are used to generate forecasts of all types, from revenue to demand. But traditionally, our data scientists and tools only worked with limited variables and parameters, which in turn gave less accurate predictions.</p>
<p>AI, or rather machine learning (ML) gives predictive analytics a big boost. <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/discovery/predictive-analytics.html">ML for predictive analytics</a> has several advantages: it can preprocess data to clean and transform it, and extract features for a customized model that handles far more data. Through the training and validation process, the model can be checked for accuracy and continually improved.</p>
 Predictive AI: Buzzword or Game Changer? 
<p>AI is always a buzzword, but that doesn’t mean that it can’t be a game changer too.</p>
<p>One of AI/ML’s strengths is providing predictions. That is most of the tasks it performs in any implementation. An image classification model? It is predicting with 82% certainty that the image is of a tree and not a bush. Predictive analytics with ML is able to capitalize off of this design for future-oriented predictions.</p>
<p><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/ai-more-than-just-a-buzzword-845e5e320981">AI is always a buzzword</a>, but that doesn’t mean that it can’t be a game changer too. Predictions drive most business models. Predicting demand is a very traditional approach, while delivering personalized content (based on recommendations, which are predictions of what a user will want to see next) is a more modern business model. Both are able to benefit from predictive AI and analytics with heightened accuracy.</p>
 Beneficial Business Areas 
<p>Business intelligence (BI) is being strengthened with predictive analytics. Typically BI was focused only on historical data, or in rare cases on real-time data. But predictive forecasts can be overlaid on BI visualizations of historical data, for example sales of a product in a certain region, with an ML-based prediction of how sales will continue in the next period.</p>
<p>Consumer experience benefits from predictive analytics largely through recommendations (predictions of what the user wants to see next). Personalization of content has completely transformed many online experiences for users, thanks to predictive analytics.</p>
<p>Fraud detection uses predictive analytics to score the risk of events, for example an authentication attempt to a system. This risk score processes (with the help of ML) several parameters that indicate if the user is a human or a bot, and if they are malicious or just a normal consumer.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://searchbusinessanalytics.techtarget.com/feature/Top-5-predictive-analytics-use-cases-in-enterprises">many other areas that benefit</a> from predictive analytics for data-driven insights.</p>
 What Does the Future Hold? 
<p>The future is bright for AI/ML, and especially predictive analytics. But how do you and your organization get started?</p>
<p>Its easy to imagine how many organizations can get a new insight into their products, processes and IT systems with predictive analytics. But be sure to adopt a new technology solution because it fits with your organization’s digital transformation plan, not because it’s new and shiny. You can read reports like this <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/bc80791/next-generation-business-intelligence-platforms" title="Next-Generation BI Platforms">Buyer’s Compass on Next-Generation BI Platforms</a> to better understand vendors in the space.</p>

<p>Hello, Jessica.</p>
<p>Jessica Figueras: Hi, thank you so much for inviting me.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s great having you, Jessica. It’s super interesting, the conversation that we’re going to have now. So let’s talk about digital identity. And first of all, I would like to hear a bit more about yourself, if you can tell us about yourself and your journey to the world of identity.</p>
<p>Jessica: Sure. So in fact, I mean many people I found to work in the field of digital identity, it’s interesting, actually how many have a background in the telecoms industry, which is my background as well, originally. So around 20 years ago, I worked at a company called Ovum, which was at that time, the leading European tech analyst firm. And I was really focusing on how you had, for the first time, the telecoms industry converging with the mainstream IT industry. And as mobile telecoms operators started to get to grips with the consumer web, it was really clear that one interesting asset they had, mobile telcos had, was identity. And so you know, I became very interested in ways in which telcos might be able to use their knowledge of the identity of the user in different ways. And in those kinds of use case.</p>
<p>So after that, I moved away from telecoms and for the past eight years, I focused most on government technology, particularly here in the UK. And around 10 years ago, the UK government, like everyone else is looking to digitise but it became apparent that there was a very significant barrier around digital identity. Government, at that time, was very keen to where they could, to replace call centres and expensive channels with what was seen as cheaper digital channels. But it was understood that if citizens couldn’t verify their identity online then the take up of government digital services would stay low. And at the time, there were there were very, very long and complex attempts to create a cross government digital identity service, which ran into a lot of problems. So, that’s something I’ve been following with interest.</p>
<p>And of course, government isn’t just about its own digital services for citizens. Government also leads our national cyber security response, it has an important role to play in making the digital economy work as well as it can. And of course, also government is the authoritative provider of many identity credentials, you know, like passports, driving license and so forth. So, this kind of whole area is of strong interest to me and a lot of the work I do at the moment is looking at these areas where government can do more to support security and trust with digital identity.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, excellent. So, from the telco industry and nowadays more with government as you mentioned, yeah super interesting. So, looking at today, so how important is identity and identity management for any government and every – any type of organisation to establish digital trust with the users?</p>
<p>Jessica: Well, of course, it’s a crucial building block. I mean, if we look beyond digital for a moment, we can see that everyday life just doesn’t function unless there is trust there. And what I mean by that is that in society, we need a basic level of trust that people are playing by the same rules as us. Trust kind of oils the wheels of social interactions, and when it’s missing, things go wrong.</p>
<p>So, for example, if people don’t trust the police, you know, they won’t report crimes, and therefore, crime will go up. And again, people won’t pay their taxes, if they think there’s a lot of corruption there. And then kind of look at looking to, you know, everyday commerce, you won’t buy things online if you don’t trust the other party is going to fulfil their side of the bargain, or if they’re going to exploit you in some way.</p>
<p>Equally, if you’re a potential merchant or a service provider, you may well not offer services online if you think there’s a very good chance that bad actors are going to use these services in ways that expose you to risks. So, there are particular areas where both organisations and users on both sides need digital trust to be in place. These are questions such as, you know, are you who you say you are, primarily? And that links on to the question, are you entitled to be here? Are you entitled to use this service? And then there are questions again, about, are you going to do what you said you do? And, I hope also that you’re not going to do what you didn’t say you’re going to do, like, for example, exploit my personal data, or use my service in a way that exposes me to harm.</p>
<p>And trust is also about understanding that the other party is going to treat you fairly. For example, making exceptions or special provisions in areas where, I as a user have got special needs. So yeah, establishing trust is absolutely critical. And identity management is the foundation piece for all of this. It starts off with those questions, you are who you say you are, you’re entitled to be here, and it provides a level of assurance in case things go wrong that you can then kind of trace it back.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, yeah definitely, I can see the connection with identity management in digital trust, right? In both sides, that’s interesting, what you say it’s both sides, not only the end users, but the other service providers, the companies and organisations like government that provide services.</p>
<p>And you also touched that sometimes it’s possible the bad actors will have bad use of the identity and everything related to persons. So this comes to the main topic we’d like to discuss today about ethical use of identity. So we’d like to know, as you work a lot on this, what’s happening today to ensure that the ethical use of identity, so what’s happening today in the UK, as you might be working much closely and globally? So what’s happening today?</p>
<p>Jessica: Yeah, absolutely. So identity is a really interesting area because it’s a kind of focus point, I think, for ethical concerns touching quite a number of areas. And in many cases, I think these issues are quite complex. There’s not always an easy answer. It’s about finding a balance.</p>
<p>So I guess to start off with, just to kind of try to summarise some of the concerns, the ethical concerns, around digital identity and the reasons why people worry. So firstly, there’s the whole area of privacy – end user privacy. So, when we verify someone’s identity online, we potentially, not necessarily but we potentially, have the ability to build a very detailed picture of a named individual. That’s not always the case, clearly, there are many digital services which build detailed pictures of users’ activity online, but without necessarily being able to map it to a real world identity.</p>
<p>When we verify someone’s identity, again, we’re talking about specific person here. Now, if you start to link that real world identity to their usage of your services, whether those are government services, financial services, what they’re buying online, websites they’re looking at, perhaps you start to join up the data you have with data from elsewhere. What you then have is potentially a wealth of data about a named individual, which could be used in many ways, some of which may be extremely unethical. These kind of very detailed profiles, they could be used as a tool of social control in a sinister way by governments or private organisations equally.</p>
<p>And if you look at the concerns generally today around surveillance, around too much power in the hands of tech companies, which citizens cannot hold accountable, we certainly see what happens when authoritarian regimes start to collect very detailed data on their citizens’ activities, just how kind of troubling this area is. So this is this is the first area where we need to be ethically aware. When we verify someone’s identity, what are we then going to do with that data?</p>
<p>And the second area is around the whole area of bias. Here, this goes back to the role of identity verification as a gateway to access services. The idea is there are many digital services which are sensitive in different ways, they expose the provider to significant risk of fraud, for example, cyber security. And, of course, there are those questions about needing to check the entitlements of the user.</p>
<p>So this is why identity verification is around gatekeeping, you know, are you who you say you are? And are you entitled to be here? Now, that’s fine. But where bias can creep in is that if there are unreasonable assumptions made about how that gatekeeping should work. What that could mean is that certain groups of users could be systematically denied access to services on basises which are very unfair. So, you know, and here is where we have the concerns around digital exclusion. And there are lots of different facets to this. We can think about people who are excluded for different reasons. There is a lot of concern around a kind of cluster of characteristics to do with poverty, old age in particular, education, people who are less digitally literate, people with an irregular immigration status, or perhaps people who are homeless or no fixed address.</p>
<p>And characteristics like this, you tend to find that people in these groups are much less likely to have the credentials that they need to verify their identity. They may not have a bank account, they may not have a fixed address, no passport, no driving license, no credit record. And then you have the challenges around the user’s actual ability to use the service. And typically, you might find this with older age groups or people with learning disabilities, who simply don’t have the digital skills or find it very kind of hard to navigate services which can be very complex. And then you have other kinds of potential bias as.</p>
<p>So for example, it is quite well known that at least some of the algorithms which are used to verify people’s identity against a photograph have a real problem with skin colour. So, people with darker skin are much more likely to be rejected and that’s a real problem. Particularly then when you bring in things like facial recognition in biometrics for security purposes. That’s really kind of quite troubling there because you may well be involving a kind of law enforcement element on the basis of a technology which is treating people differently on the basis of their skin colour. So, you know, there are lots and lots of different ways that bias can creep in, and work in quite an insidious way with identity verification to lock certain types of people out.</p>
<p>So here we have, you know, kind of two kind of broad categories of ethical difficulties, one around privacy, and the other around bias. So, in terms of what’s happening, I would say that both of these issues, you know, there is a lot of awareness about them. And these are areas of interest for many civil society groups. We have some codes of conduct out there, which are kind of voluntary. There’s one, for example, a group called <a href="https://www.womeninidentity.org/cpages/home">Women in Identity</a> has one which covers bias, which is good. There are some voluntary code of conducts around biometrics. So, for example, the <a href="https://www.biometricsinstitute.org/">Biometrics Institute</a> has one, here in the UK, the law enforcement are starting to go down that route as well.</p>
<p>And the UK Government is also developing a trust framework, which is really interesting. And the idea is that this will be something that companies which provide digital identity services will be able to accredit that service against the trust framework, which should cover issues such as these. So that’s certainly very encouraging.</p>
<p>One thing I would say, though, is that I think it’s – so far, civil society, like I’ve said, it’s certainly waking up to potential issues with the way that identity is used. It’s a particular parts of civil society have taken an interest more than others. I think that’s a potential issue.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thank you for that overview. It’s very interesting about the many aspects of the ethical use of identity. And now, ultimately who’s the responsibility to ensure that ethical use of identity? Is it government regulation – regulation is that’s part of the job? Or, is it organisations are the ones who build the services? So what would you say? Whose responsibility is it?</p>
<p>Jessica: It’s everyone’s responsibility. This is a question about the kind of society we want to live in. There are so many different questions here – some which are about ease of use and accessibility of digital services. Others are about how we balance different good things that we might want. We all want security, we all want privacy as well. And, you know, balancing these different kind of good things is something that everyone needs to get involved in.</p>
<p>Certainly, there are lots of areas where government really does need to step into lead. And these, typically, are in areas where kind of technical standards are required. Interoperability, of course, is key. And interoperability if we can build that on the basis of high standards then we can avoid the problem of having a race to the bottom as they say, where providers look to compete on having the kind of easiest and cheapest digital identity service, which is something we want to avoid.</p>
<p>So yeah, so government is I think, starting to lead now in digital identity, which is good, and they are starting to put in place some solutions, such as the trust framework I mentioned. But yeah, I did want to say more I think about civil society’s role here. There certainly is a response from civil society. I mean, we see, for example, that there are quite a few kind of think tanks who are interested in this, particularly looking at the international angle. So, for example, the Omidyar Network had a program called Good ID, which has been taken on I think, by <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/story/2021-11/incorporating-good-id">Harvard</a> now. The <a href="https://institute.global/">Tony Blair Institute</a> also has a programme looking at how digital identity is developing in different countries and what are some of the different issues, and how would they balance some of these different factors. So that’s good.</p>
<p>I think that what we haven’t seen in civil societies, we haven’t seen the breadth and depth of voices, the diversity of voices, actually, that we need to see involved in this debate. I’m starting to see much more participation by groups which are interested in bias, which is really, really good. I think I would like to see a lot more contribution from those who represent the digitally excluded. You know, the elderly, people who are less educated, people with learning disabilities, people who are poor, homeless, don’t have credentials.</p>
<p>These are the kind of people who are worst represented generally in society. They tend to not be at the table, they don’t work in the tech industry. They don’t take part in conversations like you and I are having now. And so, groups which represent these people, they really, really need to step up and take part because it’s not until we hear both sides that we start to understand how we balance these important social goods.</p>
<p>Now, to give you an example about where this has actually worked is in the field of child safety online. So, we have seen, unfortunately, over the last, you know, 10, 10, 15 years, an absolutely massive growth in the rise of online child exploitation, which is really kind of quite appalling. And has become a really, really major, perhaps even the major part of the work of law enforcement working in this area. They have to consider the digital element.</p>
<p>Now, the fact is, is that if you’re going to protect children online, around social media when they’re interacting online, then part of the solution to that is almost inevitably going to be constraints and limitations around anonymity. And these are some of the debates that we’re having now in society. And, one thing that I think that has worked there is that NSPCC, which is I think the largest British children’s charity with a background that goes back, it’s sort of legacy spans a couple of 100 years, I think. The NSPCC has really taken up this as a huge part of its mission now to kind of go and fight on behalf of children exploited online.</p>
<p>And so they’ve brought some real diversity to this debate. And they make sure that whenever we’re talking about things like encryption or digital identity or anonymity online, we don’t forget that protecting children is an important and legitimate use case, because otherwise, these things do tend to get forgotten. It’s everyone’s responsibility. And I would like to see a lot more diversity of voices at the table, I think discussing these important issues.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I couldn’t agree more. And it’s much wider than we normally hear, right? As you said, we work in the tech industry, I hear some of the voices that are already showing this concern about the ethical use of identity. But many of the ones you just said, we rarely hear about that. And there are people who are much less connected than us, as you say, they are not listened to this podcast or similar places where they can be informed or have a voice. So yeah.</p>
<p>Jessica: Yeah, for sure. And it’s difficult because I think many people in the tech industry are starting to wake up and become aware now and looking to be educated. And I think it’s often hard to know where to start.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly, exactly. Excellent to know all this based on your extensive work and research on all the aspects that relate to ethical use of identity. And now, looking at the organisations, both private and public, so how can organisations continue to protect themselves? Because something has to be done to protect themselves, while at the same time being on the right side of these ethical minefield.</p>
<p>Jessica: Yeah, it really is, it’s very challenging. And I think it’s particularly challenging for organisations that may be looking to develop their own solutions in this, which some still do. So I think, you know, first question, so, OK, organisations fundamentally should be aware that digital identity is an area where they need to carry out some assurance. And so, some questions to think about when you’re doing that assurance…</p>
<p>First of all, you need to know where in your organisation you need to verify people’s identities and how that gets done today. Typically, it falls into two categories, doesn’t it? Your own employees, and then your customers and partners. Of course, with customers and partners, some customers may be individuals, they may be businesses with individuals as well, some of identity verification is kind of quite complex.</p>
<p>So, the second thing is, you need to understand is, what are the purpose? Why are you needing to verify identity? And you need to really fully understand the risk you’re trying to mitigate and whether you’re providing the right level of assurance to mitigate it. If it’s too high, if you’re kind of putting in place too much friction that could make it harder for your customers to interact with you. And it also could worsen problems around inequality of access, like we’ve talked about. But of course, if you don’t put enough controls in, you’re opening yourselves up, of course, to all sorts of forms of cybercrime, and all sorts of risks.</p>
<p>So then you need to think about what is it that you’re trying to verify here? What attributes? Now, for the vast majority of organisations, this will be name, address, possibly the organisation you’re associated with. For some services, particularly public services, it may well be your entitlement, questions about for example, your immigration status. And if you think, some services, health related services, increasingly sensitive data. So for example, if you think of the COVID app there, you know, that’s your entitlement to go to a concert or something based on data about your vaccine status.</p>
<p>Now, on top of this, there are also services which are at particular risk of fraud, so it tends to be financial related services, where they’re regulated. They have a regulatory requirement to carry out additional checks. Now, these services are interesting, because as well as identity checks when you first sign up during on boarding, they often will lay on additional checks while you use the service to make sure you’re still the person you say you are. And here, you’re bringing in much more complex background data, often without necessarily the explicit knowledge of the user around for example, what is your device, your location, your behaviour? Is the person using the service, are they the same person who signed up in the first place?</p>
<p>OK, so then you need to think about, based on what attributes you’re trying to verify, what are the credentials you’re using to verify this individual? And what are the implications of that? You need to think about what you’re asking for. Now, in your target user group, can everyone in that user group, do they have those credentials? Can they prove themselves? Now, if they can’t, what are the implications of that? Who is excluded? This is when we start to think about, you know, what groups are being systematically excluded here. There are always going to be individuals with particular needs. But if there’s a kind of big group, we need to be concerned about that.</p>
<p>And of course, we also need to think, on the flip side, are the credentials you’re asking for, are they going to be enough? Who can get those? If anyone can get those credentials easily, you know, if you can steal something from someone’s bin, steal a document from someone’s bin. Well, you know, you need to think about that as well.</p>
<p>And last but absolutely not least, a really, really critical part of assurance now, of course, is your suppliers, you need to vet your suppliers. You need to ask questions about their own cyber security posture. Government is becoming much more demanding on this front now. You need to ask how they protect users’ data. And, of course, how they mitigate against bias and the problems we’ve talked about.</p>
<p>As I said originally, if you, as an organisation, if your own developers are creating an identity verification solution, you need actually to ask even more questions. Because we need to remember that in-house teams, unless they are specialists in building identity solutions, they’re often not going to have either the resource or the expertise to do this well. So yeah, so important to think about that too.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, in the end, it’s asking a lot of questions to a lot of people I believe, that’s the moral of this, asking a lot of questions and to a lot of people. So when designing the services, you mentioned developers of course, they are part of that, what are their roles, the persons who should be asking these questions or leading this work?</p>
<p>Jessica: These are basic governance questions. So, depending on how large the organisation is, they may well have risk owners. Senior executives who are running the parts of the business, which the identity solution is going to be aligned with, they absolutely need to be on board. And, in many cases where this is a kind of novel use, it may well be that the board needs to have visibility over this. This is an important dimension of risk management generally. And I think this is one area where senior staff certainly need to increase their awareness of the issues.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, yeah, definitely. Yeah, and it’s clear that it’s, as you said very early in our conversation, the balance is quite hard to achieve, but of course, has to be the ultimate goal. Jessica, finally, one question, for all business leaders listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Jessica: It’s an idea that I call digital native risk. And these are forms of risk, which are native to digital, they’re not necessarily kind of old risks which have now developed an online aspect. And I think, the fundamental idea is, business leaders need to think about digital native risk, and how they’re going to fill those gaps in their understanding, where are the weaknesses in your risk radar?</p>
<p>Risk management, it’s been a board level responsibility for a long time. And organisations in some sectors have a mature culture around risk management. I’m thinking particularly, for example, very safety critical industries, like the nuclear industry, and financial services, pretty mature in risk management. But as I say, there are new forms of risk now coming thick and fast, which are kind of quite new. And they fundamentally come from the very rapid adoption of digital in every area now of business in a way that has actually created a kind of dependency, a reliance which may well really undermine basic business resilience.</p>
<p>Many organisations have spent the last 20 years removing redundancy in their operations. They’ve removed manual processes. And we only have to look at what’s happening now in Ukraine and Russia to ask questions about well, just how long could a business operate with no internet access? We can add to that forms of risk, of course, around cyber security, how the rise of ransomware during the pandemic has really made that top of mind.</p>
<p>Cybercrime is spiralling in every developed country, particularly economic crime, lots and lots of new novel forms of fraud, insider threat as well is top of mind for financial services. And then of course, there’s that whole piece around the unintended consequences of innovative digital services. So we’ve talked today about ethics and issues such as, for example, how the rise of social media created a real problem around online child exploitation. Many, many innovative services, they do have unintended consequences, that’s just a fact of life.</p>
<p>And I think that business leaders, particularly at board level, they really now need to start kind of building this in right from the start. It’s not about becoming incredibly risk averse, I think it’s just about planning right from the start about how you’re going to, as I say, kind of fill the gaps in your understanding. So the way that we develop our understanding of digital native risk, it needs to evolve and get better.</p>
<p>And as I said before, I think our failure to anticipate the scale of online harms, I think many people feel that it’s lack of diversity was at the root of that. The fact that technological innovation has been driven by such a narrow demographic of people. Of course the stereotype is you’re talking about white men in Western developed countries, particularly the US, who tend to be disproportionately young, disproportionately highly educated, and probably have no children yet. We really, really need to think about broadening our awareness of the environment.</p>
<p>And one thing I’m seeing, which is interesting now, is that those organisations which find themselves under attack, which find themselves particularly subject to these forms of digital native risk, increasingly, they’re finding that they’re needing to share much more information between themselves, often their competitors, bringing in government, law enforcement, academia, the private sector, their technology suppliers, and the importance of collaboration. As I said before, I feel these issues are just too important to leave to business as usual. These issues are everyone’s responsibility to fix and I think that if we can get this kind of collaboration and open discussion, diversity of voices around the table, I think we have a good chance of moving forward in a positive way.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thank you. Thank you so much for this conversation. Jessica. Please tell us how people would like to get in touch with you.</p>

And lastly, are we seeing the dawn of a new age of digital monopolies?</p> <p>In this chaotic landscape, a rational and steady approach to understanding is always a winner.&nbsp;</p> <p>------ 📣 ZERION | Trade Across 7 Networks and 500+ protocols <a href="https://bankless.cc/Zerion">https://bankless.cc/Zerion</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ 🚀 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;  🎙️ SUBSCRIBE TO PODCAST: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://podcast.banklesshq.com/">http://podcast.banklesshq.com/&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:&nbsp;</p> <p>👀 POLYGON | LAYER &nbsp;2 DEFI <a href="https://bankless.cc/Polygon">https://bankless.cc/Polygon</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>❎ ACROSS | BRIDGE TO LAYER 2 <a href="https://bankless.cc/Across">https://bankless.cc/Across</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>🦊 METAMASK | THE CRYPTO WALLET <a href="https://bankless.cc/metamask">https://bankless.cc/metamask</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>💳 LEDGER | THE CRYPTO LIFE CARD <a href="https://bankless.cc/Ledger">https://bankless.cc/Ledger</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>🧙‍♂️ ALCHEMIX | SELF REPAYING LOANS <a href="https://bankless.cc/Alchemix">https://bankless.cc/Alchemix</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>🦄 UNISWAP | DECENTRALIZED FUNDING <a href="https://bankless.cc/UniGrants">https://bankless.cc/UniGrants</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ Topics Covered:</p> <p>0:00 Intro 8:00 Panelists 12:03 What CryptoPunks Want 16:44 Brand Management 22:01 Applebees 26:52 Creative Commons License 32:00 Best Rights Strategies 40:00 ApeCoin Launch 46:20 Is $APE Overvalued? 54:58 Yuga Labs Deck 1:00:52 Financials vs Monopolies 1:04:31 $450 Million Raise 1:06:45 Panelist Projects 1:10:00 Closing &amp; Disclaimers</p> <p>------ Resources:</p> <p>Scott Lewis: <a href="https://twitter.com/scott_lew_is?s=20&amp;t=kXCI6sgHk2MMkG_PZKekSQ"> https://twitter.com/scott_lew_is?s=20&amp;t=kXCI6sgHk2MMkG_PZKekSQ</a>&nbsp;  Zeneca_33: <a href="https://twitter.com/Zeneca_33?s=20&amp;t=kXCI6sgHk2MMkG_PZKekSQ">https://twitter.com/Zeneca_33?s=20&amp;t=kXCI6sgHk2MMkG_PZKekSQ</a>&nbsp;  Andy8052: <a href="https://twitter.com/andy8052?s=20&amp;t=kXCI6sgHk2MMkG_PZKekSQ">https://twitter.com/andy8052?s=20&amp;t=kXCI6sgHk2MMkG_PZKekSQ</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>----- Not financial or tax advice.

 Zero trust promises better security in a highly interconnected world, but many of the tenets of zero trust are contradictory to entrenched practices and ideas. Getting beyond MFA into a true zero trust environment isn't an incremental change, it's a radical restructuring of how resources are secured and accessed. 
 
 
 Encrypt everything - True end to end encryption means that data packets can't be inspected for malware in between the source and destination. Are your endpoints ready? Can your policies adapt? 
 Micro-segmentation - Preventing lateral movement of an attacker requires breaking up the smooth flow of data across a network. But segmentation is inherently inefficient. Is your network able to meet the need for speed? 
 Deny all by default - Users are all in favor of security, until it impacts their ability to work. If access is denied by default, do you have processes in place to quickly approve access when needed? Are the users (including those in the c-suite) on board? 
 Continuous authorization - Using trust scores works well in white papers, but do you know what the rules governing access to your resources really are? Does your IT department have the authority to drop a user mid-transaction because of a change in their trust score? Have you decided what your risk tolerance is?

<p>È stato presentato al “CLUSIT Security Summit”, svoltosi dal 15 al 17 marzo, il libro dal titolo: “Rischio digitale Innovazione e Resilienza – Conoscere, affrontare e mitigare il rischio digitale”. L’opera è frutto della collaborazione di numerosi autori, specialisti del settore, membri della comunità accademica e scientifica, manager esperti e professionisti di Information Security ed ha l’obiettivo di conoscere, affrontare e mitigare il rischio digitale. Fra di essi anche Giovanni Belluzzo – Head of Cyber Security &amp; Management System di InfoCert, il quale ha collaborato nella stesura degli articoli relativi a Perimetro Sicurezza Nazionale Cibernetica, al Framework NIST ed al Framework Nazionale Cyber Security.</p>

<p>Con rischio digitale si intende quella tipologia di rischio a cui sono esposti dati e servizi digitalizzati e che generalmente è la conseguenza dell’utilizzo delle nuove tecnologie. Il testo offre una panoramica su temi come l’analisi del rischio digitale, la quale assume un’importanza prioritaria in una società nella quale le minacce di cybersecurity sono considerate ormai in cima alla lista dei rischi d’impresa. Fra le attività cardine che il libro suggerisce di adottare, vi sono la mappatura dei processi, l’analisi del contesto e dei rischi, l’identificazione dei controlli di mitigazione definiti nei framework di riferimento e la realizzazione del piano di trattamento del rischio.</p>



<p>Questa pubblicazione nasce allo scopo di richiamare l’attenzione sulla corretta gestione del rischio digitale in tutte le organizzazioni, pubbliche e private, spesso connotate da una peculiarità di interconnessioni con soggetti diversi. Oggi, le PA giocano un ruolo fondamentale per lo sviluppo della società, per il rilancio economico e sociale del paese e per la realizzazione di nuovi progetti e investimenti anche collegati al PNRR. La diffusione della cultura della sicurezza al livello dei vertici e l’adozione all’interno delle PA di processi governati e integrati di gestione del rischio e della sicurezza digitale possono contribuire in modo fondamentale al raggiungimento degli obiettivi a cui sono chiamate le pubbliche amministrazioni nell’interesse primario del singolo cittadino. Nel comparto privato, invece, al di là della dimensione, è necessario evitare di considerare i dati e la tecnologia solo come meri strumenti per incrementare i propri introiti: essi devono essere valutati e gestiti sistematicamente e in modo sicuro così da sfruttarne ogni beneficio senza ledere gli interessi degli stakeholder.</p>



<p>Il libro è un’utile lettura per le figure con responsabilità più operative e di supporto al vertice, per esempio CIO, CISO, Risk manager, IT risk manager, i Data protection officer e, nell’ambito pubblico, i Responsabili per la transizione al digitale, ma anche il CEO e CFO, in breve tutti coloro che possono sviluppare la consapevolezza sul tema affinché la gestione del rischio sia correttamente affrontata.</p>



<p>Questa è la tredicesima pubblicazione della Clusit Community for Security, una community i cui componenti, nonché autori del libro e dei contenuti del blog, svolgono un costante lavoro di preparazione tramite un confronto multidisciplinare e multisettoriale, sono accomunati da una forte consapevolezza del grande bisogno di sicurezza e compliance delle organizzazioni italiane, oltre ad un un forte senso di responsabilità verso la nostra società.</p>

<p>Bob Schukai, Mastercard’s Executive Vice President of Technology Development, New Digital Infrastructure &amp; Fintech, lays out the Mastercard philosophy around protection of consumer data:</p>
<p>“Strong connectivity is important; however we also know that handling people’s data is an enormous responsibility. We have an obligation to keep our customers’ data secure and we set out <a href="https://www.mastercard.us/en-us/vision/corp-responsibility/data-responsibility.html">four simple principles</a>&nbsp;for the use of data. Consumers own the data they produce every day — and have the right to understand and control how it is shared and used. Ultimately, consumer data should be used to make their lives easier.</p>
<p>If you are building a fintech that is innovating with consumer data, it’s critical to clearly outline a set of privacy standards and data management practices up front. Protect that data using an appropriate set of privacy-enhancing technologies to back your claims. Treat the data of your users as if it was your own.”</p>

<p>KILT identity blockchain for issuing decentralized credentials will enhance Authtrail’s data integrity for enterprise</p><p>22 March 2022, Malta and Berlin — Authtrail and B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH (BTE), a developer of applications for KILT Protocol, announced plans to integrate KILT DIDs into the Authtrail platform to improve its trustworthiness and transparent data flows. Authtrail is a complete SaaS platform bringing blockchain-based integrity to enterprise data and is powered by Moonbeam, which like KILT is part of the Polkadot ecosystem.</p><p>To ensure data provenance throughout the enterprise value chain, digital identities composed of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials using KILT will be integrated into the data sources Authtrail works&nbsp;with.</p> In data we&nbsp;trust <p>Historically, trust is something that existed primarily in the physical universe. Personal data is upgraded with credentials (passports, driver’s licenses, educational certificates) that are typically managed and monetized by centralized Web2 institutions and&nbsp;systems.</p><p>KILT is a decentralized blockchain protocol for issuing verifiable, revocable, and anonymous credentials and DIDs for Web3. Building on KILT brings trust to the digital world by creating a framework for self-sovereign online identities. Developers can use KILT to create identifiers and credentials for humans, machines, services, IoT use cases, and anything that needs identity.</p> Data provenance through&nbsp;DIDs <p>KILT Protocol’s translation of real-life identity credentials to a digital realm offers Authtrail an additional level of veracity and traceability of the data. Authtrail’s enterprise clients have systems, organizations and employees that would need DIDs. These would be created via the Authtrail application using DIDsign, streamlining the onboarding process for large enterprises since no knowledge of blockchain or DIDs is needed by the end&nbsp;user.</p><p>With <a href="http://didsign.io/">DIDsign</a>, an application built on KILT by BTE, a hash for the data could be linked with a DID to form a signature. The KILT blockchain would not store the signature on-chain, but only the&nbsp;DID.</p><p>Authtrail currently provides immutability of data aggregated within its platform, and with DIDsign it could now ensure accountability before data is written to the blockchain. If the anchored data is later altered, the signature and the altered data would no longer match and therefore changes to the data could be easily detected.</p><p>“We are excited to work with BTE to integrate DIDs using KILT Protocol. By employing DIDsign, we can procure more value for enterprise customers who want to innovate their identity systems without compromising the security of personal or organizational data in their environment,” said Authtrail CEO, Matjaž&nbsp;Sobočan.</p><p>“Both Authtrail and KILT Protocol are bringing Web3 solutions to enterprises and end-users that will drive blockchain adoption in the real world. Collaborating with Authtrail, an expert in enterprise data management, will drive higher trust at a lower cost deeper into organizations,” said Ingo Rübe, founder of KILT Protocol and CEO of B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity&nbsp;GmbH.</p> About Authtrail <p>Authtrail platform tackles data integrity issues in digitized enterprises and organizations through advanced blockchain technology and high operational scalability.</p><p>With Authtrail, companies can embrace a new competitive edge. While continuing their business as usual, they show they can be trusted and collaborated with, can easily access relevant and verified data internally, and help end-users, auditors, and/or regulators to gain trust in their data. Ultimately, more efficient business operations result in increased productivity while minimizing the cost of internal data management.</p><p>Reach Authtrail on:</p><p><a href="https://t.me/Authtrail">Telegram </a>| <a href="https://twitter.com/authtrail">Twitter</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://authtrail.com/">Website</a></p> About B.T.E BOTLabs Trusted Entity&nbsp;GmbH <p>B.T.E.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>I firmly believe that one of the key success factors of a product strategy in any industry is to be able to offer customers just the right amount of choice. Looking back at the history of such companies as Ford, Kodak, IKEA, or Apple, we can see that their success was to a large extent in their ability to sell not just a product, but an entire lifestyle, a single, convenient solution for all their customers’ problems, whether real or just invented by marketing departments. Of course, this approach does not work every time, as the eventual fate of Kodak indicates. Customer requirements, just like technology, fashion and other societal factors, change all the time, and the product ecosystems have to adapt or risk extinction…</p>
<p>In a sense, Oracle is undergoing a similar transformation now, as the company is reinventing itself as a <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/oracle-delivers-on-earlier-cloud-promises">major player</a> in the cloud service provider market. This has naturally required major changes in Oracle’s strategy, transitioning from the old “hermetic” way towards open, mutually beneficial partnerships with other vendors and even direct competitors like Microsoft Azure. The most obvious sign of this change, as we have mentioned many times before, is the idea that instead of catching up with competitors on their established playing fields (for example, trying to offer cheaper infrastructure than AWS), Oracle should focus on its unique services that no other competitor can offer, like the Autonomous Database, and promote efficient and convenient multi-cloud architectures through 3rd party integrations.</p>
<p>Essentially, whenever a customer is facing a supposed dichotomy, having to choose between a solution from Oracle or from a competitor, the company’s answer now boils down to a well-known meme: <a href="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/538/731/0fc.gif">why not both</a>? Practical examples of this strategy can be seen in supporting direct interconnects between Oracle and Azure cloud datacenters in many regions or even in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/new-heatwave-is-coming">making MySQL HeatWave a first-class open source alternative</a> to Oracle’s own database even for enterprise use cases.</p>
<p>Basically, we can see a major transformation in the market of cloud services, both for data management and in general. Before, customers had to make fundamental choices before starting a new project, such as selecting the underlying database layer: should they opt for the universal approach with Oracle Database or choose the broad range of specialized engines from AWS. This choice has effectively robbed them from most of the future flexibility, should something go wrong and the initial selection prove to be suboptimal.</p>
<p>Nowadays, customers are free to use Oracle’s database services but, say, connect them to applications running on Microsoft Azure and AI services from GCP. And, of course, these services are expected to be truly and independently elastic to accommodate for unexpected changes in demand and to minimize operational costs for customers. This is what I call the right freedom of choice that underlines the real modern “multi-cloud native” approach.</p>
<p>However, Oracle does not stop there and in a sense, adopts the same strategy even within its own product ecosystem. The latest example of this I can see in the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/multiple-vm-autonomous-database-on-exadata-cloud-at-customer-2022-03-16/">recent announcement of Multi-VM Autonomous Database</a> on Exadata Cloud@Customer, Oracle’s private cloud platform. Even if it sounds too technical at first sight, it is really all about giving customers real choice of running both the Exadata Database Service and Autonomous Database Service simultaneously on the same hardware deployed in their data centers and managed by Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).</p>
<p>Previously, customers of Oracle’s managed private cloud platform were able to choose whether they wanted to run the traditional, enterprise-proven databases on a particular Exadata Cloud@Customer system for their business-critical applications or instead opt for the fully managed, self-tuning Autonomous Database instances, favored by modern developers on a separate Exadata Cloud@Customer system. They had to make a choice once and then stick to it for the whole lifecycle of the platform.</p>
<p>Now they can have both. Thanks to the improvements in the underlying management platform, customers can create multiple clusters of virtual machines on the same Exadata Cloud@Customer infrastructure and then configure each cluster for the type of database service that they need independently. This is implemented as a set of self-service workflows that can be delegated to different roles, such as developers, application DBAs and DB fleet managers.</p>
<p>From a security and governance perspective, the role of fleet managers is particularly interesting and has a follow-on positive impact on developers. The fleet manager defines the runtime environment isolation and SLAs at the cluster level, according to corporate governance best practices, and then gives each developer or operational team visibility into a subset of environments along with access controls and quotas that limit the resources they consume.</p>
<p>Exadata Cloud@Customer’s built-in security helps secure the actual databases, but it’s up to the fleet administrator to ensure that corporate governance is defined for each environment – functional governance like defining backup retention policies, failover capabilities, update scheduling, and where data is stored throughout its lifecycle in order to meet data residency requirements. Operational governance like separation of dev-test from production, secure isolation between application teams, and mission-critical workload separation are also managed by them.</p>
<p>As a result, individual developers and application DBAs no longer have to think about security and governance requirements, and they can just take the operating environments given to them and do whatever they need within their assigned quotas, increasing their personal productivity.</p>
<p>However, for organizations as a whole, the governance and compliance benefits of this approach are also obvious. Instead of having to manage multiple disconnected development, test, and staging environments separately from production instances, now companies using Exadata Cloud@Customer can benefit from applying the same policies across all their data and at the same time significantly reducing the administrative effort and data friction between organizational units. Another win for “Why not both” indeed!</p>

             March 2022   
	 
		 
			 US and EU Regulators Move to Embrace Blockchain Technology 
<p>This month, we are traveling to Miami, New York, and San Francisco for business meetings and events. Our partner Inveniam organized an impressive conference where mayors from Miami and New York spoke and embraced blockchain technology.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our CEO Luc and CCO Daniel were honored to speak on three panels to share our knowledge and experience on asset tokenization. In conversations with attendees and speakers, the topic of regulation kept coming up in light of recent regulatory developments in the U.S. and EU:</p>
 
 US’s Digital Asset EO: on March 9, the White House signed an executive order (EO) on digital assets, representing a turning point in the acceptance and recognition of digital assets by the government. 
 EU’s MiCA: on March 14, the European Parliament’s ECON Committee passed Marketplace for Crypto Assets (MiCA) draft legislation, refusing to ban the Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism, which was a relief for all European players. 
 
<p>What are our thoughts on the current state of regulation in Europe and the US regarding tokenization?</p>
 
 Issuance:&nbsp;The EU has progressed well on recognizing that blockchain-based financial instruments as securities, especially in Luxembourg, where we are based, providing the regulatory clarity for native issuance of assets on blockchain. 
 Liquidity:&nbsp;The US regulators FINRA and SEC, have approved several ATS for tokenized securities (e.g. Rialto, Oasis Pro Markets, Texture Capital, …), giving participants faster access to liquidity, whereas the EU has a complicated CSD regulation that makes access to liquidity expensive and slower. Consequently, our&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-billboard/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9ZXIO-zmf7NU4VP2ZLO5zZNwT4Cdl1_ouCEj8CeyezSpSiL2UfG8GZHq-EtSg0Js0DImXe">Billboard</a>&nbsp;solution was designed to provide European players with a license-free liquidity solution.

 Identity platform IDnow expands Digital Identities and Trust Services division 
<p>Munich, March 22nd 2022: IDnow, one of the leading European providers in the field of digital identities and identity verification, has appointed Johannes Leser as the new VP Trust Services.</p>
<p>Leser’s primary responsibilities at IDnow will be the expansion of the Trust Services unit as well as the management of a new German trust service.</p>
<p>The company, headquartered in Munich and with five additional European locations, is announcing plans to build a Qualified Trust Service Provider (QTSP) as part of the appointment of Johannes Leser. In the area of digital wallets to prove identity, QTSPs play a central role. Within these digital wallets, users and citizens can link their national digital identity (which is also known as their ‘basic identity’) with digital proofs of other personal attributes such as their driver’s license, degree certificates or bank account. The authenticity of these attributes must be confirmed by a specially certified provider of qualified trust services. With the appointment of Johannes Leser and the plans to build a QTSP, IDnow will further expand its service offering around digital identities and wallets.</p>
<p>In his new role, Johannes Leser will bring extensive experience in qualified trust services and digital transaction management to the organisation. Four years ago, he founded Namirial Germany, the German subsidiary of one of the largest providers of trust services on the European market. For more than a decade, he has been involved with the trustworthy integration of electronic signatures into digital processes.</p>
<p>Johannes Leser commented: “I am looking forward to building a provider for qualified trust services with IDnow. Among other challenges, we will solve the issues of how qualified attributes interact with wallets in proving digital identities.”</p>
<p>Armin Bauer, CTO and Managing Director at IDnow, added: “This is an important step in the digital identities space for IDnow. By building our own QTSP, we can not only verify and store digital identities, but also attest additional electronic attributes. Johannes Leser brings the ideal experience to make this initiative a success and I look forward to working with him.”</p>

Ethereum, the first blockchain to adopt the smart contract to its blockchain structure, has revolutionized the current blockchain industry with bringing a new concept of financial innovations such as ICO, DeFi, NFTs and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>However, most of the blockchain projects, including Ethereum, the 3rd generation blockchain projects and even private blockchain projects, have been failed to be tailored in the real financial world. There are many reasons why the current conventional blockchains don’t work with the real world’s financial environment, but the most important key of the mass adoption is that avoiding anonymity and making possible parallel transaction executions.</p><p>In this Live Webinar, Don Tapscott, Executive Chairman of the Blockchain Research Institute, will host the webinar and our CEO Phantom Seokgu Yun. They will discuss how the real blockchain work with the current financial infrastructure and how MetaMUI Blockchain has revolutionized the blockchain industry into the new era of a real working blockchain in the real&nbsp;world.</p><p>Registration Link:<br><a href="https://t.co/qBV2sk7m9S">https://t.co/qBV2sk7m9S</a></p>Don Tapscott / Executive Chairman of Blockchain Research Institute Don Tapscott <p>Don Tapscott is one of the world’s leading authorities on the impact of technology on business and society having authored 16 widely read books. He has coined many concepts that are part of the business lexicon today and is sought by corporate and government leaders globally. He is currently Co-Founder &amp; Executive Chairman of the Blockchain Research Institute, an Adjunct Professor at INSEAD, recently a two-term Chancellor of Trent University in Ontario and Member of The Order of&nbsp;Canada.</p>Phantom Seokgu Yun / CEO of Sovereign Wallet Network &amp; Project Lead of&nbsp;MetaMUI Phantom Seokgu&nbsp;Yun <p>A pioneer of digital currency and distributed systems since 1992, Phantom Seokgu Yun is the CEO and Chief Scientist of Sovereign Wallet Network and SWN Global. He is a South Korean national with over 25 years of experience in cryptography, algorithms, and security architectures. He has provided security solutions to DAVOS and G20 summits, LG, Samsung, Yahoo, and eBay, among other multi-national corporations. Following his professional achievements and academic research at Korea Advanced Institute of Technology and the University of Southern California, Phantom founded Sovereign Wallet, the precursor to Sovereign Wallet Network and SWN Global. He currently leads the MetaMUI Platform, a CBDC and NFT specialized blockchain.</p> About MetaMUI <p>MetaMUI is the world’s 1st Identity-based blockchain to truly enable regulated Peer_to_Peer (P2P) transactions. It can be used as the cornerstone for most financial offerings, with its high versatility and support for custom-developed use cases that enable Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) implementation and issuance easily on the MetaMUI CBDC platform.<br>MetaMUI is built around Self-Sovereign Identity (SSID) technology. By combining the SSID and blockchain token mechanism, MetaMUI was able to create a new identity-based CBDC system that can protect user’s privacy while providing an identity-based transfer system that can satisfy travel rules and other regulatory requirements such as Know your customer (KYC), Anti-money laundering (AML) and Counter Financing of Terrorism (CFT).</p><p><a href="https://sovereignwallet.network/">Website</a>/<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/metamui/">Linkedin</a>/<a href="https://twitter.com/MUIcommunity">Twitter</a>/<a href="https://t.me/muicommunity">Telegram</a>/<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SWNGlobal">Youtube</a>/<a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/">Medium</a></p>

<p>Impervious Technologies Inc. (<a href="https://impervious.ai">impervious.ai)</a></p><p>3.21.2022</p><p>Abstract</p><p>Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are user-controlled, can be globally persistent and are generated or registered cryptographically. A DID consists of a Uniform Resource Identifier specified in and used to resolve a DID document. An entity with write-privileges called a controller inputs the specifications describing a DID subject into a DID document. The DID Specification enables a controller to improve DID resiliency by listing multiple service endpoints and transport pathways. These specifications and their resulting resilience form the basis of DIDCommunications (DIDComm).</p><p>DIDComm offers communication options regardless of protocol or transport layer, enabling users to communicate without hosting their own listening servers online. DIDComm mediators act as relays that receive an onion-encrypted message from a sender (or another previous mediator in a chain) and pass this message on to another party. Relays are transport agnostic and can be used with any desired transport layer, including Lightning, HTTP, TOR, webRTC or WebSockets. DIDs make reliable direct payments possible by abstracting an identity layer from the public address of Lightning nodes.</p><p>Through the DID Specification, service endpoints and DIDComm, Impervious has interlaced DIDs with Bitcoin Lightning, IPFS, WebRTC and resilient relays to introduce a new peer-to-peer internet standard with practical applications for mitigating censorship and surveillance risk.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md">See Impervious Technologies Inc.’s Github to reference example code snippets:</a></p><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md">  specs/did-usage.md at main · imperviousai/specs  Contribute to imperviousai/specs development by creating an account on GitHub.

DIDs can be tailored for different contexts, used to reinforce pseudonymity or leveraged to port attributes between identities. This technology aims to solve many ills on the internet today, from intermediary control of identity to surveillance at successive layers of the technology stack.</p><p>A DID can identify any subject (e.g., person, organization, data model, abstract entity, etc.) based on its controller, which has DID document write-privileges. A DID document specifies the syntax, common data mode, core properties, serialized representations, operations and an explanation of the DID resolution process. A DID is represented by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for trustable interactions between a DID subject and a DID document. A DID is verified by associating a DID document and URI and can be universally resolvable with DID methods such as the Microsoft ION Sidetree protocol &lt;https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion&gt;.</p><p>DIDs consist of a URI string used to resolve a DID document with information that describes the identity’s subject.</p><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md"></a><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md">DID Document</a><p>A DID document may include authentication keys, service endpoints, a short-name alias, free-form text and other attributes as specified by the controller. Use cases can also be implemented without a protocol modification by updating a DID document.</p><p>The URI resolves to a DID document based on the implementation of the specific DID method. This infrastructure could be a web server (similar threat model to current URL API calls), peer-to-peer discovery, anchor to the Bitcoin blockchain, IPFS or custom implementation devised by the controller. The DID Specification enables a controller to add or update information within a DID document, improving the utility of a DID and enabling DIDCommunications (DIDComm).</p><p>The DID Specification</p><p>The DID Specification enables a controller to maximize decentralization by inputting additional information into a DID document. It meets the core attributes of an optimal decentralized payment and communications network. The DID Specification is updatable and open-standard and is redundant and resilient with fallback nodes, fallback on-chain addresses and alternative pathways to receive data or payments through a custodian. A DID is a static string that can function as a QR code for ease of use.</p><p>A controller may specify service endpoints in a DID document by listing the applications, features and functions a DID can support. The DID Specification for service endpoints allows for choosing the transport path, message type and method used to perform payment actions. A network of users may also select a subnet configured for their particular needs.</p><p>DID Service Endpoints</p><p>Service endpoints can be application-specific data stores (e.g., Tweets), IPNS links or any other protocol. Moreover, a DID can support several specified service endpoints. A DID document specifies the broadcast method and claims ownership over a personal domain, as shown in the following code example:</p><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md"></a><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md">DID Document Specifies a Service Endpoint</a><p>A DID document must include all metadata necessary for the respective service endpoint type. Service endpoints can be duplicated and hosted across multiple providers (URLs) for enhanced resilience. A controller can specify which service endpoint receives message information, either through code or configuration. See the W3C DID Specification Registries (working) for a standardized list of service endpoints and supporting appropriate documentation:<br><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/#service-types">https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/#service-types</a>.</p><p>Service endpoints are not only an example of the utility and flexibility that DID documents provide, but also a critical characteristic of higher-order decentralized applications that rely on DIDComm.</p><p>DIDComm</p><p>DIDComm is a secure, private communications layer built on top of the decentralized properties of a DID. DIDComm Messaging accrues the decentralization benefits to a network of connected identifiers with a particular set of specifications. While a range of secure messaging protocols exists, most require trusting a centralized authority to issue identities, register keys and delegate certificate authorities. Furthermore, most legacy messaging protocols rely on a single transport mechanism. Centralized systems often sacrifice security to gain convenience and are limited by a lack of interoperability. DIDComm Messaging relegates centralized messaging protocols and dependent systems.</p><p>DIDComm uses service endpoints and public keys located in the DID document to enable communication between DIDs. Signing, authentication and authorization are derived from a DID and are therefore inherently decentralized. DIDComm optimizes for resilience and utility while providing individual discretion of the preferential communication protocol or transport layer. DIDComm messages are easy to understand as they utilize the same message formatting and parsing as a DID document. The receiver can set priorities to manage optimal message delivery.</p><p>In the following example, three target services are listed:</p>  The lightning node pubkey, specified as LNPubkey to support Keysend and AMP.  A DIDComm Messaging service, listening for POST requests sent to the http://example.com/path.  A DIDComm Messaging service over Lightning payments.  <a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md"></a><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md">DIDComm</a><p>The specific DIDComm service endpoint above allows for receiving messages despite the sender &nbsp;not having access to a Lightning node. In addition, the receiver can set a priority as to which other service endpoint or communications method they prefer. This functional utility inherent in DIDs can be improved by implementing mediators or relays to ensure offline communication and traffic resilience.</p><p>DIDComm Mediators: Introduction to Relays</p><p>DIDComm allows users to communicate without hosting their servers online. Mediators receive an onion-encrypted message from a sender (or a previous mediator in the chain) and relay this message to another party. A mediator cannot assess whether the recipient is another relay or the intended recipient, and they cannot access message content since it is encrypted with the recipient’s public key. Delivery methods are transport agnostic and should be coordinated between the receiver and the designated mediator. In addition, a mediator can push mobile or email notifications or store the encrypted messages and wait for the receiver to fetch them directly when they are offline. DIDComm mediator properties enable evolutionary advances in secure and decentralized communications and in Bitcoin Lightning payments by securely routing messages and payments to recipients, even if they are temporarily offline.</p><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md"></a><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md">DIDComm Mediators: Introduction to Relays</a><p>DIDComm as a Lightning Transport Method</p><p>Lightning transports data via IP or TOR TCP sockets, and payments are routed by pubkeys, which are gossiped across the Lightning network. DIDs and DIDComm-based messaging can be added as alternative ways to communicate with nodes. Additionally, WebSockets, mediators, pubkey swaps, fallback nodes or communication servers can be implemented native to the network. As a transport option for Lightning payments, DIDComm improves adaptability and future-proofs the protocol. The following sections discuss how IP/TOR/Pubkeys can be referenced inside a DID to replicate Lightning features and make these resilient.</p><p>Keysend/AMP</p><p>Keysend and AMP allow for ad hoc payments by sending them directly to the destination node’s public key. This payment method does not require an invoice. In the example below, the serviceEndpoint URI is the lightning prefix followed by the node pubkey.</p><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md"></a><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md">Keysend/AMP</a><p>LNURL</p><p>Lightning URL (LNURL) is a service endpoint inside the DID document. The benefit of abstracting LNURL—also an abstraction layer—is that it does not need to solely depend on IP addresses or domain names. The LNURL location can be updated as needed without affecting payers. In the example above, there could be a list of multiple origins for LNURL.</p><p>In the next example, the serviceEndpoint URI is the lightning prefix followed by the LNURL encoded string &lt;<a href="https://github.com/fiatjaf/lnurl-rfc/blob/luds/06.md">https://github.com/fiatjaf/lnurl-rfc/blob/luds/06.md</a>&gt;.</p><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md"></a><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md">LNURL</a><p>Offers</p><p>Offers are improved static invoices that enable ad hoc payments through a generic, non-amount-dependent bolt12 payment string &lt;<a href="https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/798">https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/798</a>&gt;. To support offers, recipients can simply create a bolt12 payment string and then add it as a service endpoint. The serviceEndpoint URI consists of the lightning prefix followed by a bolt12 encoded string.</p><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md"></a><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md">Offers</a><p>Custodians</p><p>Custodians add convenience to the secure and decentralized attributes of DID mediators or relays. DID mediator properties enable a standard for custodians to accept Lightning deposits on behalf of a recipient. This protocol is similar to a banking wire transfer protocol, with recipient information attached via Type-Length-Variable (TLV). The front-end of applications that understand specific custodians can open the profile in another browser tab. Back-ends that &nbsp;understand the API for specific custodians can make the payment through these URLs.</p><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md"></a><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md">Custodians</a><p>The serviceEndpoint URI links to the component of the custodian’s code that provides a specific service to the recipient (e.g., message forwarding, Lightning deposit, other service endpoint). A controller specifies a particular custodian using the “type” argument in the “service” function. The type argument can be a URL, DID, or Lightning pubkey that has been delegated as the user’s custodian. This can be particularly useful when a Lightning node is not always online but a friend or custodian is.</p><p>BIP47 and Paynyms</p><p>Paynyms allow on-chain payments to a pseudonymous username (i.e., “paynym”). A new address is generated using BIP47 each time a payment is made to preserve on-chain privacy and transaction security.</p><p>There are two options for interacting with paynyms. The first displays a specific BIP47 payment code directly to the payer, while the second stores the paynym URL in a public directory.</p><p>For BIP47, the serviceEndpoint URI is the prefix BTC followed by the BIP47 payment code. The serviceEndpoint URI is the paynym URL for a given user’s registered paynym. Paynyms are a resilient and secure way to conduct payments, but another approach is to use a designated on-chain address.</p><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md"></a><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md">BIP47 and Paynyms</a><p>On-Chain Address</p><p>A static Bitcoin address can also be provided as payment information. In this case, the serviceEndpoint is BTC followed by the address. When advanced functionality such as running a Lightning node becomes too complex, another choice is to use a normal Bitcoin address. There is wide support for sending and receiving bitcoin to a normal on-chain address. However, due to privacy implications when reusing addresses for multiple purposes, on-chain addresses should mainly be a fallback payment option.</p><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md"></a><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md">On-Chain Address</a><p>Bitcoin Payment Metadata</p><p>For each service endpoint payment type, optional metadata can be added to specify a receiver’s preferences. This can include the priority and the minimum/maximum number of Satoshis (sats).</p><p>Priority</p><p>For payment options, a proposal for how the recipient prefers to get paid is as simple as setting the parameter “priority": 1.</p><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md"></a><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md">Bitcoin Payment Metadata: Priority</a><p>Min/Max</p><p>A minimum/maximum sats amount can be specified by setting the parameter “minAmountSat": 1 and “maxAmountSat": 100000. Msat and BTC could be supported as well.</p><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md">Bitcoin Payment Metadata: Min/Max</a><p>Lightning Communication</p><p>Several Lightning based communications applications rely on Keysend/AMP to attach messages to the payment TLV records. One existing issue for any decentralized communications method involves determining whether a specific Lightning node is online and listening. Service endpoints can be used to signal the Lightning node status. By resolving a recipient’s DID, a caller may learn the status, payment and messaging information for their desired Lighting node.</p><p>In the example below, the recipient has their desired Lightning node pubkey specified as LNPubkey and is listening to Sphinx and Impervious messages.</p><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md"></a><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md">Lightning Communication</a><p>The service endpoint is the method used to communicate with destinations by referencing the pubkey directly from within the DID document. The type identifies the application listening to these messages, each of which may require their own message protocol or TLV records according to that application’s standard.</p><p>Lightning Mailboxes</p><p>DIDComm mediators provide an avenue for two parties to coordinate payments, even if one is temporarily offline by delegating a fallback:</p><p>If a DID sender wants to pay via Lightning to a DID recipient who is currently offline but has a delegated mediator as a fallback, the sender can send a message to their mediator. This message would contain payment details such as “DID:xyz tried to pay you 10000 sats.” Once they are online and pull this message from the mediator, the sender can contact DID:xyz to request payment again.</p><p>This method informs the recipient that a Lightning payment was missed. In addition, DIDComm mediators offer advanced functionality such that upon Lightning payment transmission to an offline node, this payment is routed to a receiver-designated mediator. Next, a secondary message is sent out of band (txt, email, etc.) alerting the recipient of a missed payment. The user is then able to bring their Lightning node online, which alerts the designated mediator to receive payment. DIDComm can use the Lightning Network as a transport layer for a pure Bitcoin Layer 2 experience.</p><p>Well Known DID and DID DNS</p><p>The LNURL protocol (<a href="https://lightningaddress.com">https://lightningaddress.com</a>) has been popularized as a method for human-readable email addresses for making payments. LNURLs utilize the well-known txt record of a domain in order to return a LNURL-pay compatible payload specific to a particular username under the /.well-known/ URI. A similar protocol exists for DIDs called the “Well Known DID” (<a href="https://identity.foundation/.well-known/resources/did-configuration/">https://identity.foundation/.well-known/resources/did-configuration/</a>). Well Known DIDs provide human-readable addresses for payments and messages.</p><p>The “alsoKnownAs” field (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#also-known-as">https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#also-known-as</a>), which can be specified in a receiving party’s DID document, can be used in conjunction with Well Known DIDs to prove the common identity of a DID and URL.</p><p>In addition, the IETF has proposed a DNS for DIDs (<a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-mayrhofer-did-dns-05.txt">https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-mayrhofer-did-dns-05.txt</a>). This proposal is designed to achieve the same effect as Well Known DIDs and represents another competitor for a DID URI standard as well as a redundant service endpoint that the controller may include to make a DID document more robust.</p><p>Example: _did.example.net. IN URI 100 10 “did:example:1234abcd"</p><p>The Impervious Browser: A Revolutionary Application of Decentralized Identity</p><p>DID is the cornerstone of the peer-to-peer web, and the Impervious Browser makes peer-DIDs accessible for everyone. These enable a range of functions, from messaging to video conferencing, live document editing and content monetization. The following two scenarios involve Impervious DIDComm between two hypothetical users (Alice and Bob).</p><p>In each scenario, Alice opens a chat box to message Bob. The Impervious Browser prepares a plaintext JSON message. The Impervious Daemon checks to see if Bob’s DID document is saved on the Daemon itself, checks a public DID-resolver URL or as a fallback checks Microsoft ION. The Impervious Daemon accesses two pieces of information and then returns to Alice: a service endpoint for messages to be delivered to Bob and the public key that Bob’s agent is using in the Alice-to-Bob relationship. Next, Alice’s browser uses Bob’s public key to encrypt the plaintext messages so that only Bob’s browser with that particular DID can read it. Alice’s browser also adds authentication with its own private key.</p><p>Scenario 1: Alice and Bob are online</p><p>The browser arranges delivery to Bob directly, using either the Lightning Network, HTTP or TOR. Bob’s browser receives and decrypts the message and authenticates its origin using Alice’s public key. Bob’s browser searches for Alice’s key and an appropriate service endpoint in her DID document. Bob’s browser then routes a response by encrypting the plaintext message, adding authentication with his private key and coordinating delivery via the available transport method and service endpoint.</p><p>Scenario 2: Alice or Bob are offline</p><p>Alice attempts to contact Bob based on the prioritized communication channel specified in Bob’s DID document, but this fails because his server is offline. Therefore, the browser arranges delivery to Bob via a DID mediator (also known as a “relay”), using either the Lightning Network, HTTP or TOR. When Bob comes back online, his Impervious Daemon connects to the mediator and retrieves messages. The relay does not have access to message content, as it is encrypted to Bob’s public key. In this case, the mediator acts as a mailbox for Bob. If Bob has a pre-negotiated service endpoint (i.e., email address, Lightning Address, etc.), the mediator network acts as a forwarding service.</p><p>At launch, the Impervious Daemon will employ DID Specification service endpoints, DIDComm and mediators to provide the core peer-to-peer and encrypted functionality of the Impervious Browser. In future Impervious Browser versions, DID Specification will improve the usability and resilience of the Lightning network. The novel use of DIDs covered in this paper addresses the potential of this technology to weave the fabric of a new peer-to-peer internet standard, enabling everyone to mitigate the risk of censorship and surveillance.</p><p>Complete Code Example</p><p>The DID document includes:</p>  Personal domain ownership  Owning two nodes: the user’s preferred method of payment under 1M sats  An LNURL endpoint supporting pay requests  Supporting bolt12 offers with a generic donation invoice  BIP47/paynym as a privacy preserving fallback payment method  A static bitcoin address as a fallback payment method after paynyms  A custodial service as a last resort payment method  Impervious and Sphinx running off both LN nodes  Supporting DIDComm on a user-owned HTTP server, user-owned LN node and mediator HTTP relay when a user is offline  <p>The following example shows a DID document utilizing all payment and communication service endpoints covered throughout this paper.</p><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md"></a><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md">DID Document Complete Code Example: Part 1/2</a><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md"></a><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md">DID Document Complete Code Example: Part 2/2</a> <p>See Impervious Technologies Inc.’s Github to reference example code snippets:</p><p>Impervious Technologies: Decentralized Identifiers ("DID") Spec</p><p><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md">https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md</a></p><p>A copy of this document in PDF can be found via IPFS: <a href="https://imp.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmbMBc96PNYmJVFuQ4jReR4cgx9ZctZSsFyy9QdSuRZk18">https://imp.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmbMBc96PNYmJVFuQ4jReR4cgx9ZctZSsFyy9QdSuRZk18</a></p><p>Copyright Ⓒ 2022 Impervious Technologies Inc.</p>

<p>The payment landscape continues to shift. The move from cash and checks to digital payments such as ACH (automated clearing house) has accelerated, particularly in high-dollar or recurring categories like rent and utilities. These moves offer benefits for both consumers and merchants – more choice, simpler experiences and greater speed to payment – but they come with a few challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unsuccessful transactions create friction in the experience by leaving parties scrambling to find a different way to get a payment through, or it can generate penalty fees for both merchants and consumers. There is always the risk of fraudulent accounts or account credentials being used.</p>
<p>To improve the process, Mastercard today unveiled a new suite of Smart Payment Decisioning Tools that minimize these pain points.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new products – Payment Success Indicator and Payment Routing Optimizer – rely on real-time bank data permissioned by a consumer to show payment indicators that raise successful payment completion rates and reduce transaction costs.</p>
<p>When it comes to ACH transactions,<a href="https://www.nacha.org/content/ach-network-volume-and-value-statistics"> Nacha reported</a> that payment volume on the modern ACH Network increased 7.7% in the third quarter of 2021 alone, showing that consumers are becoming increasingly interested in making direct payments from their bank accounts.</p>
<p>With the increasing volume of ACH payments, there are a few hurdles that may potentially slow the increase in adoption, delaying the improved merchant and consumer experience:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Settlement risk – Lack of payments visibility leaves merchants exposed to the potential for returns, which disrupt and add friction to a consumer-merchant relationship. When a customer ‘walks away’ from a payment experience, the merchant is unsure of the likelihood of ACH settlement. This has the potential to create a costly return process with added fees and manual intervention or operational costs. 
 Security – On occasion, merchants experience failed payments due to a consumer providing false or inaccurate credentials. 
 Payment decisioning – Having multiple ACH payment options, such as the payment rail and settlement date, provides consumer choice and minimizes expense. However, lack of greater visibility can introduce risk to settlement.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Minimizing Payment Failure, Maximizing Cash Flow. 
<p>How do these pain points play out in the market? According to <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/press/2021/december/the-future-is-here-new-mastercard-study-finds-majority-of-consumers-embrace-open-banking-to-power-digital-financial-experiences/">Mastercard research</a>, each time an ACH payment fails, the merchant is hit with a fee. Fraud also continues to be a major issue in payments. According to a <a href="https://www.afponline.org/publications-data-tools/reports/survey-research-economic-data/Details/payments-fraud/">2021 AFP Payments Fraud Survey</a>, checks and wire transfers are by far the preferred methods that fraudsters exploit, but ACH debits have seen an increase in fraudulent activity as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enter the power of open banking. By using consumer-permissioned data, these hurdles can be lowered or even eliminated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Payment Success Indicator, failure risk is mitigated by scoring the likelihood of a successful payment before initiating it. Then with Payment Routing Optimizer, originators are given a recommendation for the most optimal day and payment rail to choose for the highest likelihood of successful settlement at the best cost and speed.&nbsp;</p>
 Better Data, Better Decisions. 
<p>With smart data comes better decision-making. This is true in virtually every aspect of life, and it’s true in handling account-to-account payments. Leveraging machine learning and predictive modeling, Payment Success Indicator and Payment Routing Optimizer can help mitigate or eliminate ACH failure. This can increase cash flow and improve the bottom line while also creating a more positive experience for customers.</p>
<p>Consumers are adopting more apps and services that utilize digital checkout and payment options. It’s more important than ever to minimize fees and their associated costs, reduce fraud, non-sufficient funds (NSF) returns and make payment settlement confident and cost-effective.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By utilizing consumer-permissioned bank insights, Payment Success Indicator will provide payment originators a composite score across 10 future calendar days, as well as an individual score for each of those 10 days. Scoring is based on real-time balance and historical behavioral risk patterns. This system is used to evaluate the likelihood a given amount will settle successfully.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>If there is a high risk of settlement or non-sufficient funds over the given time period, the merchant can then use that information and request an alternative payment method, deny the transaction or assume the risk and proceed.</p>
<p>The analytics engine returns a score separating the risk factors across four tiers, giving merchants the advantage of maximizing the available data before making the decision to initiate a payment:</p>
 
 Tier 1: Highly likely to settle. 
 Tier 2: Likely to settle. 
 Tier 3: Less likely to settle. 
 Tier 4: Do not process. Errors present. 
 
<p>Each composite score comes complete with weighted reasons accompanying it. Account balance, NSF history, consumer spending and consumer deposits are all factored into the analytics.</p>
<p>Payment Routing Optimizer will make payment rail, cost and payment date suggestions, based on the risk findings by Payment Success Indicator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, if the balance is available in a consumer’s account to make the payment today, but the analytics determine that it may not be available over the next few days, Payment Routing Optimizer will suggest Same-Day ACH over risking Standard ACH processing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This product aims to take the friction out of choosing between digital payment options with future updates of the Payment Routing Optimizer potentially including a debit card option.</p>
 Real-World Benefits. 
<p>The <a href="https://www.biltrewards.com/">Bilt Rewards Alliance</a>, a collection of more than 2 million rental homes across the country that lets renters earn highly valuable rewards points just by paying rent, will be the first fintech partner to launch Payment Success Indicator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Our mission is to help renters get the most value out of one of their biggest expenses, and returned payments create significant expense and friction for both residents and landlords,” says Ankur Jain, Founder and CEO of Bilt Rewards. “Payment Success Indicator should significantly reduce the potential for returned payments, delivering a digital payment experience that works harder and smarter for everyone.”</p>
<p>Through smart decisioning analytics, Mastercard is helping financial services innovators and payment platforms change the ACH payments landscape. Increased confidence, minimization of fees, improved profitability and simplified payments. That’s the power of open banking.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These days, enterprises are welcoming identity access management and Cloud technologies with open arms. With these technologies, businesses have moved beyond traditional methods of access management and shifted most of their components to the Cloud. Identity-as-a-service, or IDaaS, is a Cloud-based authentication service that offers businesses optimal solutions for <a href="https://imageware.io/digital-identity/">digital identity</a> management.</p>



<p>Trends and statistics that explain all the buzz around it include:&nbsp;</p>



 
 The global market value for IDaaS was valued at USD <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/identity-as-a-service-market">3.34 billion</a> in 2019 and is predicted to grow at a rate of 22.0% from 2020 to 2027.&nbsp; 
 The market is fairly fragmented with major businesses accounting for the majority of market revenue. 
 Based on the deployment, the hybrid cloud segment is expected to register a CAGR of <a href="https://www.emergenresearch.com/industry-report/idaas-market">22.1%</a>. 
 North America is one of the most dominant markets and accounted for more than <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/identity-as-a-service-market">39%</a> of the global share in 2019. 
 



 Understanding Identity-as-a-Service 



<p>This is a Cloud-based model for identity access management that is managed and hosted by a third party rather than being deployed on premises. This also referred to as Cloud-based identity governance, is an application delivery model, similar to Software-as-a-Service, that connects Identity Access Management (IAM) accounts to the Cloud. The shift to IDaaS began several years ago and was considered a ‘Cloud first’ IT adoption strategy.&nbsp;</p>







<p>This combines the benefits of an enterprise IAM solution with the business and economical advantages of a Cloud-based system. That includes various services, the most common of them being Single Sign-On (SSO), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and directory services that provide cost-effective IAM benefits to organizations.</p>



 4 Key Components of Identity-as-a-Service Solution 



<p>These has four major components:</p>



 
 Single Sign-On (SSO): SSO allows users to log into multiple applications with a single set of credentials. SSO solutions restrict identity theft by reducing password fatigue and streamlining access and simplifies operations within an organization by centralizing and unifying administrative functions. 
 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): MFA commonly includes adaptive authentication methods options to ratchet up as risk grows based on situational changes, user behavior, or application sensitivity. Adaptive authentication methods are supported by modern <a href="https://imageware.io/what-is-multi-factor-authentication/">Multi Factor Authentication</a> systems, which employ contextual information (such as location, time of day, IP address, device kind) and business rules to determine which authentication factors to apply to a specific user in a specific situation. 
 Provisioning: User identity can be integrated or “provisioned” across multiple systems and applications within an enterprise using the System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM). When the user leaves the company, their access is immediately revoked.&nbsp; 
 Biometrics: Biometrics, or physical characteristics such as fingerprints and irises, are often deployed as an important part of MFA. Fingerprints are the most common form of biometrics used in this. 
 



 Benefits of IDaaS 



<p>There are multiple added benefits:</p>



 
 As a Cloud-based service, it’s both cost-effective and time-saving, while also saving the expense of having to buy a separate software for identity management.&nbsp; 
 Reduces overhead costs for maintenance since it includes real-time system fixes, performance improvements, and updates to customers. 
 The provides efficient security when accessing any network or resources.&nbsp; 
 By utilizing the intelligence and automation capabilities of this systems, businesses can easily and efficiently manage compliance, risk, and governance. 
 



 Picking the Perfect IDaaS Provider 



<p>Before choosing an provider for your business, consider the following factors:</p>



 
 Identity Proofing: The provider should effectively verify and authenticate users before providing them access to resources. 
 Scalability: The service should be scalable to meet your changing demands. 
 Adaptability: The provider must be open to future modifications. 
 



 Conclusion 



<p>This leads to overall improved security and cost-efficiency of an organization. It protects small and enterprise-level companies against data theft and misuse of information. As the services that these companies offer level up, also continuing to evolve and develop&nbsp; innovative updates.</p>

<p>These are becoming one of the fastest-growing security systems in the market. Why? Because these systems provide a combination of access control and convenience like no other:</p>



  Biometrics is the analysis of biological components by technology&nbsp;  Access control is the management of access points, like a doorway or elevator, to ensure only authorized users get in  



<p><a href="https://imageware.io/resource/biometric-authentication-access/">Biometric access control</a> systems combine the power of biometrics with access control systems for a modern security technology that delivers numerous benefits across a wide variety of industries.</p>



 What Is a Biometric Access Control System? 



<p>Biometrics is a method of establishing a person’s identity based on their physical, behavioral, or chemical traits. These uses the biometric data to either grant or deny access to premises. These systems look for behavioral or physical characteristics which are unique to each individual, including iris or retina scans, voice recognition, and gait analysis. Over <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/4989/biometric-technologies/#:~:text=Over%2075%20percent%20of%20U.S.,can%20add%20to%20their%20organization.">75%</a> of Americans have used some form of biometric technology, ranging from fingerprint to facial recognition to hand geometry.</p>







 How Do Biometric Access Control Systems Work? 



<p>A standard system has four main components, which we break into small, easy-to-understand pieces, below.</p>



<p>Working Main Components&nbsp;</p>



  The Sensor Device  



<p>A biometric scanner obtains necessary information from the user. For example, the optical sensor in a fingerprint capture device produces an image of the ridge structure of your finger. The scanned image serves as the bedrock for further processing and analysis. The sensor unit forms a key interface between the user and the system, minimizing the possibility of reading failure rate. The quality of the data obtained depends on the quality and characteristics of the sensor.&nbsp;</p>



  Data Quality Assessment  



<p>The next step is to assess the quality of biometric data gathered by the sensors. If needed, a signal enhancing algorithm is applied to the biometric data to improve the data quality. After the data is assessed, a specific data set is chosen to represent the qualifying data set. The biometric feature set that is used is stored within the system’s database as a biometric template.&nbsp;</p>



  Comparing and Matching Data  



<p>After the feature set is gathered, it is compared to the stored data to find any identical matching points. The number of matches can fluctuate between the readings depending on the quality of data collected.&nbsp;</p>



  The System Database  



<p>The database stores all the required information. A single biometric sample is usually sufficient for extracting a user template from the system database, but sometimes multiple samples may be required to form a mosaic representation.&nbsp;</p>



 Types of Biometric Access Control Systems 



<p>Ensuring that your building is free from unauthorized visitors is important for the safety of your infrastructure. Here are some of the most popular types that can help you secure your building:&nbsp;</p>







 Fingerprint Scan 



<p>One of the earliest and most common forms is fingerprint scanning. In ancient times, the Chinese used fingerprints to authenticate government records, and the people of Babylon used fingerprints to sign written contracts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, fingerprint scanning continues to be widely used in many different industries. Examples include: identifying suspected criminals, authenticating payments, and access control systems.&nbsp;</p>



 Iris Scan&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://imageware.io/the-eyes-have-it-what-is-iris-recognition/">Iris recognition</a> technology uses multiple unique patterns in the human eye to provide accurate identification. Iris scanners use infrared light and high-resolution cameras to create a structured map of the iris and convert this information into a biometric template that becomes a person’s ID. Currently, iris scans are used in a variety of access control systems as well as law enforcement for identifying suspects.</p>



 Voice Authentication 



<p>The use of voice authentication can reduce and even eliminate the need for passwords to access your facility. Voice authentication works by breaking down the audio of speech into individual sounds and analyzing each sound using algorithms. The algorithms find the most probable word to fit into that language and transcribe those sound clips into texts.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://imageware.io/biometric-voice-recognition/">Voice authentication</a> is used to identify individuals over the phone for medical or banking purposes as well as to authenticate users logging into applications.</p>



 3 Benefits of Biometric Access Control Systems 



<p>The three main benefits of using a biometric access system are:</p>



  Highly Secure  



<p>The use the unique characteristics of a human body, which are unlikely to be stolen or used by someone other than the intended user. Traditional access keys or tokens can be easily spoofed, lost, or stolen, but biometrics cannot.</p>



  More Convenient  



<p>Biometric access systems are convenient because they do not require additional information other than the user themselves. Additionally, most biometric systems can identify users in less than a second, reducing delays caused at manual identification checkpoints.</p>



  Reduced Expenses  



<p>This help organizations cut costs by eliminating the security staff required to conduct manual identification. In addition, access control systems that use keycards or other tokens incur replacement or damage costs, however; there are no such costs with&nbsp; biometrics.</p>



<p>Conclusion</p>



<p>There are several important reasons why biometrics are so popular for access control, including increased security, improved convenience, and lower costs. Traditionally, when upgrading technologies, there is a tradeoff among security, convenience, and costs, but with biometrics all three work together to provide the perfect solution.</p>



<p>In short, when it comes to access control systems, biometrics are unbeatable.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Raj Hegde</a></p><p>Dr. Donnie Wendt's presentation will explore adding deception as a component of a security-in-depth strategy to increase cyber resilience. He will elaborate on this idea in his keynote <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5062/2" title="Donnie Wendt: Cybersecurity &amp; Deception">Vampires &amp; Cybersecurity: Using Deception to Increase Cyber Resilience</a> on Thursday, May 12, 2022, 11:30 am at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2022">European Identity and Cloud Conference 2022</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Donnie some questions about his presentation.</p>
<p> </p>
 How is deception used in the cyber realm? 
<p>I like to think of deception, you know, it's not really about deceiving the enemy, but it's about causing that enemy to deceive himself. So the art of deception is really about providing that enemy with something they want to believe. In my presentation, we'll discuss a few famous examples from history but when we talk about the cyber realm, that is where deception can really thrive. Cyberspace has made creating fake realities, imaginary assets, and false personas quite simple. In cyberspace, people use deception with ease for many purposes. Some of those users, and it's become so ubiquitous, we often don't even think of them when we think of deception. In some cases, they mimic very deceptive activities in the physical world. Sure, deception is used by cyberattackers and defenders, but it's also used for things such as ensuring privacy, criminal investigations, intel, counter-intel operations, conducting espionage. I use it for research, criminal activity, and quite often by ordinary people wanting to boost their social media profile or provide fake accounts on websites. However, my presentation is going to focus on the practical use of deception to assist with the cyber defense of our companies.<br><br></p>
 Why does your session title mention vampires? 
<p>Oh well, I am a big fan of vampire literature and I decided to have a little fun with this presentation, so I incorporated some analogies with vampires. I found that when discussing deception for cybersecurity, people seem to jump right to the honeypot and hunting nets. They start envisioning you know, enticing that attacker and perhaps through external lures and possibly even engaging the attacker. However, inviting attackers into your network, much like inviting vampires into your home, can have very serious repercussions. Furthermore, engaging them or watching them move about can be quite risky. I like to say leave that type of engagement to the professionals, the external security vendors and researchers, or in the case of vampires, let Buffy handle it. Often the best approach when encountering vampires is just to drive a wooden stake through his or her heart as soon as possible. Similarly, in most situations, once a suspected attacker is identified, organizations want to evict and block that attacker quickly and effectively.<br><br></p>
 How might companies use deception to increase security and resiliency? 
<p>Well, unfortunately, when we talk about attackers that targeted our organizations, unlike vampires, they can enter without an invitation. But that does not mean we need to invite them in, right? Fortunately, defenders can deploy many types of deception which can detect attackers and provide that early warning system of possible intrusions. So that we can respond quickly. Defenders can create a wide range of decoys, including servers, network devices, files, database entries, and even passwords, which only a malicious attacker should access. Defensive systems then monitor those decoys and alert on any interactions with bogus resources, including from insiders. Several of these methods are very simple to implement and require no new technology. However, I do believe that like an integrated deception platform can provide many benefits related to the creation, deployment, and maintenance of deceptive assets over time.<br><br></p>
 What are some keys to success when implementing a deception program? 
<p>First and foremost, the successful implementation and operation of a deception program require a clear strategy that defines the goals and objectives. Clear objectives and goals are going to assist in prioritizing many use cases for deception. Also, the program has to define the roles and responsibilities required not only to implement but to support that deception strategy over time. For example, what will be required to develop, deploy and maintain deceptive assets and respond to all the generated alerts? The objective and goals should then drive prioritization and implementation of use cases because when you consider an objective focused on detecting and evicting an attacker. It's going to have very different use cases than one focus on collecting threat intelligence. So it is important, again, to always start with that clear strategy, objectives, and goals. Let those drive your implementation. Also, be careful not to underestimate the effort required to maintain deceptive assets. Finally, always keep in mind, if you intend to engage the vampire, be very sure of your capabilities of wielding a wooden stake.</p>

 Ontology EVM — I Don’t Get&nbsp;It! <p>We’ve been gathering the most frequently asked questions about the Ontology EVM. This article will continue to be updated, as more questions arise. If you can’t find the answer to your question here, then please come over to <a href="http://t.me/OntologyNetwork">t.me/OntologyNetwork</a> and ask one of the friendly admins or Harbingers.</p> General  1. What is a Virtual Machine? What is&nbsp;EVM? <p>A virtual machine is a computer that runs on the blockchain and allows smart contracts from multiple sources to interact. Ontology already supports Wasm and NeoVM. This summer, we <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/mainnet-3rd-anniversary-special-ontologys-ethereum-virtual-machine-evm-debut-f92111436a8e">announced</a> that we had completed the development of our Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The EVM is the most popular and widely used VM, supporting a huge variety of&nbsp;dApps.</p><p>Read more in our Ontology <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/what-are-ethereum-virtual-machines-and-why-should-you-care-930a739171a9">EVM 101</a>&nbsp;blog.</p> 2. OEP-4 tokens are on the Ontology blockchain. What do they become when bridged to the&nbsp;EVM? <p>They will become ORC-20 tokens after being&nbsp;bridged.</p> 3. How many blockchains will Ontology have after the EVM&nbsp;launch? <p>Still 1 blockchain. Ontology’s multi-virtual machines make it the most VM-supported blockchain, including <a href="https://docs.neo.org/docs/en-us/basic/neovm.html">NeoVM</a>, <a href="https://webassembly.org/">Wasm</a>VM, and now Ontology&nbsp;<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/">EVM</a>.</p> 4. How many decimals will ONT and ONG have after the recent MainNet&nbsp;Upgrade? <p>9 for ONT and 18 for&nbsp;ONG.</p> 5. How will the decimals change affect node staking? Do we still need to put ONT in integer form when&nbsp;staking? <p>The decimals change won’t affect ONT staking rules. You need at least 1 ONT to stake and your total staking amount needs to be an&nbsp;integer.</p> 6. Which popular wallet will support the new EVM&nbsp;tokens? <p><a href="http://onto.app">ONTO Wallet</a>, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/onto-wallet/ifckdpamphokdglkkdomedpdegcjhjdp">ONTO Web Wallet</a> and <a href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a>.</p> 7. What’s the RPC URL for Ontology MainNet that supports Ontology&nbsp;EVM? <p><a href="https://dappnode1.ont.io:10339">https://dappnode1.ont.io:10339</a></p><p><a href="https://dappnode2.ont.io:10339">https://dappnode2.ont.io:10339</a></p><p><a href="https://dappnode3.ont.io:10339">https://dappnode3.ont.io:10339</a></p><p><a href="https://dappnode4.ont.io:10339">https://dappnode4.ont.io:10339</a></p><p>Reference: <a href="https://docs.ont.io/guides-and-tutorials/development-guides/smart-contract-dev/evm-contract/development-environment-and-tools#network-info">https://docs.ont.io/guides-and-tutorials/development-guides/smart-contract-dev/evm-contract/development-environment-and-tools#network-info</a></p> 8. What does it consume when transacting on the&nbsp;EVM? <p>When making transactions on Ontology EVM, you consume the native gas token ONG for any transactions on the Ontology EVM. Each transaction on the Ontology EVM costs at least 0.0525 ONG (0x- address) depending on the complexity of the smart contracts.</p><p>If you start the transaction from an address that starts with an A, it will cost ONG from an address that starts with an&nbsp;A.</p><p>If you start the transaction from addresses that start with 0x, it will cost ONG from an address that starts with&nbsp;0x.</p><p>For instance, ONG (0x- address) ⇔WONG (0x- address) performing wrapping or unwrapping transactions will cost ONG (0x- address).</p><p>If you transfer ONG from an address that starts with an A to an address that starts with 0x, it will cost you 0.05 ONG from the A addresses. If the transaction is the other way around, it will cost you 0.0525 ONG for 0x addresses. The gas fee is determined by underlying gas fee requirements in smart contracts.</p><p>9. What is the purpose of WONG? Why would you wrap ONG?<br>ONG is actually the native gas token of the Ontology network. However, some contracts may require ORC-20 (Similar to ERC-20 on Ethereum) standard tokens. Just like ETH isn’t ERC-20 compatible, hence wETH exists, so we need WONG for those types of contracts.</p><p>A wrapped token is a token that represents a cryptocurrency from another blockchain or token standard and is worth the same as the original cryptocurrency.</p><p>You can wrap ONG via <a href="http://bridge.ont.io">Ontology Bridge</a>.

What to do if my exchange has suspended deposits or withdrawals of Ontology&nbsp;tokens? <p>It is a common action for exchanges to suspend deposit or withdrawal transactions during network upgrades.

<p>Forbes Italia è l’edizione italiana del business magazine più famoso al mondo. Punto di riferimento per chi lavora con e per il business. “Empower The Future” mette attorno a un tavolo i protagonisti istituzionali, accademici, d’impresa e culturali per tracciare uno scenario possibile riguardo a come verrà affrontata la transizione digitale, ecologica ed energetica e come sarà in grado di abilitare un nuovo sistema economico e sociale, a moderare le tavole rotonde vi sarà l’autorevole autore e conduttore Enzo Argante, di Forbes Italia.</p>
<p>L’apertura dell’evento vedrà una prima sessione dedicata alla transizione digitale, dalla gestione della conoscenza data-driven, all’intelligenza artificiale. Partendo dall’assunto che i cambiamenti che hanno caratterizzato gli ultimi anni sono stati profondi e irreversibili, la società intera si trova a dover riscrivere le logiche e i processi del sistema economico mondiale, il quale per resistere deve adeguarsi ai nuovi modelli di business.</p>
<p>Aprirà la discussione il Rettore dell’Università Luigi Bocconi di Milano Gianmario Verona; successivamente Igor De Biasio, AD di Arexpo parlerà del progetto che vedrà la creazione di uno dei più grandi Distretti dell’Innovazione europeo nell’area Expo2015; a seguire Giorgio Ventre di Apple Academy descriverà il modello accademico pubblico/privato, un sistema che rappresenta un’eccellenza a livello europeo; la parola passerà quindi a NTT DATA conil suo CEO Walter Ruffinoni, il quale avrà il Focus sulle palestre relazionali; con Erminio Polito, Direttore Energy &amp; Utilities in Italia di Minsait&nbsp; verrà affrontato il tema delle competenze e processi di trasformazione digitale delle imprese che abilita nuovi modelli di business; Giampiero Savorelli, Managing Director HP, tratterà di manifattura digitale, uffici distribuiti e nuova organizzazione del lavoro; per InfoCert invece sarà il turno del CEO Danilo Cattaneo, il quale proporrà una lettura dei processi di deburocratizzazione messi in atto negli ultimi anni e in via di implementazione futura, sia in ambito italiano che europeo, di quanto valore possa generare la transizione al digitale sia in termini di risparmio che di semplificazione della burocrazia, di quali benefici possa essa portare al cittadino così come alle imprese e alla pubblica amministrazione; a seguire Roberta Cocco, Consulente del Ministro per l’Innovazione tecnologica e la transizione digitale approfondirà l’argomento “come le competenze digitali potranno aiutare le persone”; la tavola rotonda si concluderà con l’intervento di Dario Menasce, dell’ Istituto Nazione Fisica Nucleare, il quale parlerà del futuro quantico, su cui si stanno investendo capitali enormi in tutto il mondo.</p>
<p>La sessione delle 15:00, dedicata alla Transizione Energetica avrà numerosi ospiti fra i quali Caterina Petrillo, Presidente Area Science Park; Mario Calderini, School of Management Politecnico Milano; Cristian Acquistapace, Managing Director Renovit; Andrea Bombardi, EVP RINA; Angelo Fienga, Leader Sustainability and Circular Economy di CISCO EMEAR; e Annalisa Muccioli, CEO Eni Progetti.</p>
<p>L’evento proseguirà anche nei giorni successivi, il 23 marzo verranno affrontati i temi relativi a Smart Mobility in mattinata e Circular Economy nella sessione pomeridiana, mentre nella giornata del 24 marzo sarà il momento di Smart Food e Sostenibilità Sociale.</p>

I have to confess; I didn’t know a lot about these in the early years of my career, especially since I didn’t come from a computer science background. But looking back, I think programming security is something every programmer should be aware of and should be taught at a junior level.</p>

<p>What is safe programming, or to be more precise, what does being safe mean for a programming language? Or rather, what does unsafe mean? Let’s set the context first.</p>

 Programming safety 

<blockquote>
  <p>Programming safety = Memory safety + Type safety + Thread safety</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When we talk about “safety” in programming, we mean some combination of three distinct things: memory safety, type safety, and thread safety. There are four if you count null safety as distinct from memory safety, but we’ll group those two together today.</p>

 Memory safety 

<p>In a memory-safe language, when you access a variable or an item in an array, you can be sure that you are indeed accessing what you meant to or are allowed to access. In other words, you will not be reading or writing into the memory of another variable or pointer by mistake, regardless of what you do in your program.</p>

<p>So, why is this a big deal? Don’t all major programming languages ensure this?</p>

<p>Yes, to varying extents. But some languages are unsafe by default—for example, C and C++. In C or C++, you can access the memory of another variable by mistake, or you can free a pointer twice; that’s called double-free error. Sometimes a program continues to use a pointer after it has been freed, and that’s called a use-after-free (UAF) error or a dangling pointer error. Such behaviors are categorized as undefined; they are unpredictable and cause security vulnerabilities rather than just crashing the program. In these scenarios, a crashing program is a good thing as it won’t cause a security vulnerability.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I call it my billion-dollar mistake. It was the invention of the null reference in 1965</p>

  <p>– Tony Hoare</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then there is also null safety which is kind of related to memory safety. I come from a Java/JavaScript background, and we are used to the concept of null. Null is infamous for being the worst invention in programming. Garbage collected languages need a concept of nothing so that a pointer can be freed when unused. But the concept also leads to issues and pain, like the null pointer exceptions. Technically this relates to memory safety, but most memory-safe languages still let you use null as a value leading to null pointer errors.</p>

 Type safety 

<p>In a type-safe language, when you access a variable, you access it as the correct type of data according to how it is stored. This gives us the confidence to work on data without manually checking for the data type during runtime. Memory safety is required for a language to be type-safe.</p>

 Thread safety 

<p>In a thread-safe language, you can access or modify the same memory from multiple threads simultaneously without worrying about data races. This is generally achieved using message passing techniques, mutual exclusion locks (mutexes), and thread synchronization. Thread safety is required for optimal memory and type safety, so generally, memory and type-safe languages tend to be thread-safe as well.</p>

 Why does it matter? 

<p>Ok! Why does this matter, and why should we care? Let’s take a look at some stats to get an idea first.</p>

 Memory safety issues 

<p>Memory safety issues are the cause of most security CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) we encounter. Undefined behavior can be abused by a hacker to take control of the program or to leak privileged information. If you try to access an out of bounds array element in a memory-safe language, you will just crash the program with panic or error, which is predictable behavior.</p>

<p>This is why memory-related bugs in C/C++ systems often result in CVEs and emergency patches. There are other memory-unsafe behaviors in C/C++, like accessing pointers from stack frames that have been popped, a memory that has been de-allocated, iterator invalidation, and so on. Memory safe languages, even ones that are not the safest, still protect against such security issues.</p>

<p>If we take a look at stats, we can see that:</p>

 
   About 70% of all <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/18/we-need-a-safer-systems-programming-language/">CVEs at Microsoft</a> are memory safety issues. 
   Two-thirds of <a href="https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/lssna19/d6/kernel-modules-in-rust-lssna2019.pdf">Linux kernel vulnerabilities</a> come from memory safety issues. 
   An <a href="https://langui.sh/2019/07/23/apple-memory-safety/">Apple study</a> found that 60-70% of vulnerabilities in iOS and macOS are memory safety vulnerabilities. 
   <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2019/05/queue-hardening-enhancements.html">Google estimated</a> that 90% of Android vulnerabilities are memory safety issues. 
   <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/chrome-70-of-all-security-bugs-are-memory-safety-issues/">70% of all Chrome</a> security bugs are memory safety issues. 
   An <a href="https://twitter.com/LazyFishBarrel/status/1129000965741404160">analysis of 0-days</a> that were discovered being exploited in the wild found that more than 80% of the exploited - vulnerabilities were memory safety issues. 
   Some of the most popular security issues of all time are memory safety issues:
     
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_Slammer">Slammer worm</a>, <a href="https://www.abetterinternet.org/docs/memory-safety/out-of-bounds%20write">WannaCry</a>, <a href="https://blog.lookout.com/trident-pegasus-technical-details">Trident exploit</a>, <a href="https://tonyarcieri.com/would-rust-have-prevented-heartbleed-another-look">HeartBleed</a>, <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2015/09/stagefrightened.html">Stagefright</a>, <a href="https://blog.qualys.com/laws-of-vulnerabilities/2015/01/27/the-ghost-vulnerability">Ghost</a> 
     
   
 

<p>That’s a huge chunk of CVEs, and of course, it’s no surprise that most of it is from C/C++ systems 🤷</p>

<p>Imagine a world without memory safety issues. Imagine the amount of developer time saved, amount of money saved, amount of resources saved. Sometimes I wonder why we still use C/C++. Why do we trust humans, against all available evidence, to handle memory manually? And this is without considering other non-CVE memory issues like memory leaks, memory efficiency, and so on.</p>

 Thread safety issues 

<p>Though not as notorious as memory safety, thread safety is also a cause of major headaches for developers and can result in security issues.</p>

<p>Thread safety issues can cause two types of vulnerabilities:</p>

 
   Information loss caused by one thread overwriting information from another
     
       Pointer corruption that allows privilege escalation or remote execution 
     
   
   Integrity loss due to information from multiple threads being interlaced
     
       The best-known attack of this type is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_of_check_to_time_of_use">TOCTOU</a> (time of check to time of use) attack, which is a race condition between checking a condition (like a security credential) and using the results. 
     
   
 

<p>Both information loss and integrity loss can be exploited and lead to security issues. While thread safety-related exploits are harder and less common than memory safety ones, they are still possible.</p>

 Type safety issues 

<p>While not as critical as memory and thread safety, lack of type safety can also lead to security issues, and type safety is important for ensuring memory safety.</p>

<p>Low-level exploits are possible in languages that are not type-safe, as an attacker can manipulate the data structure and change the data type to gain access to privileged information. Although this type of exploit is pretty rare, it’s not unheard of.</p>

 Why Rust? 

<p>Now that we understand how important programming safety is, let’s see why Rust is one of the safest languages and how it avoids most of the security issues we normally encounter with languages like C/C++.</p>

<p>For those not familiar, Rust is a high-level multi-paradigm language. It’s ideal for functional and imperative programming. It has very modern and, in my opinion, the best tooling for a programming language. Though it was originally designed as a systems programming language, its advantages and flexibility have made it suitable for all sorts of use cases as a general-purpose language.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Rust throws around some buzzwords in its docs, but they are not just marketing buzz; they actually mean it with full sincerity, and they matter a lot.”</p>
</blockquote>

 Rust’s safety guarantee 

<p>The safety guarantee is one of the most important aspects of Rust; Rust is memory-safe, null-safe, type-safe, and thread-safe by design.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If the compiler detects unsafe code, it will refuse to compile that code by default. You would have to go out of your way to break those guarantees using the <code>unsafe</code> keyword. So even in cases where you would have to write unsafe code, you are making it explicit and hence issues can easily be traced down to specific code blocks.</p>

 Memory safety in Rust 

<p>Rust ensures memory safety at compile time using its innovative ownership mechanism and the borrow checker built into the compiler. The compiler does not allow memory unsafe code unless it’s explicitly marked as unsafe in an unsafe block or function. This static compile-time analysis eliminates many types of memory bugs, and with some additional runtime checks, Rust guarantees memory safety.
There is no concept of null at the language level. Instead, Rust provides the <code>Option</code> <a href="http://web.mit.edu/rust-lang_v1.25/arch/amd64_ubuntu1404/share/doc/rust/html/book/first-edition/enums.html">enum</a>, which can be used to mark the presence or absence of a value. This makes the resulting code null safe and much easier to deal with, and you will never encounter null pointer exceptions in Rust.</p>

<p>The ownership and borrowing mechanisms make Rust one of the most memory-efficient languages while avoiding pitfalls with manual memory management and garbage collection. It has memory efficiency and speeds comparable to C/C++, and memory safety that’s better than garbage-collected languages like Java and Go.</p>

<p>I’ve written detailed articles about <a href="https://deepu.tech/memory-management-in-programming/">memory management in different languages</a> in my personal blog, so check them out if you are interested in learning more about memory management in Java, Rust, JavaScript, and Go.</p>

 Type safety in Rust 

<p>Rust is statically typed, and it guarantees type safety by strict compile-time type checks and by guaranteeing memory safety. This is not special, as most modern languages are statically typed. Rust also allows some level of dynamic typing with the <code>dyn</code> keyword and <code>Any</code> type when required. But the powerful type inference and the compiler ensure type safety even in those cases.</p>

 Thread safety in Rust 

<p>Rust guarantees thread safety using similar concepts for memory safety and provides standard library features like channels, mutex, and ARC (Atomically Reference Counted) pointers. In safe Rust, you can have either one mutable reference to a value or unlimited read-only references to it at any given time. The ownership mechanism makes it impossible to cause accidental data race from a shared state. This makes us confident to focus on code and let the compiler worry about shared data between threads.</p>

 Other Rust features 

<p>I wrote about <a href="https://deepu.tech/my-second-impression-of-rust/">my impressions of Rust</a> in a detailed post on my blog where I explain Rust’s excellent features that make it unique. Here is a short summary of those features:</p>

 
   Zero cost abstractions: Rust offers true zero-cost abstractions, which means that you can write code in any style with any number of abstractions without paying any performance penalty. Very few languages offer this, which is why Rust is so fast. Rust compiler will always generate the best byte code regardless of the style of code you write. This means you can write functional-style code and get the same performance as its imperative counterpart. 
   Immutable by default: Values in Rust are immutable, or read-only, by default. Mutability has to be declared explicitly. This, along with the ability to pass by value or reference, makes it super easy to write functional code without side effects. 
   Pattern matching: Rust has excellent support for advanced pattern matching. Pattern matching is used extensively for error handling and control flows in Rust. 
   Advanced generics, traits, and types: Rust has advanced <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-01-syntax.html">generics</a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-02-traits.html">traits</a> with <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/type-aliases.html">type aliasing</a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/types/inference.html">type inference</a> support. Though generics could easily become complex when combined with lifetimes, it’s one of the most powerful features of Rust. 
   Macros: There is also support for metaprogramming using <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-06-macros.html">macros</a>. Rust supports both declarative macros and procedural macros. Macros can be used like annotations, attributes, and functions. 
   Great tooling and one of the best compilers: Rust has one of the best compilers and the best tooling I have seen and experienced (compared to JS world, JVM languages, Go, Python, Ruby, CSharp, PHP, C/C++). It also has excellent documentation, which is shipped with the tooling for offline use. How awesome is that! 
   Excellent community and ecosystem: Rust has one of the most vibrant and friendly communities. The ecosystem is quite young but is one of the fastest-growing. 
 

<p>Usually, a programming language would offer a choice between safety, speed, and high-level abstractions. At the very best, you can pick two of those. For example, with Java/C#/Go, you get safety and high-level abstractions at the cost of runtime overhead, whereas C++ gives you speed and abstractions at the cost of safety. But Rust offers all three and a good developer experience as a bonus. I don’t think many other mainstream languages can claim that.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Rust, not Firefox, is Mozilla’s greatest industry contribution.”</p>

  <p>– TechRepublic</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This doesn’t mean there are no downsides, and Rust is definitely not a silver bullet. There are issues like the steep learning curve and complexity of the language. But it’s the closest thing to a silver bullet, in my opinion. That doesn’t mean you should just start using Rust for everything. If a use case requires speed, concurrency, building system tools, or building CLIs, then Rust is an ideal choice. Personally, I would recommend Rust over C/C++ for any use case unless you are building a tool for a legacy platform that Rust does not support.</p>

      <p>Fractionalized real estate allowing investment from 1000 euro</p>      <p>100% digitized onboarding and KYC processes</p>      <p>90% of compliance &amp; administrative costs saved</p>                              The T-REX tokenization platform allows us to turn real estate into a liquid asset in a fast, secure, and most importantly user-friendly approach. We can split real estate into very small pieces and still manage it efficiently. We tokenize assets in a real partnership spirit with the Tokeny team that has a perfect understanding of our business case and is able to provide tailored solutions. Since we started, we can count on the Tokeny team to help us in any situation, as they are organized and efficient at providing support if we run into any issues.  Jean-Paul ScheurenCo-Founder of BlocHome        
	 
		 
			 The asset class that only the more affluent can afford 
<p><a href="http://blochome.com/">BlocHome</a> is a Luxembourg-based real estate tokenization platform which addresses specifically housing. Its founding team is composed of both senior real estate professionals with decades of experience and tech-savvy entrepreneurs. They have observed that many investors struggle to take part in real estate investment opportunities because of these reasons:</p>
 
 Low affordability: Investing in real estate can be very difficult for retail investors because it requires a large amount of money. 
 Lengthy processes: It can easily take months to complete the process from borrowing money from a bank to getting the apartment ownership notarized. 
 Lack of liquidity: The two issues mentioned above compound the liquidity problem, making it extremely hard to cash in when needed. Many investors have no choice but to sell their properties at low prices at the time when they are in desperate need of capital. 
 
<p>BlocHome team wants to change this status quo. Their goal is to move toward financial inclusion by making high-quality real estate projects selected and managed by experts accessible to all.</p>
 ‘Slicing’ ownership of buildings made possible on blockchain 
<p>When the founding members first heard about blockchain technology, they were fascinated by the concept of peer-to-peer value transfer.&nbsp; After months of intensive study of this technology, they believe it is the infrastructure that can help them achieve their vision thanks to the following characteristics:</p>
 
 Fractionalization: Assets can be divided into as many pieces as asset managers want via tokenization, providing affordable ‘slices’ of assets to their investors. 
 Programmability: Compliance rules and other conditions can be coded into tokens, enabling automated compliance, facilitating the investment or secondary trading process. 
 Transferability: Since compliance rules are embedded into the asset-based tokens,&nbsp; peer-to-peer transfers of assets are enabled, which leads to improved asset liquidity. 
 
 Preparing project and legal documentation for tokenization 
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We must now take advantage of this innovative technology to make real estate investment opportunities available to everyone.” said, Jean-Paul, after the team’s research into blockchain technology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, Luxembourg’s authority has given <a href="https://tokeny.com/luxembourg-gives-the-green-light-for-the-native-issuance-of-security-tokens/">the green light </a>for the native issuance of security tokens in 2021. Naturally, the team decided to tokenize the first real estate called <a href="https://www.blochome.com/en/clapton-residence">CLAPTON Residence</a>, a luxury 8-lot residence in the heart of Luxembourg.</p>
<blockquote><p>
As Jean-Paul states “Tokenization is not a gadget, you need to have a business plan that uses the full capacity of tokenization to democratize access, to achieve low-cost, high-security, and peer-to-peer transactions. We want to develop a service culture amongst the Blochomers’ community. In the end, we will be able to use tokenization at its full capacity and separate ownership from usage and ultimately redefine housing as a service.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>The team designed a sophisticated business plan and model and then joined forces with CMS and Finimmo Luxembourg to prepare documents and provide all the information required by CSSF, the financial regulatory body in Luxembourg, for a non-regulated public offering.</p>
 Technology shield with onchain compliance built-in 
<p>While the documentation process went smoothly, the team faced technical difficulties when it came to bringing assets onto blockchain and embedding compliance rules into asset-based tokens as defined in the documentation. They realized that they needed to find technology experts to help them, and after comparing multiple providers, they opted for Tokeny’s tokenization solutions due to its unique <a href="https://tokeny.com/onchain-finance-leveraging-decentralized-technology-for-capital-markets-infrastructure/">onchain compliance approach</a> that consists by two elements:</p>
 
 Permissioned tokens: The platform uses the ERC-3643 standard to issue assets as permissioned tokens to embed eligibility and offering rules into tokens. 
 Digital identities: The solution links digital identities to tokenized assets, guaranteeing asset ownership (e.g., issuers can recover tokens for investors in the event of wallet loss). More importantly, automated compliance is realized as permissioned tokens can self-check investors’ eligibility through their identities’ verifiable credentials. 
 
<blockquote>
<p>“Tokeny’s solution bridges the gap between blockchain technology and the financial market with a powerful platform, allowing us to apply compliance and control on the ultra-efficient decentralized infrastructure,” Jean-Paul added.</p>
</blockquote>
 Asset management is quicker and cheaper 
<p>As all the securities documents were ready, the tokenization process was straightforward. Tokeny’s team was able to quickly set up the <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-platform/">T-REX platform</a> for them by defining their parameters and branding, as the solution is modular and white-label. Assets were brought to the blockchain in a matter of a few weeks.&nbsp;</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>BlocHome’s investors were able to register and invest directly via the digital platform in three main steps, which are (1) creating an account, (2) completing the KYC check, and (3) transferring funds. Once the process completes, investors can check the real estate-based tokens on their dashboard. The value of their holdings will be updated in their account after each independent 3rd party valuation every 6 months.</p>
<p>As a result, the whole onboarding process and lifecycle management of the securities are digital. The T-REX platform allowed the company to save up to 90% of the time and costs it takes to onboard investors, leading to 800 potential investors onboarded in the first month. As a result, BlocHome has attracted capital from sources it wouldn’t have otherwise reached, including small-scale investors spread across a number of countries.</p>
<p>More excitingly, the team is planning to add, after receiving approval from CSSF, the secondary market solution <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-billboard/">Billboard</a> to the platform in the coming months to allow investors to find an eligible counterparty, then conduct <a href="https://tokeny.com/dvd-transfers/">peer-to-peer transfers</a> whenever they want, freeing up liquidity in this historically illiquid asset. The settlement will be instant onchain and the transfers will be automatically verified.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jean-Paul said: “We are satisfied with Tokeny’s solutions because they are designed with compliance at their core, addressing the need to comply with securities regulations required by law. We can therefore take advantage of all the benefits of blockchain technology for our investors and for us. Having them handle the technical aspect of everything lets us focus on what we do best. Together, we provide a complete digital experience to our investors.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today’s customers do not have one second to spare. They want their identities to be verified, fast. To meet their demands, you need to see more than just the status or result of their identification attempts.</p>



<p>You need a variety of useful features that give you real insights and control. Features like the ability to mine unique insights from your customers’ identification journeys, through smart configuration capabilities to general features like filtering identifications and accessing in depth reports. Ideally, all these features should live in one, easy to navigate place.</p>



<p>At IDnow , we understand the appetite of your customers and the range of services you need to satisfy them, which is why we enable you to actively manage and shape your customers’ identity verification experiences and diligently monitor verification outcomes using our customer portal, My IDnow.</p>



 Unparalleled orchestration for identity proofing 



<p>With My IDnow, you can choose the IDnow products your customers prefer and create intelligent fallback routing straight from the portal. This enables your customers to select their identity verification method of choice while you line up a secondary – or even tertiary – method should their first choice be inconclusive.</p>







<p>For example, a customer may begin the process using VideoIdent yet be unable to verify</p>



<p>their identity due to poor connectivity or being in a loud public space. In this instance, you can direct them straight to AutoIdent, which is better suited to their circumstances and stops them from abandoning the verification process.</p>



<p>Orchestration enables self-service, letting you direct your customers to another form of identity verification when they encounter bottlenecks. This leads to higher conversion rates, disrupts failed attempts, and leads to a far more customer-empowered experience with greater customer satisfaction.</p>



 Powerful insights 



<p>See all the information relating to the progress of your customer’s identification journey and visualize your customer’s identity verification.</p>







<p></p>



<p>Using My IDnow, you can access specific identity details and linked photos, videos and documents, and the up-to-date status of their application. From here, you can quickly and easily manage and verify customer identities.</p>



 Deeper customer analytics 



<p>Use vast identity verification metrics to analyse their business, maximize the strength of IDnow orchestration and understand customer onboarding better than ever before.</p>







<p>These metrics include the volume, conversion, SLA, channel breakdown, and abandonment rate of identity verification attempts, giving you unbeatable insights into your conversion rates, channel mix and the ability to spot and cancel fraudulent details.</p>



 Complete configuration 



<p>You can control the look and feel of your identity verification service with our customizable frontend design. Take control of your mobile app or web page, changing the font, color palette, button shapes, and company logo to showcase your company brand.</p>

<p>We are delighted to announce the launch of <a href="https://didsign.io/">DIDsign</a>, a decentralized way to sign and verify files privately and securely. DIDsign is designed to make online services more convenient and safer in Web3, the next generation of the internet.</p><p>DIDsign allows you to sign any digital file — PDFs, audio, video, software — directly in your browser using a unique decentralized identifier (DID). You can download your signed file (or group of files) together with the signature to your device as a zip file and send it to anyone via your preferred method (email, Telegram, WhatsApp, etc.). The recipient can then easily verify that the file has not been tampered with. Signing, sending and verifying files is always&nbsp;free!</p><p>Using DIDsign, several people can sign the same document separately and confirm that it was signed. For example if a contract needs to be approved by several parties, each party can sign it and send their signature to the others. The document can then be checked against each signature, showing that each party signed the document in its original&nbsp;form.</p> Real-world use&nbsp;cases <p>With DIDsign, documents can be signed by anyone with an on-chain KILT DID. The recipient can then verify the files on <a href="https://didsign.io/">DIDsign.io</a> — no blockchain experience needed! Only the sender and recipient have access to the files; they are not stored anywhere else. This provides a safe and private way of signing&nbsp;files.</p><p>In addition to text documents, DIDsign can be used for signing a video file, making sure it came from the right person and hasn’t been tampered with. Researchers could use DIDsign for verifying new research discoveries; doctors could use DIDsign for signing and verifying lab reports with colleagues in clinical settings. Developers could use DIDsign for signing software — if a single line of code is changed, the signature isn’t&nbsp;valid.</p><p>And DIDsign provides a new mechanism for Web3 processes like signing contracts in DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) or in the metaverse. Your avatar could even have its own DID for signing contracts. Decentralized ownership needs decentralized signatures.</p><p>DIDsign was built on KILT by B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH (BTE), a subsidiary of BOTLabs GmbH, the initial developer of KILT Protocol.</p> How to Create DIDs on&nbsp;KILT <p>A digital identity contains your own unique “decentralized identifier” (DID), a string of numbers and letters that looks like&nbsp;this:</p><p>did:kilt:4s8kEBWV9nwU5znxmfR7DVA31DdBoqYGj49SAiAPzzigwJDm</p><p>You can create your DID for free using <a href="https://www.sporran.org/">Sporran</a>, a wallet for KILT Coins and credentials developed by BTE. In order to use DIDsign, you’ll need to <a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SocialKYC_How_To_Create_On-Chain_DIDs_19Jan.pdf">upgrade your free DID to an on-chain DID</a> in Sporran, which anchors it on the KILT blockchain.</p><p>On-chain DIDs require a deposit of 2 KILT Coins and a small transaction fee (currently less than 0.01 KILT). This deposit remains on your account and is unlocked if you later delete your on-chain&nbsp;DID.</p><p>DIDsign can be used in large enterprises in a scalable way. While each signer requires an on-chain DID, the deposit and fees don’t necessarily need to be paid by the owner of that DID. Instead, businesses could pay the KILT Coin deposits for employee DIDs. In this way employees don’t face any of the hurdles that first-time users may have when buying&nbsp;crypto.</p> Your data under your&nbsp;control <p>Unlike centralized services that currently offer digital signatures, DIDsign does not store any data. You sign and store the files locally on your personal device (laptop or mobile) without external servers, providing privacy by design. Using the DIDsign website, the file recipient can quickly and easily verify that the signature is valid and that the contents have not been changed in any way since&nbsp;signing.</p> How does it&nbsp;work? <p>Signing with DIDsign requires a Sporran wallet (<a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/How-to-Set-Up-Sporran_22-Nov.pdf">setup instructions here</a>) and <a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SocialKYC_How_To_Create_On-Chain_DIDs_19Jan.pdf">an on-chain&nbsp;DID</a>.</p><p>Once you have set these up, you can use this step-by-step <a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/DIDsign_How-to_guide_17March.pdf">guide</a> to sign your files, or follow the walkthrough below:</p><p>Step 1: Go to <a href="https://didsign.io/">DIDsign,io</a>.</p><p>Step 2: Drag and drop the files you want to sign into the dropzone, or add them from your&nbsp;device.</p><p>Step 3: Click the blue “SIGN” button below the&nbsp;files.</p><p>This triggers a Sporran&nbsp;pop-up.</p><p>Step 4: Enter your password in the Sporran to sign the files. (Please note, if you accidentally close Sporran during this process, click “DISMISS” on the “Signature needed” pop-up to restart.)</p><p>Step 5: Save the signed files with the signature file in one zip file that can be easily sent via email&nbsp;etc.</p><p>That’s it!</p><p>The recipient then goes to the “VERIFY” section on the <a href="https://didsign.io/">DIDsign website</a> and adds the zip&nbsp;file.</p><p>DIDsign now verifies that the signature matches the file contents and the on-chain DID on the KILT blockchain. If the file was not changed and the DID matches the signature, then a green checkmark is displayed:</p><p>If files have been altered, the verification fails and DIDsign shows an orange exclamation mark:</p><p>The signer should share their DID with the recipient so that they can make sure the files come from the right&nbsp;person:</p><p>DIDsign also integrates verification of credentials issued by trusted entities such as <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/announcing-socialkyc-built-on-kilt-65a29a974d07">SocialKYC</a>, adding extra layers of security to the signed files. SocialKYC is an attestation service built on KILT that confirms ownership of your accounts (email, Twitter, Discord, GitHub) after you prove that you control&nbsp;them.</p><p>If users choose to make some of these credentials public, by exposing them via service endpoints of their DID, recipients will have more evidence about who signed the file than in Web2 solutions.</p><p>Future versions of DIDsign will also include the ability&nbsp;to:</p>  Include KILT credentials directly in a signed&nbsp;file  Add a unique name to your&nbsp;DID  Self-attest timestamps anchored on the KILT blockchain at the time of&nbsp;signing.  <p>Keep up-to-date with these new developments by following the KILT <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">blog</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Kiltprotocol">Twitter</a>, or join the conversation on&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/HztRqvzbhG">Discord</a>.</p> About KILT&nbsp;Protocol <p><a href="http://kilt.io/">KILT</a> is a decentralized blockchain identity protocol for issuing self-sovereign, anonymous and verifiable credentials.

<p>Hoe om te gaan met persoonlijke data is een van de belangrijkste kwesties van onze tijd. Te vaak haalt dit onderwerp de krantenkoppen om de verkeerde redenen. Het publiek wil gewoon dat bedrijven die zich bezig houden met persoonlijke data ethisch, open en transparant zijn over hun activiteiten.</p>



<p>Daarom zijn we enorm trots dat we in 2022 opnieuw de titel MyData Operator Award mogen dragen!</p>



<p>Maar wat houdt dit in? Kortgezegd krijgt een organisatie de MyData Operator Award wanneer zij individuen in staat stellen toegang te krijgen tot hun persoonlijke gegevens, deze te beheren &amp; opnieuw te gebruiken op een mensgerichte manier, en voldoet zij aan de gouden standaard voor het beheer van persoonlijke gegevens.</p>



<p>Dit betekent dus dat wij erkend worden om onze ethische benadering van persoonlijke gegevens en dat individuen hier zelf de controle op hebben.</p>

<p>This is a technical article about another of Anonyome Labs’ contributions to&nbsp;supporting the ongoing development of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/?s=decentralized+identity">decentralized identity</a>&nbsp;–&nbsp;the future of privacy and identity management on the internet.</p>



<p>Quick read: Through extensive research, we have discovered that using an air-gapped and security-tightening wallet is the optimal approach to safely storing $CHEQ tokens from our&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/02/anonyome-labs-joins-the-cheqd-mainnet/">cheqd mainnet validator node</a>. This solution is known as a cold wallet because it’s a cryptocurrency wallet that is not connected to the internet, which makes it difficult to remotely steal the assets stored in it. As the cryptocurrency space continues to develop and gain traction, the importance of securing tokens is becoming more apparent. Cryptocurrencies are very desirable to criminals and we’re seeing more hacks<a href="https://www.hedgewithcrypto.com/cryptocurrency-exchange-hacks/">&nbsp;happening to various exchanges</a>. With Anonyome Labs continuing to develop and participate in the SSI space through the cheqd network, putting privacy and security first helps set the pathway for the future. This cold wallet concept is an important step along the path.</p>



<p>Long read: Since&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/02/anonyome-labs-joins-the-cheqd-mainnet/">Anonyome Labs joined the cheqd mainnet</a>, our&nbsp;<a href="https://explorer.cheqd.io/validator/cheqdvaloper1djh8syeug9ylw7v8ca6jvq3s59klzmm4fm949w">validator</a>&nbsp;has been actively participating in the network and earning $CHEQ tokens. The validator earns a commission on the staked tokens from other parties’ delegations as well on those that are self-delegated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tokens and cryptocurrencies in general continue to attract criminals who exploit vulnerabilities in these newly developed technologies. As a result, the decentralized finance and decentralized identity communities face&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/lcx-loses-usd-8m-hot-wallet-hack.htm">hot wallet hacks</a>&nbsp;and the resulting theft of personal or company assets. To combat potential theft or loss of tokens, Anonyome Labs researched and implemented a cold wallet storage solution for its $CHEQ tokens which addresses the risks in running a validator node.</p>



 About cheqd and $CHEQ 



<p></p>



<p>Since its launch,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cheqd.io/">cheqd</a>&nbsp;has provided a utility token ($CHEQ) that will allow future issuers, receivers, holders and node operators to pay each other privately and securely for digital credentials. A suite of mobile and backend tools will allow developers like Anonyome Labs to use cheqd decentralized identifiers (DIDs) for SSI applications. While the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/node/architecture/adr-list/adr-002-cheqd-did-method">cheqd DID method is still being implemented,</a>&nbsp;node operators can already contribute by hosting nodes to participate in the network. As we said, the cheqd network is maintained by node operators that earn tokens through commissions via participant delegations. The so-called “nodes” run the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/node/">cheqd-noded</a> software, which is the server portion of the cheqd network stack built using&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk">Cosmos SDK</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint">Tendermint</a>. Nodes actively participate in the network by validating transactions, signing and writing new blocks to the public ledger, using computer resources.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 Risks involved with running a validator node 



<p></p>



<p>Operating a node on the cheqd mainnet requires tokens to initiate governance proposals and to pay for transactions. But not all the tokens that the validator earns need to remain in their wallet and could be kept on another wallet less prone to vulnerabilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The validator’s wallet is potentially vulnerable to attack in two ways:&nbsp;</p>



  Tokens can be sent from the validator’s wallet to any other $CHEQD wallet via the cheqd-noded command line interface (CLI). The CLI transaction command is protected by a keyring passphrase which is created during the setup phase. In the circumstance where access to the validator and keyring passphrase are compromised, all tokens stored on the validator could be transferred to any other wallet. Such an attack would require a weak passphrase in order to be brute-forced.<br>  If all tokens are stored on the validator and the recovery phrase (mnemonic) were to be lost, the tokens would not be recoverable if anything were to occur to the validator. For example, in the event of a corrupt or deleted node with no backups, without the mnemonic the tokens would be lost forever.  



<p>The solution to address these risks for Anonyome Labs is to successfully implement a cold wallet to store the majority of tokens it earns and owns.&nbsp;</p>



 What are cold wallets? 



<p></p>



<p>Cold wallets are devices that generate and store private keys used by cryptocurrency wallets while remaining&nbsp;offline. Being offline is an advantage because the private keys are never shared without authorization. The term “air gap” in this context describes the process of physically separating access to assets from a security perspective.</p>



 How does a cold wallet address security risks? 



<p></p>



<p>Using a secondary,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/security/the-secure-element-whistanding-security-attacks">security-hardened</a>&nbsp;wallet allows for tokens to be securely backed up. Any tokens that the validator isn’t using to perform transactions can be sent to the hardware cold wallet address. Once there, the tokens are air gapped and not accessible without authorization from the cold wallet device. The fact that a cold wallet is a physical medium ensures the assets stored on it are truly in the owner’s hands.</p>



 Which options are available for $CHEQ? 



<p></p>



 Ledger Nano Hardware Wallet 



<p></p>



<p>While the Ledger Nano natively supports the Cosmos Interchain it doesn’t support $CHEQD natively and must be configured via an interchain wallet such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.keplr.app/">Keplr</a>,&nbsp;which provides an interface to pass cheqd transactions to the Ledger Nano. This configuration alone doesn’t provide an interface to perform decentralized governance tasks, so Keplr needs to be connected via Omniflix.</p>



<p><a href="https://cheqd.omniflix.co/">Omniflix</a>&nbsp;is a dashboard used for staking, delegation and governance on the cheqd network. It connects with the&nbsp;<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap">Keplr Chrome Extension</a>&nbsp;through the extension’s&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.keplr.app/api/">API</a>,&nbsp;which authorizes any transaction through the Ledger Nano linked to the account. The Ledger Nano acts as the security-hardening component of the cheqd wallet since it must be unlocked with a 4-8 digit PIN code and be physically present when interoperating. This means that no tokens can be taken from the wallet unless the ledger owner authorizes it.&nbsp;</p>



 Ledger Live 



<p></p>



<p>The Ledger Nano devices use Ledger Live to install individual cryptocurrency “apps” onto the device. While Cosmos is supported as an app, there is no direct support for cheqd within Ledger Live. As a result, Ledger Live is not suited as a wallet to store, stake or delegate $CHEQD tokens and is only used to install the Cosmos app. The Ledger Cosmos app, when connected and unlocked within Keplr, allows the wallet to communicate to the cheqd network. Ledger Live also acts as a further management console for the Ledger hardware wallet to change preferences, settings and perform important firmware updates.</p>



 AirGap vault and wallet 



<p></p>



<p>AirGap vault is a novel approach to storing wallet private keys offline. It’s novel in the sense that no specific hardware is required, only an app on any iOS or Android device. Once the app is installed, the device can be put on airplane mode to remain completely offline. While AirGap supports Cosmos and staking of tokens, it doesn’t yet support $CHEQ tokens.</p>



 Our decision and implementation 



<p></p>



<p>Due to the limited adoption and support for $CHEQ tokens among wallet providers, the best option to date for securing assets is on a Ledger Nano device that interfaces through Keplr and Omniflix.</p>



<p>To summarize, this lets us:</p>



  back up excess tokens on a separate air-gapped wallet  stake air-gapped wallet tokens to the Anonyome Labs’ validator and claim the rewards  transfer tokens from the air-gapped wallet to the validator if it requires more tokens to process transactions.  



<p>Anonyome Labs has employed a multi-stage approach to transferring tokens off the validator, which requires:&nbsp;</p>



  biometric authentication  two-factor authentication (2FA) command line access  air-gapped cold wallet authorization  password manager access to strong passwords.&nbsp;  



<p>This process is audited and separates roles and duties, with need-to-know principles limiting the access to company assets both internally and externally. The process for backing up tokens from the validator’s address is outlined next.&nbsp;</p>



 Process for backing up tokens 



<p></p>



 &nbsp;Prerequisites 



<p></p>



  <a href="https://www.ledger.com/">Ledger Nano (S/X) device</a>  <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013349800-Update-Ledger-Nano-X-firmware?docs=true">up-to-date firmware</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;    <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4411149814417-Set-up-and-use-Keplr-to-access-your-Ledger-Cosmos-ATOM-account?docs=true">Cosmos app installed</a>&nbsp;through&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live/download">Ledger Live</a>    <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap">Keplr Chrome extension</a>&nbsp;with Ledger Nano (S/X) imported  Keplr connected to the&nbsp;<a href="https://cheqd.omniflix.co/">cheqd Omniflix dashboard</a>.  



<p></p>







  An authorized user uses biometric authentication to sign into their device and open their 2FA app.  The user logs into Validator EC2 Instance using the correct certificate file and 2-factor authentication code.  The user accesses the cheqd node CLI to send unused tokens to the Ledger hardware wallet address.  Keplr asks for the Ledger Nano to be connected and unlocked with the on-device pin and to open the Cosmos app.  Keplr Chrome extension is unlocked using the password stored in a password manager protected by another password or biometric.&nbsp;  The user is authorized to send, receive, delegate, stake and claim $CHEQ tokens. The ledger must remain connected and unlocked during any of these actions.  



 Conclusion 



<p></p>



<p>Through extensive research, Anonyome Labs has discovered that using an air-gapped and security-tightening wallet is the optimal approach to safely storing $CHEQ tokens from our&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/02/anonyome-labs-joins-the-cheqd-mainnet/">cheqd mainnet validator node</a>. As the cryptocurrency space continues to develop and gain traction, the importance of securing tokens is becoming more apparent, to mitigate the risks from malicious actors. With Anonyome Labs continuing to develop and participate in the SSI space through the cheqd network, putting privacy and security first helps set the pathway for the future.</p>



 Key terms to know 



<p></p>



<p>Validator – a node responsible for verifying transactions on a blockchain. Once transactions are verified, they’re added to the public distributed ledger</p>



<p>Node – a computer that connects to a cryptocurrency network. It acts as a relay point which keeps a copy of the ledger and verifies its validity</p>



<p>Ledger – a public record of transactions that is replicated and distributed across the participating network to its peers (other nodes on the network)</p>



<p>Staking – the process of depositing cryptocurrency into a smart contract on a network to receive tokens as a reward. This is considered similar to an interest-bearing savings account</p>



<p>Delegation – the process of picking validators to stake tokens in. Holders vest their tokens in validators they trust to process transactions and earn rewards</p>



<p>Keyring passphrase – the password that restricts access to the cheqd-noded command line interface</p>



<p>DID – a type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. This can refer to any subject, person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity etc.</p>



<p>Verifiable credential – an open standard for digital credentials. Verifiable credentials represent statements made by an issuer in a tamper-evident and privacy-respecting manner.</p>



<p>Hot wallet – a cryptocurrency wallet that is always connected to the internet and cryptocurrency network</p>



<p>Cold wallet – a cryptocurrency wallet that is not connected to the internet, making it difficult to remotely steal the assets stored in it</p>



<p>Air gap – a metaphorical description of the conceptual gap required by the physical separation between computers</p>



<p>Inter-chain – the way all blockchains and traditional systems can connect in a secure manner</p>

<p>Mydex CIC has been awarded ‘MyData Operator’ status by <a href="https://mydata.org/">MyData Global</a>, an international non-profit organisation whose purpose is to “empower people by improving their right to self-determination regarding their personal&nbsp;data”.</p><p>The award symbolises best practice that reassures individuals, governments, investors, and other companies and organisations alike.</p><p>MyData Global says the Awards reflect the rising demand for a more ethical and human-centric approach to personal&nbsp;data.</p><blockquote>“The Award process gives companies and organisations the opportunity to transparently communicate their business practices and service offering, raising trust in their operations. Further, companies must clarify how they ensure that individuals remain primary beneficiaries of their services.”</blockquote><p>Its press release adds: “As promoted by the European Commission, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_6428">putting people in the centre of digital transformations is needed for a safe and sustainable digital future</a>. Further, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_6428">boosting data sharing and ensuring its trustworthiness</a> is critical to reaping the benefits of our digitised lives. Organisations awarded with the MyData Operator Award are vital enablers for such a vision, providing value for companies and individuals alike.”</p> A long way to&nbsp;go <p>Mydex CEO David Alexander commented on this Award&nbsp;saying:</p><blockquote>“This month Mydex celebrates its 15th birthday. We are particularly proud to receive this Award because its existence and content reflects and develops many of the principles that we pioneered in the ten years before MyData Global was&nbsp;formed.</blockquote><blockquote>“But for many reasons, winning such Awards is just a first small step. The MyData movement currently faces three big challenges.</blockquote><blockquote>“First, it needs to achieve impact at scale — to embed citizen data empowerment into the everyday lives of people and organisations, to become the ‘new business as usual’. Mydex may be further down this road than most, given our longer history and the maturity of our live, operational platform (for example, the fact that we have had independently awarded accreditation under ISO 27001 for Information Security and Management for nine years running). But this is a long journey and we are still only at the beginning.</blockquote><blockquote>“Second, as the movement grows we need to achieve full interoperability between MyData Operators. People should be able to move their data where they want to, and it would be a tragedy if a movement devoted to empowering citizens ends up imprisoning them in new data&nbsp;silos.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Third, founders come first. Then profiteers. We need to develop strong, robust and resilient ways of ensuring mission sustainability so that over time, initiatives and organisations claiming to promote citizen empowerment are not subverted or overtaken by forces more interested in data monetisation and profiteering.”</blockquote><p>Mydex was one of the first organisations to sign the MyData Declaration, when MyData Global was first established in 2018. So far, 41 companies and organisations have been given MyData Operator Award status, reflecting the growing movement for ways to empower citizens with their own&nbsp;data.</p><p>To achieve the Award, organisations have to answer multiple detailed questions about how its services work, what technologies they use, how it is governed, what role the organisation plays in the data ecosystem, its business model, how its services are actually being used, how individuals and others benefit from them, along with detailed questions about identity management, permissions management, data models, interoperability provisions, and use of data standards.</p><p>You can see what Mydex’s application says&nbsp;<a href="https://apply.mydata.org/gallery/mPLRwJzJ/rbvoWgRr?search=66b23b0744e87aa6-20">here</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/mydata-operator-status-awarded-to-mydex-2916d1c48c3d">MyData Operator Status awarded to Mydex</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Humpty Calderon, our Head of Community, was invited to participate in an online AMA event held by Binance with the theme “Building The Infrastructure And Delivering The Tools Of Web3”. Humpty shared the progress Ontology is making with Binance users, answered various questions about Ontology EVM, and also airdropped $10,000 of&nbsp;ONT.  We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1499467144853024768?s=20&amp;t=l7Q0LHRzoxnxYuGd6NOJTw">weekly Discord Community Call</a>, with the theme “$10 million EVM Fund”. The fund is divided into three categories: first, to provide financial support for developers to deploy/build applications; second, to provide bounties for maintaining Ontology network security; third, to organize hackathons for more developers.  We held our Telegram weekly Community Discussion, led by Benny, an Ontology Harbinger from our Asian community. He shared “How Women Empower Blockchain”: If women want to gain a safer and fairer position in the blockchain industry, they need to use DID to break the traditional identity framework and get the help of more resources.

One big reason is the overall interoperability improvements such a development provides. In addition, a seamless connection between EVM-capable ecosystems unlocks a broader user base and more liquidity and allows for the development of more complex products, services, and solutions.”</p><p>Since its inception, Ontology has always been deeply engaged in decentralized digital identity technology, and hopes to provide more mature DID and data solutions in the wider Web3 field. Therefore, Ontology has recently integrated EVM to provide financial, technical and platform support for the majority of Ethereum developers, helping them to quickly build applications and achieve breakthrough innovations.</p> Read this month’s report in your preferred language:   <a href="https://medium.com/p/da902d4caad1/edit">中文</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/1abcd456fab/edit">繁體中文</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/858c615944af/edit">日本語</a>  한국어(coming soon)  <a href="https://medium.com/p/406eba680a09/edit">Española</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/a9338aeb7551/edit">Français</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/d5f6148a30bc/edit">Slovenčina</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/b4a055b0b9a8/edit">Tiếng Việt</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/1760cb8e964/edit">Hindi</a>  русский(coming soon)  <a href="https://medium.com/p/d11d73d05940/edit">Tagalog</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/cf12d0241230/edit">සිංහල</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/cb2bddea7186/edit">Türk</a>  Italiano(coming soon)  <a href="https://theontologyteam.medium.com/ontology-monthly-report-february-2022-%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%82%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%BE-40b0945c013e">বাংলা</a>  <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

			<p>After launching the <a href="https://infocert.digital/infocert-continues-its-growth-at-international-level-from-today-available-the-new-romanian-website/">Romanian language portal</a> last June, InfoCert announces the release of two more portals dedicated to two important European geographies. Countries already served by InfoCert through its local sales force but also through the ever-growing partnerships for the resale of services and products.</p>
<p>For some years InfoCert has started a commercial presence in Poland and Hungary for the development of the local market, considered two extremely important countries for the development of new business opportunities related to digitalization. The decision is part of InfoCert’s wider strategic plan for international expansion and, in particular, in Eastern Europe where the company is already active in countries such as Slovenia, Croatia and Romania.</p>
<p>Today, in line with this strategy, we are pleased to announce the publication on our website infocert.digital of a section tailor made to the Polish market and one to the Hungarian market, navigable at these links:</p>
 
 <a href="https://infocert.digital/hu/home/">https://infocert.digital/hu/home/</a> 
 <a href="https://infocert.digital/pl/home/">https://infocert.digital/pl/home/</a> 
 
<p>The digital market of both countries is characterized by a strong dynamism and rapid growth in technological innovation and use of Trusted Services, making both countries key drivers in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Through the contact form it is also available, also for Polish and Hungarian companies, the registration to the InfoCert Partner Program, which offers important advantages to those who want to integrate InfoCert solutions with their services or release them to their customers.</p>

<p>Dopo aver lanciato lo scorso giugno <a href="https://infocert.digital/it/infocert-continua-la-crescita-a-livello-internazionale-da-oggi-disponibile-il-nuovo-portale-in-rumeno/">il portale in lingua romena</a>, InfoCert annuncia l’uscita di altri due portali in lingua, dedicati a importanti geografie europee: Polonia e Ungheria.</p>



<p>I due Paesi sono già presidiati da InfoCert grazie alla propria forza commerciale locale, ma anche tramite le sempre più numerose partnership per la rivendita di servizi e prodotti.</p>



<p>Polonia e Ungheria rappresentano due realtà estremamente importanti per lo sviluppo del mercato locale e di nuove opportunità di business legate alla digitalizzazione. La loro copertura rientra nel più ampio piano strategico di espansione internazionale di InfoCert, in particolare nell’area Eastern Europe, dove l’azienda è già attiva in Paesi quali Slovenia, Croazia, e Romania.</p>



<p>Oggi, coerentemente con questa strategia, vengono pubblicate sul nostro sito web infocert.digital una sezione tradotta e dedicata al mercato Polacco ed una al mercato Ungherese, navigabili a questi link:</p>



 
 <a href="https://infocert.digital/hu/home/">https://infocert.digital/hu/home/</a> 
 <a href="https://infocert.digital/pl/home/">https://infocert.digital/pl/home/</a> 
 



<p>Il mercato digitale di entrambi i Paesi è caratterizzato da una forte dinamicità ed una rapida crescita riguardo innovazione tecnologica e utilizzo dei Trusted Services, rendendoli entrambi fondamentali elementi trainanti dell’area Eastern Europe.</p>



<p>Attraverso gli appositi form di contatto è inoltre disponibile, anche per le aziende polacche e ungheresi, iscriversi all’InfoCert Partner Program, che offre importanti vantaggi a quanti desiderano integrare le soluzioni InfoCert coi propri servizi o semplicemente rilasciare le stesse ai propri clienti.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Anne Bailey</a></p> Hyperautomation has the potential to disrupt and accelerate business all over the world. It is necessary to be prepared. 
<p>There is automation, and there is hyperautomation. Buckle up!</p>
<p>Before we get to hyperautomation, we should start with automation within the enterprise in the context of business process automation. Or as it is often called, <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lb80333/robotic-process-automation/">robotic process automation</a> (RPA). First of all, RPA is a software solution to automate repetitive tasks in the organization like calculations, record-keeping, making reports, filling forms, and much more. RPA typically handles digital data that must be worked on or transformed in some way. If a human employee must click, drag-n-drop, copy and paste, etc. with mind-numbing repetition, that is a great indicator of if a task could be automated with RPA.</p>
 What is Hyperautomation? 
<p>RPA is a software “robot” that imitates the actions of a human users – keystrokes, mouse movements, and applications used. Once automated, these tasks take place in the background while the human employee is doing other tasks, working in parallel. An important observation to make here is that RPA “robots” do not know what they are doing; they are programmed to mimic the actions of a human user click for click. There is no flexibility for non-typical cases.</p>
<p>Hyperautomation integrates <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/insights/artificial-intelligence">AI/ML</a> in order to automate enterprise automation. In a nutshell – automate the automation. This can achieve enterprise-level scalability for automation that uses methodical processes to identify processes and tasks that could be automated, as well as increasing the capabilities and flexibility of the automation “bots” that carry out those tasks.</p>
 The underlying technologies 
<p>Hyperautomation is a concept, not a single technology. Take a look under the hood at the tech making it work.</p>
<p><a href="https://searchcio.techtarget.com/Ultimate-guide-to-RPA-robotic-process-automation">RPA</a> is a foundational part of hyperautomation since it delivered a lot of the groundwork for business process automation. It made great progress into no and low code development options and many useful integrations. These capabilities are carried over into hyperautomation for better usability for business users.</p>
<p>But of course hyperautomation doesn’t just automate the tasks, but it automates the process of automating tasks. This requires discovering processes and tasks that could be automated with what is called <a href="https://searchcio.techtarget.com/feature/6-ways-AI-and-automation-could-improve-process-mining">process and task mining</a>. This uses data from an event log to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_mining">identify and assess processes</a> from the backend.</p>
<p>But most notable of all is the incorporation of AI/ML for more dynamic automation, using natural language processing (NLP) to better handle unstructured data, machine learning models for computer vision, continuous learning and improvement, and much more.</p>
 Hyperautomation synergy with future technologies (machine learning, AI) 
<p>Automation and AI/ML are a great match. Here is why:</p>
<p>AI/ML thrives on data-rich tasks that are repetitive because at its core it is a mathematical model that ingests data and returns a prediction based on its previous training. It requires extensive training on tasks that are all similar to each other, and after the model is trained is only suitable to continue tackling tasks like those it handled in training.</p>
 
<blockquote>
<p>A strong AI use case leverages the availability of historical data, real-time data, and the ability to fulfil a repetitive task. – <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/an80266/emerging-technologies-fostering-digital-business-innovation-healthcare/">Advisory Note: Emerging Technologies Fostering Digital Business Innovation</a></p>
</blockquote>
 
<p>A more existential quality of AI/ML is its ability to disrupt business as usual. Concepts of autonomous vehicles&nbsp;will change the landscape of cities as well as the logistics industry with uncalculatable legal implications, AI is a tool that will escalate the cybersecurity conflict&nbsp;between defenders and attackers, and its contribution to digital identities will change how humans interact online and in the real world. Hyperautomation (with the help of AI/ML) is changing the approach to enterprise process automation by removing active human participation more and more. The human is shifting into an oversight position while the day-to-day tasks of running the business are handled automatically which will change the work landscape in years to come.</p>
 Curse and blessing of Hyperautomation 
<p>Hyperautomation is a disruptive concept. And like any disruption, it can help and it can harm.</p>
<p>Efficiency and reducing repetitive work for human employees should be a familiar theme when considering AI/ML, and it is definitely the case here with hyperautomation. Overall, it is relieving the workload of human employees that manage time-consuming tasks. With the implementation of hyperautomation, many tasks are removed from human employee’s workloads to free up their time for more demanding and creative work.</p>
<p>But it is also very likely that many human roles in the organization will be made redundant, causing <a href="https://www.itproportal.com/features/how-will-automation-change-the-human-workplace/">job loss</a> for many individuals. And since hyperautomation is likely to see widespread adoption across most industries, human employees with similar skills will be eliminated from their roles across all industries and making it unlikely that they will be rehired elsewhere without significant upskilling. Implementing hyperautomation comes with a responsibility to train employees for other types of work, or to offer compensation for upskilling when they are let go.</p>
<p>Security must also be integrated into hyperautomation initiatives. Connected data and systems provides a larger threat surface and potentially more damaging data breaches if the organization is attacked. <a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2020/11/what-hyperautomation-means-for-identity-and-data-governance/">Data governance</a> that is adapted for automated tasks must be in place, especially for sensitive data that may be part of the automated process. Appropriate access management for both humans and bots must be in place, along with constant monitoring for vulnerabilities.</p>
 Hyperautomation practices taking over business 
<p>Hyperautomation isn’t about automating exact tasks, but about reshaping the way the organization approaches tasks. Here are some common use cases:</p>
<p>Goal-oriented hyperautomation: The organization may define a goal to improve a particular KPI, like time needed to process invoices. Although the task may belong to a particular department, it could pull data from different departmental siloes, require communication between different team members, or an approval from a manager. Begin with a key metric to determine were to focus your hyperautomation initiative. Examples include focusing on accounts payable, ordering, document processing, customer service, and much more.</p>
 Vendor map: Guidance for you 
<p>This is a dynamic vendor space with many new entrants. Here are a few vendors to get you started:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.uipath.com/">UiPath</a>, <a href="https://www.automationanywhere.com/">Automation Anywhere</a>,<a href="https://www.blueprism.com/?selected-locale=%E2%9C%93"> Blue Prism</a>, <a href="https://www.celonis.com/company">Celonis</a>, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/05/26/microsoft-tackles-hyperautomation-with-power-automate-rpa-update/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.kryonsystems.com/">Kryon</a>, <a href="https://www.workfusion.com/business-automation/">WorkFusion</a>, <a href="https://www.abbyy.com/">ABBYY</a>, <a href="https://www.pega.com/hyperautomation">Pegasystems</a>, and many more.</p>
 Conclusion &nbsp; 
<p>Think carefully about how you approach hyperautomation. It has great potential to serve your organization if managed in a strategic and intentional way.</p>
<p>Hyperautomation is a tool for the digitally transformed organization. Organizations that are successfully operating digitally have critically examined and adapted their business and operating model to fit the changing world and its expectations for user experience, sustainability, ubiquitous connection, and global scalability. Digital transformation does not follow a single recipe, but is unique to each organization, its mission, and its existing and future <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/guest/creating-an-innovative-identity-fabric-structure">IT architecture</a>. Hyperautomation better serves the digitally transformed organization by benefiting from connected cross-organizational data, well-architected security and identity management systems and clear business goals that automation helps to achieve.</p>
<p>Be critical of implementing a hyperautomation initiative. Question how it fits with your organization’s digital transformation plan. Does widespread automation of internal processes really help accomplish your business goals, or is it just a cost-cutting measure? Account for the human cost on your organization, including the changing demographics of consumers as more and more are made redundant and will make different buying choices as a result. And build accountability into the individual tasks being automated, with visibility into why a task was handled the way it was. In light of the massive scalability that hyperautomation brings, the individual should not be lost.</p>

<p>LegalInvoice OpenHUB consente l’interoperabilità tra sistemi di Paesi diversi e supporta la crescita internazionale delle imprese.</p>



<p>Roma-Milano, 16 marzo 2022 – InfoCert (Tinexta Group), la più grande Autorità di Certificazione europea, ed EDICOM, provider internazionale di servizi di eBusiness, annunciano di aver siglato una partnership per lo sviluppo e la commercializzazione di LegalInvoice OpenHUB, un nuovo servizio di fatturazione elettronica internazionale.</p>



<p><a>LegalInvoice</a> OpenHUB agevolerà i clienti enterprise nella fatturazione elettronica in un sempre maggior numero di nazioni, rendendo trasparente la conversione nei diversi formati previsti dai sistemi di fatturazione locali.</p>



<p>Nel corso del 2022 infatti, nuovi Paesi – fra cui per esempio Portogallo, Polonia, Panama e Paraguay – introdurranno l’obbligatorietà dei processi di fatturazione elettronica in ambito B2G e/o B2B e LegalInvoice OpenHUB permetterà ai clienti enterprise di essere pronti a rispettare gli obblighi legislativi per i flussi di fatturazione elettronica internazionale.</p>



<p>L’invio e la ricezione dei documenti elettronici potranno avvenire senza la necessità di integrare, nel processo di e-invoicing, tool specifici per l’adeguamento delle fatture ai singoli formati locali: le fatture generate utilizzando il canale LegalInvoice già attivato saranno poi convertite nel formato richiesto e trasferite al sistema di interscambio/Hub del Paese di destinazione grazie all’integrazione con la Global eInvoicing Platform di EDICOM.</p>



<p>InfoCert ed EDICOM – entrambe service provider accreditati per la fatturazione elettronica in Italia – hanno contribuito allo sviluppo di LegalInvoice OpenHUB con le rispettive e consolidate esperienze internazionali nel campo dei servizi digitali e, in particolare, proprio della fatturazione elettronica.</p>



<p>InfoCert, insieme ad AgID e all’Agenzia delle Entrate, è stata infatti key technological partner in ben tre progetti Europei – eIGOR, EeISI, SCALES – tutti propedeutici all’attuazione della direttiva EU 2014/55 sulla fatturazione elettronica conforme allo standard Europeo EN 16931-1.</p>



<p>“Siamo molto soddisfatti dell’accordo con EDICOM, che, ne siamo convinti, aggiungerà valore alla nostra offerta e ci permetterà di essere ancora più vicini ai nostri clienti nel loro percorso di crescita e trasformazione digitale”, commenta Daniele Citterio di InfoCert-Tinexta Group. “Il business internazionale è sempre di più una chiave di crescita strategica per le imprese, che hanno quindi bisogno di soluzioni uniche, semplici e veloci che permettano di agevolare gli scambi con altri Paesi”.</p>



<p>EDICOM, dal canto suo, non solo ha sviluppato un’offerta di servizi eBusiness specifica per il mercato internazionale (Global e-Invoicing Platform), ma ha anche partecipato al progetto Europeo GOVEIN19 per l’implementazione del formato fattura Europeo in ambito sanitario.</p>



<p>“Questo accordo è il frutto di una grande sinergia tra le due società che permetterà alle aziende con presenza internazionale di godere di una soluzione tecnologica robusta e compliant con la normativa di più di 70 paesi” afferma Luis Molina Apestegui, Sales Manager di EDICOM in Italia.</p>

				  Interoperability hackathons showcase the benefits of open source and community and drive scale  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>The growth in open source software has been driven by a simple, powerful value proposition: more means more. The more people use an open source solution, the better the solution becomes through stress testing and innovation; the better it becomes, the more it will scale because more people will want to use it.</p>
<p>This can happen organically—or it can happen through a community pushing itself to adopt, adapt, and scale. This was the idea behind the first Cardea Interop-a-thon. </p>
<p>Cardea is a complete open-source codebase for creating, sharing, and verifying digital health credentials with a focus on COVID-19 testing and vaccination; it was developed by Indicio and SITA and donated to Linux Foundation Public Health (LFPH), where its continued development is overseen by a community of companies and interested parties, including Indicio and SITA. </p>
<p>As the concept of verifiable digital credentials requires interoperability to scale, we decided that the best way to drive interoperability was to set up a reference implementation of Cardea and invite other companies using Hyperledger Aries-based solutions to test against it and each other. </p>
<p>It was a success. The six companies that participated in the virtual event all achieved their goals. It wasn’t painless—and that was the point. Glitches, bugs, and unknown obstacles were all uncovered by the concerted focus on testing against each other. The result is that everyone&nbsp; emerged with better products.</p>
<p>The reaction was, “we need more of this!” And so, this week, on March 17, we will host our second Cardea Interop-a-thon. We’ll have the standard reference implementation to test against, but we’ll also have two new and important features: out-of-band invitations and machine readable governance.</p>
<p>Out-of-band (OOB) invitations use the new out-of-band protocol for creating a connection using an invitation URL or QR code. The first phase is coming to Hyperledger Aries at the end of March (see the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0496-transition-to-oob-and-did-exchange">transition plan</a>) and the community will proceed until the full OOB invitation process is supported as the default connection method (to read more, see the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0434-outofband/README.md">Aries RFC</a>).</p>
<p>Machine-readable governance is a way to implement governance rules at the agent level; it makes the governance authority portable. Why is this important? </p>
<p>First, it means that governance rules can be cached and verification can happen offline. </p>
<p>Second, it means that complex information flows with “if this, then that” logic become simpler to choreograph than if governed by a central trust authority; bonus, they can be kept private too (for more on the benefits of machine-readable governance, see “<a href="https://indicio.tech/where-do-you-put-a-trust-registry-in-a-decentralized-digital-ecosystem-not-where-it-turns-into-a-wrench/">Machine Readable Governance is the Key to Scaling Decentralized Trust</a>.”)</p>
<p>Registration is closed, and we’ve got over twice as many participants for our second Interop-a-thon; but you’re more than welcome to show up and watch! Visit <a href="https://cardea.app/">https://cardea.app</a> for details.</p>

        <p>TAAL’s Norwegian Partner UNISOT Shows How Blockchain Improves<br>
Food Safety and Quality</p>
<p>For UNISOT to grow, it will need predictable costs and a dependable partner to process the number of data transactions it will send to the blockchain. That’s where TAAL comes in. With world-leading 4GB block sizes on the BSV blockchain, TAAL has the data capacity to fulfil UNISOT’s needs. The Scandinavian company recently began speaking with some of the biggest packaging companies in the world and one of the region’s biggest retailers. Transport companies have expressed interest in partnering too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“So much about what we are doing is about cost. If we can have an agreement with TAAL to process 10 million transactions per month and if we can get a fixed price for those 10 million transactions, then we can turn to our customers and with confidence say, ‘If you order 1 million transactions from us, we can offer you a fixed price’. In doing so, we are moving away from the fluctuations of the bitcoin price and will have a stable, predictable price that we can work with for the benefit of our customers and their customers. You can’t do professional business without that cost structure in place,”</p>
</blockquote>

   by John Tolbert  SentinelOne has announced that they will acquire Attivo Networks, a leading Distributed Deception Platform (DDP) and Identity Threat Detection &amp; Response (ITDR) solution provider. This appears to be a good move for SentinelOne, which is a leading Endpoint Protection Detection &amp; Response (EPDR) vendor. SentinelOne went public with the one of the largest IPOs ever last year.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">John Tolbert</a></p><p>SentinelOne has announced that they will acquire Attivo Networks, a leading Distributed Deception Platform (DDP) and Identity Threat Detection &amp; Response (ITDR) solution provider. This appears to be a good move for SentinelOne, which is a leading Endpoint Protection Detection &amp; Response (EPDR) vendor. SentinelOne went public with the one of the largest IPOs ever last year.</p>
<p>Attivo was founded in 2011 in the Bay Area. Their initial focus was on the DDP market. DDP is an innovative approach to detecting and preparing for cyberattacks, whereby organizations deploy decoy resources to attract the attention of would-be attackers. This strategy allows organizations to study attacker Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) while protecting their crucial assets, ensuring that the intelligence gathered from the DDP is of the highest quality and most pertinent for each customer. Attivo was a leader in all categories (Overall, Product, Innovation, and Market) in the 2021 edition of the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80340/distributed-deception-platforms-ddps">KuppingerCole Leadership Compass on DDP</a>.</p>
<p>Two of the main decoy components of DDPs such as Attivo’s are traps and lures:</p>
 
 Traps are servers, virtual servers, and/or appliances that host simulated assets. Traps can mimic traditional IT assets such as file and web servers, desktops, and containers, as well as Operational Technology (OT) assets such as Industrial Control System (ICS) servers, sensors, Human-Machine Interfaces (HMI), IoT devices, etc. 
 Lures are objects that are designed to appeal to attackers and get them to interact with the DDP. Lures can include services, files, credentials, x.509 certificates, SSH keys, scripts, ICS devices, etc. 
 
<p>Many OT, IoT, and health care environments do not support standard endpoint security agents, due to incompatibility of operating systems and/or restrictions against adding security software to managed hosts. Solutions such as DDPs and Network Detection &amp; Response (NDR) tools can provide visibility that would otherwise be missing from these critical portions of customer environments.</p>
<p>Traps and lures are foundational components of DDPs, but identity deception is essential also because attacks leverage user and admin credentials. Attivo Networks has extended its product portfolio significantly beyond DDP, to also support ITDR. These capabilities are delivered via the Attivo Networks Active Directory Protection Portfolio. The portfolio is comprised of ADAssessor and ADSecure. ADAssessor monitors customer AD to look for ways to reduce the attack surface. &nbsp;ADSecure returns fake privileged credentials as query results and hides real privileged credentials to attackers while alerting customer IT security staff.</p>
<p>SentinelOne’s strategic vision is to provide an integrated security platform to replace multiple types of endpoint and network security tools with a single solution to prevent, detect, analyze, and respond to cyberthreats across all enterprise IT assets, on-premises and in the cloud. SentinelOne has agents for Windows XP to version 11, Windows Server 2008+, MacOS, all Linux flavors, Android, and iOS. SentinelOne’s solutions are powered by Machine Learning and Deep Learning detection models that are capable of providing the highest levels of protection, even for clients that are not constantly connected to their cloud. SentinelOne has participated in a number of KuppingerCole reports, such as the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/mc80508/endpoint-protection-detection-and-response#heading5.14">Market Compass on EPDR</a>.</p>
<p>The acquisition of Attivo by SentinelOne will provide additional XDR (eXtended Detection &amp; Response) capabilities for their Singularity Platform. We have identified DDP as an innovative component of XDR platforms. Only a handful of vendors that are purporting to be in the XDR space have DDP within their solution set yet. Moreover, ITDR not yet is a common capability in XDR, but being able to analyze signals from the network and endpoints to the behavior of digital identities provides significantly enhanced insight into threats. This acquisition demonstrates that both DDP and Identity will be essential ingredients in XDR.</p>
<p></p>
<p>KuppingerCole will continue to <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research">monitor and publish</a> on developments in the XDR and related markets.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Andrea Beskers</a></p><p>Allan Foster thinks the identity and access management industry is an immature industry mostly because it is still thinking in siloes. He will elaborate on this idea in his keynote <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5055">Access Control – The New Frontier</a> on Thursday, May 12, 2022, 9:10 am at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2022">European Identity and Cloud Conference 2022</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Allan some questions about his presentation.</p>
<p> </p>
 You have been involved in Identity for many years now. Have we solved all the Identity Problems? 
<p>Well, wouldn't that be nice, right? We wouldn't even have to have a conference like this. We've solved everything. Well, yes and no. We have solved a lot of the identity challenges that we've had, right?<br>There's a lot of people over the last years that have done a lot of hard work at this, and we do. We've understood most of the challenges. <br>We understand what we have to do. And in general, we're pretty successful at it. However, I'm sort of going to step back a little bit from that and say there's still some big problems that we've got with it. <br>First of all, it's still siloed. <br>We're buying an identity solution from a vendor and honestly, I'm familiar with all of the different vendors I'm going to pick on ForgeRock and Okta. It's an example. We're buying a solution from them and they are two different solutions. <br>They're are two different silos. And what that ends up is giving us multiplied entities. <br>And I only have to say things like LastPass for every single one of us to roll our eyes, knowing that we've got dozens or hundreds of different identities that we need to keep track of. <br>The reason we have to do that is that we've got these silos. And so when we start talking about have we solved all of the identity problems, I think it's worthwhile for us to stand back and say: Why? Identity is not why we're doing this. Identity is the “How”. Identity is how we do things. <br>The "Why" is actually access control, right? And in that space, we're still a very immature industry. Where we're taking our baby steps. <br>The only reason we need to know who someone is, really is so that we know what they can do. And that's really an access control problem. <br>And so sort of going back to the question, have we solved all of the problems? No. Have we gone a good way into solving many of them? <br>Yeah, we've built some great foundations, but there is still an awful lot to do as we start looking at how do we implement access control. <br>And obviously, I'm going to be talking about that through the different sessions and what we need to look at in access control.</p>
<p></p>
 You have said that we are still quite immature as an industry. Why?  
<p>The immature industry. Well, the good news about being an immature industry is we've got a long way to go to grow, right? The reason I say that we're immature is that we are still working. <br>And I'm going to go back to what I just said about silos. We're still working in the ideas of specific products, and I'm sort of going to use an example that many of us are familiar with. USB, right? USB is if we think about it, it's really just a serial protocol that we can plug into the side of our computer. However, I can use a USB thumb drive, write one of these, and I can plug it into my Mac and it just works. <br>And then I take it and plug it into the PC and it just works and I want to print onto a USB printer and it just works. And the really interesting part about this is that all of those products come from different manufacturers, right?<br>And the really important piece there is the interoperability and the standards so that it works no matter what we want to do with it. We're not there yet with identity. Sure, we've got some great standards like OAuth2, and OpenId Connect and some of the old gray hair devices may remember things like SAML and things like that. We have some great standards to build on. <br>But as we start moving up right, I look at it from the idea of my car knows who I am, and so does my Nest thermostat. But they don't know about each other and there's no way these are just two different universes, and there's so much growth that we can have in that and grow. <br>The challenges of access control, the challenges of me being able to prove my identity no matter what the context that we're dealing with. <br>And really, when I talk about being an immature industry, we talking about web-based access control, we're talking about browsers.<br>There's so much more that there's this whole industry is growing into things like smart cars, smart refrigerators, smart thermostats, my personal favorite smart light bulbs, right?<br> So we have all of these different things that either are skirting around identity or we haven't really been able to integrate them. And I think there's an awful lot of opportunity there. <br>And that's sort of why I say it's immature. We haven't really addressed these issues and we haven't worked out how they interoperate to provide that access control. <br>Right. If I've got a smart door lock, how do I give somebody else access to that door lock without doing it specifically in that door lock? <br>So the good news about being immature is we've got so much more to explore and there's still a lot of growth. So I think that's a really big positive thing.</p>
<p></p>
 I noticed you are talking about Access Control, rather than Identity. Why?  
<p>Because access control is what we're trying to do. Identity is really just a means to an end. Identity is the way that we find out who we're dealing with, right? <br>Access control and the bigger the sort of bigger picture of access control is answering the question of what should this person or what should this identity be allowed to do? <br>What should they be allowed to access? <br>And so let's go back to my example of the smart door lock. It really doesn't matter to the door lock, who the person is on the other side. <br>It's going to open the door and let that person in. What matters to the door lock is the person on the other side allowed to come in to my house. <br>And so really, when we look at that, the who is important because that's how we know whether they're allowed to or not. But allowing them into the house is actually the end goal. <br>And so sort of the drive that I'm trying to go towards is to move away from the thought of simply thinking about identity and, you know, multi-factor and all of these kinds of things that that we've heard over and over and over again. <br>Identity is really just there to prove who we're dealing with and to start thinking about the access control side of things. How are we going to make that smooth, ubiquitous and work across multiple platforms, multiple devices, multiple identity sources? <br>And that's why I'm sort of focusing on the access control side of things. <br>Identity, we've got a pretty good handle as to what we need to do for it.</p>
<p></p>
 What challenges do we still have ahead of us? 
<p>Well, this goes back to the immature industry side of things, right? <br>So in order for us to do this and I'm looking at all of the vendors that we have, and we've got several of them around in the hallways and in the booths and things like that, but as an industry, we need to start thinking less about building the best product out there and more about interoperability. <br>We need to really look at this idea of having siloed products and say that's not really in the best interest of our users, right? We need to have interoperability. <br>We need to be able to work with each other's technology, work with each other's identities, protect each other's resources. <br>And in order to do that, hand-in-hand with interoperability is standards and many of you know, me, I've sort of been a standards geek for years and years and years. <br>Standards is the way that an industry comes together and decides how we're all going to do something so that we can build a viable ecosystem and I think that's the way that we mature our industry is building that interoperable ecosystem so that we can plug IoT devices or smart cars or smart refrigerators, along with all of the other places where we have to deal with identity. <br>Identifying ourselves from a health care perspective, from a financial industry perspective and all of these things and bringing them together so that from the end-user experience. <br>Now I'm sort of focusing a little bit here on the consumer side, but both consumer and in the employee case, the end-user experience should be seamless. <br>They should be able to say, this is who I am now. Let me do what I'm allowed to do. <br>And I think that's really where the challenges are. We need to continue to build that into our operability. <br>We need to start thinking about things like how do we define these access control rules, interoperable policy, interoperable standards, so that agents and security agents can work with each other systems. And I think that's really the exciting part probably of the next decade.</p>
<p></p>
 If you were to focus on one thing to take away from EIC, what would it be? 
<p>Well, to start with, all of the friends and everybody that's there, because it's always great to come together and meet everybody that's working in this industry. <br>I think it's a conference I know from my perspective that I love coming to every year. <br>But if we walk away from it, the, the I'm going to kind of break away from the one thing is to sort of maybe if I put commerce between the two, this all becomes one big thing. <br>There is still a lot of work for us to do in the identity space. We're not done. So there's still a lot of ideas for us to do and we need to keep our eye on why we're doing it. <br>What is the reason that we're doing identity or doing access control and that "Why?" has to do with the consumer. <br>We're trying to make a workable ecosystem for that consumer. <br>And in order to do that, we need to focus on get involved in standard and interoperability. It's not a problem to work with other vendors that are in the same space, right? <br>We've got even this nice word co-op petition. There's it's a big industry. We can all make money in this industry and we need to be able to work together and be interoperable with each other so that we can provide that nice, flawless, seamless experience for the end-user. And that's probably the biggest takeaway for me.<br><br></p>

<p>2022 will be the year of AERGO’s expansion. We are working closely with enterprises to secure numerous, demonstrable use cases. Through the insight gained from working with our clients, we aim to reach a wider audience through building applications that are adaptable and scalable. This led to AERGO embarking on a journey to expand its scope from being a ‘Blockchain for Businesses’ to being the “Blockchain for the world” — the team’s aspiration is for AERGO to become a blockchain platform for all. AERGO will not be bound by just enterprise technology, but an explosion of expansions into multi-dimensional technology that exists today and&nbsp;beyond.</p><p>We unveil today our new logo and website to show both our past and the direction where we are headed as we continue to build and&nbsp;evolve.</p> The AERGO&nbsp;galaxy <p>AERGO’s new logo embodies what global blockchain adoption looks like. An abstract wave with two different colors was inspired by our rapidly growing galaxy and wanted to emphasize AERGO’s expanded vision for a bigger ecosystem.</p> Refreshed Website <p>We hope our community members find our website to be informative and efficient. We have updated it so that each participant of our ecosystem can find what is relevant for them — whether you are a developer, enterprise, individual or part of our community.</p> NFT-as-a-service <p>We can define a creator as someone who produces valuable content. This encompasses a wide variety of sectors ranging from the music to sports industries. The growing adoption of blockchain technology has given rise to the concept of the metaverse, and the potential that it brings, opening the doors to an influx of individuals and entities who could leverage this technology. To best capture the opportunities in this space, we decided to launch an NFT-as-a-service for creators. Through NFT-as-a-service, creators can easily create and mint their own NFTs on top of AERGO, showcasing and exchanging their NFTs in various marketplaces. We hope this enablement will further unlock value for creators that makes the creator economy more viable and sustainable for all participants.</p> AERGO AMA&nbsp;#4 <p>The recording of the Mar 2022 AERGO AMA #4 has now been uploaded on YouTube.

<p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a> are a tamper-proof and machine-verifiable way of sharing your data safely with just the people you want. It is a larger part of a revolutionary identity paradigm called the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity</a> where users have complete control over their data, where it is stored, how it is used, and with whom it is&nbsp;shared.</p><p>Since these VCs can be used in many <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">real-life scenarios</a>, it’s important to have different VC types for issuing different credentials. For example, you need a VC with attributes such as date of employment, role, organisation name etc, to generate an <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/on-demand-employment-endorsements-a-use-case-for-verifiable-credentials-d19d263a0fbb">Employment VC</a> that’ll have credentials about a person’s past or current employment. A <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/how-to-implement-driving-license-use-case-using-verifiable-credentials-cef928222c92">Driver’s License VC</a>, on the other hand, will have attributes such as name, licence number,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>As you can see, each VC has a different set of attributes, and hence, requires a different schema.</p><p>This ability to issue custom VCs greatly enhances your flexibility. However, from an implementation standpoint, it is not easy because you can’t simply create new VCs directly through the&nbsp;APIs.</p><p>Also, there is no simple way to clone and extend existing schemas or make new versions of existing ones. Overall, the creation of a new schema type via the SDK was not a straightforward process.</p><p>This is where Affinidi’s <a href="http://ui.schema.affinidi.com/">Schema Manager</a> comes into&nbsp;play.</p> What is Affinidi’s Schema&nbsp;Manager? <p>Simply put, the Schema Manager is a tool to manage, create, clone, update, and reuse credential types and existing&nbsp;schemas.</p><p>It can come in handy for developers, product managers or engineers who are tasked with building an SSI application and faces a problem of ensuring trust between actors (mainly, Issuers and Verifiers).</p> Why Should You Use Affinidi’s Schema&nbsp;Manager? <p>Below are some compelling reasons to use the Schema&nbsp;Manager.</p>  You have the flexibility to create any VC schema for any situation.  The creation process is simple and straightforward as explained in the next&nbsp;section  The schemas you created are saved, so you can reuse them&nbsp;later.  This tool generates the JSON schema that you can simply copy-paste into your&nbsp;code  You can define the attributes for each schema&nbsp;type  The schema you create can be public or private, depending on your preference. You have the choice to even publish it as a searchable schema so others can reuse&nbsp;them.  You can create the schemas you want through an intuitive and friendly user interface, that in turn, will automatically generate the JSON code for your new&nbsp;schema.  <p>Thus, these are some reasons to use Affinidi’s schema&nbsp;manager.</p><p>Moving on, let’s get into nitty-gritty details and see how you can search through existing schema types, create, review, and even fork new VC schemas using the schema&nbsp;manager.</p> Using the Schema&nbsp;Manager <p>To access the Schema Manager, go to <a href="http://ui.schema.affinidi.com/">http://ui.schema.affinidi.com/</a></p> Explore VC&nbsp;Schemas <p>Schemas that are already created can be found in the Explore&nbsp;tab.</p> Create VC&nbsp;Schemas <p>VC Schema Types can be created in the Create tab with the following steps.</p><p>Create New&nbsp;Schema</p><p>Credential schema type needs to be filled with the name of type with no space and&nbsp;number.</p><p>Version and Revision will be automatically 1 and 0 respectively when the schema type when creating from&nbsp;scratch.</p><p>Detailed information about specific schema type can be put in the Description field.</p><p>Searchable Schema is a public Schema, that means, it appears in the Schema Index page. When the “Publish as searchable schema” option is selected, the schema type will appear in the Schema Index Page for everyone to find it. If it is not selected, it doesn’t appear in the Schema Index Page but can still be accessible by&nbsp;URL.</p><p>The JSON Schema section will be generated based on the inputs you give during the creation&nbsp;process.</p><p>Define Attributes</p><p>Attributes will be added to the VC schema type in the Define Attributes section</p><p>The CredentialID, IssueanceDate and IssuerID attributes are only readable and required for all the&nbsp;types.</p><p>Any other attributes which are needed for VC Schema Type can be added as the following data types; DID, URI, Text, Date, DateTime, Number,&nbsp;Boolean.</p><p>Review Schema</p><p>The newly-created Schema Type needs to be reviewed before it is published. After checking the schema fields, if anything is missing or incorrect, go back to make the changes. If everything looks good, it can be published.</p><p>Publish</p><p>We can see a success message in the Publish section after the schema type is published and ready to&nbsp;use.</p><p>The newly-created schema type can be checked by clicking the View&nbsp;button.</p><p>With the Formatted View, schema type can be reviewed as human readable form or can be switched to JSON Schema or JSON-LD&nbsp;Context.</p><p>Schema URLs can be shared using the Issue VC with schema button. The JSON Schema or JSON-LD Context format’s URLs can be found&nbsp;here.</p><p>Selection of Json Schema&nbsp;View</p><p>Selection of JSON-LD Context&nbsp;View</p><p>Fork VC&nbsp;Schemas</p><p>Forking VC Schema can be useful when you want to edit an existing schema type or if you want to use a schema type as a template to create a new VC type on top of&nbsp;that.</p><p>Forking creates a new schema. If the schema name already exists, revision number increases incrementally and if the schema type name is different, a new one will be created on top of the existing&nbsp;schema.</p><p>There can be no more than 999 revisions of one version, and all versions and revisions must be sequential.</p><p>This process applies to the Create section as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Thus, this is how you can navigate through this app to create custom VC&nbsp;schemas.</p> Final Words <p>In all, Affinidi’s schema manager offers the flexibility to create new VC schemas, reuse existing ones, and explore how best these VCs can fit in with your business goals. Since it also generates the JSON code, all that you have to do is copy-paste it to your application!</p><p>Creating custom VCs doesn’t get easier than&nbsp;this!</p> Join our Community today   Get conversations going with #teamaffinidi and community on&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/ffV5ctBMXr">Discord</a>  Follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/affinidi/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/affinidi">Twitter</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/affinidi.devs">Facebook</a>  Get latest updates on what’s new at Affinidi, <a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1FhRGo3c4T-erYRGOSRyzCQ8oa2v?__hstc=62619635.47aee03c70ce4792c76a5560e796e3ca.1637746550073.1646983543973.1647315106981.42&amp;__hssc=62619635.3.1647315106981&amp;__hsfp=2853627963">join our mailing&nbsp;list</a>  Interested in <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/careers">joining our&nbsp;team</a>?

<p>About Episode</p>
 
 
<p>Laws against money laundering were created to use against organized crime during the period of Prohibition in the United States during the 1930s. Organized crime received a major boost from Prohibition and a large source of new funds that were obtained from illegal sales of alcohol. The successful prosecution of Al Capone on tax evasion brought in a new emphasis by the state and law enforcement agencies to track and confiscate money, but existing laws against tax evasion could not be used once gangsters started paying their taxes.</p>
<p>“Always follow the money” has been sound advice in law enforcement and political circles for decades. Nevertheless, tracking the flows of illicit funds generated by drug trafficking and organized crime and analyzing the magnitude and the extent to which these are laundered through the world’s financial systems remain daunting tasks.</p>
<p>Can Digital ID come to the rescue?</p>
<p>This episode covers the intersections of Digital ID, AML and Open Banking.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some of the key questions answered are:</p>
 
 What’s the global impact of money laundering today? 
 How can Digital ID help prevent illicit financial flows? 
 How can technology (e.g., device fingerprinting) make anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing efforts faster, cheaper and more efficient? 
 What is the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) Digital ID guidance? 
 How can you layer multiple sources of identity (outside of government sources) to enhance Identification Assurance? 
 How can you prevent money laundering through stronger Legal Entity Identity verifications? 
 Can Open Banking succeed without Digital Identity? Are open banking and digital identity the same thing? 
 What are some of the key Open Banking standards bodies that are active today? 
 Does Open Banking make money laundering easier or more difficult?

				 <p>Maya</p>
<p>Hi everyone and welcome to this SEO identity community meetup for January 2022. We are very excited to have Gabriel Rene with us today and our topic is how web 3.0 will connect humans, machines, and AI to transform the world. Before we get started we would like to have a few words from heather dahl, CEO of Indicio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heather</p>
<p>Hi Maya, thank you, welcome to everyone, I’m excited to kick off the first of our monthly meetups for 2022. We are moving into our just second year of providing this type of content to the community, and I think the topics that we tackle and the experts that we bring on bring really intriguing conversations. I want to give a special welcome to anyone who’s here and new to our community, it’s so cool to see in the chat where everyone’s coming from. Hamburg, I heard a shout out from Brussels, Dublin, go Fairfax, Virginia, we have Seattle, Canada, by all means if you’re new to the meetup or you’re returning, add your location to the conversation because I think it’s really interesting that we bring together this global community. For those of you who aren’t familiar with Indicio, we are a public benefit company, and our mission is to advance decentralized identity. A part of our mission is running educational events like this, and because we’re out there building ecosystems for trusted data, today’s topic we find really exciting, absolutely provocative, excited to see Gabe here, and to talk about the internet of everything, and what it means for people and digital objects and non-digital objects to provide identity and to communicate with each other in ways that are secure and trustworthy. Ken was supposed to be here today to lead the conversation but he couldn’t make it, so senior architect Sam Curren is here to lead the conversation and interview with our absolutely terrific guest, Gabrielle Rene, thank you all for being here and I’m gonna turn it over to you Sam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Thanks Heather, and and thanks Gabriel for being here, I guess we should start with an introduction, that’s appropriate, Gabriel is the architect of the spatial web, it’s a vision he’s described with his co-author Dan Mapes, in the international best-selling book titled the spatial web, how web 3.0 will connect hans machines and ai to transform the world. He’s the executive director at VERSUS lab and the spatial web foundation, and he and his team are bringing this vision to life. The groundbreaking hyperspatial markup language is currently being discussed at a new working group with the IEEE, both web 3 and the metaverse have been recent hot topics in the last couple of months but the spatial web is where the real becomes virtual and the virtual real. So welcome to Gabriel Rene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me Sam, thank you Heather, and Ken when you watch this hopefully we’re doing you proud, good work. on your behalf so Sam thank you, thanks for hosting me today, and it’s an honor to be here and have a chance to speak to everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Excellent, I’ve been stunt doubling for Ken in a few areas and I’m not as good looking as Ken is but I’ll do my best. So excellent all right, let’s dive into some questions here, and please answer with whatever you think is relevant, and we can take this discussion wherever we need to go. So you’ve described the spatial web as the internet of everything and you’ve thought a lot about what the internet of everything will look like, what do you see?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well the first thing I see is a more holistic approach to the concept of the application of network computing technologies, like the internet, and a lot of times what tends to occur is that perspectives on emerging technology are industry specific or technology specific. We talk about AI or we talk about XR, we talk about IOT or we talk about blockchain, and we talk about quant, or it’s by industry, this applies to the government or this applies to supply chain which applies to retail and this applies to healthcare. So these narratives are constantly emerging where we even have these themes: human 2.0, we have dialogues around web 3.0, industry 4.0, and the Japanese are talking about society 5.0. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all of those cases almost the exact same set of technologies are being discussed, and it’s the usual suspects I just rattled off. Some people started talking about the internet of things a handful of years ago, this idea that it wasn’t just the internet where we had sort of interconnected communications, but rather these physical connected smart devices would form this new network. That was very exciting, it remains exciting, we’ve yet to see a whole lot of it work. I can tell you that the smart home struggle is real, and interoperability is at the heart of every problem. So this idea that you can connect things is one level, then there’s another debate about things being smart. So at one level you’ve got the internet of things, and then there’s been spatial computing, which has really emerged around this idea and is now re being repackaged again into the metaverse narrative, which you might call the internet of non-things, or sort of virtual things, that are not things or “what are they” things. And then there’s been this idea that is the blockchain folks saying that the internet of money, or the internet of trust, it sort of starts to intersect with the work that your community is doing. And there’s the internet of intelligence thing, which is the AI folks attempt early on the semantic web again. Whether we use the internet, or the web, or some sort of talking variations of this kind of a network where the data is intelligent or smart in and of itself. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The term smart, which has taken over everything, so there’s a smartphone that was the first thing, it’s just a computer, but that’s fine it’s a smartphone. Why? Because it has some connected capability, and in the beginning smart meant connected. As machine learning and deep learning found its footing over the last decade. The idea of things becoming smart meant actually being intelligent to the feedback loops, adaptive smart home now means that your nest adjusts the temperature for you, and that the lights turn on and off based on some feedback loop or information. Then of course we’re talking about smart cities, and so we go from smartphones, smart things, smart cars, smart cities, the idea is that these cities become intelligent and adaptive. Your autonomous car is able to just drive. Because, traffic is this sort of amorphous thing, like a bunch of starlings moving through. Drones and automated functionality that the amazon go, vacation of everything, you walk into a store, you take what you want, you walk out. All these sort of smart functions that might be built into government services, and all this sort of future sci-fi smart city narratives, but when I spoke to a community of smart cities four years ago in Europe, cities that came together to explore this, their number one thing was well how do we connect with other smart cities? So how do we form a network of smart cities? Well smart cities with all these smart cars and smartphones and smart devices and smart things with these internet and web connections across these various sets of interests and industries forms what you might call a smart world. And that idea that you’ve got this global cyber physical network now that encompasses all of these things, and that the addressability of an object isn’t just that it’s connected, it might just be that it’s being viewed by a camera, it could be an object that has no internet connection in and of itself, but this network has its own, and it’s essentially showing up on the network, that network we call the spatial web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Really good explanation, so a natural follow-on to that, I realize that web 3.0 has become a loaded term. You used it first in the title of your book, obviously, so it’s recorded there, but it’s come to mean some different things in recent times. Using sort of your original meaning of web 3.0 why doesn’t web 2.0 already solve this? What is missing from what we’ve got today that we need to go where we need to go?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well there’s a handful of things, and I think that some of the architects of web 1.0 have lamented about some of the infrastructure decisions that were made at the time. Now there were technical limitations or practical limitations, hardly anyone actually cared, but there were debates around identity and privacy and security, there was a tendency, being academics and scientists, not to think too deeply into all of the societal implications of these technologies. So the anticipation that people would use this for good, and not for personal, selfish, or otherwise harmful ends was the default. “Oh it’s gonna be this awesome network and we’re gonna do information sharing” great, problem solved. Decades of work had gone into that, from the ARPAnet all the way up into the world wide web, where you have Tim Berners-lee pulling a bunch of threads together and stitching that into what became the backbone of this amazing communications network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identity was actually one of the real missing ingredients in my opinion, and that anonymity part, the thing that makes the web open is also the thing that makes the web dangerous. The hackers, trackers, and fakers that are permeating our lives from simple sort of issues around misrepresentation, all the way to identity theft, all the way to now ransomware, and we’re about one hop away from biotech, and people being able to hack devices that were what we’re wearing, or that are on our bodies, or that are in our bodies, and so the the openness of the web is a double-edged sword that seems to cut both ways. That allowed the web 2.0 era organizations and companies to maximize the capital potential of that structure, and so they essentially monetized that openness, that anonymity was a function of the sort of the fact that you didn’t have an identity, so we’ll rent you one. We’re google here’s ours, we’re Facebook here’s ours, apple here’s one for you as well, how about one for linkedin and facebook? Alright so we all run around with these sort of two-dimensional avatars, locked in these digital fighters where we serve certain functions. We get certain services from that, so i don’t think that a pure polarized view on this looking at web 2.0 is inherently negative is fair or accurate, but these are major holes in the architecture that allowed for this type of capitalism to thrive in a new dimension, and that thriving has compromised some of the inherent freedoms, and some might say human rights. Now It’s becoming part of the debate: what property do we own here with respect to our data? And I think that those holes have produced really horrific outcomes, like not just on the monetization side, but on how we are programmed into wanting or thinking certain things. One of those things are products and services, whether those things are our own ideas about ourselves and our identity and our self-image, or whether it’s our viewpoint on the effectiveness of vaccines and science, and what political representative we think is in our best interests. You can no longer separate the technical work that we’ve done here with the web and our societal implications, and that’s the real zeitgeist challenge that I think we face at this moment. It requires some new ways of thinking about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’ve talked about some architectural adjustments that would get that will help get us there, one of one of those pieces of architecture i think is the hyperspatial markup language, HSML, that is part of your work at the IEEE, can you describe what HSML will help us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah, so just one quick parenthetical, and it’s a function of a little bit of us copying something. It is HSML, but it’s hyperspatial modeling language instead of markup language, although there was quite a bit of debate internally about whether that was an accurate description. The function of a market language and a modern language are different, but depending on your perspective, in this case it is about modeling at the heart of it. How do we model the world digitally in a way that is coherent with the way that humans cognize the world? And I provide that caveat because there are other ways of cognizing the world that we’re unable to be aware of, and that is not what our concern is with respect to what we need to teach machines or AIs. We need to ensure that they can cognize the world in a way that is similar, or compatible, or at least incorporates our understanding of reality. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What HSML does is it functions in a sort of semIOTic structure of forming the core elements, in which there are 12, that act like a language. So just like nouns, verbs, prepositions, and adjectives are sufficient components with which to construct descriptions and representation of reality that predominantly is all we’re using today. Like today I’m just using magic mouth sounds to paint pictures in everyone’s heads, and if I had it with squiggly lines it would do nearly as well. But if i could just do what we’ve been able to see some whales and some dolphins do which is actually just project an entire three-dimensional holographic representation of this particular bay, and the position of all the fish, kind of like a sonar snapshot, and just send that to you 20 miles away, “like hey the party’s over here, here’s where the fish are guys” that might be another way to communicate. So HSML enables multiple IOT devices to do what’s called sensor fusion, or data fusion, even policy fusion. So you can take information from sensors, we take information from databases, and you can take policy related information laws, or instructions, or whatever, and you can fuse those together into a multi-layered scene graph, which is a way of representing the information about any set of activities in any given space. All of the objects in the space, all the users in the space, all the activities in space, all the permissions in the space, and at the end of the day that it is intended to enable you to construct descriptions of states of things, and then describe workflows for what needs to happen, so you could conceivably program all the smart things in your house to work in a very certain particular way, one could inform another one, and this could then extend all the way out into the city, and so forth and so forth to the world at large. So the idea of making a standard here in the in many of the same ways that HTML allows us to structure content and information on pages, HSML lets us structure context and information in spaces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So I like that the modeling of context is a sign of something that sort of begun to happen, but without much organization. So when the web was new it was a new location, we would visit websites and we would go there and it was all about this new world and this new place, and honestly web 2.0 was a lot of that too. IOT starts to get a little interesting because now there’s this internet of things, but the things generally exist in real life and also on the internet, so it’s blending now between there. Of course now we’ve got augmented reality, and virtual reality, and a lot of things that pull that together, so when we think about all this stuff that in the real life that’s sort of blending together with a digital life that means like a proliferation of cameras and sensors and objects that we can interact with etc. So this means identity for everything, which is great. But there’s some implications here that the tinfoil hat wears among us, and I occasionally wear one of a particular shape. What are the implications of all of this interconnectedness upon the privacy we have and maybe governance that can help us with that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, so that was the question we started to ask ourselves back in 2016, which was all of that connectedness, all of that capability, all of that monitoring was going to happen anyway. Like that was the clear thing that was happening, so then the question became okay can you ensure certain levels of interoperability? And you need that in order to enable governance, if things are not interoperable you can make as many rules as you like, and it doesn’t it doesn’t matter. So what there’s a bit of a logical cake here, coherence is the first requirement, if you have coherence then interoperability is a function of your description of coherence. What is or isn’t coherent, like if you can describe the physics of the environment, and you want to say how you navigate through it, you can’t do it until you’ve done the first part. And then governance is a function of saying well what you can or cannot do are the ways that you must then navigate that environment, or who can when and what time and all sorts of all the parameters of activity management or activity governance. Because governance at the end of the day is really about changing states in the world. It’s not a theoretical function, it’s a practical function, and so that was what we saw as being really the scariest thing I’ve ever noticed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this cyber stuff is going to get all interconnected, you’re going to end up with this internet of everything. Which there was no term spatial web in that sense, the GIS community had been using it for many years, but not in the sense that we saw this multi-dimensional, multimodal sort of thing, it was like okay this internet of everything is going to happen, there are a handful of real challenges with that, including the possibility for abuse and looking at how wonderfully we did the web 2.0. this was just going to cascade into essentially black mirror, that’s what we’re all concerned about. So it was at that time that identity became clear to me that it was a fundamental infrastructural architectural requirement. Having been in telecom before that, and looking at telemedicine services, that was when I started looking at blockchain and the idea that you might need to own these assets related to your medical history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> I wasn’t interested in crypto in the beginning, Bitcoin seemed interesting, but not enough for me to buy any or care, blockchain looked really interesting, and this idea that you would own your sort of property. At that point I started looking for what kind of new identity structure, or what would become like a spatial web url, some sort of key identifier, and that’s when I came across the work that many of you on this call were pioneering. You were working on it before that of course, but also like right around that time, and that was a real eye opener, and it frankly made it possible for us to focus on the other bits. Because it was like this community is completely dedicated to the identity, in our version of this the human is one of those entities, or one of those actors, but every single object, including conceptual objects, can have a DID in the spatial web, and all of these are sort of structured using HSML, and some of these other ontology and taxonomy structures you’re looking at to maintain that coherence. That then grants you this ability to do governance, which gives you the second portion of this of the standard, which is called HSTP, which is hyperspace transaction protocol. What that does is it basically says “okay cool world give me all the information of the states of all these objects, users, actors,” and again they could be holographic objects in that space that that you otherwise wouldn’t be aware of, the IOT device isn’t going to pick that up, but the space knows that it’s there. You sent me something to this room so I could present it on this call as an example. I wanted to get this exact “xyz” position and I knew it was coming. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today one challenge is that you can send anything you want to my email address, I can’t stop you, you can come to my website, I can’t stop you, in fact you can send money to my eth wallet, and I cannot prevent that. But in the spatial web those everything is sort of permission based, and so that ability to then transport objects users activities and the governance around those is described in HSML, and essentially activated using HSTP, which says what are those states, i would like this state to change this way, or if the state changes what is or isn’t allowed in this case in this space, and HSTP says that transaction has passed or failed. So if only Heather is allowed to enter this room, if the temperature is x, and the time of day is y, and her facial expression or other biometric information says she’s in a certain state, all of which are just inputs that would be happening with any modern technology, but now could coherently say okay Heather’s at the right state the door can open and if she’s not then then the door remains closed. So this becomes you are able to program cyber physical activities, and define the governance for those if you were an authority of that space, and so that is the key sort of requirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>I think that it’s important that this doesn’t invent some brand new type of authority, but rather gives existing authorities the ability to express the rules about what they have authority over. So our house still remains our house, and I posit that we’ll have even more control over what’s actually going on in it from a digital perspective than we do today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes and so you could ensure that nothing is installed in your house, if it doesn’t make a certain threshold of some privacy standard, or that requires some certificate, if it doesn’t have it, it can’t it can’t be there, or it can’t turn on. The city could say drones are only allowed to fly in the city in these specific flight lanes, and if they have cameras on them those cameras are allowed to be on, but the drone cannot fly within five miles of the airport. it can’t have its cameras on when it’s flying over schools, or certain private properties, or certain zones, and all this can be spatially defined as if it were a video game. But now you can do it in the physical world in any digitally mediated set of functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>And that’s an incredibly powerful piece of this, so to switch gears just a little bit, we’ve talked about the blending of the digital and the real life thing, but with it with better technology that we’ve got for for things like virtual reality, you can now sort of have a spatially aware virtual thing, instead of a website that we’re looking at as a docent on a screen. So how do these same concepts apply in a pure virtual space? Where I might be in a fictitious world rather than in real life, and what’s the blend between the real and the virtual?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I love that question, so if you’ll allow me to nerd out for a moment, if you’ve seen the original avengers series of movies that marvel put out, there’s a moment where you get the arc of bruce banner and the hulk. It’s like when he can or cannot become the hulk, and everyone’s afraid he’s going to do it, in the final scene of the first avengers movie they’re like “Bruce get angry”, and he goes “that’s my trick I’m always angry”. So the the parallel here is that it’s actually always virtual, in one instance it must map to the physical world, in all other instances it doesn’t need to. So a harry potter world or the death star rendered in a 3d engine somewhere can have all the exact same authorities, and policies, and functions that apply. Vader is allowed to apparently strangle people at the helm of the thing, and Dumbledore, if he does something wrong the ministry fires him for a couple weeks, he’s got to go into hiding. So there are actually policies and things that exist in these virtual spaces, as we look at things like decentraland, and ownership, and NFTs, and assets and rights around this we’re going to need certain guarantees around what we can trust in these environments. How these authority structures are set up what is transparent, and and what we can investigate, what we can audit and so building property in a virtual world that you don’t ultimately have ownership of, or you can’t take those assets somewhere else, for example you don’t have any rights in roblox or fortnite they can do whatever they want, it’s a corporation they own it they can just change it, and change all your assets, change your skins, they can just flip the whole thing they can sell it, they can take the company public, there’s all kinds of other functions and interests at play. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if we expect and of course it seems natural that we’re going to want digital assets, they are becoming increasingly valuable, they’re also becoming increasingly more realistic, and to that degree at some point even experiences themselves will be indistinguishable from reality. Our senses are not that sophisticated, and you have people like Elon and others working on neural link, and others working on neural dust, that at some point are not going to require any sort of ocular interface. There’s not just a singularity of AI, there’s a singularity of reality that is a whole consideration that’s coming, so having certain guarantees around these environments will become increasingly important. This whole move with cryptocurrency, which is native internet money, and now NFTs, which are really smart assets, well not yet, they’re smart receipts to a virtual asset. I think DID’s really get you all the way across the line there, and HSML by the way would allow you to describe the asset in such a way that it would match up. So with the IDs in HSML I would know all these attributes down to color, texture, size or whatever is that version of that thing, and not just a receipt that says that I own something which could be copied a thousand times. A bit wondering of an answer but hopefully that hit a couple of notes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>No, that’s fantastic, so I want to draw something out a little bit. You sort of talked about how the same applies when I brought up this virtual versus real thing. You said real is the only instance where it actually needs to line up with reality and all these other things can exist virtually as well, that sounds like the metaverse has been talked about by a lot of folks and facebook audaciously renamed themselves to sort of try and own the space. What’s the difference here between the hyperspatial web that you see and the vision of the metaverse that facebook or other companies might be interested in offering?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Okay great question, so i think that i’ll try and provide a nuanced answer. I actually think everyone is making their best attempt to describe the same thing, which is an open and interoperable network. I think the battle right now is not for Facebook to become AOL, everyone’s seen this we’ve all seen this game before, like you don’t you don’t ultimately win with a closed version of this thing. In fact facebook thrives on an open web so that’s not a requirement that they sort of close their borders and they’re going to defend those borders, i think the battle right now is who’s the wordpress of the metaverse. Where are you going to go to build your sites, your stuff, who’s going to provide all the services, all the plugins, all that. So it’s not about Facebook changing their name to Meta and then saying we’re all about the metaverse, even though they’ve been the least arguably the least trustworthy brand in the modern era since I don’t know, Exxon. We go towards well they want to keep doing the same thing and making money the same way and that’s what Meta is for. I don’t actually think that, I think this is a massive pivot for the company, and that they’re doomed. I talk about this in the book. I don’t think that surveillance capitalism will be a profitable business in 10 years. I think it completely comes apart, look at GDPR right now saying google analytics is not going to work here anymore. That’s his web 2.0 getting smashed, these pillars are already coming down, and I think Mark Zuckerberg has seen this coming since the day he walked in to lucky palmers and put on something that was a space and realized that he had a company about a book. He must have said “oh it’s no longer about pages it’s about spaces” and we’re just seeing the arc of that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark wants an economy, he wants to build the largest economy with the largest amount of services to capture the most. Now people will willingly give over their data in order to optimize and maximize all kinds of inputs and data services around that. He doesn’t have to stay in that same game, and if he doesn’t get out of that game, while building hardware that’s capturing biometric information, the regulators are just going to keep squeezing and squeezing, and the laws and the walls are going to close in. So I don’t see a way out of this for surveillance capitalism-centered businesses, and I think actually that they’re smart enough to know that. This is why they already just announced last week, “hey we’re Twitter, everyone NFTs we have NFTs now” you can take them and move things around. You can build assets as well, say the asset I would like to move around is everything that you have about me, so let me NFT my data, and then I want to move it around, okay that’s what i would like. So I think that everyone’s still pointing in the same direction, and if you’re not, and you think that you’re gonna be the prodigy in aol, it didn’t work last time, but we’re gonna really give it a shot this time. So I just I think everyone’s smart enough not to repeat that play, but just like the oil companies and the automobile companies drag their feet as long as possible squeezing every dollar out of something that was causing arguable harm to the world, they still need to maximize the lens that they operate on, which is a fundamentally, their corporations with capital based goals. So now everyone ever wants an electric car, but it took someone like Elon and Tesla to just come in and change the whole game. So think that that’s what’s happening here, is that the battles for the wordpress of the spatial web or the wordpress of the metaverse, no one’s going to win being the siloed version of the metaverse where you don’t own any of your stuff. It’s going to be a wasteland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a fantastic answer, so we’ve talked about this vision and i think we all have a vision in our minds of what this looks like, we see even films depict this like Ready Player One for example does a really great job like laying out this universe of what it could possibly be like in the future. What’s less clear is how we get from today to there. What does this roll out actually look like? Is there a cut over? Is there a gradual way we get there? What’s this like?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well I mean I can only guess like the rest, but the hardware is the problem. So that’s why you’re seeing billions and billions of dollars being poured into that space, and more or less everyone is going there, so everyone wanted a smartphone. Does everyone remember the facebook smartphone that came out? That lasted like an hour. So Mark was very smart in jumping in on the VR thing when everyone thought that was just whatever, and Google said we’re going to play around in the AR space and their commitment has been soft. Two steps forward, one step back, and a lot of people in that community have not been happy about it, then Magic Leap emerged and said we’re gonna we’re gonna be the new Apple of this space. They said we only need a few billion dollars, and then “oh we spent it all” because it’s hardware and it’s absolutely the worst possible thing to work on, and it’s super hard. So you’re talking about innovation in battery life, innovation in optics, innovation in computing, and it’s just there’s so many pieces. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s like that smartphone moment again, which is why Apple just takes their time, and does the exact same thing they always do, waiting in the background so a lot of the froth is squeezed out and some of the core problems are solved, then they find their own path in. They’re like we don’t care about the metaverse, we’re not talking about the metaverse and they’re gonna come out with something different. But you’re gonna see four or five of these all start to really hit the market in a meaningful way, variations on AR and VR or hybrid sort of mixed reality devices or glasses. Then you’ve got Qualcomm, and others that are building chips now that have so much capability in them, AI powered chips with powerful spatial computing capabilities on it. So you’re gonna get 25 chinese companies that are making essentially the android versions of these things. I think by next year we’re going to see sort of that “iPhone 1” moment, and then that’s going to kick off the party. By the end of the decade, for some that can afford it, because the prices will go down you will have those early “Ready Player One” moments. Halfway into the next decade it seems like that’s the dominant thing so that’s the arc. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course one of the places we’re looking at, because we always tend to look at this through the consumer market lens, really where a lot of this is needed is in industrial spaces. In warehouses and ports, mining and agriculture, and that’s where the holographic part of this is only one layer, like you could think of the metaverse as sort of being the internet of experience. It’s a human-like interface layer of the spatial web while the internet of things is a machine interface. You having an experience where you go into a store, you grab some stuff, a bunch of cameras identify you and the object, and your account, and your wallet, and you walk out and it just charges you, that’s not a metaverse experience. That’s that you’re embedded in a mesh network of the internet of things, but from our lens that’s still the spatial web, and if then something popped up in front of you that gave you a holographic receipt and that was maybe that’s part of the metaverse. But if as you’re walking into the environment you’re seeing information displayed on top of all of the items saying “hey you’re gluten-free this week how about 10 off that”, that’s a metaversal layer on top of an IOT mediated experience. So you have to consider that component, that sort of digitization of the physical, and physicalization of the digital. These things are intersecting, and one sort of abstract point here is that, that’s what language is. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The experience that a deer has of the physics of a space is almost identical. The deer is in my living room. It can navigate that room better than I can, it understands the objects, but it doesn’t know what they are. But I’ve embedded the meaning, “oh that’s my couch, that’s my tv, that this is a picture of my family” it can see all those things, but it doesn’t know what they are. So I’ve embedded this virtual layer of meaning into the world, all these objects have terms, functions, and ideas. I know what they’re supposed to do. A monkey can still tell that it can sit on a couch, it understands the basic physics, it understands gravity, it can even understand the function of a couch, in that manner, but it doesn’t know whether that it might be meaningful socially to me whether it’s from Ikea or it’s from some fancy italian store. That’s a social virtual layer that humans, the human monkey has embedded into the world around us. We both configured it physically, like we shaped all this stuff, all these objects, but we’ve also added this whole virtual layer. Now we’re just doing it in a completely multi-dimensional way, so that the sort of digital twinification is putting those data sets onto the objects, and into the environment, and then we’re going into those sort of imaginary spaces that we put in our brains that we put into books we put in pictures we put into paintings we put into films. Now we’re just making them fully experiential. I think that’s that big shift, is moving from the information based web, to this experiential based web, whether that’s in the physical world or the digital world. Those blurred lines really create some new kind of digital environment and digital era. I don’t have a good word for it, that’s not a good word, forget it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a good start though. So you’ve implied that the roll out of the spatial web is not tied to the success in the hardware of augmented reality or virtual virtual reality hardware, meaning it can start sooner. So what does the rollout of the spatial web technologies look like as opposed to things that are tied to a VR or AR experience?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah what a good question. So well one of the things we just spoke about was it’s really the IOT first perspective. So in a warehouse you’ve got workers that essentially spend eight hours a day walking around 100,000 square feet trying to locate an item in a box. So what you do is you you build a three-dimensional map in your head, because some things are high, and something’s low, and some things are on the second floor, and then you get an order on your android phone it says go to row 17, isle 12 section l and grab item xj4-92. Okay where am I? You do all this three-dimensional triangulation, and then you route yourself. What we found is if you build a digital twin of that entire environment, and you map the inventory into every single location, so you now embedded the information into the space, you can take that same android phone and route that person to that location, and the cognitive load drops in half, and they basically speed up by 30 percent. The productivity, and performance, and actually the mental cost, the tax, we think about “oh people working hard for eight hours and now you’re making them more productive” there are some societal concerns about optimizing human activity in these environments, and there’s been some real concerns about how amazon is doing it, at the same time if you can reduce the cognitive load that’s actually the most expensive part for them, and so that’s one of the functions. So you’re building a three-dimensional twin you’re embedding the information into the environment, and you’re routing the human worker through that, now ultimately that human worker is hands and feet, because you’re no longer relying on the brain to do that much so the ability to then have humans and robots working in that same space or having humans in the day and robots at night or any combination thereof is a function of creating that shared model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> If there’s a shared model, whether it’s in the city and how how drones then decide are the certain flight lanes that they have, or or government policy that says in europe maybe the eu wants to say that the total flight height for all drones of a certain class is 120 meters, but in the netherlands they might want to say that it’s 100, and brussels maybe they say it’s 80, and as a drone passes through, it cannot ever go higher than 120, but as it goes through the netherlands and over the brussels it has to go down and then down. This is the machine’s view of the spatial web, and all of those capabilities and things are necessary right now, look at the supply chain, we had 500,000 cargo containers sitting off the coast here over christmas, and that’s because the ability for these systems to be able to communicate to each other is really poor, and our understanding of supply and demand globally is really bad. You have something like the pandemic hit and the butterfly fly effect is just happening all over the place and we’re not resilient enough to be able to adapt at this scale.&nbsp;So that’s really what the ultimate value of something like the spatial web means, adaptation. So it’s about the internet of experience over here on the metaverse side, the internet of things, this industry 4.0 narrative is about automation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s really the goal. Can we use machines and algorithms to automate physical functions in the system, and if you did that the impact on climate and the amount of carbon we’d be using would be hyper optimized, and we could set thresholds and regulations and the machines could adapt and adjust this. Instead something like the pandemic hits, we all go to Amazon and buy everything we ever wanted to buy because we can’t go anywhere, and then we just log jam every port in the world. This allows us to start to get a more holistic view, and the way that we start to look at the function of monitoring is not so much monitoring and surveillance, because those capabilities will be there, but if you use things like verifiable credentials, you use things like the IDs, and these get built into law and regulation, then we have we can have the ability to share this kind of information with each other. So you can set up a relay race of an adaptive supply chain, don’t send the automated truck until the thing arrives at the port, minimizing the total amount of carbon output. This adaptive thing is very much what organic systems do, this is how the body manages, you’ve got the autonomic nervous system, we need autonomous supply chains. These are the kind of functions that you can have in the spatial web which are absolutely critical, that are not about having an awesome virtual experience or or trying to sell a jpeg for a million bucks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’re claiming then that the world yesterday needs the spatial web, and that the visualization can currently be done, maybe in a 2d factor, or something like on a smartphone, or other flat screens that we have, and then as soon as the AR and VR get ready it’ll slide right into to that function for visualization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>That’s a really important point in this, in the warehouse we have an application that is multi-modal, and some people prefer just the audio, like with turn-by-turn instructions. Some people want to look at the map, some people prefer to hear it, some people want both, in our cases a lot of the workers are spanish so they want spanish audio. Generally they don’t want 3d, we started with 3d holograms, people were like “this is awesome, but i just need this” this is what’s most useful for me. So even this idea that “oh yeah 3d information is better and holograms are better”, we started doing that four years ago, and everyone was impressed and it was faster and easier, but it hurt to wear the headset for eight hours and the battery would only last three hours. So the hardware isn’t ready on that front, but cameras, AI, algorithms, and computer vision are ready to go, and so that’s a place where this is able to start. It’s really quite useful in some of these really critical environments that are far more relevant to our day-to-day lives and not so much in the entertainment or gaming or space. There’ll be education, we won’t be doing zooms like this, we’ll all be awkwardly sitting around a very large table, but there are functions today that are super meaningful for deploying the capabilities and use of the spatial web, and this is without even getting into any of the the broader needs around how DIDs can permeate, and self-sovereign identity is relevant in and of itself. Just like land title ownership by the dimensions this is going to end up being the domains of the spatial web, we will essentially be bound like boundaries. Your home is a domain, your property is a domain, the city’s a domain, today we think of domains as urls but domains in the spatial web are spaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Absolutely, so you’ve hinted at this a little already, which is really powerful. What do governments and companies do now to prepare for the coming spatial web?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I mean I think that there are a few groups that governments and researchers and regulators need to start becoming aware of. Predominantly that’s the work that’s being done around DIDs and DIDcomm, verifiable credentials, and the spatial web foundations working group at the IEEE. I think those are the critical components that you need to understand. I think that there is a more provocative branch off of this question, which is what role do governments play in virtual worlds? So it’s outside your jurisdiction, so what is legal or not not legal, and who says and how? So thinking about your geopolitical domain is one thing, thinking about people physically in your dimension that are experiencing something in another dimension that you have no jurisdictional power or authority over is a question. This ties into larger questions of governance, i mean Minecraft i think is eight times the size of earth. That’s big, that’s a big space, okay that’s one little world, you’re talking there’ll be thousands and then hundreds of thousands. There’s 300 million websites today, there’ll be billions and billions of these environments and spaces, at some point AIs will just auto generate whatever experience you want. Just start choosing adventure in real time based on biometric feedback, so the possibilities here are going to get really weird, really interesting. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chinese quote may you live in interesting times is sort of a double-edged sword. These are interesting times and so these are the kinds of questions. The last question I want to leave you with on this point is if Disney land or H&amp;M or whoever builds a store in decentraland, can I build a Disney store right next to the Disney store in decentraland? Who’s preventing it? Are they respecting the trademark and IP agreements of the United States? We will need treaties between organizations, countries on earth, and in these virtual worlds as if they were other planets. In the same way that we had to look at these challenges when we formed the league of nations or the united nations, we’re going to have other dimensions that we need to interact with that have entire economies that we trade in where the jurisdictions don’t apply. Then again who do you trust in those environments relative to what authorities? And so what prevents me from doing that in decentraland? Why can’t I sell Disney merch? or modify it with marvel or warner brothers stuff or whatever i like? So i think this is where trusts and guarantees around verifiability and credentialing of authorities becomes really critical, and if we’re going to digitize all of this, all of our reality in this next age, and all this money is flowing into the space, these are the kinds of big questions that we’re constantly thinking about and working on with respect to the standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, we are unfortunately out of time, but this has been great to hear your vision and thoughts around these things. Is there anything you’d like to leave us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, I think that the the role of identity is a fundamental pillar, and i think that in the the arc of history when we look at the role of property, and property rights, physical property rights, i just talked about intellectual property rights, data property rights, and digital asset property rights are are the next challenge. This is not a purely philosophical question, this is going to come down to law. So we need to start thinking of what does digital law mean in the 21st century? And making sure that the work we’re doing is addressing some of those questions, or hosting some of those conversations, I’d like to see more constitutional lawyers involved in these conversations. I’d like to see people that are really working through this sort of lens of data rights and ethics having these dialogues. That’s why I think that the next battleground is property rights, with respect to the function of data and the things that data form, which become these new hyperspatial objects in this next era.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, Gabriel, thank you for spending this time with us we’re we’re grateful for your willingness to be here. I hope everyone enjoyed this conversation and we’ll look forward to seeing you all in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me, take care everybody&nbsp;</p>

   In order to counter the ever-growing threat of stolen, fraudulent or fabricated identity data being used to access services, a KYC process needs to be able to verify that the applicant is in fact real - in other words, to evaluate their ‘Liveness’. Passive Liveness allows companies to provide customers with frictionless onboarding while offering a new level of protection against identity fraud.

  <p>Front-end applications are becoming ever bigger and more complex. It is not uncommon for a React app to have hundreds or even thousands of components. As the project size increases, build times become increasingly important. In large projects, you may have to wait up to a minute for the code to be translated and bundled into a production package run in the browser. The compile and load times for the development server are also a big issue for these projects. Changes in the code may only show up in the browser after a few seconds. These wait times have become a bottleneck that slows down development.</p>

<p><a href="https://vitejs.dev/">Vite</a> addresses this problem by providing a development server and a lightning-fast build command. Vite, pronounced <code>/vit/</code>, is French for “quick,” and this name describes the goal for this tool. The build command uses <a href="https://github.com/rollup/rollup">Rollup</a> under the hood, which is preconfigured to create highly optimized code. The development server makes use of browser support for ES modules. Hot Module Replacement will instantly load any codebase changes into the browser.</p>

<p>Vite was originally developed for Vue, but you can also create React and Svelte projects out of the box. In this tutorial, I will show you how to create a TypeScript-based React application using Vite. The application will be a simple number conversion tool that converts decimal numbers to hexadecimal and binary. I won’t assume any prior knowledge apart from a familiarity with JavaScript.</p>

<p>Prerequisites:</p>

 Using Vite to create the TypeScript React application 

<p>Before you start, you should have recent versions of Node and npm installed on your system. The first step is to use the Vite command to create a new application. This can be done using the <code>npm init</code> command without installing any additional software. Open a terminal in a folder of your choice and run the following command.</p>

   <code>npm init vite@latest vite-number-conversion -- --template react-ts
</code>   

<p>If you are using an older version of <code>npm</code> (below version 7), you’ll need to modify the command slightly.</p>

   <code>npm init vite@2.8.0 vite-number-conversion --template react-ts
</code>   

<p>This command will generate a new folder <code>vite-number-conversion</code> and initialize it with the <code>react-ts</code> template. If you are asked to agree to install the <code>create-vite</code> package, simply answer with yes. This template creates a React project using TypeScript and all the configuration for tooling required to develop and build the project. Next, navigate into the new project folder and run the command below to install all the dependencies.</p>

   <code>npm install
</code>   

<p>You will be using the React Router to manage navigation through your single-page app. Run the following command to install the additional dependency.</p>

   <code>npm install -E react-router-dom@5.3.0 @types/react-router-dom@5.3.3
</code>   

<p>Now open your favorite IDE in the project folder. Feel free to browse around a little to get familiar with the code that Vite has generated. If you are familiar with <code>create-react-app</code>, you will notice that the differences are not that big on the surface. There is a Vite-specific configuration file, <code>vite.config.ts</code>, to tweak Vite’s behavior. For now, leave it as it is, but we will get back to this file later.</p>

<p>Your React components are saved as <code>.tsx</code> files in the <code>src/</code> folder. To keep things organized, create a new folder <code>src/components</code> and add a new file <code>src/components/Home.tsx</code>. This will be the component to show the application’s home page. Paste the following contents into the file.</p>

   <code>function Home() {
    return &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Number Converter&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
}

export default Home;
</code>   

<p>Next, create the component that contains the number conversion tool. Create another file <code>src/components/Converter.tsx</code> with the contents below.</p>

   <code>import { useState } from 'react';

function Converter() {
    const [value, setValue] = useState&lt;number&gt;();
    const [origin, setOrigin] = useState&lt;string&gt;();
    const isDisabled = (base: string) =&gt; (origin !== undefined &amp;&amp; origin !== base);
    
    const updateValue = (baseName: string, base: number) =&gt; 
        (e: React.ChangeEvent&lt;HTMLInputElement&gt;) =&gt; {
            if (e.target.value === "") {
                setValue((oldValue) =&gt; undefined);
                setOrigin((oldOrigin) =&gt; undefined);
            } else {
                setValue((oldValue) =&gt; {
                    const newValue = parseInt(e.target.value, base);
                    return isNaN(newValue) ? oldValue : newValue;
                });
                setOrigin((oldOrigin) =&gt; baseName);
            }
        }

    return &lt;div className="Converter"&gt;
        &lt;label&gt;
            Decimal:
            &lt;input type="string" 
                value={value?.toString(10) || ""}
                name="decimal" 
                onChange={updateValue("decimal", 10)} 
                disabled={isDisabled("decimal")}/&gt;
        &lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;label&gt;
            Hexadecimal:
            &lt;input type="string" 
                value={value?.toString(16) || ""}
                name="hex" 
                onChange={updateValue("hex", 16)} 
                disabled={isDisabled("hex")}/&gt;
        &lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;label&gt;
            Binary:
            &lt;input type="string" 
                value={value?.toString(2) || ""}
                name="binary" 
                onChange={updateValue("binary", 2)} 
                disabled={isDisabled("binary")}/&gt;
        &lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
}

export default Converter;
</code>   

<p>The <code>Converter</code> component contains three input fields, one for the decimal value, one for the hexadecimal value, and one for the binary value. It also uses two state variables. <code>value</code> contains the number that should be converted to the different formats, and <code>origin</code> includes the input field’s name in which the user has entered a number. The idea is to disable the input elements filled automatically with the converted values—the <code>isDisabled()</code> callback controls which elements are disabled.</p>

<p>The <code>updateValue()</code> function is a little bit more tricky. It is a function that returns a callback configured with the name and the number-base of the input field. The callback takes the <code>ChangeEvent</code> and updates the component state according to the value in the input field. In the functional programming style, higher-order functions like <code>updateValue()</code> can provide a mechanism to implement configurable code without creating code repetition.</p>

<p>Next, open <code>src/main.tsx</code> and add the Router to the application. At the top of the file, add the following import.</p>

   <code>import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
</code>   

<p>Then, modify the render function to look like the code below.</p>

   <code>ReactDOM.render(
  &lt;React.StrictMode&gt;
    &lt;BrowserRouter&gt;
      &lt;App /&gt;
    &lt;/BrowserRouter&gt;
  &lt;/React.StrictMode&gt;,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
</code>   

<p>To add the routes to the application, open <code>src/App.tsx</code> and replace its contents with the following code.</p>

   <code>import './App.css'
import { Link, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './components/Home';
import Converter from './components/Converter';

function App() {
  return (
    &lt;div className="App"&gt;
      &lt;nav&gt;
        &lt;div className="menu"&gt;
          &lt;Link to="/"&gt;Home&lt;/Link&gt;
          &lt;Link to="/converter"&gt;Converter&lt;/Link&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/nav&gt;
      &lt;Switch&gt;
        &lt;Route exact path="/" component={Home} /&gt;
        &lt;Route path="/converter" component={Converter} /&gt;
      &lt;/Switch&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  )
}

export default App
</code>   

<p>The application is mostly complete, but it needs some styling. Open <code>src/App.css</code> and edit it to match the CSS below.</p>

   <code>.App {
  text-align: center;
}

.App nav {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  background-color: #333333;
  color: #ffffff;
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
}

.App nav a {
  color: #ffffff;
  text-decoration: none;
  margin-left: 1rem;
  margin-right: 1rem;
}

.Converter {
  text-align: left;
  margin: 1rem 4rem;
}

.Converter label {
  display: block;
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

.Converter input {
  display: block;
  margin-top: 0.5rem;
}
</code>   

 Start it up and watch it run 

<p>Now, the fun begins! You are ready to start the application. Open the terminal in the project folder and run the following command.</p>

   <code>npm run dev
</code>   

<p>If you are used to React applications built with <code>create-react-app</code>, you might expect to wait a few seconds before the development server starts. With Vite, I see the following message in less than a second.</p>

   <code>  vite v2.8.4 dev server running at:

  &gt; Local: http://localhost:3000/
  &gt; Network: use `--host` to expose

  ready in 461ms.
</code>   

<p>You can now open your browser at <code>http://localhost:3000/</code> and test the application. When I click the Converter link in the navigation bar, I see something like this.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I opened up the Developer Tools in Chrome to understand how Vite achieves these fast starting-up times. When you open up the Network tab and filter by JS requests, you will see many requests to individual JavaScript sources. You will even see the <code>.tsx</code> sources you just edited.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I then looked closer at <code>App.tsx,</code> and saw what is shown in the above image. When the development server is asked to serve a <code>.tsx</code> file, it will compile it on the fly into browser-compatible code. But it keeps all the <code>import</code> statements in place and uses the support for ES modules in the newer browsers. This way, the bundling stage is eliminated, and the loading times are significantly reduced.</p>

 Adding authentication with Okta to the application 

<p>A secure application needs user authentication to keep unauthorized users out of restricted areas. With Okta, it is easy to add authentication to your Vite application in just a few steps.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:3000/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:3000</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:3000</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/react/create-okta-application/">Create a React App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Now you are ready to add the Okta libraries for React into your project. Open the terminal in the project folder and run the following command.</p>

   <code>npm install -E @okta/okta-react@6.4.2 @okta/okta-auth-js@6.1.0
</code>   

<p>Vite needs some help resolving import aliases used by the Okta libraries. To make things work, open <code>vite.config.ts</code> and add the following entry to the configuration object.</p>

   <code>resolve: {
  alias: [
    {
      find: "@okta/okta-auth-js",
      replacement: require.resolve("@okta/okta-auth-js/dist/okta-auth-js.umd.js"),
    },
  ],
}
</code>   

<p>If your IDE or build can’t resolve <code>require</code>, you may need to add the <code>@types/node</code> library for the <code>require</code> method. In the terminal, add the library by running the following command:</p>

   <code>npm i –save-dev @types/node
</code>   

<p>Now, open <code>src/main.tsx</code> and add the following code immediately after the <code>import</code> statements.</p>

   <code>import { Security } from '@okta/okta-react';
import { OktaAuth, toRelativeUrl } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';

const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
  issuer: `/oauth2/default`,
  clientId: '{yourClientID}',
  redirectUri: `${window.location.origin}/callback`,
});

function restoreOriginalUri(oktaAuth: OktaAuth, originalUri: string) {
  window.location.replace(
    toRelativeUrl(originalUri || "/", window.location.origin)
  );
}
</code>   

<p>Here <code>{yourClientID}</code> is the client ID that you obtained earlier and <code>{yourOktaDomain}</code> is your Okta domain. Next, surround the <code>BrowserRouter</code> component with the <code>Security</code> component, passing in <code>oktaAuth</code> and <code>restoreOriginalUri</code> as parameters. The call to the render function should look something like this.</p>

   <code>ReactDOM.render(
  &lt;React.StrictMode&gt;
    &lt;Security oktaAuth={oktaAuth} restoreOriginalUri={restoreOriginalUri}&gt;
      &lt;BrowserRouter&gt;
        &lt;App /&gt;
      &lt;/BrowserRouter&gt;
    &lt;/Security&gt;
  &lt;/React.StrictMode&gt;,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
</code>   

<p>Now that you have made the <code>OktaAuth</code> object available to your application, you are ready to create a secured route and configure the login process. Open <code>src/App.tsx</code> and add the following import.</p>

   <code>import { LoginCallback, SecureRoute } from '@okta/okta-react';
</code>   

<p>Finally, convert the route that serves the <code>Converter</code> component to a secured route and add another route that handles the login callback from Okta. The code inside the <code>Switch</code> component should resemble the code below.</p>

   <code>&lt;Switch&gt;
  &lt;Route exact path="/" component={Home} /&gt;
  &lt;SecureRoute path="/converter" component={Converter} /&gt;
  &lt;Route path="/callback" component={LoginCallback} /&gt;
&lt;/Switch&gt;
</code>   

<p>Congratulations, you are ready to power up the application again. If it is still not running, run the command below in the terminal.</p>

   <code>npm run dev
</code>   

<p>Now, whenever you navigate to the Converter route, the application checks if you are authenticated. If not, it will redirect you to the Okta sign-in page, where you can enter your user credentials. After successfully logging in, you are able to access the application page you requested.</p>

 Learn more about React, TypeScript, and Okta 

<p>In this tutorial, I guided you through creating a TypeScript React application using Vite. Vite is a lightning-fast development server and package bundler that leverages modern ES module browser support and Hot Module Replacement—speeding up refresh times after changes to the codebase can significantly improve development productivity.</p>

<p>As an example, I showed you how to implement a number conversion utility that converts between decimal, hexadecimal, and binary formats. The application was secured using Okta authentication, and you have seen how this can be achieved in just a few lines of code.</p>

<p>During the presentation he will aproach the following aspects:</p>



  the role of a QTSP and the outsourcing of liability  the balance among user experience, security, legal value, and regulatory compliance  the evolution of customer journeys thanks to new technologies and regulations  



<p>To register, visit <a href="https://client-onboarding-forum.com/">client-onboarding-forum.com</a>.</p>



<p>Client Onboarding is one of the most critical functions for banks as it directly impacts client experience, servicing, and relationships — all of which, in turn, impact profits. </p>



<p>In this challenging economic environment, banks are expected to match each other quite closely in terms of product innovation and financial service offerings. A real difference will, therefore, lie in creating a high-quality first impression. The financial institutions must deal with yet another aspect of the economic fallout-Customer Satisfaction. </p>



<p>The global Banking landscape has been forever changed by the evolutionary credit crisis, leaving issues of trust, customers attrition, brand loyalty,and the resulting revenue declines trailing in its wake. To ensure the success, financial institutions, while marshaling resources to raise capital and cut costs where possible, must not overlook their lifeblood-ongoing acquisition, optimization, and retention of the customers. </p>



<p>The bottom line is that financial institutions must improve customer experience to keep customers happy and satisfied.</p>

 How to stay safe online 



<p>Now more than ever, your online safety is paramount. Thousands of cyber-attacks happen every day, and your personal details could be at risk. Nowadays, most people store a lot of personal information on devices or through online accounts, and if you don’t protect yourself, it is possible that your details could be stolen without your knowledge which can lead to dire consequences.</p>



<p>At Revoke, we have outlined how you can stay safe online!</p>



 Keep your personal information limited 



<p>Only put information that is needed online. Strangers don’t need to know about your relationship status, home address and phone number. You would never physically give out your information to strangers, so why would you online?</p>



<p>For social media sites, we recommend only providing the base data such as your name and ensuring your privacy settings are strict so that strangers can’t view everything that you do with your life. Many people have login details that contain something about their personal life, and publicly displaying this information could lead to unauthorised access to your accounts. In 2019, information related to 530 million Facebook accounts were exposed online for anyone to search and use.</p>



 Choose strong passwords 



<p>Never have passwords that are easy to guess or use the same password across multiple platforms. It’s important to keep them varied and complex, using at least 12 characters along with a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols. In the event that your data is compromised in a breach, it will be less damaging if the data is only associated with one account, and anyone accessing this data cannot use it on other platforms.</p>



 Use secure sites 



<p>When browsing online, make sure to look to see if there is a lock symbol beside the URL. If the site does not show this, it means that the site you are on is not secure and that you are in danger of someone else tracking what you’re doing without your knowledge. An unlocked website is now a sign that a website may be dangerous.</p>



<p>Most internet traffic comes from automated sources that can include bots and spammers, along with more malicious sources. Using secure websites means that you are safer from having your data accessed and keeps hackers and thieves at bay.</p>



 Make sure your internet connection is secure 



<p>Ensure that the device you are using online is secure. If you are using a public internet connection, make sure to think twice before providing personal information, as these free Wi-Fi sources provide you with no control over the security. It may be worth waiting until you are on a more trustworthy connection before providing this information.&nbsp;</p>



 Practice safe browsing 



<p>Be careful what you click. Data breaches and attacks commonly happen through malware disguised as other content, used to tempt you to click. One careless click could expose your personal data or infect your device with malware. In Britain, it has been reported that more than two-thirds of adults had been targeted in the first half of 2021 and that from April 2020 to April 2021, consumers had been scammed out of £2.3bn (and that’s just people who reported it).</p>



<p>Instead of giving up your searches to Google or storing them to monetise, why not give a privacy-centric search engine such as <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> a try? It does work!</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Markus Grüneberg</a></p><p>Among the longstanding challenges that information security leaders have grappled with for years, one stands out: the difficulty of balancing user experience and security. The traditional tug-of-war between ease of access to business-critical applications and resources and robust protection from hackers has never been easy.</p>
<p>Until now.</p>
<p>The unprecedented demands that the COVID-19 pandemic have placed on IT and security teams have tested their flexibility, inventiveness and resolve. But they’ve also had a silver lining. Across industries — particularly in those that are highly regulated or have trended towards early adoption of cloud technologies — interest and investments in Zero Trust security initiatives are at an all-time high.</p>
<p>We surveyed more than 600 security decision-makers across North America, Asia-Pacific (APAC), and Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) for our <a href="https://www.okta.com/resources/whitepaper-the-state-of-zero-trust-security-2021-report/">recent 2021 State of Zero Trust Security report</a> and discovered that 90% of organisations are currently working on Zero Trust implementation projects or plan to start one in the near future. Despite Zero Trust being coined as a network security concept by Forrester in 2010 (and conceived even earlier by the Jericho Forum), in 2019 only 16% of organisations had begun this journey. In 2020, 41% of organisations were working on Zero Trust initiatives and this shift has accelerated along with the remote working and cloud transformation programmes observed in response to the pandemic. The shift was particularly dramatic in EMEA, where only 18% of organisations had Zero Trust agendas in 2020 and 90% had planned or begun one this year.</p>
<p>For most global organisations, moving from legacy perimeter-based security methodologies (in which internal networks are “trusted” and external ones are “untrusted”) to an identity-centric <a href="https://www.okta.com/zero-trust/">Zero Trust-based approach</a> (in which identity is the new perimeter and users are secured individually so that they’re able to access the resources they need regardless of the location, device or network from which they’re connecting) isn’t simple or easy.</p>
<p>But pandemic response, combined with the need to support remote work has pushed growing numbers of organisations to accelerate Zero Trust adoption. As they do so, they’re seeing added benefits — enhanced flexibility for users who want to continue working remotely at least some of the time, and less friction for employees who increasingly depend on seamless access to cloud resources if they’re to remain productive in the modern digital business landscape. This trend has the potential to end the battle between usability and security – once and for all.</p>
<p>A key example here is the combined use of Single Sign-On (SSO) and adaptive Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). SSO enables user access to multiple resources once authenticated. This is convenient for the user but, when used by itself,&nbsp; SSO inherently increases risk as an attacker could likewise use that access if compromised. So, the authentication must be protected with MFA to ensure security.</p>
<p>By making that MFA ‘adaptive’, access can be readily granted to lower risk resources, with unusual or higher risk access attempts prompting a step up authentication challenge. Adaptive, context-based access policies reduce friction for users by prompting for MFA less frequently but ensuring security when it matters.</p>
<p></p>
 Identity is the cornerstone of Zero Trust 
<p>By definition, Zero Trust is an approach to security that ensures that the right people have the right level of access to the right resources in the right contexts, and that that access is re-assessed continuously — all without adding friction for users. To build a security architecture that achieves this aim, organisations must mature their approach to identity and access management, since identity is the cornerstone of Zero Trust.</p>
<p>As organisations implement Zero Trust architectures, they tend to progress through several relatively consistent stages of maturity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It’s important to note that the technologies adopted by organisations that are further along the Zero Trust maturity curve are those that not only provide more robust and consistent protection for greater numbers of users accessing more and more resources, but also include key capabilities that both simplify management and improve end users’ experience.</p>
 Zero Trust is Here to Stay 
<p>The shifts that were set in motion by COVID-19 &nbsp;will be with us for the long haul. Even as employees return to the office or work in a hybrid fashion, remote work will remain far more popular and widespread than it was in 2019. And the necessity of having secure and frictionless access to cloud resources as well as a diverse and distributed set of IT assets will only become more foundational for business success. We’ll never go back to yesterday’s perimeter-bound networks.</p>
<p>As a result, it’s a safe bet that adoption of technologies like passwordless and biometric authentication will continue to climb. Passwords are brittle, of course, and maintaining Active Directory on-premises with few cloud integrations creates friction for users and administrative overhead for IT and security teams alike. Modernising with a Zero Trust-based, identity-centric approach creates a win for all stakeholders: the organisation will mitigate today’s greatest risks at the same time that users enjoy seamless experiences and security teams exercise more granular visibility and control. This is why industry analysts, <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">government agencies</a> and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">regulatory bodies</a> are all increasingly calling for Zero Trust’s large-scale adoption.</p>

<p>The Fintech ecosystem in Vietnam has been expanding more than ever in these recent years. Its mobile payment industry is expected to record a CAGR of 22.8% to reach US$ 27.7 billion by 2025 [<a href="https://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/s3dq39/vietnam_mobile?w=4">Source</a>]. Thus, we would like to know how Fintech has disrupted Vietnamese consumer behavior and what Fintech trends should be expected in Vietnam’s market for the next couple of years.</p>



<p>Business managers/bidev officers from potential partners that want to take a step ahead of the game in digitizing their businesses and catching up with Fintech trends.</p>



<p>This article serves as an entry to the thought-leadership articles by Credify, along with three other interview articles in the series #TalkwithCredify’sleaders</p>

 Personal Journey 



 Can you introduce a little bit about yourself and share your story when shifting from working in Engineering to doing Business? 



<p>I started my formal career as an engineer in the embedded operating system space, working with Symbian and Nokia. This was mainly systems-level development, and I was excited to see our technologies really taking hold in the world.</p>



<p>After this, I was given the opportunity to join an early-stage biometrics startup called Authentec, where we developed a small form factor fingerprint sensing technology that dominated the market. With this company, we managed to list on Nasdaq and eventually sold the business to Apple. If you’ve used TouchID, you have interacted with the products we built.</p>



<p>Following my work with Authentec, I made an important transition from engineering to technical marketing and business development with Validity Sensors, and with Apple taking Authentec’s products off the market, we were ready to meet the demand with our new offering.</p>



<p>The shift to the business side was a goal of mine after I became fascinated with the inner workings of enterprises, viewing them in many ways similar to complex engineering systems. I felt for someone with a more outgoing personality it made a lot of sense to be able to apply my systems understanding in such away.</p>



<p>Even though I made this transition, I have always been a technologist and can never really completely remove myself from the product side of the business.</p>



 What inspired you to found Credify? Why did you choose Vietnam as a primary market? 



<p>In 2014 I was introduced to Blockchain Technology and spent several years researching and playing around with these systems. During 2017 there was a boom in projects seeking to leverage blockchain, but I felt that majority of them were disingenuous in the application of the technology, with the sole aim to raise insane amounts of money through ICOs without any products in the market.</p>



<p>In 2018, I began to delve into researching real-world use cases for blockchain and smart contract systems and came up with the initial concept of Credify, a protocol for harnessing crowd intelligence to signal counterparty reputation or credibility in the case where the data we traditionally rely on for this is insufficient or easily manipulated. I wrote the seminal academic white paper for the Credify protocol, which included a decentralized identity system that now serves as the basis for our idX technology, and proceeded to patent this globally.</p>



<p>Our focus for Credify has always been the developing world, where we can have the most impact in terms of empowering users with their own data to gain access to fairer credit and life-changing insurance.</p>



<p>Vietnam was a natural great choice for our first market, as we have a strong team here and a broad personal network. Additionally, Vietnam is one of the quickest to begin a serious transition to the new world of digital services, with partners like banks, consumer finance institutions, and insurance companies welcoming solutions like Credify’s serviceX with open arms, as we help them expedite their digital transformation journeys.</p>



<p>We are closely working with top-tier financial service partners to solve some of the really hard problems they face when natively introducing their services to users in Vietnam’s new digital economy. This openness to collaboration is a huge factor in our choice, and given the speed with which we are onboarding financial services partners in the country, it is proving a correct decision.</p>



<p>I should also share that Vietnam is a country that the founding members are absolutely in love with, so it made our decision even easier.</p>



 What were some of the challenges that you faced when establishing Credify? 



<p>In this space, we must comply with complex and often murky regulations, and an uncompromising approach to system security is of utmost importance. Local operators do not always immediately recognize the scope of painstaking efforts that we have put into creating the solutions to the challenges that they both do and will face as these regulatory and security burdens increase, but once we overcome this hurdle of awareness the value of our proposition is deeply appreciated.<br><br>One other challenge we face is the task-driven mentality of the workforce. In our line of business and at our stage, it is absolutely imperative that all our team members take initiative, ownership in our vision and engage with the passion and creativity necessary to solve some really hard problems. It has been a slow process to build a team with this mindset, but we are managing step by step, and the results are simply inspiring!</p>



 The current state of Vietnam’s fintech ecosystem 



 What are some key elements that are helping Vietnam become an attractive market to invest and develop Fintech in? 



<p>The pace of digital adoption cannot be ignored, but I would also say that the ecosystem is robust and open to embracing innovation where it proves practical to the overarching goals of all stakeholders. The government has been very friendly towards fintech upstarts, as well, not being quick to impose overly burdensome requirements that ultimately stifle innovation. From this, the West could learn a lot.<br><br>Vietnam also represents a rich resource for technical talent, with the government, has placed special emphasis on the development of the local educational system to focus on STEM. Having local talent of this caliber really helps us to achieve quicker GTM and a special level of support that is hard to realize where high-quality tech talent is scarce.</p>



 How has Fintech disrupted the Vietnamese market and consumer behaviors, especially in this time of the pandemic? 



<p>By far, the biggest impact on the Vietnamese market and consumer behavior in COVID times has been the rapid urban adoption of cashless payment solutions like e-wallets and QR payments provided directly by banks. We are still a long way away from mass adoption across the nation, but the trend is undeniable.</p>



<p>This being said, we have found that many of the well-respected local financial institutions are struggling to compete with fintech as they seek to bring new innovations to the market. This is exactly where Credify lends the strongest helping hand, as we assist these traditional businesses in bringing their services and products into the digital world more quickly, with lower capital investment requirements and with a much broader scope of availability than if they were to attempt to develop the user engagement channels that Credify offers from the outset.</p>



 What role does Credify play in Vietnam’s current fintech ecosystem? What position is it aiming for? 



<p>Currently, Credify is simplifying access to financial services for users in the digital economy by natively integrating our banking, consumer finance, and insurance partner services with digital commerce platforms, gig economy on-demand service applications, as well as SME wholesale and management systems.</p>



<p>The solutions we offer are empowering users with highly relevant and competitive financial service and product offerings that are being tailored to their individual profiles and needs, removing frictions that are inherent to cross-industry service offerings, and increasing engagement rates for greater levels of client success.</p>



<p>Through one integration, both sides gain immediate access to a rapidly growing network of partners, and soon will be able to leverage offline operational reach through the same channel. We are expanding serviceX to capture offline retail (O2O) opportunities, where financial institutions are currently spending too much to support their existing manually driven customer onboarding processes.</p>







 Vietnam’s Fintech trends in the future 



 What are the successful Fintech solutions in developed markets that would likely become key trends in Vietnam in the near future (E.g: embedded finance, BNPL, etc)? 



<p>There are a few trends of note that have emerged over the past several years in the financial services space that I think is quite important for understanding the direction that the Vietnam market will take.</p>



<p>First is digital banking. Challenger banks are popping up quickly around the world that are more agile, data-driven, and customer experience-minded, all powered by completely digital banking cores like Mambu, and Vietnam is no exception with no fewer than 4 fully licensed digital banks have come to market over the past year. This trend is being expedited by COVID’s impact on traditional banking, which has forced the State Bank of Vietnam to push new regulations around eKYC and digital lending through the legal approval processes much quicker than in times past. This has put competitive pressure on slower-moving or less well-capitalized banks to digitally transform.</p>



<p>Open Banking and Banking-as-a-Service, where banks are adopting standards like OIDC for user authorized access by third parties to their customers’ banking data and API enabled account services. Dominant players like our BEENEXT portfolio sister company Brankas in Indonesia are helping these heavily regulated institutions achieve their digital transformation (DX) goals faster and more cheaply with BaaS platforms. We see that many banks in Vietnam have already begun to explore these types of systems, and we are even working with several at Credify to assist them in these pursuits, especially in digital lending.</p>



<p>Strict regulations and outdated underwriting systems have kept more traditional banking institutions from entering into the fully digital lending space, but here is where Credify is changing the game. We are partnering with several top banks and consumer finance companies in Vietnam to co-develop digital lending services like unsecured cash loans, BNPL, and co-branded virtual credit cards.</p>



<p>With serviceX, we are availing a massive distribution network to these products in our rapidly expanding partnerships base with offline retail, e-commerce, and gig economy application operators. We partner with these ecosystems to natively embed all aspects of these new products–from onboarding to disbursement to account servicing–and enable them to make use of their valuable data in a completely privacy-preserving manner to achieve better conversion rates, lower maintenance costs, and realize higher levels of customer engagement and stickiness, all the while contributing to absolutely amazing user experiences. This is the future. This is embedded finance.</p>



 What advice would you give for Vietnamese businesses to prepare for the rising trends? 



<p>Do not be afraid to embrace new technologies to enhance your services and gain much broader market exposure. Fire any consultants or internal management that tell you that you can develop these technologies in-house more efficiently than solution providers that have focused their entire operations on innovating and perfecting these services as core offerings of their businesses.</p>



<p>Focus on elevating excellence in your core business and work with partners to achieve your DX goals faster, more efficiently, and to a higher degree of quality than you would ever be able to on your own.</p>



<p>I’ve seen far too many financial institutions both in developed and developing economies allow the “not invented here” mentality to drag their operational efficiency down to a crawl, forcing them to settle on mediocre service quality and user experiences and ultimately hindering their ability to effectively compete in this fast-changing world.</p>



<p>Even if you decide that Credify isn’t a good fit, we encourage you to collaborate with focused technology partners rather than attempting to grow these solutions in-house, as you will without a doubt see desired outcomes faster and greater levels of success for making such a smart decision early on.</p>

This key milestone enables trading partners using either platform to securely exchange and verify each other’s credentials as Authorized Trading Partners&nbsp;(ATPs).</p>Spherity and XATP enable real-time interoperability for Authorized Trading Partners.<p>A critical DSCSA requirement is the assurance that regulated interactions happen exclusively between ATPs: properly registered manufacturers, repackagers, wholesalers, third-party logistics providers (3PLs), and dispensers. More than 60,000 U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain participants are legally required to achieve regulatory compliance by November 2023. Both XATP and Spherity offer electronic solutions that deliver on the FDA guidance to respond to data requests in under one&nbsp;minute.</p><p>“The DSCSA mandates electronic interoperability across the entire U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain, and decentralized credentials have emerged as the only realistic path to achieving regulatory compliance,” said XATP president Ben Taylor. “With decentralized credentials, each ATP’s identity is in their own hands. We are excited to work alongside Spherity to enable real-time interoperability for ATPs in a zero-trust world.”</p><p>“Spherity is thrilled to be working alongside XATP to deliver the world’s first truly interoperable exchange between credentialing platforms for DSCSA compliance,” said Georg Jürgens, Manager Industry Solutions at Spherity. “Trading partners can acquire user-friendly digital wallets and ATP credentials to engage in DSCSA-regulated interactions.”</p><p>As members of the <a href="http://oc-i.org/">Open Credentialing Initiative</a> (OCI), Spherity and XATP both support the use of W3C-specified Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), GS1 messaging standards and data attributes, and open standards to achieve safe and secure credentialing and information exchange between&nbsp;ATPs.</p><p>“The clock is ticking on DSCSA compliance, and identity lies at the heart of every interaction between trading partners,” said OCI facilitator Bob Celeste. “Today’s announcement is a key moment for verifiable credentials in the pharmaceutical industry, as we all work together to further secure the U.S. drug&nbsp;supply.”</p><p>Spherity and XATP have both launched programs for ATPs and solution providers to obtain and test credentials for ATP authentication.

<p>Last week’s Holochain release brings improvements on many performance fronts. It tackles some database query inefficiencies, bringing some welcome reductions in RAM and CPU usage. Meanwhile, the developer community is exploring last the previous release’s breaking changes to validation, and have produced some materials worth watching if you’re trying to understand what these changes mean for your hApp.</p> A second note about breaking changes <p>This is a follow-up to my <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/big-hdk-change/#a-note-about-breaking-hdk-changes">previous note</a>. From now on, I’m going to be more explicit about breaking changes for each release, by starting the release notes with a big bold warning about anything that’s broken compatibility in the following seven categories. By ‘breaking’ I only mean something that is incompatible with the previous release of Holochain or any other component I’m reporting on — not the change in DNA hash that happens whenever you recompile a zome as described in last Dev Pulse.</p>  Network protocol: This is the gossip protocol that Holochain peers use to talk to each other. No updates are required for your zome code, except when a network message changes the data passed through the host API.  Host API: This is both the API that the conductor exposes to your zome code, such as source chain write functions, DHT retrieval functions, and crypto functions; and the API of callbacks that the conductor expects your zome code to implement, such as init and validation functions, and any arbitrary functions that make up your zome’s public API. A breaking change in the host API always results in a breaking change in the HDK and will require you to update your zome code to match.  HDK: This is the Rust-based SDK that your zome code can use to interact with the conductor. If the host API introduces breaking changes, the HDK will always change. Occasionally it will change in a way that’s invisible to you as an application developer, but even here your zome code will need to be recompiled in order to work with the updated host API. And occasionally the HDK can change in ways that maintain compatibility with the host API, such as <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1156">December’s changes</a> to <code>Path</code>.  Database: This is the SQLite database that holds users’ source chain data, the DHT shard they hold, and DHT routing and health information. If its schema changes, any application data stored by previous releases of the Holochain conductor will no longer work with the new release. No updates are required for your zome code, except when a change is caused by a change to information passed through the host API.  Conductor APIs: The conductor exposes these APIs to any client running on the user’s machine via a local HTTP connection that sends and receives MessagePack data as WebSocket messages. There are two APIs: the admin API, which lets a client manipulate hApps, agent keys, and change conductor configuration; and the application API, which lets a client actually call a hApp’s exposed zome functions. Any change in these APIs will also change the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js">JavaScript</a> and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-rust">Rust</a> conductor client libraries.  Conductor config format: User and developer machines specify conductor configuration in this format. Changes to it will require users and developers to modify existing config files, as well as scripts that specify conductor config as command-line arguments.  Keystore protocol: The Lair keystore, which stores all the user’s cryptographic secrets on their machine, has a protocol that it exposes to their conductor over a local socket. If this protocol changes, the conductor will come bundled with a new Lair binary, and the new keystore file format will sometimes also change, requiring users to create a new one.  Bootstrap API and proxy protocol: The bootstrap and proxy are two semi-centralised services that help peers discover each other and communicate through firewalls. The conductor talks directly to them using their APIs/protocols. If those change, both the conductor and the bootstrap and proxy binaries (bundled in the Holonix development environment) will change, and our publicly hosted bootstrap and proxy instances will be upgraded too.   Holochain 0.0.128: Database query improvements <p>Breaking changes warning: network protocol, bootstrap API</p><p>In preparation for Holo’s ‘long-term app testing’ <a href="https://holo.host/roadmap/">milestone</a>, the core dev team wrote a performance test that would simulate a DHT with 15 GB of chat data, hosted by ten conductors — essentially trying to recreate how Elemental Chat would be performing by the end of our multi-week testing run. Initially, the test result wasn’t that great: it couldn’t even complete on a fairly high-powered development machine, as CPU consumption went to 100%.</p><blockquote>Now, after a lot of work (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1243">#1243</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1244">#1244</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1245">#1245</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1246">#1246</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1247">#1247</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1248">#1248</a>) that same test runs on the same development machine with each conductor using only 2% CPU and 65 MB of RAM, for a total of 20% CPU and 650 MB RAM. That’s an impressive improvement!</blockquote><p>Now, it’s important to make meaningful comparisons. This doesn’t mean that every happ will run like this on any sort of computer — some will consume more resources; others less. But this test shows that, even under high gossip load, Holochain is now doing much better than it was a few weeks ago — and it’s more than capable of supporting a public and heavily-used Elemental Chat application.</p><p>It also makes Holochain more viable for low-powered systems such as Raspberry Pis and smartphones. This has always been one of our guiding principles. This helps companies like RedGrid achieve their goal of running Holochain on IoT devices.</p><blockquote>Note: on 3 March RedGrid rejoined our commercial director David Atkinson in a <a href="https://youtu.be/8x-FJkIBDh0">live-streamed interview</a> to share some status updates on the Internet of Energy Network. I found the whole thing really inspiring; I hope you do too!</blockquote>An excerpt from Holo’s 2018 <a href="https://files.holo.host/2018/03/Holo-Green-Paper.pdf">green paper</a>, highlighting Holochain’s resource efficiency. It makes me curious about how many Elemental Chat instances a base-model Raspberry Pi 4 could handle!<p>(Note: storage space has increased somewhat, because one of the fixes introduces new database indices.)</p><p>Other changes in this release:</p>  The old simple-bloom gossip algorithm, which is no longer used, was removed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1256">#1256</a>)  Breaking (bootstrap API): The conductor can now get a list of available proxies from the bootstrap server. This feature can be configured in the conductor config. If you’re one of the rare folks running your own bootstrap server, this breaks compatibility with the old bootstrap server and you’ll need to update to <a href="https://crates.io/crates/kitsune_p2p_bootstrap/0.0.4"><code>kitsune_p2p_bootstrap</code> version 0.0.4</a> in order to keep serving your users. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1242">#1242</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1236">#1236</a>)  The entire Holochain codebase has been updated to Rust 2021 edition. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1253">#1253</a>)  Breaking (network protocol): Gossiped DHT operations no longer include hashes, because the receiver needs to calculate them anyway during validation. This saves 39 bytes of wire data for each operation. This breaks compatibility with the network protocol of Holochain 0.0.127 and earlier. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1250">#1250</a>)  <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.128/CHANGELOG.md#20220303215755">Read the full changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.129: Codebase cleanups <p>Breaking changes warning: none</p><p>This release has no breaking changes for anything concerning developers or users. It does, however, contain a lot of work dedicated to cleaning up the codebase. To a non-developer, this might seem like pointless work. But even though you don’t ever see what the kitchen looks like in your favourite restaurant, you kinda do care about that, don’t you? You hope the floors are clean and there are no rats running around.</p><p>So it’s important for the restaurant crew to keep a clean, orderly kitchen. Mess happens all the time; it’s just part of running a busy kitchen. The same is true of a codebase; you need to do regular checkups to clean up and make sure everything’s in the right place and in working order. This makes it easier for all the core developers to work, and in this case also improves performance in a couple places.</p><p>Here’s a sampling of what they’ve been working on in the kitchen:</p>  Rename database code to remove assumptions based on our previous database engine, LMDB. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1270">#1270</a>)  Demonstrate a different approach to interfacing the conductor and the networking library. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1260">#1260</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1267">#1267</a>)  Remove unneeded test structures. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1271">#1271</a>)  Improve reliability of automated test and build (continuous integration) workflows, which are run by GitHub every time a release is cut or code is being considered for a future release. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1273">#1273</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1274">#1274</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1275">#1275</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1276">#1276</a>)  Add a config param to create key log files for debugging TLS sessions. While this changes the config file format, it’s an additive change, not a breaking one. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1261">#1261</a>)   Known issues   Unmet dependency shuts down app: Rather than failing validation on an unmet dependency and retrying after fetching it, the conductor treats this as an unrecoverable error and shuts down the application. This may also be true for other types of application errors. This is already being worked on (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1279">#1279</a>).  <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.129/CHANGELOG.md#20220309134939">Read the full changelog</a>.</p> Lots of documentation work <p>I may have mentioned this already, but even if I have it’s worth mentioning again. Our new colleague Jost is working to improve the consistency, thoroughness, accuracy, and accessibility of the documentation. Currently he’s working in four different areas:</p>  <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/latest/hdk/">HDK reference</a>  <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain/latest/holochain/conductor/api/index.html">Conductor API references</a> (admin and application APIs)  <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain/latest/holochain/conductor/api/config/conductor/struct.ConductorConfig.html">Conductor config reference</a>  <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/install/">Installation guide</a>  <p>In particular, the installation guide is getting some updates that match more closely how developers actually use Holochain; this should help new developers get up and running with a setup that’s been tested and refined by others. In the future the release team will integrate new tools that make updating Holochain and your hApps to a new version easier.</p> Holochain Launcher 0.3.10 <p>The <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases/tag/v0.3.10">newest version</a> of this end-user Holochain conductor and hApp installer has bumped the internal version of Holochain to 0.0.127. You can get it from the above GitHub link.</p> Updates to holochain-runner and electron-holochain-template <p>These two projects from Connor Turland at <a href="https://sprillow.com/">Sprillow</a> help you build a self-contained app with all Holochain components bundled into one binary. <a href="https://github.com/Sprillow/holochain-runner">holochain-runner</a> wraps the Holochain conductor and keystore into a self-contained binary that runs a single hApp, while <a href="https://github.com/Sprillow/electron-holochain-template">electron-holochain-template</a> helps you build an Electron-based hApp using holochain-runner.</p><p>holochain-runner has seen a new release, 0.0.35, which bumps the included conductor to 0.0.126 (compatible with HDK 0.0.122). You can get it on <a href="https://github.com/Sprillow/holochain-runner/releases/tag/v0.0.35">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://crates.io/crates/holochain-runner/0.0.35">crates.io</a>. electron-holochain-template’s <a href="https://github.com/Sprillow/electron-holochain-template"><code>main</code></a> branch has also been updated to match.</p> Exploring new validation approach <p>As I reported in <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/big-hdk-change/">the last Dev Pulse</a>, Holochain 0.0.127 introduced a large breaking change in the way validation works. In summary, each zome now handles validation in a single <code>validate()</code> callback that takes one <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.123/hdk/prelude/enum.Op.html">DHT operation</a>, matches on its type, and performs validation appropriate to the operation type and the data the operation contains.</p><p>The developer community has been exploring what this change means for their apps. On that theme, the most recent Holochain In Action session is all about validation…</p><p>And Eric Harris-Braun has <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/attestations/blob/20f0b7193acff186e730410a60c73f1a998e1f0e/dna/zomes/attestations/src/lib.rs#L33-L72">shared a code example</a> from a library he’s working on (more on that in the next section).</p><p>Next up, as part of the aforementioned documentation effort, the HDK doc for validation is getting some love, so you can understand exactly how it works and what you should validate for each operation type. <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.123/hdk/prelude/op/index.html">Here’s the most recent edition</a>; give it a read and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues/new">share</a> your feedback with us.</p> New library: attestations <p>This library by Eric Harris-Braun gives your hApp the power to create <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/attestations">attestations</a>. What is an attestation, you ask? It’s fairly simple: someone claiming something about a subject. Humans do this all the time, so it’s pretty easy to come up with examples: Alice claims that Bob is her son, the driver’s licensing office issues a card that says Carol is allowed to drive, Dave’s university professor Eve signs a certificate that shows he completed his master’s degree. You can see some exciting <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/attestations#use-cases">use cases</a> for this library involving DAO/Discord/NFT mashups, Holochain membrane proofs (the ‘passport’ into a hApp’s DHT), and reviews/ratings/badges/certificates.</p><p>With public-key cryptography, you can create a ‘portable’ or ‘self-verifying’ attestation — a data structure that carries a signature that proves that the proper person made the attestation. All you need is the public key of the person who did the signing (as well as a way of knowing that the public key actually belongs to the person you think it does — which is a whole other story).</p><p>This library’s readme points out that, in a sense, every source chain element is already a cryptographically verifiable attestation. When it gets published, it carries a public key and a signature that together let anyone else verify the identity of its creator.</p><p>The library is pretty simple — basically just enough structure to let anyone in a DHT make an attestation about someone else, plus functionality to search for attestations making a given claim or being made by or about a given agent. I understand there’s also plans to add support for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a>.</p> New library: threaded-comments <p>I discovered a small but useful library called <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/threaded-comments">threaded-comments</a>. It does exactly what it sounds like it does, adding support for comment threads to your hApp. It comes with a basic but working demo UI so you can play around with it. It doesn’t make assumptions about what sorts of things can have comments attached to them; it just takes an entry hash and a message as input (in fact, that’s what gives you threading for free — you can attach a comment to a comment). This means you can add comment support for anything your app deals in: pictures, blog posts, tweets, transactions, game moves, etc.</p><p>This library is coming out of the Wednesday hackalong workshops, in which members of the <a href="https://discord.gg/KCnMzzP4qZ">DEV.HC</a> Discord get together to teach/learn Holochain by working on actual projects. The next workshop (which happened the day this Dev Pulse was published) focused on a reactions library; I hope to share its Git repo in the next Dev Pulse.</p><p>It’s really exciting to see more and more developers getting interested in Holochain, gaining experience, and perhaps more importantly supporting each other through the journey. I think of Holochain as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tools_for_Conviviality">‘tool for conviviality’</a>, in the words of philosopher Ivan Illich — a tool that gives regular folks the power to take care of each other and build society without excessive intervention by institutions. And it’s so nice to see the developer community practicing the same conviviality they aim to foster with the tools they’re building.</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@mitchorr?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Mitchell Orr</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/whippet?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

 After a voting campaign and election on Snapshot, the DAO has elected its three community key signers. Find out more about who they are and what they will&nbsp;do! <p>Following a <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/shyftdao.eth/proposal/0xe4468c7d45d32ac28255bfc0addb9e91bdf80547ea64eb4784ddad6f85a983b0">voting period on Snapshot</a>, the Shyft DAO is proud to elect its three community key signers! The three elected community members will join four other key signers (two from Shyft Core; two from the Shyft Federation) to execute on transactions connected with the utilization of the Shyft DAO treasury. Key signers will all represent the Shyft DAO and aid in the perpetual advancement of Shyft Network and our mission to enable institutional blockchain adoption in compliance with local and global regulation without sacrificing users’ data privacy or sovereignty.</p><p>Now, without further ado, meet the three community key signers, who are represented by their Discord handles below. Upon election, each signer will have the choice to remain anonymous if they choose to do&nbsp;so.</p><p>You can also check out some of the newly elected key signers’ quotes from their candidacy about why they wanted to represent the Shyft community in the&nbsp;DAO.</p>  Hindsgaul (Hindsgaul#0431)  <blockquote>As a DeFi enthusiast and web3 supporter, I have had experience participating in other DAOs such as GRO protocol and Merit Circle. I have been in the crypto space for more than four years and one of my very first investments back in the day was actually in a DAO. Since then, the crypto space has matured a lot, and we see the need for regulation for crypto to truly go mainstream.</blockquote><blockquote>I believe in Shyft Network to solve both the Travel Rule problem and the institutional DeFi problem, and I want to help achieve that. This is the direction that is needed for the crypto space in general. I’d like to represent the Shyft DAO and the Shyft community in order to help grow both the community and the entire Shyft ecosystem.</blockquote><p>Disclaimer:<br>Hindsgaul Capital is a private investor and strong believer in Shyft&nbsp;Network</p><p>2. Conqueror (Conqueror#1312)</p><blockquote>“I’ve been interested in crypto for a long time and have participated in many votes across various DAOs. I have known DeFi for a long time and am an active participant—most of my time is spent researching and learning in this field. I have loved being in this community from the moment I discovered Shyft. I believe I fit this role and will best represent the Shyft community.”</blockquote><p>3. DT (DT#5207)</p><blockquote>“I am an experienced DeFi user familiar with major DeFi primitives and protocols and am an active DAO member of Inverse DAO and Gearbox DAO. I am a researcher of blockchain technology and its anti-corruption impact (transparency, cost-effectiveness, identity protection, cybersecurity, fraud prevention, traceability &amp; visibility, and real-time information sharing system usage) on different fields with the current focus on global health.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>Yesterday, Google has <a href="https://www.googlecloudpresscorner.com/2022-03-08-mgc">announced its intent</a> to acquire <a href="https://www.mandiant.com/">Mandiant</a>, a leading provider of cybersecurity defense and response services, for $5.4 billion – the company’s second-largest acquisition to date. When the deal is closed, Mandiant will join Google Cloud, further expanding its new parent company’s portfolio of security services, both in its own cloud and across multi-cloud and hybrid environments.</p>
<p>To be completely honest, my initial reaction was somewhat akin to “Oh, poor Mandiant, they just won’t leave it alone…” After all, the company had quite an interesting history. Established in 2004, Mandiant has quickly established itself as one of the leading vendors in threat intelligence, incident response, and security consulting. However, in 2013 it was acquired by FireEye in a deal of over $1 billion.</p>
<p>For 7 years, Mandiant operated as a unit within FireEye, growing and increasing its brand recognition even further with such high-profile investigations as the SolarWinds supply chain attack or the Colonial Pipeline ransomware incident. However, in June 2021, Mandiant has again emerged as an independent company after a split that has seen FireEye’s products sold to a private equity group. This freedom didn’t last long, as we can observe now since Alphabet is keen to close the acquisition as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Still, my first reaction was, of course, wrong. Mandiant is anything but “poor” and joining Google Cloud will only open massive new prospects for it, both in terms of reaching much larger customer bases and accessing Google’s own cloud infrastructure. So, while the company’s independent presence was short, its future as a part of the Google Cloud platform seems secure. More interesting, however, is understanding the future benefits of the deal for Google…</p>
<p>As we already mentioned while discussing the company’s <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/google-cloud-acquires-soar-vendor-siemplify">earlier acquisition of Siemplify</a>, Google is working hard to establish itself as a full-featured security service provider. While Google Cloud has long been recognized as one of the world’s largest cloud service providers, just having a lot of hardware is no longer enough for a reliable competitive advantage. In the times when large-scale security attacks have become a daily norm, data leaks and ransomware attacks can ruin even large businesses, and compliance regulations come with increasingly hefty fines, security has become a crucial differentiating factor for choosing the right provider for your next cloud project.</p>
<p>Fifteen years after the first public cloud has emerged, AWS remains the largest cloud service provider by size and revenue; trying to compete with it by building more data centers is still not a viable strategy. Sooner or later, other providers came to the realization that attracting customers with unique innovative capabilities and services is the right way. Oracle has <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc70309/enterprise-databases-in-the-cloud">the best databases</a>, Google has the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80477/api-management-and-security">best API management</a>, IBM has great managed services, etc. However, no single cloud is best at everything, and thus, “multi-cloud” is quickly becoming the new “hybrid” for modern large-scale cloud projects.</p>
<p>And in this new multi-cloud world, you must ensure that critical workloads and sensitive data remain constantly observable, properly governed, and securely protected against a multitude of cyber threats and other risks. Securing your own cloud is no longer enough – customers expect your security tools to provide holistic coverage across your competitors as well.</p>
<p>Microsoft was perhaps the earliest adopter of this strategy, and it has paid off quickly. In the recently published <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80473/intelligent-siem-platforms">Leadership Compass on Intelligent SIEM Platforms</a>, we have recognized the company’s security analytics platform Microsoft Sentinel as an undisputed market leader despite its relatively short history. Microsoft Defender for Cloud is also the first solution to provide security posture management across all three big clouds.</p>
<p>Now, it’s Google’s turn to boost its security services, and the company has decided to go big by adding a veteran leader in threat intelligence, attack surface management, and automated defense to its already substantial portfolio. This is a clear indication that Google is no longer focusing on “cloud-native” startups, but wants to see large, more traditional enterprises among its customers, and is ready to cater to their complex, hybrid, multi-cloud requirements.</p>
<p>All these developments indicate a welcome departure from the old-school mentality of “my cloud is better than yours” towards more open and mutually beneficial partnerships and multi-cloud collaboration projects. For the customers, consistent multi-cloud security is a must, and seeing the market becoming more competitive is a definite win. KuppingerCole will continue to observe these developments and cover all aspects of security from and for the cloud <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research">in our research</a>.</p>

				  NFTs are a powerful technology for digital ownership and value transfer, but verifiable credentials are better for digital identity  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By <a href="mailto:char@indicio.tech">Char Howland</a></p>
<p>Non-fungible tokens, more commonly referred to as NFTs, have leapt from niche tech communities into mainstream media as a way to commodify digital art. Celebrities have garnered publicity for NFTs by issuing them, such as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22308075/grimes-nft-6-million-sales-nifty-gateway-warnymph">Grimes</a>, or investing in them, such as <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nfts-legally-blonde-reese-witherspoon-163256908.html">Reese Witherspoon </a>and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22904893/nft-explainer-why-celebrities-buy-bored-ape-yacht-club-jimmy-fallon-paris-hilton">Jimmy Fallon</a>. A $11.7-million gold cube was placed in Central Park in February 2022 to garner <a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/solid-gold-cube-central-park-2067281">publicity</a> for German artist Niclas Castello crypto and NFT launch — and symbolize the transition from old-world material value to 21st century digital value. </p>
<p>Inevitably, NFTs and their connection to blockchains and cryptocurrencies are easier to hype or scorn than understand as a technology attempting to create proof of digital ownership or uniqueness in a medium of infinitely copyable ones and zeros. NFTs are technologically interesting as a way of proving ownership and facilitating value transfer; but they are problematic if applied to proving a person’s identity. </p>
<p>As a cryptographic token stored on a blockchain, an NFT is unique, irreplicable, and proves the ownership of an object by one entity. An NFT in the analog world is akin to a receipt, which proves a purchase, except that it is publicly displayed on its blockchain ledger. Having your receipt written to the blockchain means that it cannot be altered without breaking the integrity of the chain. As an immutable record, NFTs solve the problem of selling and owning digital art.</p>
<p>Depending on the ledger, NFTs can be transferable between different owners and can hold intrinsic value (i.e., value independent of market scarcity or desirability). This is because an NFT smart contract defines the relationship of ownership and value transfer on the ledger and not the other way around. &nbsp;</p>
<p>What NFTs are good for<br>NFTs provide digital data with verifiable rights of ownership and history. They do this by outlining a smart contract that governs how ownership is authenticated and transferred. NFTs excel at giving digital creators a new way to exchange labor for monetary gain. While NFT smart contracts exist as an extension of digital currency, they are being used to represent <a href="https://docs.nftstars.app/nft-stars/guides/what-are-nft-standards-and-how-to-choose-one#:~:text=financial%20asset%2C%20utility%20asset%20or%20currency">financial assets as well as utility assets</a>. </p>
<p>NFTs are good at providing digital data and digitally represented physical assets with the ability to prove a right of ownership and a history of that ownership. One limitation, however, is secure storage. Blockchain ledgers require a group of computers validating blocks to be added to the ledger. For each computer to maintain consensus in a timely manner with high availability&nbsp;&nbsp;, NFTs must be within a certain size. This size limit prevents large digital assets from being represented on a ledger. </p>
<p>As a result, NFT smart contracts are starting to use identifiers to external data storage to overcome the storage limitations of blockchain ledgers. External storage references are used to connect a digital asset to an NFT where the digital asset is stored with a different service. This use of external, off-ledger storage leads to the centralization of digital assets, with the attendant risks of centralizing any high-value data. Attempts to mitigate this centralization are being taken by using decentralized services that specialize in storage, such as the distributed <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPSF</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The ability to define exactly how value and ownership is transferred on a blockchain ledger, combined with the flexibility to represent large, custom digital assets gives the NFT creator unprecedented control of a digital asset even after its sale. Combined, these benefits provide a completely novel way for digital creators to monetize their art, creating new markets that only exist online. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As NFT smart contracts define digital ownership and value transfer, NFT creators have used the definitions of ownership and value transfer to conceal extra fees and expiration dates. Governments can use these features to collect tax, but scammers can also take the spread of value or manipulate ownership and value. As with any contract, know what you are signing.</p>
<p>What NFTs are not good for<br>As we live in increasingly digital worlds, verifying identity in digital spaces is as important as it is in many physical spaces. And since a person’s identity is unique and irreplicable, some are jumping to the conclusion that NFTs should be used to represent that person and prove their identity in a virtual space.</p>
<p>This is where the hype around NFTs is overstated. While the public nature of NFTs is useful for proving ownership, it is detrimental when applied to sensitive personal information. First, we don’t want any personally-identifying information, including variants such as hashes, written to a public or even a private blockchain. This is just basic digital safety. Even if data on a public ledger is encrypted, that encryption has an expiration date, and in some number of years that encryption will be solvable and the data will be accessible.</p>
<p>Second, NFTs are not designed for verifying personal identity information. If you wanted to verify a particular item of personal information, NFTs would, again, limit privacy because they are indivisible and immutable objects. They are not designed for selective disclosure or the right to be forgotten. This means that NFTs do not meet the needs for GDPR or other, similar, data privacy laws.</p>
<p>Third, some organizations have rules against using token-based technologies or cryptocurrencies. Since NFTs are built on top of cryptocurrencies, those organizations cannot issue or accept NFTs as credentials. Although the number of organizations with token-restricting rules will likely decrease, these restrictions decrease the overall interoperability of NFTs for identity proof.</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials are the digital identity solution<br>While NFTs are designed to prove the ownership of a digital asset, verifiable credentials (VCs) are designed to prove information about a person or entity. VCs use blockchain-based distributed ledger technology to make credentials private but verifiable: The credential itself is private until the subject consents to revealing it, or sharing data contained within it, but the cryptographic keys necessary to verify the validity of the credential and its ownership are publicly available on the ledger. </p>
<p>In other words, the contents of your passport are held by you in the verifiable credential on a mobile device or other wallet; they are not written to a blockchain as they would need to be if your passport was an NFT. This solves the privacy and safety problem.</p>
<p>In contrast to the roles of seller and buyer in an NFT transaction, VCs support the roles necessary for identity information exchange: an issuer who creates and signs the credential (e.g., the passport office), a holder who keeps and presents the credential (e.g., you), and a verifier who cryptographically verifies the validity of the credential upon presentation (e.g., airport security). </p>
<p>VCs are also designed to be divisible: each credential has a collection of attributes (i.e. first name, last name, birthdate, etc.) that can be revealed or withheld depending on the required information. They can allow zero knowledge proofs, a way of verifying a statement as true or false without revealing its value (for example: proving that someone is over 21 years old without revealing their exact age). VCs pose less of a risk to GDPR infractions than NFTs. Since VCs are not bound to cryptocurrencies, they can be used by all organizations, including those with rules against the use of cryptocurrencies and token-based technologies.</p>
<p>VCs are superior for digital identity verification than NFTs precisely because they solve the digital verification problem while preserving privacy and increasing security (the peer-to-peer&nbsp; communications protocol for verification can render each identity cryptographically unique).</p>
<p>The underlying problem of verifying digital information is only going to become more urgent as our concept of identity expands to include billions of connected devices and digital twins (the virtual representation of a physical object). NFTs demonstrate a need for proof, and meet the need for proving digital ownership; but verifiable credentials represent the better, privacy-preserving solution for personal identity.</p>

<p>The year 2022 hasn’t started well for Google, with the District of Columbia, Texas, Washington state, and Indiana&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/01/24/google-location-data-ags-lawsuit/">filing a lawsuit</a>&nbsp;against the tech giant over “deceptive location tracking”.</p>



 The lawsuit alleges Google deceived users by collecting their location data even though the users thought the function was disabled. These “misleading promises about its users’ ability to protect their privacy through Google account settings” date back to at least 2014, the Washington Post&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/techttps:/www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/01/24/google-location-data-ags-lawsuit/hnology/2022/01/24/google-location-data-ags-lawsuit/">reports</a>.&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Commenting on the lawsuit, DC Attorney General Karl Racine&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/24/google-lawsuit-location-dc-privacy/">said</a>, </p>



 “Google falsely led consumers to believe that changing their account and device settings would allow customers to protect their privacy and control what personal data the company could access. The truth is that contrary to Google’s representations it continues to systematically surveil customers and profit from customer data.” 



<p></p>



<p>That statement should drive fear through the world’s 4.66 billion internet users.</p>



<p>The lawsuit stems from investigations dating back to 2018 by Princeton University and the Associated Press into concerns that Google iOS and Android apps recorded time-stamped location data without permission.</p>



<p>As&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/24/google-lawsuit-location-dc-privacy/">Tech Crunch</a>&nbsp;reports, “The lawsuit argues that Google created a location tracking system that’s impossible for users to opt out of and that it misled users about how privacy settings could protect their data within apps and at the device level on Android. It also accuses Google of relying on deceptive dark pattern design to force users into making choices counter to their own interests.”</p>



<p>The lawsuit seeks to stop the location data practices and fine the tech giant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We like to bring you these stories because they highlight the extent of the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/how-bad-is-the-global-data-privacy-crisis/">data privacy crisis</a>&nbsp;and how, increasingly, privacy laws and consumer backlash are reining in big tech’s blatant disregard for user&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Until companies become honest stewards of consumer data, users must proactively protect themselves. At Anonyome Labs, we empower people to determine what information they share, and how, when and with whom they share it. Enterprises can use our&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;to rapidly develop and deploy branded privacy and cybersafety customer solutions, and consumers can use our&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;all-in-one privacy app. At the heart of both solutions is the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo digital identity</a>.&nbsp;</p>

 Seema Khinda Johnson, Nuggets: “there will only be more transactions, more fraud, and more friction” <p>It’s more important than ever to have an interoperable and reusable verified digital identity that preserves privacy and provides security.</p>Seema Khinda Johnson — Co-founder and COO,&nbsp;Nuggets<p>Online shopping has been sky-rocketing these past few years, with more people opting for this fast and effective way of obtaining goods. As a result, the need for secure transactions grew simultaneously with the need <a href="https://cybernews.com/what-is-vpn/">to protect our identity and personal information</a> when making purchases online.</p><p>To find out more about the concept of identity theft and its dangers, we’ve interviewed a trusted transactions company’s Nuggets COO and Co-Founder, Seema Khinda&nbsp;Johnson.</p><p>Tell us about your story. How did Nuggets evolve from an idea to what it is&nbsp;today?</p><p>In 2015, someone used my husband Alastair’s credit card and data fraudulently. That kicked off a hugely frustrating process and showed us that no one really owns or controls their data. This was against the backdrop of data breaches, constant advice to change passwords, and a lack of any comprehensive solution to protecting data. Every day, customers’ data was being compromised.</p><p>Alastair and I decided this was a challenge for us. We set out to solve it and set up Nuggets in late 2016. Our mission is to help businesses protect their customer data and to give people control back over their data. We believe personal information should be owned and controlled by the&nbsp;person.</p><p>Can you tell us a little bit about your self-sovereign identity platform? What are the main issues it helps&nbsp;solve?</p><p>Right now, the world has a trust&nbsp;problem.</p><p>Trust in the system that supports our digital lives has been massively eroded. Whenever customers sign up, transact or access services online, they become vulnerable to fraud, security, and privacy issues. And businesses are just as&nbsp;exposed.</p><p>This is a huge problem — and it’s only getting bigger. Trust, privacy, and security are now the number one priority for consumers and businesses alike.</p><p>Even so, and despite hundreds of millions spent on cybersecurity, fraud detection, and prevention, the statistics on data breaches and fraud get worse every&nbsp;year.</p><p>And it’s only going to get more complicated.</p><p>Right now, our privacy and security rely on what we can remember (passwords) and what we have in our hands (devices). Not on the thing we can prove: our identity.</p><p>The biggest issue is that no one knows who’s actually behind the password or device. It might be you — or someone completely unknown. So they can’t truly be trusted. This is a huge risk for businesses.</p><p>What you need is a verified identity that’s reusable, portable, and transparent. An identity that allows you to prove who you are, enable access, and serve as a non-custodial cache for your digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Looking ahead, there will only be more transactions, more fraud, and more friction. So we need a new privacy paradigm. One that’s built for today and tomorrow. One that can easily transition from the meatspace to the metaverse.</p><p>The good news is, we’ve already built it. It’s&nbsp;Nuggets.</p><p>Nuggets is an interoperable trust solution that&nbsp;offers:</p>  Self-sovereign verified digital identity that is reusable, interoperable with a reputation that travels with you, for Web 2.0, 3, and the Metaverse.  Trusted Payments — payments are tied to a verified identity.  Personal Cloud Vault — each identity includes a personal digital cloud vault with verified credentials.  Auditable Nuggets — thanks to our self-sovereign auditable nuggets, businesses no longer have to store PII data. You’re just granted access to data for regulatory and auditing purposes.  <p>Which methods do you use to ensure strong identity verification without compromising the user experience?</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/MJSxQUW2S4w">The process for creating</a> a verified SSI with Nuggets is simple. Once you’ve downloaded Nuggets, you do a one-time e-KYC process. You take a photo of a government-issued ID (like a passport or a driving license,) perform a moving likeness check, and you’re&nbsp;done.</p><p>Then all you have to do to use your Nuggets identity is choose the Nuggets option in a payment or verification process. It pings your mobile, and you verify your identity with biometrics. No more passwords!</p><p>In your opinion, what were the most serious cybersecurity challenges that emerged during the pandemic?</p><p>There are many new statistics around the pandemic’s impact on cybersecurity. That impact has been driven by various factors, new and&nbsp;old.</p><p>Having almost everyone working from home has exacerbated already serious vulnerabilities. These are the result of years of complacency around cybersecurity — like the ongoing use of usernames and passwords.</p><p>Working from home has also exposed more people to phishing scams. 47% of individuals fall for these scams while working at&nbsp;home.</p><p>There are some startling statistics from the pandemic&nbsp;period:</p>  Username and password breaches were up 450% in 2020, with 1.48 billion records breached.  Unauthorized access was the most common type of breach for the third consecutive year in 2021 — accounting for 43% of all breaches.  34% of breaches targeted healthcare in 2021 — the most targeted sector of all, which also recorded the highest average cost per compromised record:&nbsp;$474.  The tech sector paid the aggregate cost of recovery — a staggering $288 billion, with over 1.6 billion records&nbsp;stolen.  The average cost of a breach in the US was $8.64 million. This was the highest in the world — up 5% from $8.19 million the year&nbsp;before.  The number of time people spent online more than doubled, at more than seven hours per person per&nbsp;day.  <p>You can read more about all these statistics in <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/ch/en/pages/risk/articles/impact-covid-cybersecurity.html">this recent Deloitte&nbsp;report</a>.</p><p>As cybercrime rates are growing, which security measures should be implemented by every Internet&nbsp;user?</p><p>The onus shouldn’t be on the individual to protect themselves. We should build products and services that make it impossible for an individual to leave themselves vulnerable.</p><p>Until then, everyone&nbsp;should:</p>  Run antivirus protection  Keep up with cybersecurity awareness and briefing on best practices and procedures around private email addresses and/or cloud&nbsp;storage.  Be vigilant about phishing when receiving emails: check the authenticity of the sender’s&nbsp;address.  Ensure security of the home network: use a VPN at home and use other wifi-networks.  <p>What technologies will arise shortly as digital identity becomes an inseparable part of our&nbsp;lives?</p><p>Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) will definitely contribute to the technology behind digital identities. This enables self-certifying routes of trust, along with key pair rotation. It can also reduce the weight of traffic needed on blockchains. The key protection technique is even post-quantum proof.</p><p>You state that trust is key to growth in the digital age. Would you like to tell us more about your approach?</p><p>In the emerging world of global digital customers, it’s more important than ever to have an interoperable and reusable verified digital identity that preserves privacy and provides security.</p><p>Trusted transactions, where you know for sure who each party is, depend on verified digital identities at both ends. That’s what Nuggets delivers. And it doesn’t just offer proof of who you are and what you can access. It also serves as a non-custodial cache for all your virtual assets. So you can take them into any of the rapidly multiplying numbers of virtual&nbsp;realms.</p><p>Talking about the future, what achievements and challenges do you expect to see in the Web3 landscape in the upcoming&nbsp;years?</p><p>There’s a huge opportunity right now, and we don’t want to keep repeating the same mistakes in cybersecurity.</p><p>The big target should be for individuals to truly own and control their data and assets. For the first time, this is actually achievable. And it will change everything from here on&nbsp;in.</p><p>The challenges to that goal come from organizations that have long made enormous amounts of money from using and abusing our personal data. The danger is, we allow them to corral us into an environment that supposedly protects us from those abuses but actually just lines us up to serve their economic&nbsp;ends.</p><p>Share with us, what’s next for&nbsp;Nuggets?</p><p>It’s as important as it is simple: we want to enable as many businesses as possible to fix fraud whilst safeguarding customer data. That changes everything.</p><p>Read the original story&nbsp;<a href="https://cybernews.com/security/seema-khinda-johnson-nuggets-there-will-only-be-more-transactions-more-fraud-and-more-friction/">here</a>.</p><p>If you’re a business looking to implement reusable digital identity, and for better ways to protect customer data, you can now enable Nuggets worldwide.</p><p>Get in touch and find out how at <a href="mailto:partners@nuggets.life">partners@nuggets.life</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.nuggets.life/seema-khinda-johnson-nuggets-there-will-only-be-more-transactions-more-fraud-and-more-184b28f6517b">Seema Khinda Johnson, Nuggets: “there will only be more transactions, more fraud, and more…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.nuggets.life">Nuggets</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Anne Bailey</a></p> Comprehending the Current and Future Transformation of Business by Autonomous Machines 
<p>Self-driving cars! Not so fast, autonomous devices include much more than just vehicles.</p>
<p>Autonomous devices perform their function using data it collects from its surroundings and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/08/16/an-introduction-to-autonomous-devices/?sh=16c1d6fb6875">acts based on its analysis of that input</a>. This is often combing AI/ML and edge computing so that the device can operate without direct commands from an operator. It is not automatic, where it follows a rule-based logic that do not account for changes in the environment.</p>
<p>Autonomous devices are often closely associated with robotics, vehicles, and drones. Most tasks that autonomous devices are trained to do <a href="https://www.bridge-global.com/blog/autonomous-devices-are-here-are-you-ready/">require it to move around in the physical world</a> and respond to it.</p>
<p>How do autonomous devices dynamically interact with the world? By equipping the device with sensors and cameras to collect data, and by using <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/insights/artificial-intelligence">AI/ML models</a> to detect objects, recognize and classify what they are, make predictions about what those objects may do, and determine how best to react to them. For more information on the types of regression algorithms that are often used in autonomous vehicles and other devices, <a href="https://iiot-world.com/machine-learning/machine-learning-algorithms-in-autonomous-driving/">click here</a>.</p>
 Where future is already reality 
<p>Autonomous devices are being used today in several industries, and more are to come.</p>
<p>Autonomous devices are best understood by their function. They can range from devices that support <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/23/18194566/amazon-scout-autonomous-six-wheeled-delivery-robot">logistics</a> by monitoring, sorting, delivering, or driving/flying. Health devices that help bring <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/41960-wearable-exoskeletons-built-in-a-i-to-meld-human-machine">mobility to people with paralysis</a> include exoskeletons. <a href="https://fruitgrowersnews.com/news/tg-claims-worlds-first-commercial-robotic-apple-harvest/">Farming</a> uses autonomous robots already for crop and soil monitoring, and harvesting.</p>
<p>There are some driverless vehicles on the road, but these are <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/fisher/moving-towards-ai-and-iot-solutions-beyond-machine-learning">exceptions rather than the norm</a>. But it’s still possible to <a href="https://waymo.com/">take a ride</a> in one.</p>
<p>Its easy to write autonomous devices off as novelty experiments, but the impact on business will only continue to grow. There is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/08/03/three-ways-autonomous-technology-can-and-will-transform-your-business/?sh=58c3736d6896">high potential</a> for better efficiency and improved safety.</p>
 The double-edged sword of autonomous machines 
<p>But we should still be cautious with autonomous devices, and here’s why:</p>
<p>Connectivity issues: Autonomous devices must have the lowest latency possible for the split-second decisions that they must make. Any disruption in the connection could be disastrous.</p>
 
<blockquote>
<p>Connected and Automated Vehicles will require low latency, high volume communication potentially creating terabytes of data every day. <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lb80238/5g-impact-on-organizations-and-security">Leadership Brief: 5G Impact on Organizations and Security</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Data privacy: Devices, especially vehicles, rely on sensors and cameras to process its surroundings. What are the implications for individuals passing by if images of their faces are streamed to the cloud, or the current location information of individuals not in the car? Or the license plates and driving habits of other drivers on the road? Will this data be sold to insurance providers, law enforcement, or retail giants is consent is collected from the driver? And does the driver have the right to disclose data about other people and their property? These questions must be clearly answered, and airing on the side of caution and privacy by design.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/05/13/the-collective-power-of-swarm-intelligence-in-ai-and-robotics/?sh=40bceb5c252f">Swarm intelligence:</a> It sounds ominous, and it could be. Different types of autonomous devices that do different types of tasks could share information or trigger a follow-up action. Or the same types of devices could collaborate to all do their tasks more effectively, such as a fleet of autonomous vehicles braking in synchronization to prevent a traffic slowdown.</p>
 Protection and preparing for dangers 
<p>Research in other areas will have to advance and be implemented before autonomous devices become widely used.</p>
<p>Advances in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/the-story-of-edge-ai">edge computing</a> will reduce dependency on cloud processing by moving computing and storage resources closer to a device’s geographical location. 5G could also help establish the communication infrastructure that connected devices will need, which many autonomous devices will be. 5G is already being rolled out in different parts of the world, but it has not reached the ubiquity that is needed for massive machine-to-machine communication that could help autonomous devices flourish.</p>
 
<blockquote>
<p>5G is intended to handle up to 1000 times greater data volumes and up to 100 times more connected devices than with 4G today. It can also reduce communications latency and enable up to ten-year battery life for lower power devices. – <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lb80238/5g-impact-on-organizations-and-security">Leadership Brief: 5G Impact on Organizations and Security</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>IoT security must become stronger if autonomous devices are to be used more widely. Secure identities for devices must be managed, and <a href="https://www.iotsecurityfoundation.org/iot-security-foundation-launches-co-ordinated-vulnerability-disclosure-platform-for-iot-industry/">vulnerabilities must be managed</a>. More research must be focused here, and it must be implemented in any organization that wants to use autonomous devices.</p>
<p>Explainability in AI/ML must become more advanced, because this is our link to accountability. Autonomous devices must be able to account for why they took a certain action in a human-understandable way.</p>
 Final thoughts 
<p>Autonomous devices hold great promise for a digitally transformed organization and world. However, using autonomous devices as a means to become “digitally transformed” is shortsighted.</p>
<p>Technology should never be implemented for its own sake, but because it is clearly the best way to address the gaps and business needs of your organization. Rather, begin by assessing how your business will best survive and compete in a changing world – the IT side as well as the business model side. By creating a structured plan towards digital transformation and taking necessary initial steps like establishing <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/guest/creating-an-innovative-identity-fabric-structure">an identity fabric</a>, your organization can support the integration of autonomous vehicles into daily processes.</p>

 Customers will benefit from centralized offering and new customer portal 



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Munich, March 9th, 2022,&nbsp;IDnow, a European provider for identity proofing, will consolidate the comprehensive set of identification verification methods and document signing services into a single platform, to offer customers and their end users a secure, frictionless digital onboarding experience with even more transparency and greater flexibility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Customers will benefit from the one-stop solution: companies can now seamlessly adapt, orchestrate, and scale all the identity proofing needs&nbsp;that enterprises&nbsp;and SMBs have through a single provider. This results in optimized conversion rates and faster, more intuitive onboarding for end users.</p>



<p>An essential part of the IDnow Platform for Identity Proofing is the new customer portal, My IDnow.</p>



<p>“IDnow understands the appetites of end users and the range of services that business customers need to satisfy them. Customers will benefit from our customer portal My IDnow, which is the information interface for the IDnow Platform for Identity Proofing, says Vikas Seth, CPO at IDnow. “Customers can actively manage and shape their end users’ identification experiences and diligently monitor verification outcomes using My IDnow. Leveraging&nbsp;the power of IDnow’s identity orchestration, customers can select and combine the identity verification products their end users prefer, offering multiple choices for identity verification,” he adds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the IDnow Platform for Identity Proofing and My IDnow, the company offers deep identity verification insights and analytics, which add even more transparency for companies. Fast integration of the latest security and regulatory standards ensures that identity proofing processes create trust and confidence between all parties.</p>



<p>“Our aim at IDnow is to enable digital identity business models to create high assurance, with maximum trust and security for businesses and their end users. We provide businesses with a unified set of methods to meet every identity verification and document signing need a company has – along with identity management services to effectively orchestrate, customize, and configure the proofing process,” says Vikas Seth CPO of IDnow. “We believe in a strategy that moves far beyond offering a single identity verification method. With our platform, we offer a future-proof solution that complies with different regulatory environments, covers a variety of use cases and anticipates customer needs – it’s as flexible and fast as our digital business environment has become,” he adds.&nbsp;</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and today, in this episode, we’re going to talk about identity and also identity and access management, what is happening in the UK government and also in the public sector of this part of the world. So, for that, we have a very special guest.</p>
<p>Richard Slater started writing code on a second hand ZX Spectrum before he was 10. Today, Richard works as Head of Managed Services at Amido, a London-based start-up working on identity and microservices projects for some of the largest companies in the UK. He lives and breathes DevOps, which means he is a vocal proponent of best practices for software development teams focusing on continuous-deployment, systems thinking, reducing feedback cycles, configuration-management, infrastructure-as-a-code and of course, cyber security.</p>
<p>Hello, Richard.</p>
<p>Richard Slater: Hello, Oscar. Thank you for inviting me on.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s a pleasure having you Richard and well, let’s start talking about, let’s talk about digital identity. So first of all, I would like to hear a bit more about yourself, if you can tell us about yourself, and especially your journey to this world of identity.</p>
<p>Richard: Sure, yeah. So, over the course of the last, I don’t know, 20 odd years in the IT industry, I’ve kind of written my fair share of login pages. At one point in time, I was a dotnet developer, before that, I was a systems administrator. So that kind of gave me interaction with enterprise IdAM solutions, like Active Directory. But then also, as a developer, you know, consumer IdAM, from the point of view of login pages are required for the vast majority of applications that I’ve ever written in my time.</p>
<p>And then about 10 years ago, I joined Amido, and had the opportunity to deliver over that time, about half a dozen identity platforms for kind of big and small companies, both public and private sector. And then I started to move my career over time much more towards the cybersecurity side, and really enjoy the kind of IdAM side of it. And that kind of led me into cybersecurity.</p>
<p>However, I then really realised that cybersecurity was the thing that kind of got left behind in DevOps. And actually, that’s the area where the innovation needs to happen to really kind of change the world, change the way that we approach IT, including IdAM, including cybersecurity in general, and kind of shift left on that thinking. And IdAM is a huge part of that.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. Yes, as I read from your bio I found on Stack Overflow, yeah, you said, you live and breathe DevOps. And of course, yes, security, cybersecurity is something that is super important there. So, thank you for sharing your interesting story.</p>
<p>We’d like to hear you and Amido who are working very tightly in the UK, of course, I’d like to hear what’s the latest development in the UK government’s identity strategy?</p>
<p>Richard: Yeah, absolutely. So, I think we’re probably at a point now where most people have realised that GOV.UK Verify is starting to kind of wane a bit, it’s starting to sunset, so that it’s starting to become old news. And in its place, there is various kind of proposals floating around.</p>
<p>However, predominantly, what we’ve seen is our DCMS, Department of Digital Culture, Media and Sport, really been pushing this idea of a trust framework. And they’ve had a couple of public consultations on it so far. It’s just a really interesting approach. It’s a really kind of innovative way of looking at identity from a government perspective, in a way that enables privacy, but also creates that rich ecosystem of identity solutions.</p>
<p>And it’s been adopted elsewhere. And it’s still in its infancy. I know, Canada is a little bit ahead. The UK, and there’s a couple of other Commonwealth countries like Australia and New Zealand, who have been trying to approach government identity in a way that is less tied to being a single identity for a department and then having a different identity entirely for a different department actually creating an ecosystem.</p>
<p>And the real key to these trust frameworks being decentralised is that it comes into kind of flavours as it were. You have the identity providers, so the people that say, “You are who you say you are.” And those identity providers could fundamentally be anyone. So, it could be the NHS that say you are this person, you have this this NHS number which represents who you are. We’ve done the identity verification for you and thus, you can use an NHS identity to be able to access other non-NHS services.</p>
<p>Equally, it could be the home office that say that you’re a naturalised resident, or that you’re a British citizen. It could be even as far as you know, if you’ve got somebody coming in from- temporarily into the UK. It may be that it’s the foreign office that’s able to provide them an identity that demonstrates the fact that they are that person.</p>
<p>But the other side of the equation really comes down to what are called attributes. And those attributes allow individual government departments, and potentially private sector as well, to be able to kind of enrich that identity, and do it in such a way that it can mask the kind of personal data that can sometimes be encoded in identity.</p>
<p>So, a really good example of that one, if, for example, you were to go into a bar or a pub. At the moment, you have to show somebody some form of photo ID, so it might be a passport, it might be a driving license. And obviously on that it’s got your passport number, your driving license number, your date of birth, potentially your address on it as well. So, you’re sharing a lot more data than you really need to share. All they need to know is your date of birth. And even then, they don’t really need to know your date of birth, what they need to know is, are you legally entitled to buy alcohol in the UK? And for us, that means it’s 18.</p>
<p>And really, you know, what you’re able to do with attributes is create a digital identity that is able to be enriched, so you can present that digital identity. It might be through an app, it might even be through an actual physical ID card with a chip on it, that will then allow the establishment to go, “Is this person allowed to buy alcohol? Are they over 18?” And ask those questions.</p>
<p>Now, the really interesting thing is, is what the government’s doing here is they’re not trying to tell industry how to implement this. They’re trying to create a framework for trust, which is why they call it a trust framework. What they want is they want to go, “Here is the standard. Here is the approach. This is how we secure it. This is broadly, semantically how it’s going to work.”</p>
<p>Now, industry bring products to market that enable us to turn this from something that is essentially a white paper, into a product that enables government identity in a distributed manner. I think it’s a really exciting time because it helps to balance the privacy aspects of identity with the need to actually not have multiple identities.</p>
<p>I mean, I have probably 30 different government-based identity accounts just because I’m a British citizen. I’ve got accounts with the NHS, I’ve got accounts with the passport office, I’ve got accounts with the drive– DVLA. They’re all completely separate from each other. But what this trust framework promises and really, I hope it’s something that can be brought to bear is actually building out that system that means I only really need to have one true identity and all the other attributes are able to be added by the relevant parties.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely, a trust framework would solve this problem, as you said, dozens of identities you have from some public service institutions in the UK. So, you said that there’s one organisation that is already leading in creation on that trust framework in the UK.</p>
<p>Richard: Yeah. So DCMS is being kind of charged with actually bringing this to bear, they have overall responsibility for both digital policy and cybersecurity policy. In the UK, they’re the organisation that sets policy for the Information Commissioner’s Office. So that’s kind of backing off into GDPR, and other privacy laws.</p>
<p>So really, these are the people, this is the government department that is fundamentally there to drive forward the digital agenda in the UK. And their role is really to help define what that’s going to look like. And then allow other government departments to start working with industry partners to be able to deliver an identity platform that meets this specification.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. So, we expect to see in the near future results, a more unified identity verification service in the UK. But something that every single public sector organisation, they also have to deal with IAM in their way based on their own needs. So, if you can tell us about – in general public sector organisation, how they should be approaching IAM from this year 2022.</p>
<p>Richard: Yeah, definitely. So, you’re right, it’s great to talk about what’s in the future, but we are a good few years off having anything even in kind of an alpha or a beta stage that was going to be using the trust framework. IAM is not going to go away. It is something that is fundamentally necessary to be able to deliver a product and deliver it securely. So, you’re right, companies need to be looking at this- companies and departments need to be looking at this in 2022.</p>
<p>Amido are a cloud-native consultancy, you know, I kind of want to call that out o maybe I’m a little bit biased here. But the answer for me is really is it’s got to be on cloud. We’ve actually had a number of clients recently, I can’t mention them, unfortunately, who have come to us and asked us, after we built their cloud platform, you know, in an on-prem world, to help them move it into the cloud.</p>
<p>Cloud-first has been on the Cabinet Office agenda for the last five years, it’s something GDS has been pushing really heavily in the UK. And actually, you get so many benefits from cloud. It’s proven now, there is so many IdAM solutions that have been delivered using IaaS, using past components, that actually we’re starting to see government departments adopting cloud more and more as their predominant mechanism for delivering a service. And so, it’s not going to go away anytime soon.</p>
<p>And you know, as I say, those benefits if you’ve got VMs, on Azure, or AWS, where you’ve got commercial off-the-shelf software, or using SaaS components, it’s a whole lot less work for departments. And in these times of post Coronavirus and recovery – departments, budgets are going to be squeezed and you’re going to have less money to be able to spend on IAM. And that’s really where, you know, adopting the cloud, adopting those best of breed services, you can outsource a lot of their ongoing operational costs to the cloud providers, and focus on delivering that IdAM solution that is specific to your needs.</p>
<p>And, government, public sector, like no other sector has got some very specific needs for IAM. We’ve got one of our clients have to contend with building into the IAM solution a mechanism for identifying conflict and resolution. And like ensuring that segregation of duties is both implemented at the technical level, but also ensuring that there are no conflict of interest between two element, two IAM users in this particular solution.</p>
<p>So, it can be horrifically complicated. But it’s something that actually products are out there on the market, able to support those kinds of rules, those kinds of mechanisms, to protect the privacy of individuals, to ensure that regulatory requirements are being met. Departments need to be focusing on the solutions that are actually going to serve citizens. And by using cloud, you’re just removing all of that kind of underlying, like, let’s look after the VMs, let’s look after the hardware in the data centres, just focus on the actual applications themselves.</p>
<p>And all of the vendors I talked to, we work with vendors across the industry to deliver IdAM for our government clients and private sector clients, everyone has now got some kind of cloud offering. There is absolutely no reason in 2022 to be looking at on-prem environments for hosting IAM. You lose all of the flexibility. You lose all the maintainability aspects of it. Use the vendor’s cloud native offerings to be able to deliver IAM and focus on your kind of unique selling point, the thing that actually delivers value to citizens.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. Yeah, it’s interesting to see that now in the beginning of 2022, these public administration organisations are already asking for that, explicitly asking for cloud.</p>
<p>Richard: Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>Oscar: So, given that IAM is core to an organisation’s cybersecurity strategy, how can the public sector ensure that the IAM implementations are successful?</p>
<p>Richard: Yeah, so this is interesting. So, as an organisation, we counted it up a couple of days ago, and we have delivered 37 IAM platforms over the last five years. And I think really, there are two things that we’ve seen most common, that are mistakes that have been made during an IAM implementation. And the first one is a bit of a weird one, a bit of a curveball. A couple of organisations we work with have left IAM to last. They’ve almost forgotten about IAM, or considered it as not part of a greater whole, you know, IAM you know, it’s a login page.</p>
<p>IAM is so much more than a login page. It may be that’s the first thing that people see. But IAM is actually a much wider solution that enables you to implement your cybersecurity controls, that enables you to grant access, grant privilege, et cetera in the relevant parts of your service. And I think this is a bit of a symptom really of a disconnect between security, compliance and technology.</p>
<p>Security is often not involved early enough. And I don’t necessarily mean a security department, I mean, the concept of security. And in reality, all of those elements are important – security, compliance and technology. Each of the standards, you know, I talked about ISO 27001, or cyber essentials, each of those talks about vital requirements for authentication and authorisation. And security is increasingly leading to adopt that shift left mentality that’s required to be able to ensure that InfoSec is really involved from the beginning.</p>
<p>I have this bit of a saying that what I want for my information security teams, what I want when I’m having a cybersecurity is how do we get to saying, yes, because all too often particularly when security is involved later in the project, the answer ends up being no. Like, no, you can’t go live until you’ve done this, this and this.</p>
<p>What I want to be in a position is at the beginning of a project, having security involved and going, what do you need? What do you need from this solution? What are your fundamental non-functional requirements that mean that you’re going to be able to say yes? What tasks do we need to do? What kind of level of pen testing do we need against this solution? So that when the business wants this to be live, the answer is going to be, “Yes, of course, we’ve been involved all the way through. We’re absolutely happy with this. And we have utter utmost confidence in it.”</p>
<p>And I think what often happens is that organisations, both public and private sector, get caught out that thinking IAM is something somebody else does. It never something somebody else does. Even if there is a pre-existing IAM solution in place, for a government department or for the private sector, then half of the effort is going to be involved in actually integrating that into the application or service that you’re building.</p>
<p>IAM is not something that is purely a case of redirect out somewhere and get back a failed or success message. It involves JWT tokens, it involved claims, it involves actually understanding how the IAM solution works across firewall boundaries, how the IAM solution works in terms of gaining access to privileged information.</p>
<p>In terms of administrator access, how is that working? What happens when somebody is trying to log into your application and the error message isn’t instructive enough to say, this is a problem with the login versus a problem with the application? There’s a lot to think about with IAM, so don’t get caught out. Do not think that IAM is something that somebody else better do for you. Embrace it, and like build it into your thought process from day one, before you even start designing anything, thinking about IAM and actually building that into the kind of wider picture is absolutely key to ensuring that implementation is successful.</p>
<p>And then that is related in many ways. The second mistake I really see is, is IAM not really being embedded in the organisation. We see a lot of organisations that try to implement IAM as a team. So, we have an IAM team, they are responsible for IAM for the organisation. Fundamentally, every application developer, every product owner, every business analyst in an organisation needs to understand the basics of identity, the basics of the OpenID connect protocol, the OAuth 2.0 protocol, because those influence how applications are designed and built.</p>
<p>I would actually say it’s 30% of the time for an IAM team should be dedicated to education and knowledge transfer to people who are outside of the IAM team, and the rest of the organisation. Because actually, those are the people that need to integrate. Those are the people that actually are going to be the relying parties. And those are the actual applications that IAM is there to kind of serve and protect.</p>
<p>And there’s a couple of ways of handling this. I really like the Train the Trainer programmes. When I’m working with client teams, I’m trying to make sure there’s a person in each of those service delivery teams who is the IAM champion. They are the person that has kind of put the time in, they’re talking with the actual IAM delivery team. They’re understanding how it works, what they need to do. And they’re championing that within the project.</p>
<p>Every time the sprint goes round, they’re putting their hand up and going OK, well how is this integrating with IAM? How are we handling the fact that something in the IAM platform is changing? How are we handling the changes in the wider ecosystem? And we’ve got additional claims available to us now. How are we managing that? And actually, having that Train the Trainer programme or that kind of subject matter expert embedded in the team is really important.</p>
<p>But then also, you know, it’s increasingly important to have really good training materials. As I record a lot of videos, half of the reason I’ve got a decent microphone and camera is I record videos, I’ll stand there in front of the camera and I will talk about IAM for our clients so that they have material that they can put into their Confluence or their SharePoint or their LMS to be able to educate people on how to interact with IAM as an application developer.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, that is very powerful, what you have just said about training, the Train the Trainer, or just the fact of making sure there is a champion in the organisation and the customer will keep… yeah, training and educating about IAM across several functions. So that’s definitely, definitely a great idea. And I see – it came out you are doing this constantly for a while already. And your first point was that organisations leave IAM to the last. So yeah, it’s…</p>
<p>Richard: Yeah, never leave IAM to last. We have had a couple of opportunities where we have gone into a client to talk about IAM, only to discover that actually it was forgotten about. It was not included in the project plan. And actually, the work has already started on application services. And really just getting to a point where realising that there needs to be a lot of thought to go into IAM right at the beginning, do not leave it to last. It is so important to actually think about IAM from day zero, and build it out as part of your wider technical strategy.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely. And also, as you said, identity management systems are touching very different also roles in the organisations. What about one that the users will feel directly is the user interface, user experience. So, what about the user experience in government identity systems, how is the sector’s approach to UX? How is it changing? What is the direction it’s heading now?</p>
<p>Richard: Yeah, so this is a really interesting one. There’s a GIF floating around that we have in our company Slack, which is essentially is a cat going through a gap in a door. And successively over time that this gap gets smaller and smaller. And the labelling around it is around security controls. And the very last section of the GIF, it says ISO 27001, where the gap is maybe about three centimetres wide, and the cat just jumps over the door, just goes straight over it. And that’s a fundamental problem.</p>
<p>If you make things so hard to use, people will find their way around it. People are intelligent, people are innovative, if you make it difficult, it’s going to be the last thing somebody is going to want to do. And that really, I think is something that has been influencing IAM over the course of the last five years.</p>
<p>And what we’re seeing is it moving from being a fairly cumbersome kind of login system, as it might have been termed, into a heavily researched, well understood ecosystem of user design principles that enables IAM to really kind of get out the way. I mean, for the most part, IAM is going to be something to an end user that should be transparent. In an ideal world, then you would be able to use authentication mechanisms that don’t require people to remember usernames and passwords.</p>
<p>We’re not quite there yet. I think we will get to a point where actually, that kind of transparent sign in model is going to be secure and it’s going to be friendly to end users. But in the meantime, what most departments are focusing on is the research. Use UX professionals to research into how people use the IAM solution, how people interact with it. Not just from the point of login and registration, but also from the point of how do I make this more secure? How can I implement multifactor authentication or passwordless login? Or, how do I reset a password in a secure and efficient way? Sending PIN codes out in the post, whilst incredibly secure and gives a high level of assurance that that address still matches that person and so there’s a good degree of confidence, it’s a very slow process and it’s not helpful if you’re trying to get something done quickly.</p>
<p>So, actually building those flows based upon research, based upon evidence that this is the majority of the system the population are able to use it. This is particularly important for government departments, because unlike private sector, rather, where you can say I have a demographic, you know, one of our clients is ASOS and so they have a very clear demographic graphic, it tends to be young. So, you can make the assumption there that all of them will have a smartphone, and probably a fairly good smartphone. All of them will be very kind of used to using touchscreens and used to using the internet.</p>
<p>When you’re dealing with a government department, you can’t make any of those assumptions, because the vast majority of departments have to deal with a citizen from either birth or, you know, entering into adulthood all the way through to later life. So, you can’t make the assumption that, you know, I can just test it with a small group of people who are in my demographic. You have to understand it from all aspects.</p>
<p>And equally, the vast majority of the particular governments in the UK need to deal with multiple cultures. London is such a cosmopolitan place. But most of the UK is, if you look at Manchester, you look at Birmingham, there are people with English not as their first language, you have got people coming in from very different cultures, either from abroad or just from community cultures within the UK. So, you can’t make the assumption that, you know, a small group of people is actually going to be representative of your actual end users.</p>
<p>So really kind of doing the research and thoroughly kind of getting into a representative example of all of the people that are going to be using your service, the alphas in front of them, the code base in front of them, or even you know, we’re a huge fan of coffee shop testing. So literally just drawn mock-ups really of a service, and actually go to people and go into a coffee shop and go, “Can I buy you a coffee and show you how I think this is going to work? I’d really like to get your feedback on how easy this might be to use, what you’d like to see done instead, you know, what do you not like about this? What do you like about this?</p>
<p>It’s really important to really get into the heads of citizens to understand like what they actually need from an IAM solution and the wider solution, but particularly from there, how do we get IAM out of the way. And it’s something that that I say with my InfoSec teams, is fundamentally we need to be making the right thing to do, the easiest thing to do. So, it’s the absolute antithesis of that cat jumping over the door. It’s trying to make it so actually going through the door, following the rules, following the controls, implementing the controls is by far and above easiest thing to do, rather than having to try and kind of circumvent it.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, very, very good. You say in a visual way, visual language way with the cat and the door. But yeah, excellent. The key is, as you said, is to do serious research to have success in UX, in user experience. Yeah, so it’s very, very enlightening. Everything you have been sharing about IAM, I can see you also breathe, not only DevOps, you breathe IAM. I can feel it.</p>
<p>A final question for you will be, for all business leaders who are listening to us right now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Richard: Yeah, this for me has got to come down to shift left thinking. So, I’ve talked a little bit about shift left in cybersecurity, but it applies to absolutely everything, so user experience research, cybersecurity compliance. If these are not things that are being thought about at a project level or at a product level from day zero, then they can be shifted left.</p>
<p>The sooner we kind of embrace the fact that we’re part of an ecosystem whereby lots of people are going to get involved in a project and involve those people from day zero onwards, the more effective those products are going to be and the lower risk there is going to be in delivering those proposed projects and products. So really, for me, it’s that if cybersecurity or user experience or compliance is not involved in day one, what one thing can you do this year to move that to the left, to get it in as close to zero as possible?</p>
<p>Oscar: Thanks a lot Richard for sharing all these super interesting things about not only UK but actually also in not only UK, not only public sector, but many of the things you have also shared with us are valuable for any project that requires identity and access management.</p>
<p>Richard: My pleasure.</p>
<p>Oscar: Please tell us how people can learn more about you, get in touch with you, what are the best ways?</p>
<p>Richard: Yes, so I am on the vast majority of social networks, so you feel free to reach out to me I am <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/devopsrichard/">DevOps Richard on LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/richardslater">Richard Slater on Twitter</a>. So please do feel free to reach out. I live and breathe this stuff. I’m always happy to have a chat about it and I enjoy spending my evenings talking to you guys out there.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic. Again, thanks a lot Richard, and all the best.</p>

 Covid-19 has highlighted the systemic vulnerabilities in the Swedish and planetary food systems, while creating the political economy for deep transformation. This paper seeks to outline the increasingly critical relationship between food and the healthy development of our minds and bodies, and therefore the future prosperity of our economies and societies. <p>Covid-19 is increasingly forcing us to recognise that food plays a central role in the human health defense systems <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213453020301890">[1]</a>. Yet our health treatment systems are trailing behind, with nutrition left out of governments’ key recommendations announced during the Covid-19 pandemic [image&nbsp;1].</p>Image 1: general recommendations by the public health authority during&nbsp;Covid-19<p>For society as a whole to become resilient and healthy, it appears crucial to recognise the effects of food’s regenerative potential and its capacity for systemic prevention of illness and the avoidance of societal harm. However, to enable this, government officials, food systems actors, health care workers, marketing offices, researchers and civil society need to actively start redesigning the systems and institutional infrastructures around our food systems and address deep societal lock-ins.</p><p>We recognise these are easy sentences to write and that a true transformation will require fundamental new models of change and innovations at the systemic level.

Therefore, enabling the availability of healthy foods and the conscious consumption of it, across the whole spectrum of society, is a burden that can not be put on the individual alone.</p> Identifying the root causes to why change is not happening <p>With the availability of evidence and the crystallisation of damage, the open question is why we are not addressing these challenges. There is no single answer or magic bullet, rather there are multiple factors as to why this is not not yet happening at the scale and speed necessary. It is crucial to take a systems perspective in analysis of this challenge and consider the root causes of the symptoms made visible in society by the Covid-19 pandemic. These root causes impact both physical infrastructures and the metabolic flows of food systems e.g. the logistics of water, energy, nutrients, fertilizers, seeds, waste,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Interventions to address these root causes would need to sit across multiple layers such&nbsp;as:</p>  Culture and language, ex. new nordic&nbsp;cuisine  Capacities, capabilities and competencies, ex. labs and mentor&nbsp;programs  Monitoring and evaluation, ex. beyond GDP initiatives and sustainability reporting  Standards and guidelines, ex. organic farming standards and national&nbsp;goals  Policy making, ex. preventative care strategies  Financing, ex. public procurement models for school and hospital&nbsp;meals  Law, ex. regulatory sandboxes and parametric law  <p>Based on interviews conducted in the Rapid Transition Lab (including a doctor focused on functional medicine, a nurse at a cancer treatment clinic, a nutritionist and two health coaches) and additional desk-top research, there appears to be three critical challenges to consider:</p>  Pricing and accounting of food is struggling to consider its regenerative potential nor the negative externalities created through its production and consumption,  Food lobbying (e.g. around what can be called milk <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/8384/sweden-milk-war-oatly">[30]</a>), misleading marketing campaigns and labelling of food <a href="https://annfernholm.se/2022/01/07/hemmakvall-inleder-aret-med-vilseledande-reklam/">[31]</a> is making it hard for consumers to navigate the impact of the items displayed on the supermarket shelves and online stores’ interfaces,  Disconnect between the food and pharmaceutical industries. Food companies are trying to make money through the system challenged by what is described above and pharmaceutical companies by selling patented drugs. This is minimizing the funds available for research into diet’s role in medical treatment, prevention and regeneration.  <p>When looking closer at the food system’s incentive structures it becomes clear that ingredients triggering the brain to want more <a href="https://www.bokus.com/bok/9789113116389/halsosegrar-den-vetenskapliga-vagen-till-ett-friskare-liv/">[32]</a>, for example sugar, salt, saturated fats, or all three combined <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0117959">[33]</a>, becomes a desirable for anyone trying to make a quick profit from food. Unfortunately, these items tend to give no or minimal support to the five health defense systems, and over time, large consumption of such products can even harm them [<a href="https://2heal.se/om-oss/">34</a> interview with Anette Lindquist]. Today this reality is not being reflected in the cost of the production nor the price for the consumers. It seems to be that the pricing and the accounting systems are not designed for people’s, nor the planet’s, regenerative health.</p><p>If consumes like to make better choices by themselves, the words, colours, and symbols on the wrapping of ingredients are often misleading <a href="https://foodpharmacyco.com/category/ann-fernholm-en/">[35]</a>; creating cascading effects at societal scale. What is more, people are bombarded with commercials about cheap prices on traditional and social media channels, putting the focus on price over quality [<a href="https://www.johannescullberg.com/">36</a> interview with <a href="https://www.johannescullberg.com/">Johannes Cullberg</a>]. It appears, therefore, that the negative freedom enjoyed by food companies to use certain language and imagery when marketing food is actually diminishing people’s positive freedom to enjoy healthy lives and consequently creating increased liabilities for future generations <a href="https://obgyn.duke.edu/about/our-faculty/susan-kay-murphy-phd">[37]</a>.</p><p>The last structural challenge (mentioned in this blog) is the lack of high-quality and large-scale research into the relationship between diet, healing, prevention, and regeneration. Today, large clinical studies, necessary to change treatment recommendations <a href="https://www.kostfonden.se/varfor/#starkt_forksning">[38]</a>, are almost always sponsored or entirely paid for by pharmaceutical companies <a href="https://www.tidningencurie.se/nyheter/2016/03/02/trovardigheten-hotas-av-bestallda-studier/#:~:text=L%C3%A4kemedelsbranschen%20i%20Sverige%20satsar%20%C3%A5rligen,samarbete%20med%20akademi%20och%20sjukv%C3%A5rd.">[39]</a>. They have little reason to prove that for example, cranberries can be used in cancer treatment <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5039576/">[40]</a>, as they can not write a patent for cranberries. Therefore, there are very few large and high-quality clinical studies made to show foods’ regenerative role in society <a href="https://www.kostfonden.se/varfor/#starkt_forksning">[41]</a>. In Sweden, this means that governments and doctors have too little evidence to back up detailed recommendations about using food in prevention and treatment. Without the necessary investment into this area of research, the necessary change will be very difficult to accomplish.</p><p>To ensure resilience in society it is therefore critical to create the incentives for researchers, government officials, food systems actors, health care workers, marketing offices, and individuals to become a part of a new transitional system that enables food to play a regenerative role in building society’s capacity to&nbsp;heal.</p> Enabling the transformation <p>Multiple entangled interventions will be necessary to transform the current scenario, requiring the involvement of actors from across the food and health care systems, national, regional, and municipal governments, research institutions, and civil society. To start a conversation with these actor groups, four propositions, addressing the three main challenge areas (described above), have been made and outlined as ‘what if…’ statements below. We invite you to engage with them together with us, exploring why or why not these could help to drive the change necessary.</p> (1) Pricing not just the production but the externalities of&nbsp;foods <p>Increasingly food and our food systems have been optimized from a production costs and supply side optimisation perspective. This reality has supported the massive reduction in the cost of food and calories over the last 18 years <a href="https://www.fao.org/worldfoodsituation/foodpricesindex/en/">[42]</a>, while off loading increasingly significant societal costs. These liabilities include, as earlier described, the impacts of sugary, fatty and salty food items and the loss of nutrition dense foods on 1) sick leave costs, 2) life style driven health care costs and 3) opportunity costs; in terms of the cognitive capacity of society as whole. This is not including the food systems’ impact on the environment, such as GHG emissions <a href="https://essd.copernicus.org/preprints/essd-2021-389/">[43]</a>, biodiversity loss <a href="https://report.ipcc.ch/ar6wg2/pdf/IPCC_AR6_WGII_FinalDraft_Chapter05.pdf">[44]</a>and soil erosion <a href="https://report.ipcc.ch/ar6wg2/pdf/IPCC_AR6_WGII_FinalDraft_Chapter05.pdf">[45]</a> — to name a few. Today these outcomes are almost always ignored when food is being&nbsp;priced.</p><p>What if the societal and environmental costs generated throughout the supply chain of food had to be considered and paid into an autonomous self-balancing system, held by a public good trust, which simultaneously cross finances and balances different parts of the food economy that create societal value? The externalities that are generated throughout the food value chain would be considered at each level, from farmers to producers to distributors, to create a true value market inclusive of future societal liabilities and assets. The cost of negative externalities, and the value of positive externalities, would be standardised and decided collectively yet self determined by the actors involved when pricing their products — for example a farmer when selling their cabbage, a manufacturer when selling their cabbage&nbsp;crisps.</p><p>What if this balancing system even considered how different people are impacted by different foods?</p>Image 2: Pricing not just the production but the externalities of&nbsp;foods<p>Such a system would seek to shift the incentives in the current food system and encourage consumers to buy those foods that are benefiting their health defense systems and the&nbsp;planet.</p><p>As farmers and producers would need to evidence their self-set prices (through verifying externalities generated) they are incentivized to both continuously self-evaluate their practices and continuously improve them as means to reduce liability costs and increase competitiveness under the new market and price&nbsp;logics.</p><p>This systemic realignment of our food system and incentives to societal outcomes as opposed to capital optimisation is&nbsp;vital.</p><p>Some actors are already testing new logics to pricing food. Felix Climate Store <a href="https://webershandwick.eu/our-work/felix-the-climate-store/">[46]</a> is one example and in our interview with them, we understood that when they based their prices on a product’s CO2 emissions, items that usually never get left on the shelves became harder to sell, for example, their classic frozen meatballs.</p><p>In order to increase the complexity of the pricing beyond CO2 emissions and look at multiple outcomes at the same time (suggested by the what if… statement above) would require highly-complex information infrastructures. Companies would need to be able to combine different types of data (public, private, sometimes personal) in order to build real-time and context based pricing models. This might not be a 1st horizon scenario, however, with the technology at hand today, this could become possible over&nbsp;time.</p><p>Still there are multiple important questions to ask before moving forward with such an idea. For example, who decides what positive and negative outcomes are and for who? Considering the development of accuracy in measurement, how would the system tackle discrepancies in externalities estimated and measured e.g. would there be retrospective adjustments, if so who would hold the risk for that, would bespoke insurance products be needed? What would be required in terms of labelling, displaying and packaging of foods? What would be asked of the individual to navigate this system? What research would be needed to cover current knowledge gaps about how different food impacts people differently? recommendations? And the list could go&nbsp;on.</p> (2) Accounting for the re-generative potential of&nbsp;food <p>Many decisions in today’s economy are informed by the reports created by accountants. Still, the existing accounting systems are struggling, similar to the pricing models, to account for the spillover liabilities and assets created in the wider system. Instead accountants are concentrated on the economic costs and revenues of one specific entity, in order to put a number at the end of the balance sheet. This is creating a simplified picture of the complex value flows generated by the supply chain of food and the systemic discounting of externalities (this is not only an issue within the food system&nbsp;<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/a-smart-commons-528f4e53cec2">[47]</a>).</p><p>What if the accounting systems and accountability structures were able to account for the entangled values and liabilities created by food and include the many co-beneficiaries impacted? By combining new accounting practices and monitoring systems (making sense of the outcomes created) new lines could be added to the balance sheet. Maybe even items that do not directly impact the entity concerned? This would paint a different picture for companies to consider when making decisions.</p>Image 3: Accounting for the re-generative potential of&nbsp;food<p>Such a shift would create incentives to consider the entangled values and liabilities generated throughout the supply chain when choosing, for example, what crops to grow, as well as how to grow&nbsp;them.</p><p>The new sustainability reporting requirements <a href="https://www.icaew.com/insights/viewpoints-on-the-news/2021/nov-2021/new-sustainability-standards-board-targets-globally-comparable-reporting">[48]</a> are an important step in this direction, as companies are being asked to report their social and environmental impact. However, until these impacts are visible on the balance sheet, we may not see enough change as urgently necessary [49]. Visibility would influence a companies’ ability to raise capital, and the cost of that capital, it would also influence the insurance premiums needed. Equally, it would make it more transparent for customers how a certain company operates.</p><p>At the same time as this shift seems important, it can not be discussed without mentioning the risk of trying to put a number on social and environmental impacts. What sort of design decisions would be needed to be taken in order to calculate this, for example what impacts, over what time-span — and who would take these decisions? For example, how would the interests of non-human actors and future generations be taken into account, and what would happen in situations where a balancing between interests would be needed? What new capabilities, skills and professional training would be needed in order to develop this system? And, as this would also require highly-complex information infrastructures, when could this be made possible?</p> (3) Taxonomy for regenerative food <p>Today the marketing and labeling of food is often done through culturally associated claims, such as clean, all natural, real fruit, happy cows, independent family farmers, humane and environmentally responsible products, naturally sweet and the list could go on. The ambition is to create a cultural wrapper around food which overwhelms its actual nutritional value and associated regulatory requirements, to enable us to believe a product is good and healthy for us/or the planet, without the associative evidence or&nbsp;reality.</p><p>It is becoming clear that this cultural taxonomy of food has been massively exploited for the intentional or the unintentional misdirection of informed&nbsp;choices.</p><p>What if there was a new evidence-based-claims requirement for the taxonomy for regenerative food? Instead of only addressing the words regenerative and food, this could include a whole series of different words and sentences. Let us walk through an&nbsp;example.</p><p>Imagine a new food product is being placed into the market. The producer would in this case be required to make a self-declarative impact model of the product’s impact on different people, society and the environment. Based on this open model, they would be permitted (or not) to make a portfolio of self-declarative claims, such as this product will improve your immune system or the local soil quality. The portfolio of claims could then be structured as a sign that this is a regenerative food, if, for example, the model shows sustainable input, positive societal outcomes and low externality/positive externality process.</p><p>These claims would need to acknowledge the situational variance, i.e different foods have differential impacts on different people, at different times and different foods have different impacts on soils and ecosystems in different climates. This would mean that the portfolio of claims shifts depending on who the buyer is and when the purchase is being&nbsp;made</p><p>Similarly, what if products which are systemically degenerative would be required to label their regressive impacts similar to cigarettes?</p>Image 4: Taxonomy for regenerative food<p>Such a taxonomy would, beyond helping customers navigate different options, create the incentives for food actors to monitor the impact of their businesses. This would increase the awareness of externalities created in the system and potentially encourage improvements to be made. The evidence would need to consider the entire supply chain and could further inform new collaborations across the&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Äkta Vara is an existing customer owned organisation trying to address issues with food labeling and marketing using campaigns and their Ä-mark <a href="https://www.aktavara.org/">[50]</a>. They are making it more transparent what a product contains, or maybe rather what it does not contain. Another example is kliMAT, allowing customers to scan items and find out their climate footprint <a href="https://klimatappen.se/">[51]</a>. While both of these examples help the customer to navigate the shelves of a food store, neither creates a framework for how to name and market. Currently this is regulated by the EU-taxonomy <a href="https://www.livsmedelsverket.se/foretagande-regler-kontroll/regler-for-livsmedelsforetag/information-markning-och-pastaenden">[52]</a>, which is not able to address the complexity of impacts in the&nbsp;system.</p><p>While this “EU Taxonomy 2.0” for regenerative food could improve the current situation, it is important to note that the marketing of food is still likely to be miss-leading; mostly due to the difficulty of ensuring quality of evidence, and therefore verifying, claims. This is not necessarily due to intentional misleading of customers, but rather because a food item’s impact is dependant on the entire supply chain, which is entangled with many other systems. Any generalization, therefore, becomes hard to make, without an over simplification. This requires us to ask how to create the necessary information infrastructures to evidence claims uniformly and while allowing actors to make sense of their specific&nbsp;impacts?</p> (4) Invest in evidencing <p>Today there is a funding gap for research about food’s impact on the body <a href="https://www.kostfonden.se/varfor/#starkt_forksning">[53]</a>. As stated earlier in this article, the main root cause of this is the disconnect between the food and pharma industries and the lack of incentives to prove that food can be regenerative.</p><p>What if the self-balancing pricing system was used as a seed fund, matching public and private investment into research to evidence food’s impact on the body and mind? This research would be necessary to make the earlier suggested pricing, accounting and taxonomy models work and could encourage private and public bodies to raise their investments.</p>Image 5: Invest in evidencing<p>Once there is enough evidence to make the new models function, there would be clear incentives for private companies and public bodies to keep investing in this area of research (as it would help them prove what their impact on society and environment is).</p><p>The increased understanding of food’s impact on mind and body would not only enable the new incentive models, it would further help the health care system navigate how to use food in prevention and treatment. When a next pandemic arrives, governments may even know what diet to recommend populations to eat in order to help their health defence systems to stand up against the&nbsp;disease.</p><p>Kostfonden is a fund that is already trying to address the current funding issue. They are particularly targeting food’s role in treatment <a href="https://www.kostfonden.se/">[54]</a>. However, it is not enough and it will be important to better understand diets’ role in personalised prevention and regeneration (personalised food is a growing area within the food sector and will need to be explored by&nbsp;itself).</p><p>However, before the investments are pooled, the suggested funding model would need to carefully consider its governance structures. What is the decision-making architecture for deciding who, or what, gets funding? There are already issues with food lobbying in research related to food <a href="https://www.adlibris.com/se/bok/fejkmaten-9789127173583?affId=2939453&amp;utm_source=tradedoubler&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=annfernholm.se&amp;tduid=bccf80942c42f1cd13ce74f0a5b55ac9">[55]</a>, how can this be an opportunity to ensure that the research is done for public good? Equally, how can the fund ensure long-term sustainability for researchers while leaving space for the inherited uncertainty in the process? What would the Intellectual property requirements be for research to avoid recreating many of the ills and perverse incentives of our current food&nbsp;system?</p><p>Lastly, how can the insights and results generated from the research become radically legible for people across food and health care systems, different layers of governments as well as individuals? And who is responsible for these translations?</p><p>Combined, these four “what if…” statements, could, if realised with careful consideration, have transformative potential and ensure that food’s regenerative ability is seriously considered throughout its supply chains. However, these suggestions are not enough and it will be crucial to identify additional intervention points moving&nbsp;forward.</p>Image 6: Provocation ecosystem<p>Therefore, in the coming months, we will continue exploring the questions and ideas raised in this blog together with different stakeholders.

				  “I can’t think of anything I’ve done that I’ve been more proud of.”  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>Learning new skills in a new industry and technology is always good for growth, both personally and professionally. It’s particularly important for those in college to be able dip their toes into different worlds off campus and get a sense of the kind of work they want—or don’t want—to pursue in life.</p>
<p>Indicio is committed to finding and cultivating the next generation of technical and business professionals through our part time associates program. Associates work side-by-side with experienced staff on all our key projects. It’s an intense learning experience with a ton of opportunities to learn new skills and take on responsibilities. Our unique position as an early-stage startup, there is so much to do and our associates quickly get to see the impact of their work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for new associates to be given a crash course on decentralized identity, maybe some relevant exercises to bring them up to speed, and then have them working on client projects within a week or two of accepting an offer. The team is, of course, always behind them to help with the quick transition and any questions they might have, but we believe our associates have what it takes to fix any problems a client may experience, and to interact with them to ensure our reputation for customer satisfaction at every step of the way.</p>
<p>Specifically this year saw the implementation of a more structured 90-day review and mentorship program that we are particularly excited about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While mentorship programs are fairly common, at Indicio we don’t require our associates to stay inside their team, and in fact we encourage them to experience other parts of the business. An associate on the technical team might have a mentor in finance to give them a more well rounded view of the business and help with their career development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hold 90-day reviews so associates and their managers can&nbsp; mark progress towards more long term goals and provide&nbsp; a chance for the associate to both receive and give feedback on the program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What former Indicio associates say about their experience</p>
<p>“The associate program at Indicio has been great for me. I got the position while I was still in school, and I was able to work while I finished my degree. When I started, I only knew javascript and I’d never worked on a mobile app before. I learned React Native on the job, and now I work on apps every day. After school, I went from associate to full-time without missing a beat, so the Indicio associate program totally jump started my career.” — Sabrina Jensen, Mobile Software Engineer, Indicio, former associate</p>
<p>“I’ve appreciated the balance of challenge and support I’ve received as an Indicio associate. I’ve been able to work on client projects, take ownership of my tasks, learn new technical skills, and more with the help of a mentor and a team who is happy to answer questions and help out with issues.” — Char Howland, Software Engineer, Indicio, former associate</p>
<p>“My associate experience at Indicio has been phenomenal. Initially, I was a little nervous; this was my first time programming for work, rather than just for school. Beyond that, it was my first “office job,” and my first time working from home. A few weeks into the program, after I’d gone through the orientation and trainings, I was given what turned out to be my favorite project I’ve ever worked on. Without going into too much detail, I was given a very basic structure and some project requirements, and was told to get to work. Of course, the team was super willing to offer help and guidance when I ran into snags, but in large part, I was given responsibility for the project. I’ve been working on that project as time permits ever since, and there’s always more to polish and update with it, but the bulk of the project is functional and working smoothly. I can’t think of anything I’ve done that I’ve been more proud of.” — Micah Peltier, Software Engineer Associate</p>
<p>In the coming year, we’ll be running more events for associates, so they can get to know each other better outside of client projects; we’ll be providing more professional development, so that we can help associates structure and progress in their careers; and, critically, we’ll be giving them the time to find, develop, and work on a passion projects.</p>

<p>Ontario, and Canada as a whole, is seeing a transformation when it comes to betting and iGaming, with a bill being passed in 2021, removing the prohibition of single-game betting in the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The bill (C-218) was a milestone change for gambling in Canada, with single-game betting opening up a ton of markets that were previously unavailable in the country. Regulation is still, however, down to each province and Ontario is looking to welcome iGaming and betting with open arms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ontario’s government acted quickly after the bill was passed, creating a new body to contact and manage iGaming in Ontario, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/igaming-ontario-igo/">iGaming Ontario (iGO)</a>. This body serves as a subsidiary of an existing regulatory body, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/alcohol-gaming-commission-ontario-agco/">the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO)</a>, with the two working together to ensure a safe and open gaming market within the province.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, operators are readying to enter what could be a very promising market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What makes Ontario a high-potential iGaming market for European Operators?&nbsp; 



<p>Ontario’s iGaming market is set to be a unique and open one. Managed by iGO and AGCO, there is no limit to the number of operators that can compete in the province, which houses over 15 million people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Early <a href="https://vixio.com/blog/a-new-era-for-online-gambling-in-canada/">VIXIO GamblingCompliance forecasts</a> predict that Ontario’s gambling market could generate over $795 Million in revenue in 2022 and will see rapid growth in the short term, with a forecasted revenue of $1.5 Billion by 2026. These numbers put the province as one of the largest online gambling markets in North America.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While impressive growth is forecast, that’s not the only benefit for operators. Ontario’s market also features a very competitive annual tax rate of just 20% – one of the lowest in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>On top of all this, Ontario has proven to be a leader when it comes to embracing Canada’s new iGaming market. The province was quick to act following the passing of C-218 and has put out detailed guidelines for operators interested in entering the market, while also working alongside a range of industry leaders to establish responsible regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another keynote is Ontario’s European approach to gambling regulations. We can still expect to see the usual restrictions and regulations. However, unlike in some markets, operators will not be required to cease offshore activities in other Canadian provinces, even after being registered in Ontario.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 How Ontario’s standards are raising the regulatory bar&nbsp; 



<p>While Ontario looks to be a promising iGaming market, it’s also raising the bar when it comes to regulatory standards. Due to a wide set of rules and regulations, Ontario is being considered a complex market to get into and features a core focus on customer protection. &nbsp;</p>



<p>iGaming Ontario and the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario have set out a wide range of rules and regulations which need to be adhered to in order to gain access to the market. This includes and goes beyond standard know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) standards. Specifically, the country is subject to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA), which is regulated by the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre (FINTRAC).&nbsp;</p>



<p>This includes things like requiring operators to report suspicious transactions, prohibited players, and step up KYC processes with an onboarding process that includes checking official documents, recent photos, as well as liveness. The AGCO has made available a full list of <a href="https://www.agco.ca/lottery-and-gaming/registrars-standards-gaming">Registrar’s Standards for Gaming</a>, where the full details can be found.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All in all, Ontario’s iGaming market looks to be a very promising one when it comes to revenue, while also offering a high level of customer protection and strict regulations. If the market proves to succeed as it is forecast to, it could show that stepping up security and customer protection efforts is well worth pursuing and possible while still being profitable. This is especially important in modern times, with regulators all over the globe pushing for stricter gambling rules and regulations. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>



 How European Gaming Operators can enter Ontario’s iGaming market&nbsp; 



<p>Ontario has introduced a unique method of managing operators within its market. All operators must register directly through the AGCO, and rather than operating individually in Ontario, they will provide their services through a commercial partnership with iGO. This means gaming companies work as private operators on behalf of Ontario’s governing body. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to enter the market, operators must go through an official registration process. This begins with submitting an application through the <a href="https://www.agco.ca/iagco-information">iAGCO</a> portal. It’s a detailed process, which requires operators to submit gaming-related goods and services, gaming website information, and branding details. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, there are also comprehensive entity and personal disclosures which require details of both the registrant, as well as associated individuals like parent companies and individuals holding key management or operational roles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is, however, more to it than going through the application process. In the long run, operators will need to be fully compliant with Ontario’s evolving rules and regulations. This means being subject to not only iGO’s and the AGCO’s rules and regulations, but also the overarching PCMLTFA and FINTRAC standards. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>



 IDnow’s role in easing entry into Ontario’s iGaming market&nbsp; 



<p>Entering Ontario’s iGaming Market will prove to be a sizable challenge for any operator. The wide range and complexity of iGaming requirements in the province mean there is almost a regulatory maze to navigate through to reach compliance. (Read on: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/becoming-compliant-ontario-igaming-market/">Becoming Compliant in Ontario’s iGaming Market</a>)</p>



<p>All operators will need to meet iGaming Ontario’s and the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario’s standards, while also adhering to policies laid out by the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act and the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>One key issue operators may face is a lacking onboarding process. iGO has set out clear AML and KYC requirements, which exceed even the FINTRAC standards and will require detailed verification, tracking, and data storage systems. You can learn more in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/why-ontarios-igaming-industry-game-changer/">Ontario’s iGaming model ebook</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This International Women’s Day, Revoke is celebrating women in the technology industry, and what better way to do this than with one of our own? Anca is a vital part of the company and works with us as a software developer. Here she is sitting down with Digital Jersey &amp; Skills Jersey, outlining how she started out in this sector:</p>







<p>She also spoke with us to discuss women in the tech industry, and why she made the move over.</p>



 Q: Hi Anca, thanks for sitting down with us to talk women in tech! Could you start off by telling us a little bit about yourself? 



<p>A: Hi, my name is Anca, I am originally from Romania but have been living in the UK for almost 10 years. At first, I lived in Birmingham while studying for my bachelor’s degree in Hospitality and Tourism Management, and once I finished university I moved to Jersey, Channel Islands. I worked in a prestigious 5-star hotel on the island until I decided to change my career and started learning programming.</p>



<p>Long story short: I studied Web Development on my own through online courses and built a portfolio with projects using the latest, most in-demand technologies; in just a few months, I got hired at Revoke where I have been working as a Software Developer for more than 3 years.</p>



<p>During this time, I have learnt a lot, especially on the job, thanks to my amazing colleagues, as well as through additional courses such as the Digital Jersey Coding Course.</p>



<p>I have won a tech award and a Hackathon (second place ), I have become a mentor and a programming teacher for 10-year-olds, and I have recently started to study for a master’s degree in Cyber Security Technology.</p>



 Q: What first sparked your interest in working in the tech industry? 



<p>A: I worked in the hospitality industry for about 5 years, advancing in my career from an internship in a luxurious hotel in Dubai to Events Supervisor and then Assistant Restaurant Manager in Jersey. I was really enjoying the work environment, learning about different cuisines, wines, customer service, the novelty of each day in events, meeting new people, travelling, and making connections.</p>



<p>However, because of the nature of the industry, I was working a lot of hours per week, late nights, as well as all the weekends and holidays and I, was feeling like there was no work-life balance in my job, as well as receiving very little appreciation for my effort and dedication.</p>



<p>Therefore, I started researching other career options and tried a few different things (including opening an online shop) until I eventually came across a great Web Development&nbsp;course online and the <a href="https://zerotomastery.io/blog/learn-to-code-for-free">article</a> that Andrei, the course tutor, had written about learning to code and getting hired.</p>



<p>That article was life-changing for me; it described a programmer’s career so well, emphasising on industry growth, the high demand for developers in the future, the need to always learn and stay up to date with technologies, as well as the freedom that comes with a job in IT, for example through the ability to choose where you want to live (since you can find a job anywhere in the world, or work remotely).</p>



 Q: What advice would you give to women just starting out in Software Development? 



<p>A: This is a great time for women to get into the technology industry as everyone is realising the importance of diversity. There is a lot of advice out there for women who are just starting to code, no matter if they have a degree or not. Most of these I’ve heard or read when I started this journey myself and I found them to be very valuable and helpful.</p>



<p>Probably the best advice I got was to&nbsp;not give up in the first couple of months&nbsp;while it feels like climbing “an insurmountable mountain”, to stay strong and keep learning until it all clicks, because it will. If you remember that, then you are halfway there, here are a few more tips that worked for me, to keep you going:</p>



 Make a plan – spend some time planning what you want to learn and in what order, rather than aimlessly following tutorials or reading books. Find out what are the most relevant technologies that will get you hired and aim to learn those. 

<br>If you have a plan, it’s less probable that you will get distracted from your goals or that you will go down a dead end by learning outdated technology. You should start with the basics of how the internet works, how the web integrates with HTML and CSS and reacts to your code, how to use the command line and a suitable text editor, then choose one programming language and stick to it.<br><br>

 Find a mentor or a supporting community, or both – in my opinion, it’s very important to surround yourself with women who have the same goals as you as well as others that you can learn from. Join a coding challenge such as #100daysofcode or Hacktoberfest or a Discord community where you can ask for help, offer help to others, collaborate on projects and many more. <br>

 Ask a lot of questions – once you’ve found a mentor and a supportive community, don’t be afraid to ask lots of questions. I know it sounds like a cliche, but there really isn’t such a thing as a silly question when you are learning to code. Whenever you are stuck on something or there’s something you don’t understand, try to Google it first and if you don’t get an answer to your question, ask your peers. 
<br>

 Be organised! – set some goals for yourself and do your best to achieve them. Give yourself a time-limit to learn HTML and CSS, to build your first website, to complete a module on a course, etc. <br>

 If you have trouble staying focused for a long time, especially when you’re struggling to understand, try using the <a href="https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique">Pomodoro Technique</a> (You focus on what you’re doing for 25 minutes with no distractions, then take a 5-minute break and repeat the cycle 4 times before taking a longer break) – this was a massive help for me at the start and I am still using it sometimes when I am learning something new, there are many mobile and web apps for it. <br>

 Don’t get stuck on the basics, it will all make sense – when you first learn how to code, you might get stuck trying to memorise basic things such as HTML elements or CSS syntax, but you shouldn’t waste your time on these. <br>

 You should build your first basic website within a couple of days and then move on, as you will always be able to find all the keywords and syntax online when you need them. <br>

 When you get to the actual programming language of your choice, make sure you understand the fundamentals such as data types and structures and variables but don’t waste too much time trying to memorise a certain syntax, you can always Google it later. <br>

 Build a portfolio – this is very important especially if you don’t have a CS degree or any related work experience, since it’s your opportunity to showcase your work to potential employers, to prove what you can do and to show how you have evolved. Having an active GitHub profile where you contribute often to personal and public projects is also a great advantage when applying for junior or mid developer jobs. <br>

 Apply for jobs – if it’s your goal to get hired, start applying for jobs as soon as possible. If you have already 2 or 3 projects in your portfolio, if you have a clear learning path that you are following and if you show that you are motivated to develop further, you might find a company that is willing to take you on and teach/mentor you themselves. Even if you might fail on some interviews, you don’t really have anything to lose, but you will have gained some experience and you know what is expected of you for the next ones. But once you succeed, you will get paid to learn.

<p>Using storytelling to achieve positive social change is Wendy’s passion, as well as helping visionaries to realize their dreams. Concerning technology, Wendy helped launch a new movement for a decentralized, private and secure web that gives control back to its users.</p>



<p>We are happy to share this conversation with Wendy on the occasion of International Women’s Day 2022. Read how her first job taught her the hard way what matters if you want to succeed as a woman in a male-dominated job, and how she would encourage young women to pursue a career in tech or IT. Finally, Wendy shares why she would like to sit down for dinner with Angela Merkel and Michelle Obama. Thank you Wendy for this inspiring conversation! We are glad you do what you do and hope you keep up with the good work to be an inspiration for many more women!</p>



<p>What was your first job, and what did it teach you?</p>



<p>My first job was as a reporter-researcher for TIME Magazine in New York. It was the 80s and the organization was very hierarchical and dominated by men. Women were pretty much segregated into support roles and no woman had ever risen to a senior editorial position. It was eye-opening! After coming from school which felt more egalitarian, the work world was a rude awakening. It taught me that the world would not be a meritocracy and to succeed I would need to break a lot of entrenched, unconscious patterns of promotion and advancement.</p>



<p>Do you have a female rolemodel?</p>



<p>Both my best and my worst boss ever have both been women. At the positive end of the scale, women have been nurturing, honest, and willing to invest in my growth—not for the sake of the organization, but for my sake.</p>



<p>How can we encourage more women to pursue senior leadership roles in their careers?</p>



<p>At one company, my female CEO invited three women department heads to lunch at her house. It was a lovely lunch and I remember one piece of advice she gave us that day: don’t ever wait for your boss to offer you a raise or promotion again. If you want it, you have to ask for it. All three of us had been promoted or offered raises by this CEO, but none of us had gone to her to request it. Why? We were scared of being turned down. It’s important to overcome that fear of rejection if you want to become a leader.</p>



<p>What is the most important message you want to send out to young women thinking about a career in tech or IT?</p>



<p>When you arrive at an organization, don’t be surprised to find the leadership in technical fields 100% male and overwhelmingly white. It will feel impossible to break through, but it’s not. Find allies in unexpected places and don’t be afraid to ask for your own advancement.</p>



<p>If you could have dinner with three inspirational women, dead or alive, who would they be (and why)?</p>



<p>Michelle Obama</p>



<p>Eleanor Roosevelt</p>



<p>Angela Merkel</p>



<p>In the case of Michelle Obama and Eleanor Roosevelt, they took a support role and made it really matter; they overcame incredible prejudice and resistance to find their own voice. Angela Merkel showed you can rule a country—even the European Union—with a rational, even hand and succeed.</p>

<p>We are happy to talk with her about International Women’s Day. In this conversation, Kaliya talks about her own career and sheds a light on how it is not about encouraging women to pursue a career in IT, because women are not the problem limiting their leadership. More likely, she talks about a deep systematic issue. Finally, Kaliya offers advice to young girls who feel inspired to start a career in IT or tech. Thank you Kaliya for this inspiring conversation and keep going with your amazing work!</p>



<p></p>



<p>Have you faced any barriers in your career due to being a woman? If so, how did you overcome them?&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think when I was in the early part of my career I didn’t believe I experienced barriers or issues but looking back I realize they were there. This included inappropriate sexual advances at conferences (my strategy was to just ignore them).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Early on when we were all talking on a mailing list about user-centric identity Doc encouraged everyone to start blogging – it was at that time when one needed a name for a blog – that is when named my blog Identity Woman. This was in part because I was the only woman I had met in a meeting about digital identity.&nbsp; I was very lucky to find alignment and connection with Doc Searls and Phil Windley to collaborate in co-organizing the Internet Identity Workshop.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>What was your dream job when you were a little girl?&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I was a little girl my family watched the 6pm evening news almost every night. In Canada where I grew up the first 1/3 of the hour-long news program was international news. So I was aware of a bigger world and I saw things that didn’t seem just or right like the first Palestinian Intifada or learning about the tensions in the cold war.&nbsp; I also saw politicians talking and they seemed to have power at least how it was framed and I was putting pieces together as a young child so I wanted to be one of them – to make a difference in the world to make it better.&nbsp; I am still trying to use my power to make the world a better place.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>What are you most proud of?&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’m proud of myself for having the strength to follow my own path and through the significant struggles found success.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I have held true to a vision I caught via my participation in the Planetwork community and ist articulation of the Augmented Social Network vision. It was following that path I worked with others to cultivate the Internet Identity Workshop is an incredible community. I realize, now that I am reading more about international standards bodies and how they work, how our event and the community we have spawned to work on open standards for digital identity that center people and our autonomy instead of centering corporations and governments and their needs that this community and our event is really special.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>What was your first job, and what did it teach you?&nbsp;</p>



<p>You could say that my first job was being a water polo player.&nbsp; I played on the Canadian Jr. National Team when I was 17 and 18 years old and from there I got an athletic scholarship to attend University in the United States at UC Berkeley. While I was in college I played water polo for the Canadian Sr. Women’s National Team. Playing sports at such a high level teaches you a lot – more than I really realized at the time.&nbsp; It gives you a mental toughness to really knuckle down and focus to improve yourself over time.&nbsp; I also learned how to play water polo in a team system by observing patterns in the field of play and knowing where to go. This sense of game and strategy serves me very well in both areas of my work facilitating unconferences and supporting communities acting together.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Do you have a female role model?&nbsp;</p>



<p>I admire Esther Dyson and her pioneering of convening within the Technology industry. She a major conference PCForum from 1982 to 2007.&nbsp; It was the one conference where Bill Gates and Steve Jobs appeared on stage together. She published a book Release 2.0: A Design for Living in the Digital Age in 1997. I aspire to have enough money to be an investor like her.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>How can we encourage more women to pursue senior leadership roles in their careers?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don’t really think it is about encouraging women. We aren’t the problem limiting women’s leadership. The problem is the dominant culture and the way that it frames who is worthy and who it can “see”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I founded a conference in 2007 called She’s Geeky for women in technology.&nbsp; I was about 3 years into my career and was bright-eyed and optimistic. We kept hosting the conference and as I and others who attended approached year 10 of our career many of us contemplated leaving the industry. It isn’t that it’s toxic and hard right away – it is that the deep systemic issue and the years of micro-aggressions and not being seen and recognized for one’s work build-up to the point that it sort of become “why bother”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think we need to do some significant cultural work amongst those in the dominant and largely unconscious culture. It is so toxic and really quite terrible for women and people of color.&nbsp; I am unclear how we get to this type of significant cultural change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>What is the most important message you want to send out to young women thinking about a career in tech or IT?&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is critical to find allies and people who will support you and your work. I have been materially helped most by men of color who have made proactive steps to materially help me – get me contracts, do key introductions, help me address bad behavior by white men, give me job opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you could have dinner with three inspirational women, dead or alive, who would they be (and why)? &nbsp;</p>



<p>I would like to go back and talk to my great-grandmother Spoor. She went and got her bachelor’s degree at the University of Wisconsin and in fact, did a senior thesis that was almost exactly the same as a science fair project I did in 7th grade.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>My mom died when I was 18 and I would really love to see her again. She would be really astounded at what I have accomplished. She didn’t even see me go to college.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>‘International Women’s Day is an occasion to celebrate the progress made towards achieving gender equality and women’s empowerment but also to critically reflect on those accomplishments and strive for a greater momentum towards gender equality worldwide.’</p><a href="https://en.unesco.org/commemorations/womenday">https://en.unesco.org/commemorations/womenday</a></blockquote>



<p>March 8th is International Women’s Day and it’s all about celebrating women’s success and raising awareness against bias. Celebrated each year since 1911, thousands of events occur to mark the economic, political and social achievements of women. &nbsp;</p>



<p>‘Gender equality today for a sustainable tomorrow’ is the theme for this year. As it stands, just 19% of the tech workforce are women. It is unlikely that the gender pay gap in tech will be closed in a short amount of time, because even as more female graduates enter the tech industry, they will be entering at more junior positions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thankfully, times are changing in general, and more women are being encouraged to join the ranks of innovators and developers working to bring remarkable technological innovations to this world. To bring about change, we need to challenge stereotypes and overcome gender bias, and we need more female role models and mentors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For that, we at Jolocom are celebrating two leading female tech professionals today: Wendy Hanamuna, and Kaliya ‘Identity Woman’ Young.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kaliya – known as Identity Woman – is a key figure in SSI and identity on the blockchain. Internet, in her opinion, is there to empower people. By co-founding the Internet Identity Workshop in 2005, Kaliya committed her life to the development of an open standards-based layer of the internet. </p>



<p>We are happy to talk with her about International Women’s Day. In this conversation, Kaliya talks about her own career and sheds a light on how it is not about encouraging women to pursue a career in IT, because women are not the problem limiting their leadership. More likely, she talks about a deep systematic issue. Finally, Kaliya offers advice to young girls who feel inspired to start a career in IT or tech. Read more about it here: <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/kaliya-identity-woman-young/">https://jolocom.io/blog/kaliya-identity-woman-young/</a> </p>



<p>Using storytelling to achieve positive social change is Wendy’s passion, as well as helping visionaries to realize their dreams. Concerning technology, Wendy helped launch a new movement for a decentralized, private and secure web that gives control back to its users.</p>



<p>We are happy to share this conversation with Wendy on the occasion of International Women’s Day 2022. Read how her first job taught her the hard way what matters if you want to succeed as a woman in a male-dominated job, and how she would encourage young women to pursue a career in tech or IT. Finally, Wendy shares why she would like to sit down for dinner with Angela Merkel and Michelle Obama.

 The Solana x Web3Auth Hacker House world tour turned out to be a massive success paving the way for more such global collaborations for both&nbsp;parties.  What is the Solana Hacker&nbsp;House? <p>The Solana Hacker House world tour is a series of events around the globe where developers building on Solana can build, find collaborators, and learn from some of the greats in the Solana ecosystem. Participants will have all the essentials: good WiFi, food, power, and (of course)&nbsp;swags.</p> Solana — Web3Auth Partnership — a Quick&nbsp;History <p>Web3Auth and Solana share a close partnership dating back to 2020 which more recently resulted in the launch of the <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/lets-replace-seed-phrases-on-solana-make-onboarding-easy-for-the-next-billion-users-on-both-ed6054520a74">Solana Torus Wallet</a> and Web3Auth committing 100% support to all Solana developers. The partnership took a deeper turn with Web3Auth’s commitment to co-headline 4 Hacker Houses with Solana — the first of which commenced in Singapore between February 15th — 20th.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/KyleSamani/status/1495793687401414658">@KyleSamani</a></p></blockquote> Singapore Hacker House — A closed-door event for 200 curious developers <p>Participants were welcomed with exclusive Web3Auth&nbsp;swags</p><p>The event was hosted at the iconic Marina Bay Sands Expo and Convention Center overseeing the beautiful Marina Bay in Singapore. Given Singapore’s stringent Covid protocol, the Hacker House was a closed-door gathering of only 200 individuals. These mostly included Developers, members from the investing fraternity, and of course senior team members from both the sponsors — Solana and Web3Auth. All of the participants had one thing in common — the urge to collectively contribute towards the development of&nbsp;Web3</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/hackerhouses/status/1494598814446985223">@hackerhouses</a></p></blockquote> A Galaxy of Star Speakers graced the&nbsp;stage <p>The Hacker House saw a galaxy of speakers grace the stage to offer valuable insights, fascinating demos, and intriguing panel discussions.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/muhnkee/status/1496137947254595584">@muhnkee</a></p></blockquote><p>On Day 1, Our Head of Engineering Chaitanya Potti(Chai) spoke about how Solana Developers can eliminate the need for seed phrases while onboarding users into their dApps or wallets. The developers were pleasantly surprised to know that they could increase user conversion on their dApps by up to 64% with our solution.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1493482058030608384">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote><p>On Day 4, our Sr Software Engineer conducted a workshop on how Solana Developers can leverage the power of the Solana Torus Wallet while building their dApp or wallet. The talk was received with much intrigue and interest which also invited many curious questions from the audience.</p><p>On the final day, Web3Auth talks culminated with Chai and Shubham doing a panel discussion along with moderator Tristan, founder of Zeta finance. The discussion revolved around “UX, Wallets, and the future of Web3Auth“.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1495337601816928258">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote><p>Web3Auth won Developers with their state-of-the-art auth infrastructure<br>True to the spirit of the Hacker House, the Web3Auth team forged many collaborations through the 6-day event. Various developers discovered the ease of onboarding Web3Auth’s Plug and Play SDK offered to their dApp and with every integration, Web3Auth moved closer towards their vision of making crypto accessible to the&nbsp;masses.</p><p>Here are a few examples of some integrations that happened during the Hacker&nbsp;House.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1494957294915706885">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1495331334352355329">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote><p>We are certain that the different partnerships and collaborations made during the Hacker House may result in bringing the next billion users into the Solana Blockchain.</p><p>The event culminated with Tom who leads Growth and Strategy at Solana thanking the participants and partners for making the event such a grand success and also shared what the future holds for&nbsp;Solana.</p> 3 more events to go… Where to&nbsp;next? <p>The success of the inaugural Solana x Web3Auth Hacker House has paved the way for many more such collaborations. With 3 more Hacker Houses to co-headline in 2022, there is much anticipation around where the next Solana x Web3Auth Hacker House will be conducted.</p><p>The Web3Auth team would be headed to New York to take part in the Hacker House from 14–18 March 2022!

 Verus Showcases Scalable, Decentralized Currency Launch and Anti-MEV DeFi Technology for Ethereum and Other Networks at Consensus 2022&nbsp;🔥  Verus will showcase its Public Blockchain as a Service (PBaaS) Technology at Consensus 2022, June 9–12, Austin, TX. The world’s most influential crypto &amp; blockchain experience of the year. Here tens of thousands of crypto enthusiasts come together to discover the latest industry-leading developments.  Verus Addresses Ethereum Network Challenges <p>The Verus protocol addresses challenges that are seen in Ethereum and other networks. Challenges such as MEV (Miner Extractable Value), scalability and cross-chain/network interoperability.</p><p>With the release of the new Verus testnet (March 6, 2022, <a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/releases/tag/v0.9.1">see extensive release notes</a>) and the planned mainnet launch before the start of Consensus 2022, Verus can be used as, among many other things, a launch platform for ERC-20 tokens and currencies.</p><p>Through the Verus Interchain Protocol (VIP, decentralized bridging technology) creators can use the Verus protocol to create currencies and tokens and immediately export them to Ethereum as ERC-20s without needing any Solidity developers or actual programming. Saving costs and having the ability to use the most feature-rich decentralized crypto protocol to date. Currencies and tokens on the Verus protocol can also be created to be mapped 1:1 with any ERC-20 token, making never seen before value transfers possible.</p><p>All currencies and tokens on the Verus and Ethereum networks can be used with Verus DeFi. Verus DeFi is part of the L1 consensus protocol, which means that all AMM conversions can not be front-run or reordered, and are calculated simultaneously for all transactions in any given block, meaning all participants get the same price in all directions of conversion.</p><p>Additionally, anyone can create a blockchain with Verus PBaaS technology. Rent-free, independent and fully interoperable with all other connected blockchains in the network. <a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/releases/tag/v0.9.1">See release notes for more extensive information on various launch options for currencies, tokens and blockchains.</a></p><p>Ethereum is the first network that has a decentralized bridge to Verus, and many networks will follow. The Verus community is excited to showcase these working technologies to the masses at Consensus 2022.</p> Powerful Verus Community <p>The Verus community came together to make the attendance of Consensus 2022 possible and donated VRSC, BTC and ETH at an incredible combined amount of $150,000. Thank you so much to everyone who donated!&nbsp;❤️</p><p>With the funds, the Verus community acquired a 10x10 feet (3x3 meter) booth at Consensus. And a hotel suite to be used as a Verus community home base and where interested parties can learn about Verus away from the noisy and busy Austin Convention Center.</p><p>Most Verus community members are all joining Consensus 2022 and we want you to join as well! Let’s make a big presence and let the world see what Verus has to offer. We are all hyped and confident it is going to be a great opportunity for Verus and its ecosystem!</p><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus2022/">Grab your ticket here</a>. ⚠️ Get a 15% discount on your Consensus 2022 ticket if you join the <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">Discord channel</a>, and ask for the discount code in #marketing!</p> 💙 <a href="http://www.verus.io">Visit verus.io for more information on&nbsp;Verus</a>  <p><a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-showcases-scalable-decentralized-currency-launch-and-anti-mev-defi-technology-for-ethereum-96c165e94c1">Verus Showcases Scalable, Decentralized Currency Launch and Anti-MEV DeFi Technology for Ethereum</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin">Verus Coin</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Looking Forward — Community <p>Written by Paul Pomerleau, Developer Relations at BOTLabs GmbH, the company that initially developed KILT Protocol.</p><p>Last year was the most exciting to date in KILT’s short history. With incredible support from the community, the KILT crowdloan cap of 220,000 KSM was achieved hours after the parachain slot auction began. On September 8, 2021, KILT won its slot and went live as a Kusama parachain. Staking, governance, and a Treasury were then added to the KILT blockchain, along with decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials to provide developers with the tools to <a href="https://www.kilt.io/how-it-works/">create businesses around identity and credentials</a>. After testing and auditing, on November 10, 2021, KILT transitioned to a decentralized network. <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/announcing-sporran-and-stakeboard-storing-and-staking-for-kilt-3e37125fc744">Ways to store and stake KILT were launched</a> and the community of KILT Coin holders started participating in active <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/how-to-vote-on-a-kilt-referendum-2a9e167a24f0">governance</a>. It was a busy four&nbsp;months!</p> The Way&nbsp;Ahead <p>2022 is already shaping up to be another whirlwind. <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/announcing-socialkyc-built-on-kilt-65a29a974d07">SocialKYC</a>, a service that uses KILT to regain control over your digital identity, launched in January and more services are on the way. Even more exciting is the KILT community’s evolution, as it begins to imagine and build real products and use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>The prime direction of the KILT community is now clear: driving development and adoption. How? By ignoring the noise, removing friction, and staying laser-focused on outcomes. This is where the fun really&nbsp;starts!</p><p>Let’s do a quick&nbsp;recap:</p>  KILT is ready to go. It’s past the concept stage and the infrastructure already exists to allow anyone to build a real-world services on the KILT blockchain.  The KILT blockchain is live and running as a Kusama parachain in the Polkadot ecosystem. Polkadot addresses a lot of problems — such as interoperability, security, and stable transaction fees — that have hampered blockchain use to&nbsp;date.  Entrepreneurs and developers who want to build real-world products around digital identity can harness the advantages of blockchain without any blockchain experience via the JavaScript <a href="https://www.kilt.io/developers/kilt-sdk/">software development kit</a>&nbsp;(SDK).  The KILT SDK can be downloaded free from the KILT website, and extensive<a href="https://dev.kilt.io/#/"> technical documentation</a> is already available.   The Power of Community <p>The community around KILT is constantly growing and forming support systems for those interested in building on KILT. Anyone who wants to run a successful business and tap into the KILT blockchain can join the conversation and collaborate on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/HztRqvzbhG">Discord</a>, an active hub that already has over 2,000&nbsp;members.</p><p>Trello, the newest community addition, provides a platform for individuals and teams to share information. Areas are devoted project ideation and practical support when building:</p><p>Projects that are underway&nbsp;include:</p>  <a href="https://burma.ac/">Burma Academy</a>, a MOOC (massive open online course) platform built by a team in Myanmar that provides education, will implement KILT for login and credential issuance.  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/yazgit/">YAZGİT (Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing Community)</a>, a project at the Konya Technical University in Turkey, is creating Arduino-powered smart locks that use KILT DIDs and Credentials + RFID Cards to allow users&nbsp;entry.  <a href="https://publiclandprotocol.com/">Public Land Protocol</a> is building the ORGO App, a mobile application that will gamify and incentivize land maintenance and remediation. ORGO will use KILT DIDs and credentials to attest completed tasks and accomplishments to unlock perks and earnings.  <a href="https://trello.com/c/Ye8pcyvc">Doggo DID</a> is a project focusing on credentials for dogs to certify hard traits like ID and vaccine status, as well as soft traits like skills, disposition, etc. The project is exploring existing NFC Collars and future-facing UWB technology. It also plans to interoperate with existing Web2 registries in order to tap into an existing user&nbsp;base.  <p>Some of these projects including Doggo DID and ORGO are actively seeking developers! Message the teams in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/847445252663148565/856523327011291137">Discord</a> by role, or in their collaboration channel.</p> Treasury Funding <p>KILT also has a <a href="https://www.kilt.io/treasury/overview/">Treasury</a>, a store of on-chain funds available for creating infrastructure or initiatives that benefit the network and contribute to its long-term sustainability. These can cover a wide range of projects, from software or infrastructure development to community outreach programs. Any KILT Coin holder can create a proposal and request funds from the Treasury.</p><p>Since KILT is at the beginning of this exciting phase, the “KILT Distillery” was created to support a culture of “abstract and open source”&nbsp;. This is a cookbook of recipes and tools allows devs to quickly spin up projects leveraging the work and learnings of others. As a new member of the community building your business, you can engage with more experienced members for advice on finding abstractions that you can use to create open-source code and contribute to the ecosystem. You can also apply for Treasury funding for your outcomes.</p><p>For example: Burma Academy is using a tool called OpenEDX and is exploring creating an KILT &lt;&gt; OpenEDX auth plugin. YAZGİT may explore Arduino modules, and Doggo DID an NFC &lt;&gt; DID resolver, etc. This creates a win-win situation, with the project obtaining support and the KILT community gaining a growing ecosystem of modular libraries and tools that entrepreneurs and developers can use to quickly bootstrap their business or use cases. Obviously, the common goal of the community is adoption, and together it can happen&nbsp;quickly.</p> Looking Forward <p>KILT was built to counter monopolies and their poor handling of user data. Projects building on KILT are reimagining Web2 identity constructs to create a new digital identity model for Web3, the next generation of the internet.</p><p>Building on KILT goes beyond one blockchain or network. Entrepreneurs and developers can build a better way for the user as well as a successful and sustainable business&nbsp;model.</p><p>Discover more about KILT on its <a href="https://www.kilt.io/treasury/overview/">website</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/announcing-socialkyc-built-on-kilt-65a29a974d07">blog</a>.

				  The Privatyze team is excited to announce a collaboration with IndicioID to develop a robust, decentralized data marketplace.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p><a href="https://privatyze.io/">Privatyze</a>, an innovative startup for privacy-respecting data monetization solutions, has announced a collaboration with&nbsp;<a href="http://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a>, a global leader in developing the infrastructure for trusted data ecosystems, to help guide the Privatyze team as they develop a robust, decentralized data marketplace using the Indicio Network.</p>
<p>The new Privatyze platform will provide an open and secure peer-to-peer environment for market participants to trade data directly, with full user consent and support for enrollment and discovery.</p>
<p>The result will be a more efficient, secure, and transparent platform than any offered by traditional data markets. Users can be compensated for the use of their data. It will mean that those with data to trade will be in complete control of the process, removing the data privacy and security problems of third-party data control. The use of verifiable credentials to manage authentication and decentralized identifiers to generate unique P2P encryption for every transaction will provide the zero-trust level of assurance needed for participation.</p>
<p>“We are excited to partner with Indicio to deliver a world-class data monetization platform that meets the stringent security and privacy requirements of our customers,” said Madison Majeed, CEO of Privatyze. “With the rise of big data and the increasing demand for secure ways to monetize this information, this partnership represents an important step forward in the decentralization of data and the evolution of privacy-respecting technologies.”</p>
<p>“In a data-driven economy, we need a marketplace for data that’s inclusive and not exploitative,” said Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “That means that participants can meaningfully consent to data transactions and do so in a way that enables zero-trust security. This just isn’t possible without decentralized solutions, and we are excited to work with Privatyze on building this solution.</p>
<p>This collaboration represents an important step towards the development of decentralized data markets and will help to promote data ownership, transparency, and privacy protection for all participants.</p>
<p>About Privatyze:</p>
<p>Privatyze is a San Diego based technology startup on a mission to end the Surveillance Data Economy, and siloed-centralized data monopolies, known to many as Surveillance Capitalism. To do this they’re enabling everyday people to take ownership of their digital footprint, data, and privacy and turn it into a valuable digital asset. Privatyze is empowering users to take control of their data by giving them the freedom to collect and store their own data and information, verify its validity, and take it to the marketplace; where they can claim their piece of the $300 billion big data and digital advertising industries.</p>
<p>Privatyze was grown out of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.launchfactory.com/">Launch Factory</a>&nbsp;which brings together talented founders, elite advisors, seed capital, vetted technology, and an accelerator program to give entrepreneurs the unfair advantage they’re looking for. Launch Factory partner Bill Orabone said, “Privatyze is capitalizing on exactly the type of wide-ranging, big thinking opportunity we seek. Everyone knows that data privacy is a huge problem and Privatyze’s approach hits directly at its center.” Learn more about Privatyze at Privatyze.io</p>

<p>This is a transcript of Ocean Founder Bruce Pon’s latest talk at the MOBI Community Lecture Series. In his fourth presentation to the MOBI community since 2019, Bruce offers a deep dive into safe data sharing with blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. His lectUre also underlines the role of <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a> and its latest technical advances — safe staking and Data NFTs — in spearheading this&nbsp;vision.</p><p>The Value of&nbsp;Data</p><p>Data is an untapped asset waiting to be unlocked. With a combination of new technology, mindset changes and new business processes, this is possible. As a starting point, organizations must acknowledge that publishers need to feel safe, secure and comfortable to share data. If this is solved, then the next phase is to develop pricing signals on the data to incentivize people, reveal the value of personal data to them and get the cycle&nbsp;going.</p><p>My team have worked for eight years to build the tools and technologies to allow for safer data sharing and we have employed blockchain technology and cryptocurrency for this purpose. Today, the world is closer to having the pieces in place to unlock data at a large scale. The technology stack is maturing quickly and many of the core infrastructure pieces are ready to be used. With successful models of bootstrapping and new economies forming in the Web3 space through decentralised finance, non-fungible tokens and decentralised autonomous organisations, the Defi space has a total value of $3+ trillion, which is more than the value of all the startups and unicorns on&nbsp;Earth.</p><p>The decentralised space is moving very fast, there’s a lot of value being sucked up to it which makes data ripe for this crypto cycle. However, there are still a lot of challenges to improving the user experience. There is a need to raise awareness and educate people and streamline the onboarding process because that’s not intuitive. The need of the hour is to teach people that if they are able to put things into digitized formats using these tools, they will also be able to apply the tools of finance to make it&nbsp;happen.</p><p>Ocean Protocol: The key to unlocking an Open Data&nbsp;Economy</p><p>There are a lot of features in the Ocean tech stack that enable users to share their data and monetise it on their own terms. In Ocean’s upcoming technical release V4, these features present a whole new set of opportunities.</p><p>1. Ocean&nbsp;Market</p><p>The <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Market</a> is the main way for people to interact with Ocean; it’s the front end application that one can access from any browser. Users can see the datasets, stake them, buy them and consume them. What Ocean will work to build soon is a pool to draw people in, whether through a wider range of useful data, bounties or request forms to allow people to ask for the type of data they’re looking&nbsp;for.</p><p>For data providers, the Ocean Market is open-source software that’s freely available to anyone to clone and build their own marketplace. The code is completely available to inspect and any vulnerabilities found can be fixed very quickly. In V4 the providers can set their own fee schedules for each transaction as well as price data in the currencies they want. The advances Ocean has made in the last 14 months are to extend tools, features and control to all participants and stakeholders. Ocean has also integrated both DeFi and NFTs into the Ocean Market enabling users to stake and earn transaction fees. The Ocean Market has now evolved into a more mature front end with which people can start using Web3 technologies. This includes the cryptocurrencies of Ocean, anything else that interacts with it, the concept of NFTs and decentralized finance.</p><p>The idea driving this is that Web3 technologies are future-facing; this is where the world is going to head and the ability to have a live demo that is in production, securing several million dollars worth of data and allowing people to start sharing their data is very rare. This makes the Ocean Market one of the very first data markets available using Web3 technologies.</p><p>2. Ocean Smart Contracts</p><p>With Ocean as an operating system for AI and data sharing, smart contracts are the engines driving it. They serve to enforce conditions of access, facilitate payments, execute a transaction or business logic. It is a globally shared computer that anyone can use, which allows for these transactions to happen anywhere on Earth at any time, given the proper&nbsp;inputs.</p><p>There are multiple kinds of blockchain networks, and Ocean interacts with all of them through smart contracts — these are the core building blocks on which all protocols live. They allow the trustless exchange of value, but also provide an audit trail on what transactions have taken place and what actions have been done. It is a very strong use case because any participant can trace back and see what happened directly on the blockchain, paving the way for automated audits and inspections — continuous monitoring of what happens to the data and personal datasets. Publishers could get daily reports on how many datasets were sold, what was done to them, and be notified of any exceptions or&nbsp;misuse.</p><p>3. Compute-to-Data</p><p>The third piece that Ocean built to meet the needs for people to share their data without exposing it is a reference implementation called Compute-to-Data. It offers privacy-preserving access, which means that data can be stopped from being stolen. Today, there are a host of tools being developed across the entire space, which allow for privacy-preserving computing to happen at multiple fine grain levels. This means that any type of computing on a dataset, any type of action that is run on it will still preserve its privacy. Compute-to-Data is our first cut at this and our team is working with several other entities to integrate their privacy-preserving algorithms and solutions directly into the Ocean Market. Users will be enabled to choose the type of privacy protection they want to implement on top of their services in order for them to be consumed safely. Ocean equips users with comfort and security for providing their data to meet industry&nbsp;demand.</p><p>4. OCEAN&nbsp;Token</p><p>We hear a lot about cryptocurrencies nowadays where more and more people are comfortable acquiring, holding and using them to navigate the blockchain economies. 15% of the American public apparently holds crypto and in about a dozen other countries, such as the Philippines, Nigeria, and other places that you wouldn’t have necessarily thought would be on the edge of innovation, the number of population that actually have crypto is above 20%. This is what crypto does, it invites the world in, and it allows everybody to participate. That is the positive effect of this technology.</p><p>This is where the OCEAN token comes in. It is a native crypto token for the Ocean network that helps to run the smart contracts and we use it for a whole bunch of other purposes like governance, staking rewards and bounties as well. It’s a standard for this data economy and the means of payment in the ecosystem. In the future, we are also looking to introduce other cryptocurrencies in the ecosystem. Our whole goal is to make sure that data sharing becomes easier. We do know that right now, it is mandatory that people have cryptocurrency wallets in order to interact with us but we are looking forward to easier onboarding as technology progresses.</p><p>5. Datatokens and Data&nbsp;NFTs</p><p>Think of it this way: if you want to play a pinball game, you need to throw in a token to play the game. The way we have architected datatokens is through the idea that one needs a token in order to access&nbsp;data.</p><p>A publisher could set the price of the datatoken at $100 in the Ocean Market. There’s also innovative technology that allows for tokens to be dynamically priced by the community in real-time, without affecting the data itself. If the community takes a look at the data and understands what is being provided, they can help price the data. The datatoken concept allows for a data asset to develop its own dynamic price, the liquidity behind the datatoken gives a price, people can trade datatokens speculatively without moving the actual underlying data — and at the end, because there’s a dynamic price on the datatoken, that becomes the de facto the price of the data asset. It is an interesting experiment to see how we can price data into the future, especially for data assets that we don’t really know the price&nbsp;for.</p><p>If one takes the datatoken concept to its logical conclusion when a dataset is so well used and so broadly traded, one could say that the dataset is IPO’ed — and it is a stock that also grants one access to use the data if one&nbsp;wants.</p><p>One of the things that we’ve realized in the Web3 space is that speculation and pricing are fundamental pieces to a market. In a nascent market, there is only speculation. By using this dynamic, we can start unlocking data through datatokens.</p><p>6. Data&nbsp;NFTs</p><p>Imagine that you have a dataset, and you’ve generated it for your doctoral research but you don’t really need the data anymore. It now turns out that an automotive company would like to have that dataset. One could generate a datatoken and hand over access to that automotive company. But one could argue that there is also the possibility of creating a Data NFT for the licensing rights to a data asset. Not only can you sell this Data NFT to the automotive company, and let them use the data but now it can also be improved and marketed.</p><p>In other words, you’ve licensed out your intellectual property for somebody else to use and monetize themselves. Think of an NFT for a car — where one essentially sells the car with the NFT — the physical object with the digital NFT. Or one can invest in licensing where the process is just granting access at a particular time to a particular data asset. Just like a song and multiple CD’s with access to it, there are datasets and a couple of NFTs to grant access to them enabling owners to monetise their data&nbsp;assets.</p><p>In summary, there are two approaches. One is the datatoken, where users maintain control of the data asset, watch over how many people are trading it and what the price is from a dynamic perspective. The second one is Data NFTs, where users generate sublicenses and sell them off. These NFTs are free-floating but whoever has that NFT continues to be able to access a particular dataset.</p><p>These are native, future-facing technologies that we are going to hear a lot more about. With these building blocks, Ocean gives users the tools to sell data and monetize it. Any publisher can now monetize their data using these innovative channels without any reliance on a centralized party or software as a service provider. They have full control over their commissions and they cannot be de-platformed. This allows for a flowering of innovation but also for different business models to be tried out by interested parties in order to get a data economy&nbsp;going.</p><p>Why isn’t data being shared more frequently?</p><p>The answer is simple: there are 100 different ways how data can be collected, but it just stays locked up. Many individuals today want to share and monetise their data however they do not know how to get started. They want to have a comprehensive understanding of the legal, safety and privacy implications involved in the process. There is a curiosity to learn, a sense of opportunity to start building new business lines and that is crucial to building the open data economy that we aim to unleash at&nbsp;Ocean.</p><p>We need more experiments that put small amounts of value and reputation at risk, to learn and adjust organically. Interested publishers must take that first step because no one can predict the market’s reaction. The path isn’t clear for anyone and no one knows how to package and sell the data in a Web3 world. Everyone is learning in this new environment and it is my strong conviction that we can start sharing data now only if we take some bold steps forward. Many people have exactly the kind of data that many organizations are looking for in order to enhance their services and AI capabilities and so, it becomes imperative to dive into the easiest ways to start sharing and monetising it.</p><p>The 3-step approach to getting value out of your&nbsp;data</p><p>Step 1 — Gather &amp; Publish&nbsp;data</p><p>Gather data that you think is valuable but isn’t being exploited and monetized.</p><p>Find some data about supply chains, manufacturing, energy consumption, sensor data, warehouse data — whatever it is that you are collecting and you think has value. However, avoid anything that exposes personal information.</p><p>Find it, package it up, publish it on Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p><p>This allows you to get your feet wet with the tools and paradigms of Web3 — from setting up a wallet, to self-generating IDs and then using the tools available. It’s the best way to learn and demonstrate to stakeholders how to navigate the world of&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>Step 2 — Explore&nbsp;Value</p><p>If you don’t know what the data could be valuable for, issue a&nbsp;bounty.</p><p>You issue a bounty to the community for helping you find out what the data could be used for. It can be as simple as a $15k prize for the best ideas on how the data is valuable and could be better monetized — $5k to the top 3 winners. Ocean Protocol can also publicize the bounty with its 250,000 strong community. This bounty allows you to gather ideas from a broad swath of motivated people.</p><p>Step 3 — Get&nbsp;Value</p><p>Finally, if you have some burning questions and you think there might be an answer, or at least, an approach to solving the questions, you can also bounty this for the community.</p><p>Give a prize to anyone that can help you solve the riddle or question, using the datasets you published.</p><p>One example: in 1999, Goldcorp Challenge was launched by the new owner of a goldmine — he asked the global community to help him find the gold on his land for a chance to get $1m in prize money. He put up a small file of his geological data for inspection. 20 years later, Goldcorp was sold for $10 Billion and is now the largest gold mining company on Earth. All because he took the chance, opened up his data and let others help him to figure out where to dig for&nbsp;gold.</p><p>Data — when openly, transparently exploited, can be extremely powerful and valuable.</p><p>Through this simple 3-step approach, you can get value out of your data and incentivize a global community of data scientists using bounties. It can be a game-changer only if one takes a&nbsp;chance.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>In summary, with Ocean, we have been building infrastructure to enable this kind of safe data sharing. It is there and is ready to use; we just have to get the wheel going. As part of our future Ocean V4 release, Ocean will give publishers more control, transparency and ways to monetize their data. It’s the most advanced stack of technologies in this rapidly expanding space. However, its true potential can be realized only if there is more experimentation. Imagine the discoveries that are just waiting to happen if data could be opened up. At Ocean, we will continue to support and encourage you in this&nbsp;journey.</p><p>Ocean Protocol is a decentralized data exchange platform spearheading the movement to unlock a new Data Economy, break down data silos, and open access to quality&nbsp;data.</p><p>Watch Bruce Pon’s past talks for the MOBI community via the links&nbsp;below:</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHuNQ-DmaM0">How to Tokenize and Monetize Your Data</a> — MoCo Los Angeles, 12 November&nbsp;2019</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U2H0qV2VwE">Data Monetization for Mobility</a>, 25 November&nbsp;2020</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybfZUT0Fmb0">Data Sharing Using the Latest Web3 Technologies</a>- 23 February&nbsp;2022</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-sharing-using-the-latest-web3-technologies-7703624aa709">Data sharing using the latest Web3 technologies</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Web3Auth at one of the World’s Largest Web3 Events — ETHDenver 2022  Web3Auth was at ETH Denver to forge partnerships, sponsor the Opening Party where we (literally) air-dropped NFTs, delivered talks, and also unveiled a&nbsp;dance!  What is ETHDenver and why does it&nbsp;matter? <p>ETHDenver is the largest and longest-running ETH Event in the world. Attended by the who’s who of the Crypto industry — particularly from within the Ethereum community, ETHDenver is hosted in the state of Colorado — a thriving hub of Ethereum and Blockchain innovation.</p><p>In the three years since we’ve been active as a Web3 company, this is the second time we had the opportunity to participate in this massive gathering of some of the brightest minds in the Web3 space. What better way to open our presence at ETHDenver than to become official sponsors of the Opening&nbsp;Party?</p> How Celebrations unfolded at the Opening&nbsp;Party <p>The Party was hosted at the Wings Over The Rockies Air and Aviation Museum spread across 44000 sq ft and housing over fifty iconic aircraft and the most realistic flight simulators.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1494427295720919042">@epnsproject</a></p></blockquote><p>Starting at 2:00 pm and going on till 2:00 am, the opening party hosted a slew of exciting talks and panel discussions with our own co-founder and CTO Leonard Tan featuring in a very insightful discussion around ”Interoperability, Scaling, and Blockchain Agnosticism”. Leonard also cited the example of Web3Auth whose pluggable SDK is blockchain agnostic which evoked a few pleasant surprises in the audience.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1495452625709395970">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote><p>Later in the day, our co-founder and <a href="https://twitter.com/zenzhenyu">CEO Zhen Yu Yong</a> also spoke about a popular topic — “How one can accelerate the adoption of Web3 Wallets and Applications”</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/DefiNft/status/1494446562163900423">@DefiNft</a></p></blockquote><p>The audience was surprised to know that with Web3Auth’s pluggable SDK, they could eliminate the need for using seed phrases in their dApps just in a few&nbsp;minutes.</p><p>The party got groovier with an interesting bunch of artists performing through the day(and night) to keep the energy rising in what was an already electrifying space. After having spent the day reaching out to many developers, it was time to put the good old phrase “Work hard party harder” into action. Team Web3Auth partied through the rest of the&nbsp;evening.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1495504783909732361">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote> Web3Auth AirDrops Party&nbsp;NFTs <p>The highlight of the night was a blimp that circled above the event for 6 hours from which we airdropped specially designed physical NFTs. Don’t believe us? See for yourself.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1495488929562255364">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/EthereumDenver/status/1494843481172459524">@EthereumDenver</a></p></blockquote> Star-Studded Speaker&nbsp;Sessions <p>ETHDenver set the stage for some of the biggest names in Blockchain to come and share their priceless insights with the rest of the community. The galaxy of speakers included the founders of some of the biggest NFT marketplaces to the founders of giant L2 chains to senior members from the Ethereum Foundation and countless exciting developers from the ecosystem!</p><p>Having helped dApps such as Skyweaver, Rarible, and MyCrypto heroes increase user adoption, Zhen gave insights to the community on how they can scale up too by integrating Web3Auth’s state of the art Private Key management infrastructure.</p><p>However, it was Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum Foundation(with whom both our co-founders worked previously) who eventually stole the show for reasons both expected and unexpected.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/neocrassical/status/1494888681055920129">@neocrassical</a></p></blockquote><p>When Vitalik wore the ETHDenver Mascot Buffi suit, little did he know he would end up as a meme to be shared by Elon&nbsp;Musk</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1496252264171941888">@elonmusk</a></p></blockquote> Successful Partnerships and the Dance of&nbsp;success <p>The simplicity of Web3Auth attracted a lot of attention from the community and people from different quarters reached out to the team to know more about Web3Auth. Below is a snippet from Zhen’s interview with The Sapien&nbsp;Tribe.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/sapien_network/status/1496253333941940225">@sapien_network</a></p></blockquote><p>Web3Auth also forged some promising partnerships at ETHDenver that will help onboard the next generation of users into Web3. You can expect formal announcements in the days to&nbsp;come.</p><p>Lastly, we would like to leave you with a sweet dance of success — presenting to you the official Web3Auth Dance that we unveiled for the first&nbsp;time.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1495790667867508744">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1496291445883420675">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote> About Web3Auth <p>Web3Auth, is a pluggable non-custodial infrastructure that enables Web3 wallets and applications to provide seamless user logins for both mainstream and Web3.0 users. By aggregating OAuth (Google, Twitter, Discord) logins, different wallets, and existing key management solutions, Web3Auth provides dApps/wallets with a familiar experience that fits every&nbsp;user.</p> Stay in touch with&nbsp;Web3Auth <p><a href="http://web3auth.io/">Website</a> | <a href="https://docs.web3auth.io/">Docs</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/web3auth">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://t.me/web3authdev">Telegram</a> | <a href="http://discord.gg/web3auth">Discord</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/web3auth">Linkedin</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/web3auth-at-one-of-the-worlds-largest-web3-events-ethdenver-2022-4a2180621107">Web3Auth at one of the World’s Largest Web3 Events — ETHDenver 2022</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Over the years, I’ve developed a lot of Java applications. I started writing Java code in the late 90s and spent several years doing Java before I tried another server-side language. I was impressed when I first tried building apps in Ruby on Rails, Python, and Node.js - they all started super-fast!

<p>Over the years, I’ve developed a lot of Java applications. I started writing Java code in the late 90s and spent several years doing Java before I tried another server-side language. I was impressed when I first tried building apps in Ruby on Rails, Python, and Node.js - they all started super-fast!</p>
 
 
<p>Starting fast is cool, but we in the Java community have often asked, does it perform over time? The Java Virtual Machine is famous for performance and optimization over time.</p>
 
 
<p>I scoffed at serverless when it first came out. Mostly because I was a Java developer and my apps didn’t start in milliseconds. They also used a whole lotta memory and there was no hope in sight.</p>
 
 
<p>Then, along came <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/">GraalVM</a>. It’s gained support from many Java frameworks in the last few years and has made their apps start in milliseconds!</p>
 
 
<p>Today, I’m proud to announce that this same capability is now available for your JHipster 7+ apps!</p>

 Why should you care about serverless? 
 
 
<p>From <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/serverless">IBM’s What is Serverless computing?</a></p>
 
 
<blockquote>
 
<p>Serverless is a cloud execution model that enables a simpler, more cost-effective way to build and operate cloud-native applications.</p>
 
</blockquote>
 
 
<p>That’s it!</p>
 
 
<p>For companies with high traffic and large cloud bills, serverless makes sense. They can save millions of dollars a month.</p>
 
 
 
 
 GraalVM allows serverless Java for everyone! 
 
 
<p>I’ve been playing with GraalVM and the Java frameworks that support it for around 18 months. After doing a lot of research, I blogged about <a>building native Java apps with Micronaut, Quarkus, and Spring Boot</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>In September 2021, I did a talk with Josh Long about Spring Native with JHipster at the San Francisco JUG.</p>
 
 <blockquote><p>Let the games begin with <a href="https://twitter.com/starbuxman?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@starbuxman</a>! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Java?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Java</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SpringNative?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SpringNative</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/JHipster?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#JHipster</a> <a href="https://t.co/0KSRTd89e5">pic.twitter.com/0KSRTd89e5</a></p>— Matt Raible (@mraible) <a href="https://twitter.com/mraible/status/1442698739563446276?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2021</a></blockquote>

 
 
<p>I flew out on a Monday, we got everything working by Wednesday afternoon, and then spoke about our experience on Wednesday night. I wrote about it in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/jhipster-works-spring-native-matt-raible/">JHipster Works with Spring Native!</a> on LinkedIn and created a <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/16498">JHipster issue</a> to automate our learnings.</p>
 
 
 
 
 What is Spring Native? 
 
 
<p>Spring Native provides an API to configure Spring Boot and GraalVM so classes that are not easily discoverable become recognizable. For example, those that are instantiated using reflection. It’s a really slick extension to Spring Boot and will likely disappear with Spring Boot 3 because it’ll be native by default.</p>
 
 
<p>As a result of our successful <a href="https://youtu.be/F9oydL_MndA">presentation at the SF JUG</a>, Josh and I were invited to speak at the Garden State JUG in December. We laid low for a few months and rekindled our research in December. I wrote about it in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/jhipster-works-spring-native-part-2-matt-raible/">JHipster works with Spring Native, Part 2!</a></p>
 
 
 
 
 🔥 Announcing the JHipster Native blueprint! 
 
 
<p>In late January 2022, we (the JHipster team) upgraded JHipster to use Spring Boot 2.6 and released version <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/2022/01/23/jhipster-release-7.6.0.html">7.6.0</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>In early February, I updated <a href="https://github.com/mraible/spring-native-examples">the Spring Native with JHipster examples</a> that Josh and I’d been using for research. I was ready to start automating the Spring Native integration using a JHipster module. When <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/16498#issuecomment-1030263905">I asked the JHipster team</a> about the best way to implement it, <a href="https://github.com/mshima">Marcelo Shima</a> volunteered to create the initial blueprint.</p>
 
 
<p>This was on a Friday afternoon (Mountain Time or MT). By the next morning, Marcelo had the MVP finished and provided steps to reproduce our examples. 😳</p>
 
 
<p>I was amazed! I remember telling (my partner) Trish that he’d done a week’s worth of (my estimated) work in a matter of hours.</p>
 
 
<p>Today, I’m proud to announce the <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-native">JHipster Native blueprint</a> is available! Here’s how to use it:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm install -g generator-jhipster-native@1.0
jhipster-native</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This will generate a JHipster app and integrate GraalVM automatically. You can build and run a native image with the following commands:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./mvnw package -Pnative,prod -DskipTests
npm run ci:e2e:prepare # start docker dependencies
./target/native-executable</code> 
 
 
 






Gradle is not currently an option, but it can be if we add support to the JHipster Native blueprint.



 
 
 
 
 Go native with Spring Native and GraalVM 
 
 
<p>To see Spring Native + JHipster in action, let’s look at a <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/full-stack-java-with-react-spring-boot-and-jhipster/">previous JHipster app I created for the Auth0 blog</a>. First, clone the example:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/auth0-full-stack-java-example.git jhipster-native
cd jhipster-native</code> 
 
 
 






 
<p>Want results right away? Clone the <code>spring-native</code> branch with the changes below already made:</p>
 
 
 
 git clone -b spring-native https://github.com/oktadev/auth0-full-stack-java-example.git jhipster-native 
 
 
 
<p>Then, skip to the <a>Configure your OpenID Connect identity provider</a> section to continue.</p>
 



 
 
<p>Install JHipster 7.7.0 and the JHipster Native blueprint:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm i -g generator-jhipster@7.7
npm i -g generator-jhipster-native@1.0</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, remove all the existing project files and regenerate them. The <code>jhipster-native</code> command includes parameters to disable caching because it’s not supported by Spring Native, yet.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>rm -rf *
jhipster-native --with-entities --cache-provider no --no-enable-hibernate-cache
# When prompted to overwrite .gitignore, type "a" to overwrite all files</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you open the project in IntelliJ IDEA, you can use the Commit Tools Window (⌘+0 on macOS or Ctrl+0 on Linux/Windows) to view files that changed.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Next, run the following <code>git checkout</code> commands to restore the files that were modified in the original example.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git checkout .gitignore
git checkout README.md
git checkout demo.adoc
git checkout flickr2.jdl
git checkout screenshots
git checkout src/main/webapp/app/entities/photo/photo.tsx
git checkout src/main/webapp/app/entities/photo/photo-update.tsx
git checkout src/main/java/com/auth0/flickr2/config/SecurityConfiguration.java
git checkout src/main/resources/config/application-heroku.yml
git checkout src/main/resources/config/bootstrap-heroku.yml
git checkout Procfile
git checkout system.properties</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you’d rather not use the command line, you can right-click on each file and select Rollback.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>If you ran the <code>git checkout</code> commands, there are several changes I made in the first tutorial that’ll need to be re-applied:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>In <code>src/main/resources/config/application-dev.yml</code>, remove the <code>faker</code> profile for Liquibase.</p>
 
 
<p>In <code>pom.xml</code>, re-add Drew Noake’s <code>metadata-extractor</code> library:</p>
 
 
 <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.drewnoakes&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;metadata-extractor&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;2.16.0&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Next, modify the <code>createPhoto()</code> method in <code>src/main/java/com/auth0/flickr2/web/rest/PhotoResource.java</code> to set the metadata when an image is uploaded.</p>
 
 
 <code>import com.drew.imaging.ImageMetadataReader;

public class PhotoResource {
    ...

    public ResponseEntity&lt;Photo&gt; createPhoto(@Valid @RequestBody Photo photo) throws Exception {
        log.debug("REST request to save Photo : {}", photo);
        if (photo.getId() != null) { ... }

        try {
            photo = setMetadata(photo);
        } catch (ImageProcessingException | IOException | MetadataException ipe) {
            log.error(ipe.getMessage());
        }

        Photo result = photoRepository.save(photo);
        ...
    }

    private Photo setMetadata(Photo photo) throws ImageProcessingException, IOException, MetadataException {
        String str = DatatypeConverter.printBase64Binary(photo.getImage());
        byte[] data2 = DatatypeConverter.parseBase64Binary(str);
        InputStream inputStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(data2);
        BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(inputStream);
        Metadata metadata = ImageMetadataReader.readMetadata(bis);
        ExifSubIFDDirectory directory = metadata.getFirstDirectoryOfType(ExifSubIFDDirectory.class);

        if (directory != null) {
            Date date = directory.getDateDigitized();
            if (date != null) {
                photo.setTaken(date.toInstant());
            }
        }

        if (photo.getTaken() == null) {
            log.debug("Photo EXIF date digitized not available, setting taken on date to now...");
            photo.setTaken(Instant.now());
        }

        photo.setUploaded(Instant.now());

        JpegDirectory jpgDirectory = metadata.getFirstDirectoryOfType(JpegDirectory.class);
        if (jpgDirectory != null) {
            photo.setHeight(jpgDirectory.getImageHeight());
            photo.setWidth(jpgDirectory.getImageWidth());
        }

        return photo;
    }
    ...
}</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Install the React libraries needed:</p>
 
 
 <code>npm i react-photo-gallery@8 --force
npm i react-images</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>In <code>src/test/javascript/cypress/integration/entity/photo.spec.ts</code>, remove the code that sets the calculated data in the <code>should create an instance of Photo</code> test:</p>
 
 
 <code>cy.get(`[data-cy="height"]`).type('99459').should('have.value', '99459');
cy.get(`[data-cy="width"]`).type('61514').should('have.value', '61514');
cy.get(`[data-cy="taken"]`).type('2021-10-11T16:46').should('have.value', '2021-10-11T16:46');
cy.get(`[data-cy="uploaded"]`).type('2021-10-11T15:23').should('have.value', '2021-10-11T15:23');</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Then, you’ll need to add type hints for Drew Noake’s EXIF processing library in <code>src/main/java/com/auth0/flickr2/Flickr2App.java</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>@org.springframework.nativex.hint.TypeHint(
    types = {
        ...
        com.drew.metadata.exif.ExifIFD0Directory.class,
        com.drew.metadata.exif.ExifSubIFDDirectory.class,
        com.drew.metadata.exif.ExifThumbnailDirectory.class,
        com.drew.metadata.exif.makernotes.AppleMakernoteDirectory.class,
        com.drew.metadata.exif.GpsDirectory.class,
})
@org.springframework.nativex.hint.NativeHint(options = "-H:+AddAllCharsets")</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The <code>@NativeHint(options = "-H:+AddAllCharsets")</code> solves the following exception that happens when you upload a photo:</p>
 
 
 
 Caused by: java.nio.charset.UnsupportedCharsetException: Cp1252
    at java.nio.charset.Charset.forName(Charset.java:528) ~[native-executable:na]
    at com.drew.lang.Charsets.&lt;clinit&gt;(Charsets.java:40) ~[na:na] 
 
 
 
<p>Once you’ve made all the changes (or cloned the <code>spring-native</code> branch), you can build your hip native binary.</p>
 
 
 Build a native JHipster app 
 
<p>You will need a JDK with GraalVM and its <code>native-image</code> compiler. Using SDKMAN, run the following command and set it as the default:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>sdk install java 21.3.0.r17-grl</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Add the native extension to the JDK:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>gu install native-image</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, use Maven to build the project. Skip tests since there’s no support for Mockito at this time.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./mvnw package -Pnative,prod -DskipTests</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This process will take a few minutes to complete.</p>
 
 
 
 Configure your OpenID Connect identity provider 
 
<p>When you generate a JHipster app with OAuth 2.0 / OIDC for authentication, it defaults to using Keycloak. It creates a <code>src/main/docker/keycloak.yml</code> file for Docker Compose, as well as a <code>src/main/docker/realm-config</code> directory with files to auto-create users and OIDC clients.</p>
 
 
<p>If you want to use Keycloak for your running app, start it with the following command:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>docker-compose -f src/main/docker/keycloak.yml up -d</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you’d rather use Okta or Auth0, that’s possible too!</p>
 
 
 Use Okta as your identity provider 
 
<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create jhipster</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
  Accept the default Redirect URI values provided for you.</p>
 

  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI streamlines configuring a JHipster app and does several things for you:</p>

 
   Creates an OIDC app with the correct redirect URIs:
     
       login: <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> 
       logout: <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761</code> 
     
   
   Creates <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups that JHipster expects 
   Adds your current user to the <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups 
   Creates a <code>groups</code> claim in your default authorization server and adds the user’s groups to it 
 

<p>NOTE: The <code>http://localhost:8761*</code> redirect URIs are for the JHipster Registry, which is often used when creating microservices with JHipster. The Okta CLI adds these by default.</p>

<p>You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app. It will look like this (except the placeholder values will be populated):</p>

   <code>export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI="/oauth2/default"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID="{clientId}"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET="{clientSecret}"
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#okta">Create a JHipster App on Okta</a> for more information.</p>


 
<p>You’ll need to source the <code>.okta.env</code> file the Okta CLI creates to override the default Spring Security settings.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>source .okta.env</code> 
 
 
 






If you’re on Windows, you can modify this file to use <code>set</code> instead of <code>export</code> and rename it to <code>okta.bat</code>. Then, run it with <code>okta.bat</code> from the command line.



 
 






Modify your existing <code>.gitignore</code> file to have <code>*.env</code> so you don’t accidentally check in your secrets!



 
 
<p>Skip to <a>Run your native JHipster app</a> if you’ve configured your app for Okta and just want to see it running.</p>
 
 
 
 Use Auth0 as your identity provider 
 
<p>To switch from Keycloak to Auth0, override the Spring Security OAuth properties. You don’t even need to write any code!</p>
 
 
<p>To see how it works, create a <code>.auth0.env</code> file in the root of your project, and fill it with the code below to override the default OIDC settings:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI=https://&lt;your-auth0-domain&gt;/
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=&lt;your-client-id&gt;
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=&lt;your-client-secret&gt;
export JHIPSTER_SECURITY_OAUTH2_AUDIENCE=https://&lt;your-auth0-domain&gt;/api/v2/</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You’ll need to create a new web application in Auth0 and fill in the <code>&lt;…​&gt;</code> placeholders before this works.</p>
 
 
 Create an OpenID Connect app on Auth0 
 
<p>Log in to your Auth0 account (or <a href="https://auth0.com/signup">sign up</a> if you don’t have an account). You should have a unique domain like <code>dev-xxx.eu.auth0.com</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>Press the Create Application button in the <a href="https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications">Applications section</a>. Use a name like <code>JHipster Native!</code>, select <code>Regular Web Applications</code>, and click Create.</p>
 
 
<p>Switch to the Settings tab and configure your application settings:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Allowed Callback URLs: <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code></p>
 
 
<p>Allowed Logout URLs: <code>http://localhost:8080/</code></p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Scroll to the bottom and click Save Changes.</p>
 
 
<p>Copy your Auth0 domain, client ID, and client secret into the <code>.auth0.env</code> file you created earlier. Then, run <code>source .auth0.env</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>In the <a href="https://manage.auth0.com/#/roles">roles</a> section, create new roles named <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>Create a new user account in the <a href="https://manage.auth0.com/#/users">users</a> section. Click on the Role tab to assign the roles you just created to the new account.</p>
 
 
<p>Make sure your new user’s email is verified before attempting to log in!</p>
 
 
<p>Next, head to Auth Pipeline &gt; Rules &gt; Create. Select the <code>Empty rule</code> template. Provide a meaningful name like <code>Group claims</code> and replace the Script content with the following.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>function(user, context, callback) {
  user.preferred_username = user.email;
  const roles = (context.authorization || {}).roles;

  function prepareCustomClaimKey(claim) {
    return `https://www.jhipster.tech/${claim}`;
  }

  const rolesClaim = prepareCustomClaimKey('roles');

  if (context.idToken) {
    context.idToken[rolesClaim] = roles;
  }

  if (context.accessToken) {
    context.accessToken[rolesClaim] = roles;
  }

  callback(null, user, context);
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This code is adding the user’s roles to a custom claim (prefixed with <code>https://www.jhipster.tech/roles</code>). Click Save changes to continue.</p>

 Run your native JHipster app 
 
<p>After you’ve built your app, it will be available in <code>target/native-executable</code>. Start Keycloak or source your Okta/Auth0 settings. Then, run the following commands:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm run ci:e2e:prepare # start docker dependencies
./target/native-executable</code> 
 
 
 
<p>It should start in under a second!</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 What does the JHipster Native blueprint do? 
 
 
<p>The JHipster Native plugin integrates Spring Native into a JHipster project based on <a href="https://github.com/mraible/spring-native-examples#readme">findings from the research by Josh Long and me</a>. I documented our findings in September and December 2021.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Sep 30, 2021: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/jhipster-works-spring-native-matt-raible/">JHipster Works with Spring Native!</a></p>
 
 
<p>Dec 14, 2021: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/jhipster-works-spring-native-part-2-matt-raible/">JHipster works with Spring Native, Part 2!</a></p>
 
 
 
 
<p>The unexpected thing is, one of the hardest problems we had to solve was with JPA and relationships. In JVM mode, everything worked fine. When running in native mode, <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/17794">there was an exception</a>. The solution took days to figure out, but was quite simple to fix: I just had to add a type hint for <code>java.util.HashSet.class</code>. 🤯</p>
 
 
<p>During this experience, I was surprised to find that Spring Native <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-native/issues/465">doesn’t support caching yet</a>. I believe this support will be added by the community soon. In the meantime, if you’re looking to start/stop your infra as fast as possible, you probably don’t care about caching. Caching is made for long-lived, JVM-strong, JVM-loving apps.</p>
 
 
 
 
 What’s the performance like? 
 
 
<p>The native binary starts in just over 500ms (581ms) on my 2019 MacBook Pro with a 2.4 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 processor and 64 GB of RAM.</p>
 
 
<p>If I start it in JVM mode with Maven, it takes just under five seconds.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>As far as build time goes, Spring Native says:</p>
 
 
 
 Finished generating 'native-executable' in 3m 10s. 
 
 
 
<p>If I build a Docker image with the native binary:</p>
 
 
 
 mvn spring-boot:build-image -Pprod 
 
 
 
<p>It takes a while the first time:</p>
 
 
 
 Total time:  06:30 min 
 
 
 
<p>And it’s slightly faster the second time:</p>
 
 
 
 Total time:  06:18 min 
 
 
 
<p>The amount of memory used after starting: <code>180 MB</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>The amount of memory used after running <code>npm run e2e</code>: <code>196 MB</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>In the interest of full disclosure, here’s the command I used to measure the amount of memory used:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>ps -o pid,rss,command | grep --color native | awk '{$2=int($2/1024)" MB";}{ print;}'</code> 
 
 
 
<p>What about the M1 Max? That’s <a href="https://twitter.com/mraible/status/1494417051137585152">not an option yet</a>, but <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/2666#issuecomment-1057819284">could be in the next release of GraalVM</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Learn more about GraalVM and Spring Native 
 
 
<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed learning how to make JHipster work with Spring Native and GraalVM. It’s still a work-in-progress. Startup time isn’t the end-all-be-all metric, but it is important in a serverless environment.</p>
 
 
<p>You can find the source code for this example on GitHub in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/auth0-full-stack-java-example/tree/spring-native">@oktadev/auth0-full-stack-java-example repository</a>. The source for the JHipster Native blueprint is in the <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-native">@jhipster/generator-jhipster-native repository</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>JHipster also has Micronaut and Quarkus blueprints. However, their native support is currently a work-in-progress. I hope to help improve them in the next few months.</p>

				 <p>Maya</p>
<p>Hi everyone and welcome to this SEO identity community meetup for January 2022. We are very excited to have Gabriel Rene with us today and our topic is how web 3.0 will connect humans, machines, and AI to transform the world. Before we get started we would like to have a few words from heather dahl, CEO of Indicio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heather</p>
<p>Hi Maya, thank you, welcome to everyone, I’m excited to kick off the first of our monthly meetups for 2022. We are moving into our just second year of providing this type of content to the community, and I think the topics that we tackle and the experts that we bring on bring really intriguing conversations. I want to give a special welcome to anyone who’s here and new to our community, it’s so cool to see in the chat where everyone’s coming from. Hamburg, I heard a shout out from Brussels, Dublin, go Fairfax, Virginia, we have Seattle, Canada, by all means if you’re new to the meetup or you’re returning, add your location to the conversation because I think it’s really interesting that we bring together this global community. For those of you who aren’t familiar with Indicio, we are a public benefit company, and our mission is to advance decentralized identity. A part of our mission is running educational events like this, and because we’re out there building ecosystems for trusted data, today’s topic we find really exciting, absolutely provocative, excited to see Gabe here, and to talk about the internet of everything, and what it means for people and digital objects and non-digital objects to provide identity and to communicate with each other in ways that are secure and trustworthy. Ken was supposed to be here today to lead the conversation but he couldn’t make it, so senior architect Sam Curren is here to lead the conversation and interview with our absolutely terrific guest, Gabrielle Rene, thank you all for being here and I’m gonna turn it over to you Sam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Thanks Heather, and and thanks Gabriel for being here, I guess we should start with an introduction, that’s appropriate, Gabriel is the architect of the spatial web, it’s a vision he’s described with his co-author Dan Mapes, in the international best-selling book titled the spatial web, how web 3.0 will connect hans machines and ai to transform the world. He’s the executive director at VERSUS lab and the spatial web foundation, and he and his team are bringing this vision to life. The groundbreaking hyperspatial markup language is currently being discussed at a new working group with the IEEE, both web 3 and the metaverse have been recent hot topics in the last couple of months but the spatial web is where the real becomes virtual and the virtual real. So welcome to Gabriel Rene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me Sam, thank you Heather, and Ken when you watch this hopefully we’re doing you proud, good work. on your behalf so Sam thank you, thanks for hosting me today, and it’s an honor to be here and have a chance to speak to everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Excellent, I’ve been stunt doubling for Ken in a few areas and I’m not as good looking as Ken is but I’ll do my best. So excellent all right, let’s dive into some questions here, and please answer with whatever you think is relevant, and we can take this discussion wherever we need to go. So you’ve described the spatial web as the internet of everything and you’ve thought a lot about what the internet of everything will look like, what do you see?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well the first thing I see is a more holistic approach to the concept of the application of network computing technologies, like the internet, and a lot of times what tends to occur is that perspectives on emerging technology are industry specific or technology specific. We talk about AI or we talk about XR, we talk about IOT or we talk about blockchain, and we talk about quant, or it’s by industry, this applies to the government or this applies to supply chain which applies to retail and this applies to healthcare. So these narratives are constantly emerging where we even have these themes: human 2.0, we have dialogues around web 3.0, industry 4.0, and the Japanese are talking about society 5.0. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all of those cases almost the exact same set of technologies are being discussed, and it’s the usual suspects I just rattled off. Some people started talking about the internet of things a handful of years ago, this idea that it wasn’t just the internet where we had sort of interconnected communications, but rather these physical connected smart devices would form this new network. That was very exciting, it remains exciting, we’ve yet to see a whole lot of it work. I can tell you that the smart home struggle is real, and interoperability is at the heart of every problem. So this idea that you can connect things is one level, then there’s another debate about things being smart. So at one level you’ve got the internet of things, and then there’s been spatial computing, which has really emerged around this idea and is now re being repackaged again into the metaverse narrative, which you might call the internet of non-things, or sort of virtual things, that are not things or “what are they” things. And then there’s been this idea that is the blockchain folks saying that the internet of money, or the internet of trust, it sort of starts to intersect with the work that your community is doing. And there’s the internet of intelligence thing, which is the AI folks attempt early on the semantic web again. Whether we use the internet, or the web, or some sort of talking variations of this kind of a network where the data is intelligent or smart in and of itself. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The term smart, which has taken over everything, so there’s a smartphone that was the first thing, it’s just a computer, but that’s fine it’s a smartphone. Why? Because it has some connected capability, and in the beginning smart meant connected. As machine learning and deep learning found its footing over the last decade. The idea of things becoming smart meant actually being intelligent to the feedback loops, adaptive smart home now means that your nest adjusts the temperature for you, and that the lights turn on and off based on some feedback loop or information. Then of course we’re talking about smart cities, and so we go from smartphones, smart things, smart cars, smart cities, the idea is that these cities become intelligent and adaptive. Your autonomous car is able to just drive. Because, traffic is this sort of amorphous thing, like a bunch of starlings moving through. Drones and automated functionality that the amazon go, vacation of everything, you walk into a store, you take what you want, you walk out. All these sort of smart functions that might be built into government services, and all this sort of future sci-fi smart city narratives, but when I spoke to a community of smart cities four years ago in Europe, cities that came together to explore this, their number one thing was well how do we connect with other smart cities? So how do we form a network of smart cities? Well smart cities with all these smart cars and smartphones and smart devices and smart things with these internet and web connections across these various sets of interests and industries forms what you might call a smart world. And that idea that you’ve got this global cyber physical network now that encompasses all of these things, and that the addressability of an object isn’t just that it’s connected, it might just be that it’s being viewed by a camera, it could be an object that has no internet connection in and of itself, but this network has its own, and it’s essentially showing up on the network, that network we call the spatial web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Really good explanation, so a natural follow-on to that, I realize that web 3.0 has become a loaded term. You used it first in the title of your book, obviously, so it’s recorded there, but it’s come to mean some different things in recent times. Using sort of your original meaning of web 3.0 why doesn’t web 2.0 already solve this? What is missing from what we’ve got today that we need to go where we need to go?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well there’s a handful of things, and I think that some of the architects of web 1.0 have lamented about some of the infrastructure decisions that were made at the time. Now there were technical limitations or practical limitations, hardly anyone actually cared, but there were debates around identity and privacy and security, there was a tendency, being academics and scientists, not to think too deeply into all of the societal implications of these technologies. So the anticipation that people would use this for good, and not for personal, selfish, or otherwise harmful ends was the default. “Oh it’s gonna be this awesome network and we’re gonna do information sharing” great, problem solved. Decades of work had gone into that, from the ARPAnet all the way up into the world wide web, where you have Tim Berners-lee pulling a bunch of threads together and stitching that into what became the backbone of this amazing communications network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identity was actually one of the real missing ingredients in my opinion, and that anonymity part, the thing that makes the web open is also the thing that makes the web dangerous. The hackers, trackers, and fakers that are permeating our lives from simple sort of issues around misrepresentation, all the way to identity theft, all the way to now ransomware, and we’re about one hop away from biotech, and people being able to hack devices that were what we’re wearing, or that are on our bodies, or that are in our bodies, and so the the openness of the web is a double-edged sword that seems to cut both ways. That allowed the web 2.0 era organizations and companies to maximize the capital potential of that structure, and so they essentially monetized that openness, that anonymity was a function of the sort of the fact that you didn’t have an identity, so we’ll rent you one. We’re google here’s ours, we’re Facebook here’s ours, apple here’s one for you as well, how about one for linkedin and facebook? Alright so we all run around with these sort of two-dimensional avatars, locked in these digital fighters where we serve certain functions. We get certain services from that, so i don’t think that a pure polarized view on this looking at web 2.0 is inherently negative is fair or accurate, but these are major holes in the architecture that allowed for this type of capitalism to thrive in a new dimension, and that thriving has compromised some of the inherent freedoms, and some might say human rights. Now It’s becoming part of the debate: what property do we own here with respect to our data? And I think that those holes have produced really horrific outcomes, like not just on the monetization side, but on how we are programmed into wanting or thinking certain things. One of those things are products and services, whether those things are our own ideas about ourselves and our identity and our self-image, or whether it’s our viewpoint on the effectiveness of vaccines and science, and what political representative we think is in our best interests. You can no longer separate the technical work that we’ve done here with the web and our societal implications, and that’s the real zeitgeist challenge that I think we face at this moment. It requires some new ways of thinking about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’ve talked about some architectural adjustments that would get that will help get us there, one of one of those pieces of architecture i think is the hyperspatial markup language, HSML, that is part of your work at the IEEE, can you describe what HSML will help us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah, so just one quick parenthetical, and it’s a function of a little bit of us copying something. It is HSML, but it’s hyperspatial modeling language instead of markup language, although there was quite a bit of debate internally about whether that was an accurate description. The function of a market language and a modern language are different, but depending on your perspective, in this case it is about modeling at the heart of it. How do we model the world digitally in a way that is coherent with the way that humans cognize the world? And I provide that caveat because there are other ways of cognizing the world that we’re unable to be aware of, and that is not what our concern is with respect to what we need to teach machines or AIs. We need to ensure that they can cognize the world in a way that is similar, or compatible, or at least incorporates our understanding of reality. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What HSML does is it functions in a sort of semIOTic structure of forming the core elements, in which there are 12, that act like a language. So just like nouns, verbs, prepositions, and adjectives are sufficient components with which to construct descriptions and representation of reality that predominantly is all we’re using today. Like today I’m just using magic mouth sounds to paint pictures in everyone’s heads, and if I had it with squiggly lines it would do nearly as well. But if i could just do what we’ve been able to see some whales and some dolphins do which is actually just project an entire three-dimensional holographic representation of this particular bay, and the position of all the fish, kind of like a sonar snapshot, and just send that to you 20 miles away, “like hey the party’s over here, here’s where the fish are guys” that might be another way to communicate. So HSML enables multiple IOT devices to do what’s called sensor fusion, or data fusion, even policy fusion. So you can take information from sensors, we take information from databases, and you can take policy related information laws, or instructions, or whatever, and you can fuse those together into a multi-layered scene graph, which is a way of representing the information about any set of activities in any given space. All of the objects in the space, all the users in the space, all the activities in space, all the permissions in the space, and at the end of the day that it is intended to enable you to construct descriptions of states of things, and then describe workflows for what needs to happen, so you could conceivably program all the smart things in your house to work in a very certain particular way, one could inform another one, and this could then extend all the way out into the city, and so forth and so forth to the world at large. So the idea of making a standard here in the in many of the same ways that HTML allows us to structure content and information on pages, HSML lets us structure context and information in spaces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So I like that the modeling of context is a sign of something that sort of begun to happen, but without much organization. So when the web was new it was a new location, we would visit websites and we would go there and it was all about this new world and this new place, and honestly web 2.0 was a lot of that too. IOT starts to get a little interesting because now there’s this internet of things, but the things generally exist in real life and also on the internet, so it’s blending now between there. Of course now we’ve got augmented reality, and virtual reality, and a lot of things that pull that together, so when we think about all this stuff that in the real life that’s sort of blending together with a digital life that means like a proliferation of cameras and sensors and objects that we can interact with etc. So this means identity for everything, which is great. But there’s some implications here that the tinfoil hat wears among us, and I occasionally wear one of a particular shape. What are the implications of all of this interconnectedness upon the privacy we have and maybe governance that can help us with that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, so that was the question we started to ask ourselves back in 2016, which was all of that connectedness, all of that capability, all of that monitoring was going to happen anyway. Like that was the clear thing that was happening, so then the question became okay can you ensure certain levels of interoperability? And you need that in order to enable governance, if things are not interoperable you can make as many rules as you like, and it doesn’t it doesn’t matter. So what there’s a bit of a logical cake here, coherence is the first requirement, if you have coherence then interoperability is a function of your description of coherence. What is or isn’t coherent, like if you can describe the physics of the environment, and you want to say how you navigate through it, you can’t do it until you’ve done the first part. And then governance is a function of saying well what you can or cannot do are the ways that you must then navigate that environment, or who can when and what time and all sorts of all the parameters of activity management or activity governance. Because governance at the end of the day is really about changing states in the world. It’s not a theoretical function, it’s a practical function, and so that was what we saw as being really the scariest thing I’ve ever noticed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this cyber stuff is going to get all interconnected, you’re going to end up with this internet of everything. Which there was no term spatial web in that sense, the GIS community had been using it for many years, but not in the sense that we saw this multi-dimensional, multimodal sort of thing, it was like okay this internet of everything is going to happen, there are a handful of real challenges with that, including the possibility for abuse and looking at how wonderfully we did the web 2.0. this was just going to cascade into essentially black mirror, that’s what we’re all concerned about. So it was at that time that identity became clear to me that it was a fundamental infrastructural architectural requirement. Having been in telecom before that, and looking at telemedicine services, that was when I started looking at blockchain and the idea that you might need to own these assets related to your medical history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> I wasn’t interested in crypto in the beginning, Bitcoin seemed interesting, but not enough for me to buy any or care, blockchain looked really interesting, and this idea that you would own your sort of property. At that point I started looking for what kind of new identity structure, or what would become like a spatial web url, some sort of key identifier, and that’s when I came across the work that many of you on this call were pioneering. You were working on it before that of course, but also like right around that time, and that was a real eye opener, and it frankly made it possible for us to focus on the other bits. Because it was like this community is completely dedicated to the identity, in our version of this the human is one of those entities, or one of those actors, but every single object, including conceptual objects, can have a DID in the spatial web, and all of these are sort of structured using HSML, and some of these other ontology and taxonomy structures you’re looking at to maintain that coherence. That then grants you this ability to do governance, which gives you the second portion of this of the standard, which is called HSTP, which is hyperspace transaction protocol. What that does is it basically says “okay cool world give me all the information of the states of all these objects, users, actors,” and again they could be holographic objects in that space that that you otherwise wouldn’t be aware of, the IOT device isn’t going to pick that up, but the space knows that it’s there. You sent me something to this room so I could present it on this call as an example. I wanted to get this exact “xyz” position and I knew it was coming. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today one challenge is that you can send anything you want to my email address, I can’t stop you, you can come to my website, I can’t stop you, in fact you can send money to my eth wallet, and I cannot prevent that. But in the spatial web those everything is sort of permission based, and so that ability to then transport objects users activities and the governance around those is described in HSML, and essentially activated using HSTP, which says what are those states, i would like this state to change this way, or if the state changes what is or isn’t allowed in this case in this space, and HSTP says that transaction has passed or failed. So if only Heather is allowed to enter this room, if the temperature is x, and the time of day is y, and her facial expression or other biometric information says she’s in a certain state, all of which are just inputs that would be happening with any modern technology, but now could coherently say okay Heather’s at the right state the door can open and if she’s not then then the door remains closed. So this becomes you are able to program cyber physical activities, and define the governance for those if you were an authority of that space, and so that is the key sort of requirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>I think that it’s important that this doesn’t invent some brand new type of authority, but rather gives existing authorities the ability to express the rules about what they have authority over. So our house still remains our house, and I posit that we’ll have even more control over what’s actually going on in it from a digital perspective than we do today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes and so you could ensure that nothing is installed in your house, if it doesn’t make a certain threshold of some privacy standard, or that requires some certificate, if it doesn’t have it, it can’t it can’t be there, or it can’t turn on. The city could say drones are only allowed to fly in the city in these specific flight lanes, and if they have cameras on them those cameras are allowed to be on, but the drone cannot fly within five miles of the airport. it can’t have its cameras on when it’s flying over schools, or certain private properties, or certain zones, and all this can be spatially defined as if it were a video game. But now you can do it in the physical world in any digitally mediated set of functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>And that’s an incredibly powerful piece of this, so to switch gears just a little bit, we’ve talked about the blending of the digital and the real life thing, but with it with better technology that we’ve got for for things like virtual reality, you can now sort of have a spatially aware virtual thing, instead of a website that we’re looking at as a docent on a screen. So how do these same concepts apply in a pure virtual space? Where I might be in a fictitious world rather than in real life, and what’s the blend between the real and the virtual?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I love that question, so if you’ll allow me to nerd out for a moment, if you’ve seen the original avengers series of movies that marvel put out, there’s a moment where you get the arc of bruce banner and the hulk. It’s like when he can or cannot become the hulk, and everyone’s afraid he’s going to do it, in the final scene of the first avengers movie they’re like “Bruce get angry”, and he goes “that’s my trick I’m always angry”. So the the parallel here is that it’s actually always virtual, in one instance it must map to the physical world, in all other instances it doesn’t need to. So a harry potter world or the death star rendered in a 3d engine somewhere can have all the exact same authorities, and policies, and functions that apply. Vader is allowed to apparently strangle people at the helm of the thing, and Dumbledore, if he does something wrong the ministry fires him for a couple weeks, he’s got to go into hiding. So there are actually policies and things that exist in these virtual spaces, as we look at things like decentraland, and ownership, and NFTs, and assets and rights around this we’re going to need certain guarantees around what we can trust in these environments. How these authority structures are set up what is transparent, and and what we can investigate, what we can audit and so building property in a virtual world that you don’t ultimately have ownership of, or you can’t take those assets somewhere else, for example you don’t have any rights in roblox or fortnite they can do whatever they want, it’s a corporation they own it they can just change it, and change all your assets, change your skins, they can just flip the whole thing they can sell it, they can take the company public, there’s all kinds of other functions and interests at play. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if we expect and of course it seems natural that we’re going to want digital assets, they are becoming increasingly valuable, they’re also becoming increasingly more realistic, and to that degree at some point even experiences themselves will be indistinguishable from reality. Our senses are not that sophisticated, and you have people like Elon and others working on neural link, and others working on neural dust, that at some point are not going to require any sort of ocular interface. There’s not just a singularity of AI, there’s a singularity of reality that is a whole consideration that’s coming, so having certain guarantees around these environments will become increasingly important. This whole move with cryptocurrency, which is native internet money, and now NFTs, which are really smart assets, well not yet, they’re smart receipts to a virtual asset. I think DID’s really get you all the way across the line there, and HSML by the way would allow you to describe the asset in such a way that it would match up. So with the IDs in HSML I would know all these attributes down to color, texture, size or whatever is that version of that thing, and not just a receipt that says that I own something which could be copied a thousand times. A bit wondering of an answer but hopefully that hit a couple of notes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>No, that’s fantastic, so I want to draw something out a little bit. You sort of talked about how the same applies when I brought up this virtual versus real thing. You said real is the only instance where it actually needs to line up with reality and all these other things can exist virtually as well, that sounds like the metaverse has been talked about by a lot of folks and facebook audaciously renamed themselves to sort of try and own the space. What’s the difference here between the hyperspatial web that you see and the vision of the metaverse that facebook or other companies might be interested in offering?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Okay great question, so i think that i’ll try and provide a nuanced answer. I actually think everyone is making their best attempt to describe the same thing, which is an open and interoperable network. I think the battle right now is not for Facebook to become AOL, everyone’s seen this we’ve all seen this game before, like you don’t you don’t ultimately win with a closed version of this thing. In fact facebook thrives on an open web so that’s not a requirement that they sort of close their borders and they’re going to defend those borders, i think the battle right now is who’s the wordpress of the metaverse. Where are you going to go to build your sites, your stuff, who’s going to provide all the services, all the plugins, all that. So it’s not about Facebook changing their name to Meta and then saying we’re all about the metaverse, even though they’ve been the least arguably the least trustworthy brand in the modern era since I don’t know, Exxon. We go towards well they want to keep doing the same thing and making money the same way and that’s what Meta is for. I don’t actually think that, I think this is a massive pivot for the company, and that they’re doomed. I talk about this in the book. I don’t think that surveillance capitalism will be a profitable business in 10 years. I think it completely comes apart, look at GDPR right now saying google analytics is not going to work here anymore. That’s his web 2.0 getting smashed, these pillars are already coming down, and I think Mark Zuckerberg has seen this coming since the day he walked in to lucky palmers and put on something that was a space and realized that he had a company about a book. He must have said “oh it’s no longer about pages it’s about spaces” and we’re just seeing the arc of that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark wants an economy, he wants to build the largest economy with the largest amount of services to capture the most. Now people will willingly give over their data in order to optimize and maximize all kinds of inputs and data services around that. He doesn’t have to stay in that same game, and if he doesn’t get out of that game, while building hardware that’s capturing biometric information, the regulators are just going to keep squeezing and squeezing, and the laws and the walls are going to close in. So I don’t see a way out of this for surveillance capitalism-centered businesses, and I think actually that they’re smart enough to know that. This is why they already just announced last week, “hey we’re Twitter, everyone NFTs we have NFTs now” you can take them and move things around. You can build assets as well, say the asset I would like to move around is everything that you have about me, so let me NFT my data, and then I want to move it around, okay that’s what i would like. So I think that everyone’s still pointing in the same direction, and if you’re not, and you think that you’re gonna be the prodigy in aol, it didn’t work last time, but we’re gonna really give it a shot this time. So I just I think everyone’s smart enough not to repeat that play, but just like the oil companies and the automobile companies drag their feet as long as possible squeezing every dollar out of something that was causing arguable harm to the world, they still need to maximize the lens that they operate on, which is a fundamentally, their corporations with capital based goals. So now everyone ever wants an electric car, but it took someone like Elon and Tesla to just come in and change the whole game. So think that that’s what’s happening here, is that the battles for the wordpress of the spatial web or the wordpress of the metaverse, no one’s going to win being the siloed version of the metaverse where you don’t own any of your stuff. It’s going to be a wasteland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a fantastic answer, so we’ve talked about this vision and i think we all have a vision in our minds of what this looks like, we see even films depict this like Ready Player One for example does a really great job like laying out this universe of what it could possibly be like in the future. What’s less clear is how we get from today to there. What does this roll out actually look like? Is there a cut over? Is there a gradual way we get there? What’s this like?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well I mean I can only guess like the rest, but the hardware is the problem. So that’s why you’re seeing billions and billions of dollars being poured into that space, and more or less everyone is going there, so everyone wanted a smartphone. Does everyone remember the facebook smartphone that came out? That lasted like an hour. So Mark was very smart in jumping in on the VR thing when everyone thought that was just whatever, and Google said we’re going to play around in the AR space and their commitment has been soft. Two steps forward, one step back, and a lot of people in that community have not been happy about it, then Magic Leap emerged and said we’re gonna we’re gonna be the new Apple of this space. They said we only need a few billion dollars, and then “oh we spent it all” because it’s hardware and it’s absolutely the worst possible thing to work on, and it’s super hard. So you’re talking about innovation in battery life, innovation in optics, innovation in computing, and it’s just there’s so many pieces. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s like that smartphone moment again, which is why Apple just takes their time, and does the exact same thing they always do, waiting in the background so a lot of the froth is squeezed out and some of the core problems are solved, then they find their own path in. They’re like we don’t care about the metaverse, we’re not talking about the metaverse and they’re gonna come out with something different. But you’re gonna see four or five of these all start to really hit the market in a meaningful way, variations on AR and VR or hybrid sort of mixed reality devices or glasses. Then you’ve got Qualcomm, and others that are building chips now that have so much capability in them, AI powered chips with powerful spatial computing capabilities on it. So you’re gonna get 25 chinese companies that are making essentially the android versions of these things. I think by next year we’re going to see sort of that “iPhone 1” moment, and then that’s going to kick off the party. By the end of the decade, for some that can afford it, because the prices will go down you will have those early “Ready Player One” moments. Halfway into the next decade it seems like that’s the dominant thing so that’s the arc. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course one of the places we’re looking at, because we always tend to look at this through the consumer market lens, really where a lot of this is needed is in industrial spaces. In warehouses and ports, mining and agriculture, and that’s where the holographic part of this is only one layer, like you could think of the metaverse as sort of being the internet of experience. It’s a human-like interface layer of the spatial web while the internet of things is a machine interface. You having an experience where you go into a store, you grab some stuff, a bunch of cameras identify you and the object, and your account, and your wallet, and you walk out and it just charges you, that’s not a metaverse experience. That’s that you’re embedded in a mesh network of the internet of things, but from our lens that’s still the spatial web, and if then something popped up in front of you that gave you a holographic receipt and that was maybe that’s part of the metaverse. But if as you’re walking into the environment you’re seeing information displayed on top of all of the items saying “hey you’re gluten-free this week how about 10 off that”, that’s a metaversal layer on top of an IOT mediated experience. So you have to consider that component, that sort of digitization of the physical, and physicalization of the digital. These things are intersecting, and one sort of abstract point here is that, that’s what language is. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The experience that a deer has of the physics of a space is almost identical. The deer is in my living room. It can navigate that room better than I can, it understands the objects, but it doesn’t know what they are. But I’ve embedded the meaning, “oh that’s my couch, that’s my tv, that this is a picture of my family” it can see all those things, but it doesn’t know what they are. So I’ve embedded this virtual layer of meaning into the world, all these objects have terms, functions, and ideas. I know what they’re supposed to do. A monkey can still tell that it can sit on a couch, it understands the basic physics, it understands gravity, it can even understand the function of a couch, in that manner, but it doesn’t know whether that it might be meaningful socially to me whether it’s from Ikea or it’s from some fancy italian store. That’s a social virtual layer that humans, the human monkey has embedded into the world around us. We both configured it physically, like we shaped all this stuff, all these objects, but we’ve also added this whole virtual layer. Now we’re just doing it in a completely multi-dimensional way, so that the sort of digital twinification is putting those data sets onto the objects, and into the environment, and then we’re going into those sort of imaginary spaces that we put in our brains that we put into books we put in pictures we put into paintings we put into films. Now we’re just making them fully experiential. I think that’s that big shift, is moving from the information based web, to this experiential based web, whether that’s in the physical world or the digital world. Those blurred lines really create some new kind of digital environment and digital era. I don’t have a good word for it, that’s not a good word, forget it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a good start though. So you’ve implied that the roll out of the spatial web is not tied to the success in the hardware of augmented reality or virtual virtual reality hardware, meaning it can start sooner. So what does the rollout of the spatial web technologies look like as opposed to things that are tied to a VR or AR experience?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah what a good question. So well one of the things we just spoke about was it’s really the IOT first perspective. So in a warehouse you’ve got workers that essentially spend eight hours a day walking around 100,000 square feet trying to locate an item in a box. So what you do is you you build a three-dimensional map in your head, because some things are high, and something’s low, and some things are on the second floor, and then you get an order on your android phone it says go to row 17, isle 12 section l and grab item xj4-92. Okay where am I? You do all this three-dimensional triangulation, and then you route yourself. What we found is if you build a digital twin of that entire environment, and you map the inventory into every single location, so you now embedded the information into the space, you can take that same android phone and route that person to that location, and the cognitive load drops in half, and they basically speed up by 30 percent. The productivity, and performance, and actually the mental cost, the tax, we think about “oh people working hard for eight hours and now you’re making them more productive” there are some societal concerns about optimizing human activity in these environments, and there’s been some real concerns about how amazon is doing it, at the same time if you can reduce the cognitive load that’s actually the most expensive part for them, and so that’s one of the functions. So you’re building a three-dimensional twin you’re embedding the information into the environment, and you’re routing the human worker through that, now ultimately that human worker is hands and feet, because you’re no longer relying on the brain to do that much so the ability to then have humans and robots working in that same space or having humans in the day and robots at night or any combination thereof is a function of creating that shared model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> If there’s a shared model, whether it’s in the city and how how drones then decide are the certain flight lanes that they have, or or government policy that says in europe maybe the eu wants to say that the total flight height for all drones of a certain class is 120 meters, but in the netherlands they might want to say that it’s 100, and brussels maybe they say it’s 80, and as a drone passes through, it cannot ever go higher than 120, but as it goes through the netherlands and over the brussels it has to go down and then down. This is the machine’s view of the spatial web, and all of those capabilities and things are necessary right now, look at the supply chain, we had 500,000 cargo containers sitting off the coast here over christmas, and that’s because the ability for these systems to be able to communicate to each other is really poor, and our understanding of supply and demand globally is really bad. You have something like the pandemic hit and the butterfly fly effect is just happening all over the place and we’re not resilient enough to be able to adapt at this scale.&nbsp;So that’s really what the ultimate value of something like the spatial web means, adaptation. So it’s about the internet of experience over here on the metaverse side, the internet of things, this industry 4.0 narrative is about automation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s really the goal. Can we use machines and algorithms to automate physical functions in the system, and if you did that the impact on climate and the amount of carbon we’d be using would be hyper optimized, and we could set thresholds and regulations and the machines could adapt and adjust this. Instead something like the pandemic hits, we all go to Amazon and buy everything we ever wanted to buy because we can’t go anywhere, and then we just log jam every port in the world. This allows us to start to get a more holistic view, and the way that we start to look at the function of monitoring is not so much monitoring and surveillance, because those capabilities will be there, but if you use things like verifiable credentials, you use things like the IDs, and these get built into law and regulation, then we have we can have the ability to share this kind of information with each other. So you can set up a relay race of an adaptive supply chain, don’t send the automated truck until the thing arrives at the port, minimizing the total amount of carbon output. This adaptive thing is very much what organic systems do, this is how the body manages, you’ve got the autonomic nervous system, we need autonomous supply chains. These are the kind of functions that you can have in the spatial web which are absolutely critical, that are not about having an awesome virtual experience or or trying to sell a jpeg for a million bucks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’re claiming then that the world yesterday needs the spatial web, and that the visualization can currently be done, maybe in a 2d factor, or something like on a smartphone, or other flat screens that we have, and then as soon as the AR and VR get ready it’ll slide right into to that function for visualization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>That’s a really important point in this, in the warehouse we have an application that is multi-modal, and some people prefer just the audio, like with turn-by-turn instructions. Some people want to look at the map, some people prefer to hear it, some people want both, in our cases a lot of the workers are spanish so they want spanish audio. Generally they don’t want 3d, we started with 3d holograms, people were like “this is awesome, but i just need this” this is what’s most useful for me. So even this idea that “oh yeah 3d information is better and holograms are better”, we started doing that four years ago, and everyone was impressed and it was faster and easier, but it hurt to wear the headset for eight hours and the battery would only last three hours. So the hardware isn’t ready on that front, but cameras, AI, algorithms, and computer vision are ready to go, and so that’s a place where this is able to start. It’s really quite useful in some of these really critical environments that are far more relevant to our day-to-day lives and not so much in the entertainment or gaming or space. There’ll be education, we won’t be doing zooms like this, we’ll all be awkwardly sitting around a very large table, but there are functions today that are super meaningful for deploying the capabilities and use of the spatial web, and this is without even getting into any of the the broader needs around how DIDs can permeate, and self-sovereign identity is relevant in and of itself. Just like land title ownership by the dimensions this is going to end up being the domains of the spatial web, we will essentially be bound like boundaries. Your home is a domain, your property is a domain, the city’s a domain, today we think of domains as urls but domains in the spatial web are spaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Absolutely, so you’ve hinted at this a little already, which is really powerful. What do governments and companies do now to prepare for the coming spatial web?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I mean I think that there are a few groups that governments and researchers and regulators need to start becoming aware of. Predominantly that’s the work that’s being done around DIDs and DIDcomm, verifiable credentials, and the spatial web foundations working group at the IEEE. I think those are the critical components that you need to understand. I think that there is a more provocative branch off of this question, which is what role do governments play in virtual worlds? So it’s outside your jurisdiction, so what is legal or not not legal, and who says and how? So thinking about your geopolitical domain is one thing, thinking about people physically in your dimension that are experiencing something in another dimension that you have no jurisdictional power or authority over is a question. This ties into larger questions of governance, i mean Minecraft i think is eight times the size of earth. That’s big, that’s a big space, okay that’s one little world, you’re talking there’ll be thousands and then hundreds of thousands. There’s 300 million websites today, there’ll be billions and billions of these environments and spaces, at some point AIs will just auto generate whatever experience you want. Just start choosing adventure in real time based on biometric feedback, so the possibilities here are going to get really weird, really interesting. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chinese quote may you live in interesting times is sort of a double-edged sword. These are interesting times and so these are the kinds of questions. The last question I want to leave you with on this point is if Disney land or H&amp;M or whoever builds a store in decentraland, can I build a Disney store right next to the Disney store in decentraland? Who’s preventing it? Are they respecting the trademark and IP agreements of the United States? We will need treaties between organizations, countries on earth, and in these virtual worlds as if they were other planets. In the same way that we had to look at these challenges when we formed the league of nations or the united nations, we’re going to have other dimensions that we need to interact with that have entire economies that we trade in where the jurisdictions don’t apply. Then again who do you trust in those environments relative to what authorities? And so what prevents me from doing that in decentraland? Why can’t I sell Disney merch? or modify it with marvel or warner brothers stuff or whatever i like? So i think this is where trusts and guarantees around verifiability and credentialing of authorities becomes really critical, and if we’re going to digitize all of this, all of our reality in this next age, and all this money is flowing into the space, these are the kinds of big questions that we’re constantly thinking about and working on with respect to the standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, we are unfortunately out of time, but this has been great to hear your vision and thoughts around these things. Is there anything you’d like to leave us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, I think that the the role of identity is a fundamental pillar, and i think that in the the arc of history when we look at the role of property, and property rights, physical property rights, i just talked about intellectual property rights, data property rights, and digital asset property rights are are the next challenge. This is not a purely philosophical question, this is going to come down to law. So we need to start thinking of what does digital law mean in the 21st century? And making sure that the work we’re doing is addressing some of those questions, or hosting some of those conversations, I’d like to see more constitutional lawyers involved in these conversations. I’d like to see people that are really working through this sort of lens of data rights and ethics having these dialogues. That’s why I think that the next battleground is property rights, with respect to the function of data and the things that data form, which become these new hyperspatial objects in this next era.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, Gabriel, thank you for spending this time with us we’re we’re grateful for your willingness to be here. I hope everyone enjoyed this conversation and we’ll look forward to seeing you all in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  The attack on OpenSea users raises legitimate, valid questions about the security of web3 platforms that must be addressed if web3 is to survive &amp; reach mass adoption.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>By now, you may have heard about the attack on <a href="https://opensea.io/">OpenSea</a>, the world’s largest NFT (non-fungible token) marketplace, that resulted in roughly $1.7 million worth of NFTs being stolen from users’ wallets. The apparent phishing scam took place on February 19th, and some OpenSea users fell prey to it. </p><p>OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer took to Twitter on the 19th to explain the details the company knew at that point, denying direct responsibility for the hack: “As far as we can tell, this is a phishing attack. We don’t believe it’s connected to the OpenSea website. It appears 32 users thus far have signed a malicious payload from an attacker, and some of their NFTs were stolen.” </p><p>OpenSea later revised the original estimate of 32 affected users to 17, and clarified that some of the NFTs had been returned to their rightful owners, though by <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/02/23/2390008/0/en/UPDATE-Mintable-Recovers-NFTs-Stolen-in-OpenSea-Exploit.html#:~:text=While%203%20NFTs%20have%20been%20recovered%20and%20will%20be%20returned%20by%20Mintable%2C%20over%20a%20million%20dollars%E2%80%99%20worth%20of%20NFTs%20remain%20lost">some reports</a> about $1 million in assets are still unrecovered. </p><p>This attack raises legitimate, valid questions about the security of web3 platforms that must be addressed if web3 is to survive &amp; reach mass adoption. </p><p>In a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/31/success-of-web3-hinges-on-remedying-its-security-challenges/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAHZNOQLkIbdMdaa19R3WYV-CGFpWmBY396bPvAF5sATS6Fpai-XQSb_PU9ckqZSo7o8mdRCL5FB_UwqX-sV8upKGEDORCVQskmGwMaDbYTOcpaMeU6bzPU0-ZmE4M4gnidqN8ABfYAjx-9v5V7FOVPsUkq8l7EyZSKm5MwnU52i">TechCrunch article from January</a> titled “Success of web3 hinges on remedying its security challenges,” author Wei Lien Dang lays bare the security tradeoffs between Web 2.0 and web3: “The blockchain does not require actors to be trusted as in Web 2.0, but making updates to address security problems is harder. Users get to maintain control over their identities, but no intermediaries exist to provide recourse in the event of attacks or key compromises (e.g., how Web 2.0 providers can revert stolen funds or reset passwords). Wallets can still leak sensitive information like an Ethereum address – it’s still software, which is never perfect.” </p><p>Dang goes on to say “in Web 2.0, a substantial part of the security model is about response. In web3, where transactions cannot be changed once executed, mechanisms must be built in to verify if transactions should happen in the first place. In other words, security has to be exceptionally good at prevention.” </p><p>The TL;DR: because of the decentralized structure of web3, with users amassing more control of their identities, it’s crucial for platforms to focus on attack prevention, rather than solely on response, which is the previous Web 2.0 mode of handling security. </p><p>Web3 is growing in scope and popularity, and is no longer just a nascent movement populating quiet corners of the internet. As web3 gains momentum, underlying vulnerabilities are coming to light as malicious actors find ways to exploit them, as with the OpenSea attack. Vulnerabilities can stem from issues with authentication, key management, and a plain lack of user knowledge from which attackers can capitalize. Because transactions on the blockchain are irreversible, falling prey to an attack often has no positive resolution for victims. </p><p>Whether or not these security issues are just web3 growing pains or develop into larger, systemic problems remains to be seen. Much of that trajectory depends upon how developers, enterprises, and thought leaders in this space address these problems. Ultimately, if users who are educated enough in the web3 space to be buying NFTs fall for a sophisticated phishing attack, then how can we expect a nontechnical populous to participate in a new, decentralized web that’s supposed to be for everyone? </p><p>We want users to control their identities – to own their credentials, to stop trusting platforms with sensitive information – but enterprises, organizations, and individuals must take seriously the technological challenges posed by a growing web3 movement in order to fully realize that ideal end goal.</p><p>Fortunately, a community built largely by individuals with a passion for a decentralized digital landscape is addressing those vulnerabilities head-on. One such core challenge is privacy-preserving accountability, which NuID’s Trustless Authentication protocol provides. </p><p>In our next blog, we’ll define and explain how NuID provides privacy-preserving accountability to enterprises &amp; assists in furthering the goal of individuals’ self-sovereignty online. </p>

 Massachusetts has advanced its data privacy bill. 



<p></p>



<p>For the first time, the commonwealth has moved the Massachusetts Information Privacy Act beyond the committee stage.</p>



<p>As with all other states who have either passed data privacy legislation or have a proposed bill on the table, Massachusetts wants its citizens to have greater control over their personal information in the digital economy.</p>



<p>In progressing its bill, Massachusetts moves closer to California, Virginia, and Colorado, which have all passed state privacy legislation, although California’s updated law (<a href="https://www.caprivacy.org/cpra-text/">CPRA</a>), and the laws in&nbsp;<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+ful+CHAP0035">Virginia</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/2021a_190_signed.pdf">Colorado</a>, don’t take effect until 2023.&nbsp;All these laws restrict how businesses can collect and use the personal information of residents within the relevant state.&nbsp;</p>



<p>State-level pushes for comprehensive privacy bills have never looked stronger, with Maryland, Oklahoma, Ohio, New Jersey, Florida and Alaska also&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/01/4-major-data-privacy-trends-to-watch-in-2022/">likely</a>&nbsp;to pass laws in 2022.</p>



<p>Of course, the states continue to act in the absence of a&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/us-federal-privacy-legislation-tracker/">federal privacy law</a>, which appears to remain a long way off, locked in partisan divisions over the detail.</p>



<p>But the goal remains a single federal privacy law with streamlined compliance obligations for business and clear rights for consumers. Recent discussions have looked at what might be the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/10/the-us-data-privacy-law-floor-what-deserves-basic-protections/">minimum protections</a>&nbsp;of a national law, and survey results show&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/11/75-of-americans-want-national-data-privacy-standards/">75%</a>&nbsp;of all Americans want some data privacy standards at the national level.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>The organization that is ready to onboard pre-verified customers should pay attention to global identity networks.</p>
<p>The organization that is ready to provision, authenticate, authorize their employees, contractors, suppliers, etc. remotely and based on credentials verified by trusted service providers should pay attention to global identity networks.</p>
<p>The organization that is ready to manage identities with data minimization built into credential sharing, and transparent audit trails to check the validity of those credentials should pay attention to global identity networks.</p>
<p>Global identity networks propose a different way of identity management, one that operates on shared standards so that organizations <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/bc80792/providers-of-verified-identity" title="Global identity networks">don’t need to repeat onboarding and verification</a> with the same individuals, and one with verification built in so that organizations don’t need to rely on trust. But this post isn’t to explain global identity networks; if you’re curious about that, this <a href="https://gainforum.org/GAINWhitePaper.pdf" title="GAINforum Whitepaper">white paper</a> is a great place to start.</p>
<p>The question to ask is how to leverage them? The short answer is to get involved: participate in any number of the organizations that are designing the technical and governance architectures. Contribute to the conversation, join a PoC or a pilot where it fits your requirements. Join the cause as long as it also helps achieve your identity management or digital transformation goals. Collaborate, because we all have something to gain.</p>
 Where to Begin 
<p>Knowing where to start can be difficult, but understanding a bit of the context in which global identity networks are developing is a good place to begin. As is typical with a blog post, this is an oversimplified explanation, but the regulatory environment in Europe could soon make big waves in the identity community and beyond, complimented by the long-standing action from numerous organizations.</p>
<p>For those of you that European-based, you certainly are aware of eIDAS. For those who are not, the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG" title="EU Regulation on electronic identification">EU Regulation No 910/2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market</a> (most commonly referred to as eIDAS) sets out a common interoperability framework for Member States to accept the national eIDs and trust services (like electronic signatures) of other Member States to authenticate citizens when accessing public services. It may sound pretty dry, but it was a very clear attempt to facilitate a regional identity network, where identities could be issued by different identity providers and accepted by cross-border public services. In other words, eIDAS tried to facilitate a portable, reusable identity.</p>
 The Revision 
<p>Unfortunately, tried is an important word here. The uptake of eIDAS (facilitating cross-border acceptance of eIDs) is low relative to the technical capacity of states; <a href="https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/35274ac3-cd1b-11ea-adf7-01aa75ed71a1" title="eIDAS requlation requirements">only 15 of the 27 Member States</a> able to fulfil the regulation’s requirements of accepting the eIDs of other Member States for public services.</p>
<p>The EU Commission did reflect on the effectiveness of the regulation in its <a href="https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/35274ac3-cd1b-11ea-adf7-01aa75ed71a1" title="Impact Assessment">Impact Assessment</a>, and is developing a revision of it. There are multiple revision options being discussed, but thus far, the preferred option would establish a framework that provides citizens with optional use of a personal digital wallet. This could be used to access public and private services across EU borders. Provision of cross-border trust services is also part of the revision, but is out of scope for this post.</p>
 The Collaborative Action 
<p>Upping their digital identity game between 2014 up to the present (freshly 2022), EU Member States may now need to provide not only a digital identity to each of their citizens and residents, but also a personal digital wallet with which the individual can present to the public services of any other EU Member State. Why does a digital wallet make that big of a difference, and what does that have to do with you and global identity networks?</p>
<p>This could be a catalyst for reusable, portable identities in private industry, not just for public services. For consumer-facing businesses, that could mean inheriting a digital identity for a consumer at increasingly high assurance levels with even faster onboarding times and less responsibility for managing consumer data. It also means that onboarding your workforce digitally, and enabling other methods of high assurance authentication is available to more organizations. And it’s possible, even likely, that the basis of both consumer and workforce credentials would be based in an eID.</p>
<p>A digital identity wallet plays a big role in enabling the same individual to use their digital identity for multiple purposes. Instead of creating numerous accounts and being bound by usernames and passwords for each consumer and/or employee service, digital wallets put identity credentials that have been issued and verified by trusted parties into the hands of the individual to share as they please.</p>
<p>This concept starts to edge on decentralized identity, sometimes called self-sovereign identity (SSI). Digital wallets have been part of the decentralized identity conversation since the early days. But digital wallets are not exclusively the domain of decentralized identity, and benefits from the cooperation of many initiatives, organizations, and foundations that are globally working to promote interoperable, secure, privacy-centric, and functional identity standards for personal and enterprise use.</p>
<p>The following is just one example of how these identity networks and organizations are interconnected and support each other. There are many other projects besides identity wallets that tie these networks together. The order in which these organization are mentioned is arbitrary, and doesn’t denote any formal hierarchy.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/ssi-eidas-bridge/about" title="eIDAS Bridge">eIDAS Bridge</a> project which is supported by the European Commission and the European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework (ESSIF) is striving to make eIDAS available as a trust framework in the decentralized identity ecosystem. This means that there are now efforts from both sides of the spectrum: eIDAS may be revised to accept personal identity wallets and technological mechanisms such as zero-knowledge proofs and Verifiable Credentials. The European decentralized identity scene is also actively working to integrate eIDAS by enabling issuers to issue a VC “through” the eIDAS bridge to add additional trust to the credential.</p>
<p><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/EBSI" title="European Blockchain Services Infrastructure">European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI)</a>, also supported by the European Commission, Member States and Lichtenstein and Norway are aiming to establish a blockchain infrastructure for cross-border public services, and to enable information verification and trustworthy transactions. ESSIF and identity are a critical part of the first major pilot, which is to issue and exchange credentials between universities.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.digitale-technologien.de/DT/Navigation/DE/ProgrammeProjekte/AktuelleTechnologieprogramme/Sichere_Digitale_Identitaeten/Projekte_Umsetzungsphase/IDunion/IDunion.html" title="IDUnion">IDUnion</a> is also on the scene. It is a consortium of decentralized identity vendors and other influential partners, funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) and private investment. It is providing an open-source infrastructure to issue credentials, identify legal entities/natural persons/devices, and authenticate user and relying party. It aims to be available globally, but with governance remaining primarily European. It is designing its structure to align with the eIDAS revision, is compatible with <a href="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html" title="GAIA-X">GAIA-X</a> (a European-based secure data infrastructure project), and is working to improve interoperability with EBSI.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/" title="GLEIF">GLEIF</a> is also a part of this as a non-for-profit organization to manage the organizations who issue Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs). LEIs provide a unique identification for legal entities. It was establish to facilitate improved financial governance, but with potential for many other uses like authentication of relying parties, as is likely required in the eIDAS revision. GLEIF is part of Trust Over IP (ToIP), and uses ToIP’s governance framework and technology stack.</p>
<p><a href="https://trustoverip.org/toip-model/" title="Trust Over IP">Trust Over IP</a> is an independent project hosted at the Linux Foundation and lays out the governance model and a trust framework to provide Internet-wide digital trust. The main use cases they address with this trust framework are passwordless authentication, long-term private digital connections, and verifiable origins. This is a governance stack to complement the (often decentralized) technology solutions that are being developed.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://identity.foundation/" title="Decentralized Identity Foundation">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF) aims to and ensure an open ecosystem and interoperability for decentralized identity. DIF has contributed DIDs, DID authentication, and many other standards, wallet security, and much more related to implementing decentralized identity. They and ToIP <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/w3cdidspec/" title="ToIP and DIDs">both support</a> the Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) 1.0 specification being advanced to an official W3C Recommendation.</p>
<p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) develops technical specifications and guidelines, of which the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/" title="DID specification">DID specification</a> is a proposed recommendation. W3C carries the influence and respect to propose decentralized identity standards to the web community at large.</p>
<p>Though this took a turn into the decentralized world, the cooperation of other non-decentralized organizations are critical to test the interoperability and standards that are being developed. <a href="https://gainforum.org/" title="GAIN forum">The Global Assured Identities Network (GAIN)</a> proposes a federated identity network that would allow any organization to utilize verified identity attributes. It utilizes the international collaboration of financial institutions <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/deeper-dive-into-gain" title="Leverage trusted identities">to leverage the trusted identities</a> that are issued by those financial institutions for reuse in any industry.&nbsp;This project is in close collaboration with OpenID, Open Identity Exchange, the Cloud Signature Consortium, and GLEIF. While this is still in early stages of launch and development, GAIN may emerge as a parallel effort along with decentralized identity. Achieving interoperability can be achieved between such decentralized and federated global identity networks will be a monumental leap forward in enabling a verified, reusable identity for consumer, citizen, and workforce identity management.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cloudsignatureconsortium.org/" title="Cloud Signature Consortium">Cloud Signature Consortium</a> is working to establish a standard for secure and open cloud signatures, motivated in part by eIDAS goals to create a single digital EU market for trust services.</p>
<p>This is a very brief and simplified map of some of the most active organizations working for global identity networks. This is a space remarkably focused on collaboration and first enabling interoperability before striving for market share. Each organization has their own individual goals which dovetail with many of the goals of others, and even provide a critical technology or governance frameworks that help other organizations to achieve theirs.</p>
<p>Continue the conversation with us at the European Identity and Cloud Conference, May 2022 in Berlin.</p>

 The Launch of the Ontology EVM Fund Makes $10 Million in ONT/ONG Available to Enable Expeditions <p>As Ontology community members, we have chosen a life of adventure where we push the boundaries of what is possible. We are pioneers, explorers, choosers of the road less travelled. Now, looking to fund our adventures and fuel our journeys into uncharted lands, Ontology has created a $10 million (ONT/ONG equivalent) EVM Fund. The fund, which has been launched in celebration of the recent release of Ontology’s Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), aims to support Web3 developers building on Ontology.</p><p>We invite you to join us on what could be our greatest adventure to date, entering the Metaverse. Web3 will bring us together to game, invest, communicate, and innovate online. It will offer a world where we are self-sovereign and not simply a product which companies capitalize on by collecting our data. In the new era of the web, there can be a decentralized metaverse world where we have more control over our identity and our&nbsp;data.</p><p>Fueled by the new Ontology EVM Fund, we can make this vision a reality. We have made $10 million equivalent funding available to support suitable projects who are working towards creating an incredible Metaverse that is open and decentralized. Of course, success on a new planet is not only dependent upon finances. That is why further to the support offered by the Ontology EVM Fund, developers will benefit from a Fast, Accessible, and Secure public chain with a focus on Decentralized Identity and Data. Projects also benefit from the growing user base of <a href="http://onto.app">ONTO Wallet</a>, which already has over 800k users, and the flagship identity solution, <a href="http://ont.id">ONT ID</a>, which has been created over 1.5 million times. Ontology offers projects the opportunity to achieve exposure by top level media outlets and the opportunity to join the crypto conversation with some of the leaders in the&nbsp;space.</p><p>We think of these projects as spacecrafts, the driving force behind a shared mission and the stable vessel that holds collective explorers together. If you are one of these projects/spacecrafts, bring your crew to join us on an adventure. We have landing platforms prepared on Jupiter, Saturn, Venus, and Mars. Our ground crew is waiting to welcome you with the resources you need. Simply check out below to see which planet best suits your&nbsp;needs.</p><p>Should you possess an adventurous spirit, but not yet own a spacecraft and team, then do not fear. We have space on our public spacecraft where you can put your skills to use and be rewarded for your endeavors. These flights take you to Mercury and to the Moon, where you can take part in Bug Bounties and Hackathons. See the details&nbsp;below.</p><p>So how can we support your adventurous spirit? What can we do to make our journey a success? What awaits you when you land on your planet of choice. Whilst we only have limited space available, each selected project will be eligible for rewards to help them succeed. See the landing and flight plans&nbsp;below.</p><p>We are going to the Metaverse.

 Ontology Releases Ethereum Virtual Machine and Announces $10 Million Fund To Support Web3 Developers Building On&nbsp;Ontology <p>The EVM will increase interoperability and reduce migration costs for developers, allowing them to enter the Ontology ecosystem with lower gas fees and faster block production</p><p><a href="http://ont.io">Ontology</a>, the project bringing trust, privacy, and security to Web3 through decentralized identity and data solutions, has today announced the release of its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Seamlessly connecting the Ontology and EVM-based ecosystems, it will increase cross-chain interoperability, allowing EVM-based blockchain developers to migrate easily across ecosystems and seamlessly construct applications on Ontology.</p><p>To celebrate the release, Ontology has also announced a $10 million USD (ONT/ONG equivalent) EVM Fund to support developers building Web3/Metaverse decentralized applications (dApps) on Ontology. As well as receiving investment and the potential to access Ontology’s state-of-the-art protocols and tools, participating projects can receive tech, marketing, and business development support. Ontology will receive equity/tokens in the projects, enabling the synergistic growth of its interoperable ecosystem across a diverse array of projects.</p><p>Ontology’s EVM will reduce migration costs for developers, allowing them to enter EVM-based ecosystems on the Ontology blockchain. This will enable lower gas fees, as the Ontology EVM uses ONG as the gas fee for on-chain services, which usually costs 0.05 ONG per transaction. Developers will also benefit from faster block production.</p><p>Ontology’s multi-virtual machines make it the most VM supported blockchain, including <a href="https://docs.neo.org/docs/en-us/basic/neovm.html">NeoVM</a>, <a href="https://webassembly.org/">Wasm</a>VM and now <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/">EVM</a>. The latest virtual machine will help to connect thousands of developers building on Ethereum to the Ontology blockchain. These developers will be able to build rapidly with Ontology’s decentralized identity and data protocols.</p><p>As we move into the next iteration of the internet, decentralized identity solutions and privacy preserving technology are becoming increasingly important for the secure expansion of decentralized networks. Ontology’s EVM will facilitate the creation of privacy preserving technologies within a more mainstream developer group. These developers will be able to leverage <a href="https://onto.app/">ONTO</a> Wallet, the gateway for a seamless Web3 experience which has a base of 800K users, as well as <a href="https://ontid.ont.io/">ONT ID</a>, Ontology’s decentralized digital identity application which reached over 1.5 million users last&nbsp;year.</p><p>Commenting on the development Li Jun, Founder of Ontology, said: “As we migrate to Web3 we have an opportunity to create a safer, fairer, more decentralized internet. By launching our EVM, Ontology is contributing to this vision by increasing cross-chain interoperability, as well as expanding our decentralized identity solutions to mainstream developers within EVM-based ecosystems through our EVM Fund. The fund hopes to contribute to the creation of a decentralized, secure and fully interoperable metaverse. For this reason, it will put a specific focus on metaverse and Web3 projects. The Ethereum network is an essential connection for Ontology given its extensive support of smart contract creation and decentralized application development, not least its position as a leader within the DeFi space and its extensive portfolio of world class developers.”</p><p>The EVM will increase Ontology’s functionality by adding an Ethereum account system, Ethereum transaction types, and Web3 APIs. The existing Ontology chain native assets can be transferred to dApps on the EVM for circulation without redevelopment, allowing for the seamless continuity of Ontology’s ecosystem development.</p><p>Dr Kendall MAO, Chief Scientist at Ontology, said: “Since the completion of our EVM development in June last year, it has gone through rigorous checks to ensure that developers will experience a seamless, secure integration upon its release today. In September, we opened the EVM compatible public beta to developers across the world, as well as launching a bounty program in collaboration with renowned security experts, <a href="https://www.slowmist.com/en/">SlowMist</a>. Now fully audited, the machine will offer seamless interoperability to a host of new mainstream developers, as well as allowing them to enter the Ontology ecosystem with lower gas fees and faster block production.”</p><p>Any new or established dApp interested in the EVM Fund can apply and will be subject to evaluation from the Ontology community and team. Project submissions can be made through <a href="https://buidl.ont.io/">Ontology Community Forum</a>.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 RapidLEI support now live for new Common Data File formats driven by ROC, enhancing legal entity reference data available within the Global LEI Index 
<p>LONDON, UK – 1 March 2022 – Today, <a href="https://rapidlei.com/">RapidLEI</a> announced a major platform update to support new Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) format standards, as set out by the Regulatory Oversight Committee (<a href="https://www.leiroc.org/">ROC</a>) and the Global LEI Foundation (<a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/">GLEIF</a>). All Local Operating Units (LOUs) are required to support the platform changes within the month of March.</p>
<p>RapidLEI is a Ubisecure service, and is the leading global LOU for LEI issuance and data quality. These achievements are largely due to RapidLEI’s pioneering automated LEI issuance API, and a partner network that spans the world.</p>
<p>The GLEIF requires LEIs to be reported according to Common Data File (CDF) formats, in order to standardise how LOUs report LEI and reference data. The ROC, which oversees the Global LEI System (GLEIS), recommended the new policies for updated CDF formats, enabling new information to be reported within the LEI records. As of 1st March 2022, these formats are now required by the GLEIF in order to ensure uninterrupted access to LEI data.</p>
<p>One of the most significant changes to the CDF formats is the inclusion of <a href="https://www.leiroc.org/publications/gls/roc_20181030-1.pdf">legal entity events</a>, such as mergers, acquisitions, or entity name changes. This enriches the information available about an entity, for example removing potential previous uncertainty around whether name changes were corrected mistakes or intended alterations.</p>
<p>Another substantial change is the ability to report on complex groupings of entities – particularly <a href="https://www.leiroc.org/publications/gls/roc_20190520-1.pdf">fund relationships</a> and <a href="https://www.leiroc.org/publications/gls/roc_20201229.pdf">government entities</a>, which can both form composite networks. Entities will now be able to report beyond just parent companies, to provide information around relationships and structures.</p>
<p>Other new data offered in the updated formats include further available entity categories, resulting in fewer blank category entries, and foundation date, which will facilitate record de-duplication.</p>
<p>Steve Roylance, Senior VP Identity Services at RapidLEI and Ubisecure, said, “Since the LEI is primarily intended to increase transparency in financial transactions, the information available in the new CDF formats is valuable in enhancing that transparency further. RapidLEI is committed to GLEIF’s vision of legal entity identification enabling trusted business, so we’re excited to support these enhancements to the Global LEI System and the additional benefits they will bring to organisation identity use cases.”</p>
<p>Most of the new information will be added to the GLEIS when renewing, importing, or creating new LEIs from this point onwards. As LEIs are renewed on a yearly basis, the GLEIF anticipates a period of up to one year for the GLEIS to be fully populated with the new data.</p>

<p>Paul Kohlhaas, the co-founder of Molecule Protocol and co-author of VitaDAO on longevity research and the role of decentralization in&nbsp;science.</p><p>In this episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/voices-of-the-data-economy-learn-about/id1506212617">Voices of the Data Economy, </a>we spoke to Paul Kohlhaas, co-founder of <a href="https://www.molecule.to/">Molecule Protocol</a> and co-author of <a href="https://www.vitadao.com/">VitaDAO.</a> ​​VitaDAO is a community-owned collective funding early-stage longevity research. Paul Kohlhaas is an entrepreneur and economist with a passion for open-source utility networks. His drive for pharmaceutical innovation led him to found Molecule–a networked marketplace that enables the distributed R&amp;D and funding of new chemical intellectual property. In a chat with us, he spoke about the need for longevity research, IP-NFTs, DeSci, and more. Below are edited excerpts of the&nbsp;episode.</p><p>Why invest in longevity research and how can DAOs add&nbsp;value?</p><p>Longevity research and longevity therapeutics are the final frontiers of medicine. If we can stop the genetic ageing process in our body, we can also stop the onset of many diseases ranging from cancer to age-related diseases like Alzheimer’s. This would mean saving an enormous amount of cost across society. Developing longevity therapeutics is about how high medical costs typically associated with age can be&nbsp;reduced.</p><p>Most of the medical costs associated with a person’s life, typically happen in the last two to three years of their lifespan. Through the onset of age-related diseases, be cardiovascular disease or tumours developing in your body, or even Alzheimer’s, the question remains — could we offset the onset of those diseases by 10–20 years? The goal wouldn’t be to live up to the age of 150 but to have the same decline that we know today where one can’t move as fast anymore. How can we have a more productive and happy end of&nbsp;life?</p><blockquote>“Most longevity research that we know, is being funded by billionaires today. Longevity therapeutics haven’t really been in the purview of a pharma company and the reason for that is that aging is not considered a disease. If you want to develop a pharmaceutical or medicine and you want to take it through the classical pharmaceutical development pipeline — what you’re developing has to be considered a disease by the Food and Drug Administration in the US, or by the EMA (European Medicine Agency). However, aging has been in this weird field, where if you essentially develop a medicine that would prevent people from getting a disease, its not considered a treatable disease. This may actually change in the&nbsp;future.”</blockquote><p>There’s also a blossoming venture capital industry that is only focused on supporting biotech companies and researchers that are working on developing longevity therapeutics.</p><blockquote>“Even though there is a large research community for longevity, I think it’s been quite difficult for the general public to participate in that and to actually get involved. The biotech field always has this area of secrecy around it. Looking at it from the lens of a DAO, or a decentralized community, it can be really powerful in democratizing access to research and also democratizing involvement in the therapeutics that have been developed. It can avoid the risk of developing aging therapeutics in a monopolized way.”</blockquote><p>The ownership of IP in pharma and the role of blockchain</p><p>A large pharmaceutical company only has a few things from an asset perspective. It’s based on their intellectual property portfolios in the form of patents. It takes quite a long time to get a new medication onto the market. Once you have it on the market, there’s a long funnel, and it typically starts in academia in small research laboratories, where a researcher has an idea to treat new cancer therapeutically and begins on a path of obtaining funding to prove her thesis and drug development.</p><p>The other component of drug development is data production. Throughout the pharmaceutical development process, you need different entities that essentially finance data production. In return, you are distributing ownership of the IP gradually as you move along. Today, distributing ownership in the IP really happens through equity. Let’s say this researcher decides to create a biotech company and obtains some venture capital funding. The biotech company might file for a patent, and probably then a series of new discoveries will need more financing to begin researching and producing data about this IP. Those companies grow and move along, and typically at some point are acquired by a biopharmaceutical company. Typically the VCs that finance these companies are also backed by pharma companies.</p><blockquote>“The problem starts in a small lab in an academic institution and then goes all the way to these large companies. The IP essentially says, ‘Hey, here’s a new molecule, and it could be a viable cure for this disease, and then you produce data to solidify that thesis. The problem with that is that IP today in the form that it works is essentially a monopoly and if we contain IP within companies, those companies only have an incentive to show positive data. For example, if I’m a company backed by venture capital firms with a certain valuation — we only show positive data about this drug. At the point where a pharma company would then be interested in purchasing the IP or purchasing the biotech company. I don’t have an obligation to show you the negative data, I will only show you the positive data to learn so and so we could have run 50 studies on this on a particular drug or the IP and only two of them work. So 48 didn’t work, two of them work and one of them is maybe kind of inconclusive. So we’ll only show you the positive data. And then let’s say, this acid, this company, or this IP is now purchased, it goes into a pharma company. And the pharma company invests now, another says they purchased the company for $100 million.”</blockquote><p>What are IP&nbsp;NFTs?</p><p>The problem is the monopolization of IP and how we share data essentially creates a lot of inefficiencies in this entire drug development process.</p><blockquote>“We’ve been working on it in Molecule protocol and VitaDAO is really our first organization that has fully vilified that thesis and proven that the model could work. We’re essentially saying that we move IP out of these centralized organizations and move the IP into a more open structure where essentially fundraising around the IP is not tied to an individual organization, but you can distribute ownership to multiple participants. And those participants can now move in and out of the IP ownership and confirm the IP in a more decentralized way.”</blockquote><p>NFTs can really represent pretty much anything. IP, by nature, is a construct, it’s completely virtual. It is, for example, a relationship between two companies. It’s a right that’s granted between two companies or rights granted by the government, in the form of a patent. However, over the past 30 to 40 years, the IP landscape hasn’t really evolved and it’s very hard to transact an IP. NFTs could be, let’s say, technology carriers for IP.<br>In some cases, the creators of art NFTs, specifically remove media ownership from them, so that you actually don’t have any rights. But in other cases, the rights to the artwork are fully encapsulated within the&nbsp;NFT.</p><blockquote>“We’re using the same technology to essentially attach on one side full legal rights to an underlying intellectual property asset, for example, the discovery of a new molecule — we’re attaching that to an NFT. But then on the other side, what we’re also attaching to the NFT are essentially all of the raw data assets that now come with this molecule.”</blockquote><p>So going back to the original example of a researcher at an academic institution — she can now attach the IP rights in her biotech company to an NFT. At the same time, also attach all of the raw data, let’s say, like the pre-clinical data, the studies that she’s running in the laboratory — she could attach that also to the NFT. The NFT encapsulates those IP rights and then the NFT can be purchased by cancer research staff. This cancer research by purchasing the NFT actually begins funding her research and her work. This way you could move the IP now into a decentralized community of other researchers, or scientists across the world of investors, and the funding community.</p><p>Fractional NFTs: The next interesting thing that VitaDAO is looking at doing is essentially taking those IP NFTs and then making them fractional again.<br>What does one mean by making NFTs fractional? This means essentially, now, you could create a million tokens of this NFT. And you could now open them up to community ownership. Say we need some additional research studies done on this particular drug that we’re looking at. If a researcher comes in and does them, then they get let’s say X amount of ownership in the NFT. You can also now create a public&nbsp;market.</p><p>The demand and supply dynamics of&nbsp;DeSci</p><p>There are biotech companies and biotech VCs and angels that work in different research areas, that are actively looking for IP constantly and then there are interesting researchers. To date, there’s no good way to transparently find and discover the IP where this research was discovered.</p><blockquote>“I think it’s very powerful to enable researchers to obtain funding in a seamless way but also to put them back in control. Through the systems and frameworks that we’re building, researchers have more control over what happens to the IP that they’re developing. The same actually goes for the universities that are involved in this. If a researcher is approached by a pharma company, the pharma company obviously has much more control over what’s going to happen next If they’re really interested in wanting to finance this. So Web3 in that sense levels the playing field making processes more transparent and more democratic.”</blockquote><p>Here is a list of the selected time stamps on the different topics discussed during the&nbsp;podcast:</p><p>1.15–8.30: Why invest in longevity research?

<p>Pricing matters — it’s often one of the first things to consider when adopting a new&nbsp;product.</p><p>That’s why we value transparency not only when it comes to building Magic, but also iterating on pricing. Thanks to all of the helpful feedback from the community, today we’re excited to introduce new and improved pricing&nbsp;plans.</p><p>Since we launched metered pricing (based on logins) last summer, we heard from developers across different sized teams that this model made it harder to predict costs. With that in mind, our new pricing is based on monthly active users, and adds clarity to how you and your teams can make the most out of&nbsp;Magic.</p><p>Before we share more insight into why we’re updating pricing, let’s cover what’s&nbsp;new.</p><p>Note: if you’re an existing Magic customer, these new pricing plans won’t impact your account immediately (and we will be grandfathering in&nbsp;perks!).</p> Our new&nbsp;plans <p>The changes to <a href="https://magic.link/pricing">Magic’s pricing</a> make it simple and straightforward to choose the plan that’s most tailored to your&nbsp;needs.</p> Builder plan <p>With Builder, you’ll get 1,000 free monthly active users and 100 free login text messages per month. This plan also gives you access to all login methods, access to all 20 <a href="https://magic.link/docs#blockchains">blockchains</a> to build a dApp, low-code login form, and User Settings, in addition to the ability to add a custom logo and&nbsp;theme.</p><p>For budding startups or indie devs diving into a fun hack project, the Builder plan is a great way to get started with Magic for&nbsp;free.</p><p>Want unlimited monthly active users and text messages? Easily upgrade from the dashboard; add your credit card to keep scaling worry-free. After the first 1,000 MAUs free every month, it’s $0.05 per additional MAU. Similarly, for SMS login, after the first 100 texts are free every month, <a href="https://magic.crisp.help/en/article/sms-pricing-1y7u2ck/?bust=1646078799953">market-rate</a> surcharges apply per&nbsp;text.</p> Enterprise plan <p>With Enterprise, you get everything in Builder, plus premium features: multi-factor auth, custom session length, custom email providers (SMTP), additional team seats, and priority support. Volume-based discounts make the Enterprise plan a great fit for customers serving over 20,000 monthly active users. Our Sales team will partner with you to discuss a custom pricing agreement.</p> The “why” behind these&nbsp;changes <p>From conversations with developers and teams of various sizes, we learned the pros and cons of the legacy pricing&nbsp;model.</p><p>As a result, we aimed to keep the “best of” and added key benefits:</p>  Free to get started — 1,000 MAUs free, no credit card&nbsp;required  Suits your needs — whether you’re an indie dev or a large organization  Pay as you grow — self-serve upgrade to unlimited MAUs and login text&nbsp;messages  Predictability — unlock volume-based pricing and custom pricing agreements   What you can&nbsp;expect <p>We are rolling out new pricing for new users on March 1,&nbsp;2022.</p><p>All existing Magic customers will remain on their current plans and will not need to take any action. Our aim is to make the migration as seamless as possible. Over the coming months, we’ll continue giving existing customers a heads-up on the perks that will be grandfathered in, plus the summer migration planned via email and in the Magic dashboard.</p><p>Have questions or input regarding the new plans? We’re all ears and more than happy to help. Contact <a href="https://magic.crisp.help/en/">Support</a> on our site&nbsp;anytime.</p><p>We can’t wait to see the dApps you&nbsp;build.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/new-pricing-based-on-monthly-active-users-733793b09aa3">New Pricing based on Monthly Active Users</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
