 Dawn of the DID: Part&nbsp;3  Embracing the Digital Identity Revolution <p>In today’s digital age, our online identities are as integral to our lives as our physical identities. Yet, as we navigate the vast digital landscape, the security and sovereignty of these digital selves often feel just out of reach. Enter blockchain technology, a beacon of hope in the quest for a secure and autonomous digital identity, promising a future where we hold the reins of our online personas.</p><p>Blockchain is not just a technological innovation; it’s a paradigm shift in how we manage and protect our digital identities. By offering a decentralized and immutable ledger, blockchain technology introduces a new era of security, privacy, and user control. This marks the beginning of a revolution, one where our digital identities are both safeguarded and truly our&nbsp;own.</p> Understanding Digital&nbsp;Identity <p>Our digital identity is an amalgamation of all the digital footprints we leave behind — email addresses, social media profiles, and even our online shopping habits. These bits of data paint a picture of who we are online but are scattered across the vast expanse of the internet, often under the stewardship of various online platforms. The challenge here is twofold: ensuring the security of this scattered identity and reclaiming control over how it’s used and by&nbsp;whom.</p><p>In the traditional setup, our digital identities are not fully in our control. Instead, they’re often managed by central authorities or platforms, making them susceptible to breaches, misuse, and privacy invasions. This centralized approach not only poses significant security risks but also strips individuals of their privacy and control over their own identities. The need for a shift towards a more secure, user-controlled identity system is&nbsp;clear.</p> Blockchain to the&nbsp;Rescue <p>Blockchain technology emerges as the hero in the narrative of digital identity, offering a solution that is as secure as it is revolutionary. With its decentralized nature, blockchain acts as a digital ledger that is distributed across a network, rather than being stored in a single location. This not only makes it nearly impervious to hacking but also ensures that no single entity can claim undue control over the system. The implications for digital identity are profound, promising a future where our online selves are both protected and autonomous.</p><p>The decentralized approach of blockchain brings the power back to the user, offering a level of security and privacy that centralized systems simply cannot match. By storing identity data across a network, blockchain makes unauthorized access and identity fraud exponentially more difficult. Moreover, it gives individuals the ability to manage and control their own digital identities, marking a significant step towards a future where online privacy and user sovereignty are the norms, not the exceptions.</p> The Mechanisms of Blockchain in Digital&nbsp;Identity <p>Blockchain secures digital identities through cutting-edge technologies like public-private key encryption. Imagine sending a locked box through the mail, where the recipient has the only key; this is the essence of public-private key encryption. The public key is widely available, allowing anyone to encrypt information, but the private key is held only by the recipient, ensuring that only they can decrypt and access the information. This mechanism is at the heart of blockchain’s ability to secure digital identities, ensuring that only the rightful owner can access and control their identity.</p><p>Smart contracts further enhance the security and efficiency of digital identities on the blockchain. These are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into lines of code. Smart contracts automate and secure transactions, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing the potential for fraud. This technology not only streamlines transactions but also fortifies the trust and integrity of digital interactions, making blockchain an indispensable tool in the management of digital identities.</p> Real-World Applications and&nbsp;Benefits <p>The practical applications of blockchain in managing digital identities are as diverse as they are transformative. From securing personal medical records to ensuring the integrity of online voting systems, blockchain technology is already reshaping how we interact with the digital world. These applications not only demonstrate blockchain’s versatility but also highlight its potential to enhance security, privacy, and trust in digital transactions. By providing a secure platform for managing digital identities, blockchain paves the way for more efficient, transparent, and user-centric online services.</p><p>Beyond its practical applications, blockchain offers profound benefits for individual users. It empowers users with greater control over their personal information, ensuring that they decide who has access to their data and how it is used. This shift towards user-centric identity management represents a significant move away from the vulnerability and lack of control that characterize traditional digital identity systems. With blockchain, users enjoy enhanced privacy, reduced risk of identity theft, and a newfound sense of agency over their digital&nbsp;selves.</p> Empowering Users Through Blockchain <p>Blockchain technology doesn’t just protect; it empowers. By enabling the concept of self-sovereign identities, blockchain allows individuals to own and directly control their digital identities without the need for intermediaries. This empowerment extends beyond mere control over personal data; it fosters a digital environment where trust is built into the system, and users can engage in transactions with confidence. The impact of such a shift is profound, offering a blueprint for a digital society where privacy, security, and individual autonomy are paramount.</p><p>The empowerment provided by blockchain is a catalyst for innovation, opening doors to new ways of interacting in the digital realm that were previously unimaginable. From streamlining financial services to revolutionizing how we verify credentials and qualifications, the potential for growth and development is limitless. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, so too does the landscape of digital identity, promising a future where our online lives are not only secure but also more seamlessly integrated with our physical realities.</p> The Future Is Decentralized <p>As we stand on the cusp of a new era in digital identity management, the role of blockchain technology cannot be overstated. It heralds a future where the security, privacy, and control of digital identities are not just improved but reimagined. The journey toward a decentralized digital world is filled with promise, offering a vision of the internet where trust is inherent, and user empowerment is the standard. The path forward is clear: a future where our digital identities are as secure, sovereign, and uniquely ours as our physical&nbsp;ones.</p> Join the Revolution <p>The blockchain revolution is here, and it’s redefining what it means to own your digital identity. We invite you to dive deeper into the world of blockchain, explore its potential, and become part of the movement towards secure, decentralized digital identities. Whether you’re a seasoned expert in the realm of Web3 or just starting to explore the possibilities, your voice and your actions can help shape this exciting future. Together, we can build a digital world that respects privacy, security, and individual autonomy. Join us in paving the way toward a more secure, decentralized digital&nbsp;future.</p> A Quote or Thought to&nbsp;Ponder <blockquote>“In the end, it’s not the technology that changes the world; it’s how we use&nbsp;it.”</blockquote><p>As we embrace the possibilities that blockchain technology brings to digital identity management, let’s remember that technology is a tool — one that, in the right hands, has the power to transform lives, societies, and the world at large. The future of digital identity is not just about securing data; it’s about empowering individuals, fostering trust, and building a digital world that values and protects the identity of every user. As we move forward, let’s use this powerful tool to create a legacy of empowerment, security, and trust — a legacy that future generations will thank us&nbsp;for.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/blockchains-role-in-digital-identity-40e8b646a2fc">Blockchain’s Role in Digital Identity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Written by Fission's <a href="https://github.com/bgins">Brian Ginsburg</a> and <a href="https://zee.town/">Zeeshan Lakhani</a> and published on March 27th, 2024.</p><p>The <a href="https://everywhere.computer/">Everywhere Computer</a> is a decentralized platform that aims to distribute computational tasks across a vast, open network. This network spans from your personal machine to other devices on your LAN, a cluster of cloud nodes, and even to PoPs (points of presence) located at the edge of the Internet. Processing happens as close to the data source as possible, scheduled on nodes with general capacity or those with specialized capabilities like high-powered GPUs.</p><p>At its core, the Everywhere Computer is built on the <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg">InterPlanetary Virtual Machine (IPVM)</a> protocol. It executes workflows containing tasks that are content-addressed—which means they're uniquely identified by their content rather than by their location. This system is powered by nodes running Fission's <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/homestar/">Homestar runtime</a>, an engine that runs WebAssembly (Wasm) based workflows composed of <a href="https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/">Wasm components</a> with runnable functions that can be scheduled and executed by any Homestar peer throughout the network.</p><p>Beyond the sandboxing, portability, and predictable performance benefits of Wasm, we're excited about orchestrating workflows and state machines composed of modules compiled from different source languages and bringing them together into workflows where the output of one task feeds into the input of another. Composing components in a workflow lets users focus on component interfaces without considering interactions between multiple languages.</p>Tasks that wrap functions are published by content identifier (CID), and distributed and executed by nodes running Homestar<p>With the Everywhere Computer, we're all in on <a href="https://youtu.be/dhoVlVu2XAw?si=x1YIQk-9Jkg_FphP">"the return of write once, run anywhere"</a> as a motto, but with content-addressing and our focus on caching and replayability of previously computed tasks, we can go a step further and say:</p><blockquote>Write once, run once, and never run again (everywhere!)</blockquote><p>This post will introduce authoring Wasm components and functions for the Everywhere Computer. Wasm components can be written in <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-guest-languages">several different programming languages</a>— including C/C++, Java (TeaVM Java), Go (TinyGo), and C#—but we'll focus on Rust, JavaScript, and Python for this post. We'll be writing functions in each of these languages, compiling and packaging them as Wasm components, and bringing them together into a workflow that executes on our compute platform. Along the way, we'll introduce Wasm component tooling, the Homestar runtime, and <a href="https://docs.everywhere.computer/everycli/">EveryCLI</a>, which provides a convenient interface for running Homestar with a gateway for preparing and executing workflows.</p><p>The Everywhere Computer is in beta. The <a href="https://github.com/everywhere-computer">GitHub repositories</a> and <a href="https://docs.everywhere.computer/">docs</a> are publicly available and open-source licensed. We have a closed beta group to provide high-quality support and to gather feedback. <a href="https://everywhere.computer/">Sign up</a> for the beta group. We would love to hear what you are working on and what ideas you have for using the Everywhere Computer!</p><p>This post is a high-level overview that can be used a companion to the code in the <a href="https://github.com/everywhere-computer/writing-functions-blogpost-2024">everywhere-computer/writing-functions-blogpost-2024</a> repository. We won't cover every detail in this overview, so clone this repository if you would like to follow along.</p> Background: Wasm components, WIT, &amp; WASI logging <p>Evolution within the Wasm ecosystem is happening at a wicked fast pace, particularly now that the <a href="https://youtu.be/phodPLY8zNE">path to Wasm components</a> has been streamlined and standardized, module-to-module interop is trivial.</p><p>In the Everywhere Computer, we decided to use the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/CanonicalABI.md">Canonical ABI</a> to convert between the values and functions exposed by components written using the Component Model and those provided by <a href="https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/">Core WebAssembly</a> modules instead of imposing a custom ABI upon our users. A component is just a wrapper around a core module that specifies its imports, internal definitions, and exports using interfaces defined with the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/WIT.md">Wasm Interface Type (WIT)</a> IDL format.</p><p>Unlike core modules, components may not export Wasm memory, reinforcing Wasm sandboxing and enabling interoperation between languages with different memory assumptions. For example, a component that relies on Wasm-GC (garbage collected) memory compiled from a dynamic language can seamlessly interact with a component compiled from a static language using linear memory.</p><p>The Everywhere Computer strives for <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/">simplicity</a>. By adopting the Component model and its tooling (for example, <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cargo-component">cargo-component</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen">wit-bindgen</a>), we can run workflows combining components from different languages without handling arbitrary Wasm modules or introducing custom tooling, bindgens, or SDKs for our ecosystem.</p><p>In addition, while our Homestar runtime utilizes alternate formats as internal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_representation">intermediate representations</a>, by adopting WIT, we can <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/homestar/tree/main/homestar-wasm#interpreting-between-ipld-and-wit">interpret</a> between WIT values and other data models at runtime without exposing these internal formats to function writers.</p> Embedding Wasmtime <p>The Homestar runtime embeds the <a href="https://docs.wasmtime.dev/">Wasmtime</a> runtime to execute Wasm components associated with tasks in a workflow. The Wasmtime runtime is built and maintained by the <a href="https://bytecodealliance.org/">Bytecode Alliance</a>. It provides multi-language support and fine-grained configuration for CPU and memory usage.</p><p>Wasmtime is at the forefront of the Wasm ecosystem, which includes their support of the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) stack that recently reached <a href="https://blog.sunfishcode.online/wasi-0-2/">WASI Preview 2</a>. WASI gives library developers and implementers like us lower-level primitives for working with files, sockets, and HTTP with a stable set of common interfaces to build on.</p><p>Some of the other platforms and frameworks that have adopted Wasmtime include <a href="https://wasmcloud.com/blog/wasmtime-a-standardized-runtime-for-wasmcloud">wasmCloud</a>, <a href="https://www.fermyon.com/spin">Spin</a>, and <a href="https://www.fastly.com/products/compute">Fastly Compute</a>.</p> WIT <p>In the following sections, we will use WIT interfaces to define the types of our functions and a <a href="https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/design/wit.html#worlds">world</a> to describe the imports and exports associated with each Wasm component. Then, we will implement the interfaces in Rust, JavaScript, and Python.</p><p>WIT provides built-in types, including primitives like signed/unsigned integer types, floats, strings, and more interesting and complex types like results, options, and lists. WIT also provides a way to define custom, user-defined types like records, variants, and enums. Homestar supports all of these WIT types internally (except <a href="https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/design/wit.html#resources">resources</a>, which we do not permit in guest code) when translating between other formats and data structures.</p> WASI Logging <p>EveryCLI reports logs executed by guest programs running on the Homestar host runtime. To emit log messages, Homestar implements the proposed <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-logging/tree/main">WASI logging WIT interface</a> which exposes the <code>log</code> method to function writers for integration into their programs. As we'll demonstrate later in this post, when you call <code>log</code> in your guest code, EveryCLI will display logs in a console at a specified level of verbosity and with contextual information.</p><p>In addition, EveryCLI provides detailed information that reports workflow events and runtime execution errors.</p> Writing Functions <p>In this post, we will write arithmetic operations in each source language to keep our example code simple. Our Rust program will perform addition and division, the JavaScript one will perform subtraction, and the Python program will perform multiplication. We will use division to show division by zero error reporting.</p><p>Our functions will be compiled into Wasm components using tools from or built upon the excellent work of the Bytecode Alliance. The Wasm component ecosystem is evolving quickly, so keep in mind that the techniques described in this blog post may be out of date. We'll provide links so you can check on the latest developments.</p><p>Clone the <a href="https://github.com/everywhere-computer/writing-functions-blogpost-2024">writing-functions-blogpost-2024</a> repository if you would like to follow along. The repository includes instructions for installing dependencies, tooling, and compiling components for each language. We will use <a href="https://docs.everywhere.computer/everycli/">EveryCLI</a> to run workflows that call the functions in these components.</p> Rust <p>For writing a function in Rust, we will use <code><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cargo-component">cargo component</a></code> to generate a Wasm component.

Let's run these functions together in some workflows!</p><p>Install <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@everywhere-computer/every-cli">EveryCLI</a>, and then we'll write a workflow:</p> <code>npm i -g @everywhere-computer/every-cli
</code> <p>Homestar and the Everywhere Computer currently use <a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/how-to/command-line-quick-start/">IPFS Kubo</a> as a content-addressed storage layer for Wasm components. In the near future, we'll support other forms of distributed storage.</p><p>EveryCLI starts a gateway that loads Wasm components onto IPFS, prepares workflows, and calls on the Homestar runtime to schedule and execute them.</p><p>EveryCLI provides a simplified workflow syntax that it uses to prepare the underlying workflow. Let's start by using <code>math.wasm</code> in <a href="https://github.com/everywhere-computer/writing-functions-blogpost-2024/blob/main/workflows/add.json">a workflow</a> to add two numbers:</p> <code>{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "run": {
        "name": "add",
        "input": {
          "args": [3.1, 5.2],
          "func": "add"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
</code> workflows/add.json<p>A workflow is an array of tasks that we would like to execute. Each task is given a <code>name</code>, which will be used to reference results in subsequent tasks. Our task <code>input</code> includes the name of the function to execute and its arguments.</p><p>Let's run this workflow! Start EveryCLI with <code>math.wasm</code> as an argument:</p> <code>every dev rust/target/wasm32-wasi/release/math.wasm
</code> <p>EveryCLI starts a gateway that we can query for a JSON Schema representing the WIT interfaces in <code>math.wasm</code> at <code>localhost:3000</code>.</p><p>Post the workflow to the gateway:</p> <code>curl localhost:3000/run --json @workflows/add.json
</code> <p>The response reports the result of adding <code>3.1</code> and <code>5.2</code> as <code>8.3</code>.</p><p>In addition, EveryCLI has passed along logs from the Homestar runtime:</p>Logs on running the add workflow<p>The logs report information about workflow execution and include our WASI logs. Our WASI log reports <code>"3.1 + 5.2 = 8.3"</code> with the category <code>guest:rust:add</code>. WASI logs always have the <code>wasm_execution</code> subject.</p><p>We can also see workflow settings, fetching resources (our Wasm components), initializing, starting, and completing the workflow. The "resolving receipts" log shows that Homestar is looking for cached results so it can avoid work where possible. The "computed receipt" log reports the <a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/content-addressing/">CID</a>, a content identifier derived from the content's cryptographic hash, of the receipt from the add computation. EveryCLI returns the workflow result, but the computed receipts can be also used to pull results directly from IPFS by CID.</p><p>If we post the workflow to the gateway again, we see a different set of logs:</p>Logs on replaying the add workflow<p>This time we don't need to do any work. Homestar cached the receipts from our last run and reports that it is replaying the workflow and its receipts.</p><p>Notice also that our WASI log does not show up. WASI logging happens only on execution, not replay. We'll see in a moment how we can force re-execution to always see WASI logs.</p><p>Let's try <a href="https://github.com/everywhere-computer/writing-functions-blogpost-2024/blob/main/workflows/all.json">a workflow</a> that uses all four arithmetic operations from our Rust, JavaScript, and Python-sourced components:</p> <code>{
  "tasks": [
    {

        "input": {

        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
</code> workflows/all.json<p>In this workflow, each task except the first receives input from the previous task. For example, <code>subtract</code> awaits the output of <code>add</code> by using <code>{{needs.add.output}}</code> as a placeholder that will be filled in when <code>add</code> has completed.</p><p>Restart EveryCLI, passing in all of our Wasm components:</p> <code>every dev rust/target/wasm32-wasi/release/math.wasm javascript/output/subtract-j54di3rspj2eewjro4.wasm python/output/multiply.wasm --debug
</code> <p>The hash of your subtract Wasm component may be different. Check <code>javascript/output</code> for the appropriate file name.</p><p>We use the <code>--debug</code> flag this time to force re-execution of the tasks in our workflow. The <code>--debug</code> flag lets us see our WASI logs on every run while we are developing our functions, but it should not be used in production because it eliminates the benefits of caching.</p><p>Post this workflow:</p> <code>curl localhost:3000/run --json @workflows/all.json
</code> <p>The response reports a result of <code>5.98</code> which looks close enough for computer math!</p><p>Our WASI logging reports each operation:</p>Logs on running all operations workflow<p>We can see WASI logs from each component, labeled by category as <code>guest:rust:add</code>, <code>guest:javascript:subtract</code>, <code>guest:python:multiply</code>, and <code>guest:rust:divide</code>.</p><p>Lastly, <a href="https://github.com/everywhere-computer/writing-functions-blogpost-2024/blob/main/workflows/division_by_zero.json">a workflow</a> that attempts division by zero to check our error reporting.</p> <code>{

The second error is an execution error from the Wasm runtime. It's a bit inscrutable, but we can see "not able to run fn divide" which tells us which function failed.</p> Conclusion <p>In this post, we have introduced the Everywhere Computer and how you can get started writing functions and workflows for it.</p><p>So far, to execute workflows, we've used <code>curl</code> to POST manually constructed JSON workflows to the gateway.

<p>Here’s the situation: You’re the CIO or similarly empowered representative of an organization. Different voices within your business are calling attention to the awesome scalability and power of hyperscale computing, which you’ve also noticed with increasing interest. Now the word comes down from on high that you’ve been tasked with designing and implementing your company’s hyperscale computing solution—whatever that should be.</p>



<p>Your organization already has an ambitious agenda in mind for whatever<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/infrastructure"> IT infrastructure</a> you wind up choosing. The company is working with extremely high volumes of data and expects this situation to continue or grow. So, you’ve got a ton of assets earmarked for <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-storage">data storage</a>, with many more workloads on the way.</p>



<p>Your business isn’t expecting this data to collect dust in a vault, either. Company leadership is already trumpeting new <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-management">data processing</a> applications and how smoothly already favored apps will be integrated into the new, high-performance system. Still others are wowed by the promise of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/automation">automation</a> that hyperscale data centers offer.</p>



<p>For these reasons, there’s a lot of positive support for going ahead and building a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/hyperscale-data-center">hyperscale data center</a>, customized expressly for this business. However, that’s just one set of opinions.</p>



<p>Other leaders remind you that the company’s primary allegiance is to the bottom line and that your solution needs to be cost-effective and “thread the needle” by providing the most return for the least investment possible. These voices forcefully advocate using a colocation solution, where your company will instead rent space in a hyperscale data center, thus saving USD millions or even billions in construction costs and other associated charges.</p>



<p>Both options offer compelling arguments for their adoption. So, hyperscale vs. colocation—which do you choose?</p>



 Big systems, costly decisions 



<p>When deciding between building hyperscale data centers or renting in colocation data centers, there are many variables for hyperscale customers to consider. To effectively weigh the decision, one must consider the total costs of ownership versus renting—plus a range of other, tangentially related issues.</p>



<p>Both <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-centers">data center</a> options have their advantages and disadvantages. Both options deliver complex <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/saas">Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)</a> solutions. Both are based on complicated <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/infrastructure">digital infrastructures</a> and depend on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/virtualization">virtualization</a>, the underlying concept of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-computing">cloud computing</a>.</p>



<p>To make the smartest decision possible, it’s important to first focus on each option, and check out their advantages and disadvantages.</p>



 What is a hyperscale data center? 



<p>Hyperscale data centers represent <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-storage">data s</a>torage on a gigantic scale. According to the Independent Data Council (IDC) definition of a hyperscale database, as reported by <a href="https://www.viavisolutions.com/en-us/what-hyperscale-data-center">VIAVI Solutions</a> (link resides outside ibm.com), to be considered a true hyperscale data center, it must contain at least 5,000 servers and occupy at least 10,000 square feet of physical space. There is no hard-and-fast guideline concerning energy usage, although most hyperscale data centers use somewhere between 100 megawatts (MWs) and 300 MWs.</p>



 Components that go into building a hyperscale data center 



<p>It’s not an overstatement to say that creating an on-premises hyperscale data center from the ground up is a major endeavor—one that will require deep pockets and considerable effort. Even a simple listing of basic components provides a sobering idea of the project’s overall complexity and pricing:</p>



 
 A tract of land that can support a structure of at least 10,000 square feet. 



 Development costs to survey the land, clear the site and prepare it for construction. 



 One structure with at least 10,000 square feet of floor space. It should be built sturdily enough to support normal operations as well as withstand normal building “wear and tear,” plus any relevant local conditions, such as extreme weather situations or even geological occurrences. 



 Fire-safety equipment that is sufficient for protecting the building and its operators, such as sprinkler systems and extra extinguishers, as well as the development and instruction of fire-safety Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). 



 A parking lot of sufficient size to support the number of vehicles used by data center operators, as well as ample parking room for any emergency vehicles that might be needed. 



 Cooling system equipment to offset the immense heat generated by 5,000 servers operating 24 hours per day. 



 Specialized water lines and piping to support the cooling system. 



 Dedicated and reinforced power lines and equipment to safely handle massive electrical loads. 



 Back-up power systems in case of mainline outages. 



 At least 5,000 servers. 



 Metal (or wooden) racks for housing 5,000 servers. 



 Associated IT equipment. 



 Reinforced cabling to connect 5,000 servers. 



 Networking equipment to connect 5,000 servers. 



 Telecommunications (telecom) equipment. 



 Specialized firewalls and other protocols for enhancing the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cybersecurity">cybersecurity</a> of data centers. 
 



<p>Keep in mind that this list is in no way comprehensive and doesn’t represent the full costs associated with building a hyperscale data center. For example, it doesn’t include the primary asset needed for such activities: electricity. Nor does it mention the complicated and possibly expensive agreements that will need to be struck with local governments and communities. The list does, however, suggest how complex and multi-faceted this undertaking can be by showing that what’s being constructed is nothing less than a full-scale data factory.</p>



 What is colocation? 



<p>Some organizations are interested in the power and potential of hyperscale computing but have no wish to build their own data center, especially once they see a breakdown of all associated costs.</p>



<p>The concern of such companies is understandable and legitimate; the sums of money required to operate in this space are not small. Depending on the facilities constructed, some use cases will require USD millions or even billions. Businesses building hyperscale data centers do have to maintain deep pockets—both when they construct the facility and then during its entire operation. A hyperscale data center should not be considered a one-time purchase.</p>



<p>Colocation, on the other hand, is simply a situation wherein one company owns a hyperscale data center and rents out its facilities, servers, bandwidth and/or space to interested businesses that presumably do not have their own data center facilities.</p>



<p>The obvious benefit for the company renting space in the off-site data center is that doing so saves it from having to make its own large-scale investment into a hyperscale data center. Viewed another way, what the company is, in fact, purchasing when it rents out data center space is flexibility. By opting for colocation, the company can delay the significant investment in a hyperscale data center until a later time, keeping its cash reserves right where they are.</p>



<p>There’s even a specific term for when smaller companies make a gradual entry into this market— retail colocation, which allows organizations to start slowly. Typically, this plays out like this: The company sets up servers within a colocated environment and starts getting the feel for the process. Then the business begins experimenting with different cloud deployments, trying on different configurations and checking them for fit.</p>



<p>So, colocation (and retail colocation) allows businesses to enjoy the benefits of hyperscale, without the major investment required to make it happen. On the other hand, nobody’s going to let a company use their hyperscale data centers for free, as anyone trying to negotiate such an arrangement soon learns. Further, since you’re renting these facilities, you should probably accept the fact that a colocated data center will not provide the same perfect “fit” as custom-built hyperscale data centers.</p>



<p>Regardless of whether you choose to build a hyperscale data center or rent space through a colocated data center, organizations usually need to designate someone as an integrator to shepherd the project across all possible hurdles and into completion.</p>



<p>For the purposes of this blog post, the integrator is you.</p>



 Hyperscale vs. colocation: Biggest misconceptions 



<p>It’s interesting that at such a “modern” time as this, when whole new vistas of computing are opening up, that some people’s attitudes are still trapped in old ways of thinking. For example, when you see the phrase “buy or rent,” certain longtime assumptions can still come to mind:</p>



 
 Renting options are primarily provided for those who can’t afford to make purchases. 



 Persons or organizations purchasing items can afford such purchases. 



 Renting options are primarily provided for those subject to frequent moving around. 
 



<p>While the first two statements contain some measure of truth, the only statement that’s fully true is the final bullet point. Renting options, it turns out, are indeed perfectly designed for people whose work keeps them in constant motion and relocating to different areas.</p>



<p>So, there’s validity to the third bullet point. The first two contain various levels of validity.</p>



<p>Let’s take the second bullet point first. While it is true that most people and companies can afford the purchases they make, you can’t always bank on it. We’ve seen example after example of companies, families and individuals who were supposedly wealthy—until it was suddenly discovered that they weren’t. Bottom line: Without seeing a verified financial balance sheet, there’s really no way to know what’s going on with a company or a person and who can afford what.</p>



<p>But it’s the first bullet point that can be most misleading because it could definitely be a valid business strategy for a company to avoid building hyperscale data centers and instead rent colocation facilities and services. Businesses have to walk a complicated financial line and part of that is keeping enough cash in reserves. Hyperscale data centers can cost USD millions or even billions to build and operate, quickly turning a thriving company cash-poor because of the massive commitment it has made to this technology.</p>



 Who are colocation’s biggest users? 



<p>Prepare to be surprised, because some of the world’s biggest users of wholesale colocation services are actually Amazon (AWS), Google and Microsoft. Actually, each of the “Big Three” data center providers either currently rent out some of their space from other colocation providers or have done so in the past. For example, members of the “Big Three” have leased significant data center space from a company called Equinix, which owns and runs 260 data centers in 71 markets. Then, these cloud service providers turn around and rent out their newly acquired space to users.</p>



<p>That this practice occurs should surprise no one; most economies function using mid-level distributors that are instrumental in moving goods or services from Point A to Point B. Still, based on their collective clout in this market, it is intriguing that some of the world’s largest providers of data center infrastructure are also some of its biggest customers.</p>



<p>Not that there’s any shortage of external data center customers. The market is sizzling hot right now and has been for a while now. For example, Synergy Research Group reported in April 2023 that the first quarter of that year saw a USD 10 billion jump over Q1 2022 <a href="https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/q1-cloud-spending-grows-by-over-10-billion-from-2022-the-big-three-account-for-65-of-the-total">spending on data centers</a> (link resides outside ibm.com).</p>



<p>Most recently, there has been a perceptible shifting of corporate assets among giant companies to enable their concentration on establishing data centers. As <a href="https://www.costar.com/article/1327223979/microsofts-cloud-computing-income-soars-paving-way-for-more-data-centers">real estate</a> analyst CoStar (link resides outside ibm.com) reported in October 2023, “While Microsoft and other tech giants such as Google, Meta and Amazon have made deep cuts to their once-vast office portfolios, they have increased spending on development of data centers.”</p>



 Things to consider when deciding between hyperscale and colocation 



<p>For companies who are strictly compelled by the bottom line, the matter routinely comes down to the simple comparison: Which is the cheaper alternative? But divining the answer to that rather complicated question usually involves a number of areas of comparison, some involving tangible quantities but others based on various intangibles that usually come into play and which should be considered:</p>



 
 First, assemble all the projected costs you can related to the building of a hyperscale data center to serve your company. 



 Next, try to carefully imagine and gather all the annual costs related to operating the type and size of hyperscale facility you have concepted. Remember to factor in the cost of needed labor, even if it’s just a skeleton crew, as well as any security staff kept on-site. 



 The next part of your due diligence is to repeat the last step, but this time, project the annual operating costs of using a colocated data center. And don’t be surprised to learn that even though this type of solution requires no construction costs, there may still be imposing start-up fees involved with working with this technology. 



 At this point, you should possess enough data to run time-based comparisons for various intervals, so you can answer that original question about which is the cheaper alternative. 
 



 Questions to ask 



<p>However, by this point, you will have surely realized that when it comes to data centers of this magnitude, a bottom-line comparison doesn’t tell the entire story. There are many questions and considerations to entertain. Before any organization selects either of these solutions, it would be wise for it to engage in a bit of serious soul-searching about what kind of company it seeks to be, both now and in the future:</p>



 
 What kind of organization do you have? If you’re part of the IT industry, that may affect your decision-making, because this technology directly targets the IT industry. If you’re at an IT company, it may be in your interest to go ahead and invest in a hyperscale data center. 



 Are you sure you can handle the costs? Hyperscale data centers are currently a “hot item,” and some businesses will base their decision on desire, instead of need. But, because we’re talking about such a sizable and ongoing investment, some extra forethought is warranted. 



 What level of control do you wish to maintain? If your organization has a “hands-on” culture that is apt to making constant tweaks to the system, you may want to build your own hyperscale data center. This will more easily enable any customization your business desires. 



 How concerned are you about <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/sustainability">sustainability</a>? Hyperscale data centers consume huge amounts of power, often more than the villages or towns near them. Although it’s not impossible to hyperscale and avoid leaving a heavy carbon footprint, it may be more difficult. 



 What new technologies do you want to incorporate? It’s essential to envision not only where your company wants to be tomorrow but also down the road. Will the solution you select let you incorporate emerging technologies, such as the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/internet-of-things">Internet of Things (IoT)</a>? 
 



 The real bottom line 



<p>As you’ve probably already figured out, there are few quick or easy answers when it comes to deciding between building a hyperscale data center or renting space from a colocated data center. There are simply way too many issues at work to make a casual decision one way or the other.</p>



<p>It might even be such a weighty decision that you need more than one person to help make the call. If so, the integrator may need additional staff to help divide up and tackle the different decision areas that require extra study. For example, you may need to assign a staff member to handle any ecological impact statements that will need to be drafted and submitted before a building site can be legally cleared for construction.</p>



<p>As for parting advice, make sure you do your homework in full. The stakes of this decision are very high indeed. Not only are we discussing vast sums of money, we’re also talking about issues that have a direct and perhaps lasting bearing on an organization’s fiscal health. Therefore, when feasible, get the freshest data that exists. Create contingency plans defined according to data-center-performance levels. You must be thorough in your thinking and cover every angle possible. That’s how you’ll draft a blueprint for success—no matter which type of system you choose.</p>

<p>The rising interest in the calculation and disclosure of Scope 3 GHG emissions has thrown the spotlight on emissions calculation methods. One of the more common Scope 3 calculation methodologies that organizations use is the spend-based method, which can be time-consuming and resource intensive to implement. This article explores an innovative way to streamline the estimation of Scope 3 GHG emissions leveraging AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) to help categorize financial transaction data to align with spend-based emissions factors.</p>



 Why are Scope 3 emissions difficult to calculate? 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/scope-3-emissions">Scope 3 emissions</a>, also called indirect emissions, encompass greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) that occur in an organization’s value chain and as such, are not under its direct operational control or ownership. In simpler terms, these emissions arise from external sources, such as emissions associated with suppliers and customers and are beyond the company’s core operations.</p>



<p>A 2022 CDP <a href="https://cdn.cdp.net/cdp-production/cms/reports/documents/000/006/918/original/CDP-Supply-Chain-Report-2022.pdf?1678870769">study</a> found that for companies that report to CDP, emissions occurring in their supply chain represent an average of 11.4x more emissions than their operational emissions.</p>



<p>The same study showed that 72% of CDP-responding companies reported only their operational emissions (Scope 1 and/or 2). Some companies attempt to estimate Scope 3 emissions by collecting data from suppliers and manually categorizing data, but progress is hindered by challenges such as large supplier base, depth of supply chains, complex data collection processes and substantial resource requirements.</p>



 Using LLMs for Scope 3 emissions estimation to speed time to insight 



<p>One approach to estimating Scope 3 emissions is to leverage financial transaction data (for example, spend) as a proxy for emissions associated with goods and/or services purchased. Converting this financial data into GHG emissions inventory requires information on the GHG emissions impact of the product or service purchased.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.epa.gov/land-research/us-environmentally-extended-input-output-useeio-models">US Environmentally-Extended Input-Output (USEEIO)</a> is a lifecycle assessment (LCA) framework that traces economic and environmental flows of goods and services within the United States. USEEIO offers a comprehensive dataset and methodology that merges economic IO analysis with environmental data to estimate the environmental consequences associated with economic activities. Within USEEIO, goods and services are categorized into 66 spend categories, referred to as commodity classes, based on their common environmental characteristics. These commodity classes are associated with emission factors used to estimate environmental impacts using expenditure data.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://knowledgebase.envizi.com/home/managed-emission-factors-eora-mrio-multi-region-in">Eora MRIO (Multi-region input-output)</a> dataset is a globally recognized spend-based emission factor set that documents the inter-sectoral transfers amongst 15.909 sectors across 190 countries. The Eora factor set has been modified to align with the USEEIO categorization of 66 summary classifications per country. This involves mapping the 15.909 sectors found across the Eora26 categories and more detailed national sector classifications to the USEEIO 66 spend categories.</p>



<blockquote>However, while spend-based commodity-class level data presents an opportunity to help address the difficulties associates with Scope 3 emissions accounting, manually mapping high volumes of financial ledger entries to commodity classes is an exceptionally time-consuming, error-prone process.</blockquote>



<p>This is where LLMs come into play. In recent years, remarkable strides have been achieved in crafting extensive foundation language models for natural language processing (NLP). These innovations have showcased strong performance in comparison to conventional machine learning (ML) models, particularly in scenarios where labelled data is in short supply. Capitalizing on the capabilities of these large pre-trained NLP models, combined with domain adaptation techniques that make efficient use of limited data, presents significant potential for tackling the challenge associated with accounting for Scope 3 environmental impact.</p>



<p>Our approach involves fine-tuning <a href="https://youtu.be/Beh13Cd_QbY?si=6K4-aX1lVxrIAwri">foundation models</a> to recognize Environmentally-Extended Input-Output (EEIO)&nbsp; commodity classes of purchase orders or ledger entries which are written in natural language. Subsequently, we calculate emissions associated with the spend using EEIO emission factors (emissions per $ spent) sourced from <a href="https://knowledgebase.envizi.com/home/managed-emission-factors-supply-chain-greenhouse-g">Supply Chain GHG Emission Factors for US Commodities and Industries</a> for US-centric datasets, and the <a></a><a href="https://knowledgebase.envizi.com/home/managed-emission-factors-eora-mrio-multi-region-in">Eora MRIO (Multi-region input-output)</a> for global datasets. This framework helps streamline and simplify the process for businesses to calculate Scope 3 emissions.</p>



<p>Figure 1 illustrates the framework for Scope 3 emission estimation employing a large language model. This framework comprises four distinct modules: data preparation, domain adaptation, classification and emission computation.</p>



Figure 1: Framework for estimating Scope3 emissions using large language models



<p>We conducted extensive experiments involving several cutting-edge LLMs including roberta-base, bert-base-uncased, and distilroberta-base-climate-f. Additionally, we explored non-foundation classical models based on TF-IDF and Word2Vec vectorization approaches. Our objective was to assess the potential of foundation models (FM) in estimating Scope 3 emissions using financial transaction records as a proxy for goods and services. The experimental results indicate that fine-tuned LLMs exhibit significant improvements over the zero-shot classification approach. Furthermore, they outperformed classical text mining techniques like TF-IDF and Word2Vec, delivering performance on par with domain-expert classification.</p>



Figure 2: Compared results of different approaches



 Incorporating AI into IBM Envizi ESG Suite to calculate Scope 3 emissions 



<p>Employing LLMs in the process of estimating Scope 3 emissions is a promising new approach.</p>



<blockquote>We embraced this approach and embedded it into IBM® Envizi™ ESG Suite in the form of an AI-driven feature that uses a NLP engine to help identify the commodity category from spend transaction descriptions. </blockquote>



<p>As previously explained, spend data is more readily available in an organization and is a common proxy of quantity of goods/services. However, challenges such as commodity recognition and mapping can seem hard to address. Why?</p>



 
 Firstly, because purchased products and services are described in natural languages in various forms, which is why commodity recognition from purchase orders/ledger entry is extremely hard. 



 Secondly, because there are millions of products and service for which spend based emission factor may not be available. This makes the manual mapping of the commodity/service to product/service category extremely hard, if not impossible. 
 



<p>Here’s where deep learning-based foundation models for NLP can be efficient across a broad range of NLP classification tasks when availability of labelled data is insufficient or limited. Leveraging large pre-trained NLP models with domain adaptation with limited data has potential to support Scope 3 emissions calculation.</p>



 Wrapping Up 



<p>In conclusion, calculating Scope 3 emissions with the support of LLMs represents a significant advancement in data management for sustainability. The promising outcomes from employing advanced LLMs highlight their potential to accelerate GHG footprint assessments. Practical integration into software like the IBM Envizi ESG Suite can simplify the process while increasing the speed to insight.</p>

<p>As AI technology advances, the need for high-performance, cost-effective and easily deployable solutions reached unprecedented levels. EclipseStore, a groundbreaking data storage platform from <a href="https://microstream.one/">MicroStream</a>, is revolutionizing the development of cutting-edge software applications. IBM® collaborated with MicroStream to integrate the IBM WebSphere® Liberty InstantOn feature within EclipseStore. This combination empowers developers to build highly scalable Java applications that deliver unparalleled performance, while substantially minimizing infrastructure expenses.</p>



<p>Exciting new innovations such as advanced robotics, real-world gaming, neuronal interface technology and AI require three fundamental elements:</p>



 
 High-performance solutions. Java is 1000 times faster than today’s database systems. While programming languages like Java offer microsecond processing speeds, external database servers that have been utilized for data processing over the past 40 years, are 1000 times slower with millisecond processing speeds. 



 Simple implementation that enables faster time-to-market. Often, programming languages and database systems are incompatible. An impedance mismatch creates a significant issue with far-reaching consequences. Programming languages like Java have incompatible object models with today’s database-specific data structures and formats. Consequently, mapping objects to database-specific models, converting data and generating objects for each query result in expensive latencies of up to 100ms or more, even when retrieving data from cache. 



 Low infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs are skyrocketing. Users rely on performance-enhancing solutions such as distributed caches, in-memory data grids and searching servers to reduce latencies. However, this leads to skyrocketing cloud costs due to inefficient data processing and the need for resource-consuming cluster solutions. Consequently, traditional databases lag behind and hinder modern software applications. 
 



<p>There is no doubt that the database server concept has been proven over decades. However, comparing it to Java, which is 1000 times faster than traditional databases, is like using a steam engine in a spaceship solely because it is a proven technology.&nbsp;</p>



 EclipseStore enables high performance and saves 96% data storage costs 



<p>EclipseStore was built to eliminate this problem by introducing a revolutionary data storage concept that is tailor made for cutting-edge software solutions, but also can boost classic enterprise applications.</p>



<p>EclipseStore enables data storage by synchronizing any Java object graph of any size and complexity seamlessly with any binary data storage such as AWS S3 or IBM Cloud® Object Storage. With EclipseStore in the architecture, a traditional database system becomes superfluous. Unlike all database systems, EclipseStore really stores the native Java object model 1:1 as it is. This leads to exciting user benefits:</p>



 
 High performance: Data is cached and processed in-memory. Queries are executed up to 1000x faster than comparable SQL queries. The highest data processing speed can be achieved with the with the Eclipse OpenJ9 JVM that powers the Semeru Runtime® JDK. Expensive mappings or data conversion as well as resulting latencies are eliminated. 



 Convenience and high developer productivity: Implementing, testing, deployment and maintenance becomes much simpler as just core Java features are used. 



 Database cost savings: Cloud object storage such as IBM Object Storage is up to 96% cheaper than any database in the cloud, while IBM even takes care for backups, high availability and security.&nbsp; 
 



<p>EclipseStore is developed as an open-source project at the Eclipse Foundation and is well-integrated with modern Java runtimes such as Spring Boot, MicroProfile and WebSphere Liberty/Open Liberty®.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Elastic scalable EclipseStore apps with WebSphere Liberty InstantOn 



<p>For developing distributed, horizontally highly scalable EclipseStore apps, MicroStream provides an EclipseStore cluster as a fully managed cloud service that lets users fully automate and scale-out their apps and microservices on higher loads and vice-versa to scale-in up to zero on decreasing loads to save infrastructure costs. Clusters can be setup, configured, run and monitor with just a view clicks so that users don’t get in touch with Kubernetes or other complex cloud technologies. Users also benefit from the enterprise-grade security and support.</p>



<p>With EclipseStore, MicroStream Cluster and InstantOn, our customers like Allianz are now able to build and run fully automated elastic scalable Java applications and microservices in the cloud. By using this stack, our customers benefit from ultra-fast realtime data processing, microsecond response and query times and save up to 96% database costs in the cloud.</p>



 Java is great, but startup time has been too slow 



<p>Creating a fully automated and scalable application that can handle any workload on-demand may sound enticing, but it presents significant complexities and challenges, especially with Java. One crucial requirement for a well-elastic and scalable cluster is the quick startup time of new cluster nodes to avoid latencies. While containers can be launched in milliseconds, Java apps take longer due to the warm-up time required by the JVM’s JIT compiler.</p>



<p>This potential setback could have hindered the entire MicroStream Cluster concept. To address this issue, the MicroStream engineers explored and evaluated three different concepts and a solution with Liberty InstantOn that enables rapid startup times for new cluster nodes, driving optimal performance and minimizing latencies. This technical solution addresses the complexities associated with Java startup times, which allow for the development of highly scalable and efficient applications in the cloud.</p>



 
 Static cluster model: A static cluster model is a configuration where the number of nodes within a cluster remains fixed and does not dynamically adjust based on workload or demand. In this scenario, the startup time of individual nodes is of secondary importance. Adopting this approach would allow the construction of an EclipseStore cluster, marking it as the first milestone of the project.&nbsp; 



 Proactive scaling: Proactive scaling is effective for creating a dynamically scalable cluster, even with slow-starting nodes. New cluster nodes can be launched in advance to mitigate long JVM startup times when anticipating increased load. However, this approach has drawbacks. During sudden and unexpected load spikes, a pre-scaled cluster may not respond quickly enough if resources are already fully utilized, resulting in performance degradation. Accurately predicting load spikes is complex, and this approach may lead to unnecessary costs as resources may be activated when not immediately needed. Nevertheless, proactive scaling is more cost-efficient than a static cluster model and works well for systems with slight load fluctuations but may not be suitable for systems with frequent and significant load changes.&nbsp; 



 GraalVM native images: GraalVM enables the creation of native executables, which start in milliseconds through ahead-of-time compilation of Java code. Oracle promises significantly faster startup times (up to 50x) and smaller memory footprints (up to 5x), which is impressive. This opens up the possibility of creating dynamically scalable Java applications with native images. However, native images come with several drawbacks, including longer build times, increased build complexity, limited compatibility with other frameworks, limited reflection support and the absence of dynamic class loading. While larger native image sizes may be acceptable, the complete loss of JIT compiler runtime optimizations would be particularly problematic for EclipseStore users as it would slow down the entire in-memory data processing with Java. 
 



 InstantOn: the drop-in fast startup solution 



<p>The benefits of using Liberty InstantOn for developing elastic and scalable EclipseStore apps are significant. With Liberty InstantOn, provided by MicroStream, users can easily scale their applications and microservices in a fully automated manner, both on higher loads and during decreased loads to save on infrastructure costs. Setting up, configuring, running and monitoring clusters is simple and efficient, without the need for complex cloud technologies like Kubernetes. Additionally, users can enjoy enterprise-grade security and support.</p>



<p>By leveraging this technology stack, customers like Allianz can build and run fully automated elastic Java applications and microservices in the cloud. The stack offers ultra-fast real-time data processing, microsecond response and query times, and up to 96% savings on database costs. While Java’s startup time can be slow, Liberty InstantOn provides a solution by enabling quick startup times for new cluster nodes, ensuring optimal performance and minimizing latencies. With Liberty InstantOn, customers can build highly scalable applications in the cloud without having to choose between startup time and the dynamic features and compatibility of Java.</p>



<p>With EclipseStore and Liberty InstantOn, you can unlock the potential for ultra-fast data processing and significant cost savings in the cloud.</p>

Introduction: Towards Decentralized Artificial Superintelligence <p>Speed of AI. With the release of the latest LLMs, the pace of innovation in AI has noticeably accelerated from its already fast pace. It’s now a torrent of innovation that every single startup, decentralized project and large multinational must come to terms&nbsp;with.</p><p>Decentralized AI. As three of the longest serving OG teams of the decentralized AI world, committed to open and beneficial AI, committed to decentralization and striving to build exit ramps away from centralized monopolies; we aim to give AI researchers, companies and governments an alternative that doesn’t lock them into walled gardens and silos to tilt to a particular bias, or worse, allow the risk of user de-platforming and the loss of their intellectual property, social graph and followers.</p><p>The need for scale. The resources needed to win this competition are immense. We joked internally that we are the “Rebel Alliance” against the large platforms — but it’s actually no joke. The world needs a full, vertically integrated stack of decentralized tools to harness and leverage AI, and give users an alternative in case the monopolies no longer serve the needs of all&nbsp;users.</p> Why NOW? <p>AI is not only moving fast, it’s accelerating. AGI and ASI loom&nbsp;near.</p><p>Artificial General Superintelligence (AGI) — when an AI system can perform all human tasks at least a human level of competence — looms near. The acceleration will continue past AGI, straight to Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) when AI systems perform at far-beyond human levels of competence.</p><blockquote>It is imperative for humanity that artificial superintelligence is fundamentally decentralized.</blockquote><p>Not just “don’t be centralized” but can’t be centralized. Artificial superintelligence must be decentralized across the whole technology stack: from the network infrastructure, to AI infrastructure software (agents, data), to AI models &amp; prediction.</p><p>We at Fetch, Ocean Protocol and SingularityNET have been leading decentralized AI for the past seven years. In fact, the founders of each have been driving AI for decades before that. We’ve been building towards fundamentally decentralized network infrastructure, decentralized AI infrastructure software (agents, data), and decentralized AI models &amp; prediction. We have long been aligned philosophically, with mutual respect among the teams, and have had several specific project collaborations.</p><blockquote>We have been building and moving quickly. Yet, centralized AI has moved faster and accumulated enormous capital: All towards AGI then&nbsp;ASI.</blockquote><blockquote>If we want AI to be fundamentally decentralized, we must deliver decentralized AI, with scale, stronger and more robust: All towards AGI then&nbsp;ASI.</blockquote><p>Charlie Munger famously said “Show me the incentives, and I will show you the outcome.” Well, here are the incentives. In this singular move, we have aligned the economic incentives of these teams and their communities.</p> 2. Pillars of&nbsp;Focus <p>Our efforts — as group of three organizations — will follow three&nbsp;pillars:</p>  We’re building decentralized Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) — for humanity and for the&nbsp;future.  On the continuum from today to the future, we balance the ASI future with efforts on decentralized AI tools for present-day applications in business and retail users. These are the world-class tools that all three Foundations have built; we will continue to develop&nbsp;these.  AI, AGI and ASI want compute, specifically the silicon and the energy to power the compute. We intend to use the scale of $ASI to move even more aggressively in securing compute for AI, decentralized-style.   3. Complementary Strengths <p>The Superintelligence Alliance brings together the best of decentralized AI.</p><p>Each team Fetch, Ocean, SingularityNET have strengths that can be leveraged by the Alliance. We’ve all been building different parts of the decentralized stack, with little overlap. SingularityNET has been building a path to AGI &amp; ASI, and is strong in R&amp;D — with seven live projects launched, many with their own tokens. Fetch has an L1 network that we can all leverage, leading edge technology for AI Agents, and recently invested $100 million in GPUs. They also have a top-notch business development and commercialization team. With Ocean, we’ve assembled a lot of building blocks to allow decentralized data sharing, access control and payment. Our Predictoor product has seen over $800 million in volume, just six months since launch, and it has its own exponential path to&nbsp;ASI.</p><p>Teaming up allows us to leverage a deeper bench of AI &amp; crypto builder talent and evangelists, spanning the globe. The Alliance has some of the leading researchers, developers and commercialization know-how, under one umbrella to push adoption of decentralized technology.</p><p>Finally, the value-flow from deep research, to tools &amp; applications, and finally to large-scale commercialization of data and AI services is now possible — all while giving users full control and&nbsp;choice.</p> 4. How the Alliance Becomes Greater than the&nbsp;Parts <p>The Superintelligence Alliance exists to give people the freedom of choice to own and control their data and AI, to respect each person’s autonomy and sovereignty. This is more important than ever in a world with artificial general intelligence then artificial superintelligence.</p><p>We apply these principles to our own collaboration as well. Even though a common website for the Superintelligence Alliance will be put up, each Foundation — Fetch, Ocean Protocol, and SingularityNET — will remain as independent legal entities, with the existing leadership, teams, communities and token treasury. As a baseline, existing initiatives from each Foundation will continue as planned. Any changes with respect to a given Foundation’s offering will be announced via official channels. Specific for Ocean Protocol: everything will continue as-is for now with the exception of Passive Data Farming and Volume Data Farming; details are&nbsp;below.</p><p>To a large extent, each Foundation already exhibits varying levels of decentralization in the control of the token, governance, the diversity of the community and the number of independent spin-out projects.</p><p>Over time, as the Foundations collaborate and the teams get the chance to work more closely together, we will announce joint projects and collaborations — either internally to strengthen the overall product offering and improve the user experience, or externally to bring stronger go-to-market services for large and enterprise customers.</p><p>Each Foundation is free to do as they like, to bring forward the values and adoption of decentralized AI — without coercion or compulsion to pressure other Alliance members. When cross-team collaborations make compelling and pragmatic sense, we’ll do it. If it doesn’t, two teams could be working on a similar topic with different approaches. Community members are free to join, and free to leave at all&nbsp;times.</p>Figure 1 — Levels of Integration of the Superintelligence Alliance<p>Governing council. To manage this symphony of decentralization, a governing council will be formed with Humayun Sheikh as Chairman, Ben Goertzel as the CEO, and Trent and Bruce will represent Ocean Protocol and we’ll do our part to contribute to a shared Superintelligence Alliance&nbsp;vision.</p><p>The text above it is essential, as it forms the core principles of our Alliance, and will guide how we move forward. Enticingly, this flexible framework leaves open the opportunity for other decentralized teams who share our values to join the Alliance in the future, to add even more strengths and capabilities.</p> 4. The New $ASI&nbsp;Token <p>From Day 1, the $ASI token (the renamed $FET token) will have a market capitalization ranking it around #20 on CoinMarketCap. This placement gives the Alliance significantly more exposure to a broader, global audience and puts $ASI as a strong candidate to be included in any index-based AI and crypto-ETF.</p><p>There are 225,000 wallet holders of $FET, $OCEAN and $AGIX tokens, as well as several hundred thousand more holders who leave their tokens on exchanges.</p><p>With the rise in token ranking of $ASI, we can expect our community to grow rapidly, and with it, an increase in trading volumes and attention from sophisticated players.</p> What Happens&nbsp;Next <p>With the announcement live, each Foundation will speak to business partners, answer questions from the community and start to plan the next&nbsp;steps.</p><p>The first priority is to execute the token merge. The $FET token will be the reserve token of the Superintelligence Alliance. It will be renamed $ASI — ‘Artificial Superintelligence.’ Holders of $OCEAN and $AGIX need not do anything right now. You can continue to hold your tokens without worry as the exchange rate between $FET/$ASI and $OCEAN is fixed to 0.433226 $ASI per $OCEAN and the 0.433350 $ASI per $AGIX. Holders can choose to swap their tokens as soon as the token swap tool is available, or 10 years from now if they want to, at their leisure. The exchange rate will remain fixed. There is no&nbsp;rush.</p> Token Exchange Mechanism <p>Starting with $FET as the base token of the Alliance, the $FET token will be renamed $ASI, and an additional 1.48 Billion tokens will be minted, with 867 million $ASI allocated to $AGIX holders and 611 million $ASI allocated to $OCEAN token holders. The total supply of $ASI tokens will be 2.63 Billion&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>We took a snapshot on Monday, 25 March 2024. Here is the Max Supply (#) and Fully Diluted Value ($)&nbsp;summary:</p>Figure 2 — Fully Diluted Valuation ($) and Max Token Supply (#) of&nbsp;$ASI<p>Here is the calculation basis for the token minting to give a proportional share of new $ASI tokens to $OCEAN and $AGIX&nbsp;holders:</p>Figure 3 — Token Supply Calculation<p>Token holders will receive 0.433226 $ASI per $OCEAN and 0.433350 $ASI per $AGIX. This exchange rate is fixed and will not change. We expect that smart arbitrageurs will notice if a price differential between the tokens arises, and then arb it out to maintain a balance and equilibrium in the exchange&nbsp;rate.</p> 6. Actions for Token&nbsp;Holders <p>$FET Tokens on Exchanges</p><p>If you have $FET tokens on an exchange, they will be automatically relabeled as $ASI tokens. No action is needed from you. We’ll coordinate with the exchanges on your&nbsp;behalf.</p><p>$OCEAN and $AGIX tokens on Exchanges</p><p>If you have $OCEAN and $AGIX tokens on an exchange, no action is needed. We will work with each exchange to ensure a smooth conversion and your holdings will automatically be converted to $ASI tokens directly by the exchange.</p><p>One day, you’ll log in and you won’t see your $OCEAN or $AGIX — but don’t panic! The tokens are there — look for the $ASI symbol near the top of the&nbsp;list.</p><p>Don’t Deposit $OCEAN / $AGIX tokens into Exchanges after they’ve Executed a Conversion</p><p>When an exchange has converted all $OCEAN and $AGIX tokens, the tickers $OCEAN and $AGIX will be retired from the exchange. If anyone accidentally sends $OCEAN or $AGIX an exchange after the conversion event, we cannot guarantee that the tokens will be available or converted to $ASI. So please keep abreast of notices and announcements from your exchanges.</p><p>If you hold $OCEAN or $AGIX outside of an exchange and want to convert them to $ASI tokens, please see the next paragraph.</p><p>$OCEAN / $AGIX Tokens in Hard Wallets or&nbsp;Offline</p><p>For those of you holding your tokens in hard wallets or offline, a token swap mechanism will be available in the coming weeks to allow holders to exchange their $OCEAN and $AGIX for&nbsp;$ASI.</p><p>Once made available, this swap mechanism will be available indefinitely to allow long-term stakers to exchange their $OCEAN and $AGIX for $ASI tokens when their tokens unlock, without any FX or exchange&nbsp;risk.</p><p>Data Farming &amp;&nbsp;Staking</p><p>Some of you have locked your $OCEAN for up to 4 years in Data Farming. We’ve got you covered. Appendix 2 on Data Farming has&nbsp;details.</p><p>Timing for the Token Swap Mechanism</p><p>The token swap contracts have been tested and audited but given the complexity of the coordination with hundreds of business partners, we’ll complete a more detailed analysis, speak with partners &amp; exchanges, and come back to the community with a firm date to release the token swap tool. Stay&nbsp;tuned.</p><p>DEXes and Pool Liquidity</p><p>We encourage liquidity providers to remove any $OCEAN and $AGIX related liquidity from DEXs at your convenience. Users may experience higher slippage in pools with lower liquidity. We recommend that you size your swap according to the available liquidity to minimize slippage.</p><p>Once you have your removed liquidity and have OCEAN in your wallet, wait until token swap contracts are ready to use and exchange OCEAN to&nbsp;ASI.</p><p>Once a threshold of 95% of the $OCEAN and $AGIX token supply is converted to $ASI, Ocean Protocol and SingularityNET Foundations will remove any pool liquidity that we have provisioned.</p> 7. Conclusion <p>We’re excited. You’re&nbsp;excited.</p><p>This Alliance makes sense because the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. We can move faster, aggressively deliver more features and have the scale to compete globally and commercialize a decentralized stack of&nbsp;tools.</p><p>Our ambition is nothing less than to accelerate the path to artificial superintelligence, while carving out an essential role for humans and respecting the dignity and sovereignty of each one of&nbsp;us.</p><p>The covenant that we make to you, our community and the Superintelligence Alliance is the same — we will build the tools to help every human have a chance to thrive in a future where AI, AGI and ASI is a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>Join us. Build with us. Be a part of the movement.</p> About Ocean <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data. Ocean tools enable businesses and individuals to trade tokenized data assets seamlessly to manage data all along the AI model life-cycle. Ocean-powered apps include enterprise-grade data exchanges, data science competitions, and data DAOs. Our Ocean Predictoor product has over $800 million in monthly volume, just six months after launch with a roadmap to scale foundation models globally.</p> Appendix 1: Beware of&nbsp;Scams <blockquote>Most Importantly, We Really Can’t Stress this Enough — BEWARE of SCAMS&nbsp;!!!</blockquote><p>Our number one priority is to protect the community.</p><p>Moments like these are a prime time for scammers to appear with tempting, time-sensitive, “click-now!” links. Don’t fall for it. It breaks our hearts every time someone is scammed because there’s little we can do other than maybe file a police&nbsp;report.</p><p>We cannot stress how important it is to maintain vigilance and remember — there is no time urgency to swap your $OCEAN / $AGIX for $ASI. Do it at your&nbsp;leisure.</p><p>Here are some ways to stay&nbsp;safe:</p>  Cross-verify any call to action to exchange your tokens. Visit Fetch, Ocean Protocol and/or SingularityNET Twitter/X handles and check if our Tweets point to the same url or destination.  Rely only on official sources that you independently type in the destination on your browser and avoid following any links. There are many impersonator websites designed to look authentic, to steal your tokens. For instance, on Twitter — if you see @FetchAI, check the number of followers — it should be 200,000. Most impersonators will have only 50 bot followers — that’s a clear sign of a&nbsp;scammer.  In Telegram, only click on links from the pinned notices posted by Admins. Admins have been explicitly instructed not to post links in the message threads. All official messages will be pinned, not in the deluge of scrolling messages.  For Telegram/Discord, always use public channels or threads and do not engage in private messages promising to&nbsp;help.  Our Admins are instructed NEVER to proactively reach out to users. Be extremely wary of any direct messages from an “Admin” with a call to action. We’ve designed the process so that users can swap their tokens at their leisure with no urgency. The exchange rate is fixed between $OCEAN / $AGIX and $ASI, so regardless of price action — you will get your allocated share of&nbsp;$ASI.  NEVER share your private key or seed (12, 15,18, 24 words) used to generate your wallet with anyone, nor enter them into a&nbsp;website.  If you have a problem, reach out via Twitter/X by writing a DM or posting a public Tweet. One of our admins should see it and respond using the official account from Fetch, Ocean or SingularityNET. Nonetheless be very wary and maintain vigilance for any links and rely only on official sources and websites.  If you do fall for a scammer and you post a plea for help on a forum or Telegram, more scammers will come out of the woodwork to offer you to recover your tokens for a fee. Don’t fall for this scam. Send a message via Twitter to either Fetch, Ocean or SingularityNET and one of the Admins will get back to&nbsp;you.  <p>Stay safe! People will try to scam you out of your hard-earned tokens. We’ve designed the process so that you can swap your tokens in a relaxed manner with no rush. If you are unsure, Ask and keep asking until you are 100% sure that it is safe to execute the&nbsp;actions.</p> Appendix 2: Data Farming &amp; OCEAN&nbsp;Locking  Introduction <p>Data Farming (DF) is Ocean Protocol’s incentive program. If you’ve locked OCEAN for veOCEAN, to participate in Passive DF or Active DF, we’ve got you&nbsp;covered.</p><p>The Fetch and SingularityNET communities have token governance requiring approval of the token-merger action. The voting process will take several&nbsp;weeks.</p><p>Data Farming plans must account for a “yes” (from both) or a “no” outcome (from&nbsp;either).</p><p>veOCEAN, Passive DF and Volume DF will be heavily affected if “yes”. To be ready for either outcome, we will pause giving rewards for Passive DF and Volume DF as soon as the DF82 payout of Thu Mar 28 has completed. Also in preparation, we have taken a snapshot of OCEAN locked &amp; veOCEAN balances as of 00:00 am UTC Wed Mar 27 (Ethereum block 19522003); we need this information in the event of a&nbsp;“yes”.</p><p>Predictoor DF will continue regardless of voting&nbsp;outcome.</p><p>Once the votes are complete, then the next actions depend on “yes” vs&nbsp;“no”.</p> Actions if&nbsp;“no” <p>If a “no” happens, then we will resume Passive DF &amp; Volume DF&nbsp;as-is.</p><p>The first Passive DF &amp; Volume payout will be within a week after we resume, and weekly after that as per usual DF schedule. The first payout will include the payouts that were missed during the&nbsp;pause.</p> Actions if&nbsp;“yes” <p>If a “yes” happens, the following will&nbsp;occur.</p><p>veOCEAN will be retired. This will make it easier to have a unified ASI staking program that aligns with Fetch and SingularityNET. Passive DF &amp; Volume DF will be&nbsp;retired.</p><p>People who have locked OCEAN for veOCEAN will be made whole, as follows. <br>Each address holding veOCEAN will be airdropped OCEAN in the amount&nbsp;of:</p><p>(1.25^years_til_unlock) — 1) * num_OCEAN_locked</p><p>In words: veOCEAN holders get a reward as if they had got payouts of 25% APY for their whole lock period (and kept re-upping their lock). But they get the payout soon, rather than over years of weekly DF rewards payouts. It’s otherwise the same commitment, expectations and payout as&nbsp;before.</p><p>This airdrop will happen within weeks after the “yes”&nbsp;vote.</p><p>That same address will have its OCEAN unlocked according to its normal veOCEAN mechanics and timeline (up to 4 years). After unlock, that account holder can convert the $OCEAN directly into $ASI with the published exchange&nbsp;rate.</p><p>Any actions taken by an account on locking / re-locking veOCEAN after the time of the snapshot will be&nbsp;ignored.</p><p>Example. Alice recently locked 100 OCEAN for a duration of four years, and had received 100 veOCEAN to her&nbsp;account.</p>  She will get airdropped 144 OCEAN soon after the “yes”&nbsp;vote  In four years, her initial 100 OCEAN will&nbsp;unlock.  In total, Alice will have received 244 OCEAN (144 soon, 100 in 4&nbsp;years).  Her return is approximately the same as if she’d used Passive DF &amp; Volume DF for 4 years and got 25% APY. That is: (1.25⁴-1) * 100 = 2.44 * 100. Yet this updated scheme benefits her more because her 144 of that 244 OCEAN is liquid&nbsp;soon.  <p>psdnOCEAN. psdnOCEAN holders will be able to swap back to the OCEAN with a fixed-rate contract. For each 1 psdnOCEAN swapped they will receive &gt;1 OCEAN at a respectable ROI. Details forthcoming.</p><p>Predictoor DF. In the event of a “yes”, Predictoor DF continues. Over time, we will migrate Predictoor and Predictoor DF to use the new ASI&nbsp;token.</p><p>Data Farming budget. Ocean Protocol Foundation will re-use the DF budget for its incentives programs. These can include: scaling up Predictoor DF, ASI incentives programs, and new projects that arise from synergy among Fetch, SingularityNET, and&nbsp;Ocean.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-is-joining-the-superintelligence-alliance-767c82693f24">Ocean Protocol is joining the Superintelligence Alliance</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Fetch.ai, Ocean Protocol and SingularityNET Unite to Create <br>Artificial Superintelligence Alliance  Artificial Intelligence Pioneers Combine to Create a Decentralized Alternative to Existing AI Projects Controlled by Big Tech<br> <br>Combined value of $FET, $OCEAN and $AGIX is USD$7.6 Billion as of March 26,&nbsp;2024 <p>Zug and Singapore — March 27, 2024 — SingularityNET (SNET), the world’s first decentralized Artificial Intelligence (AI) network, Fetch.ai, a Web3 platform for the new AI economy, and Ocean Protocol, a decentralized data exchange platform to protect data, have launched the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance. The creation of the largest open-sourced, decentralized network through a multi-billion token merger is a major step that accelerates the race to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).</p><p>The Alliance is the brainchild of three leading minds in decentralized AI. Dr. Ben Goertzel, renowned as the “Father of AGI”, founded SNET as a blockchain-based marketplace and framework for AI services. Deep Mind founding investor Humayun Sheikh built Fetch.ai as a decentralized multi-agent platform to deploy and commercialize AI applications. Trent McConaghy, the architect of the AI-based software that most chip designers use to drive Moore’s Law, formed Ocean Protocol to provide a platform for data exchange and the seamless trade of tokenized data&nbsp;assets.</p><p>As part of the formation of the Alliance, the $FET, $OCEAN and $AGIX tokens that fuel the three Alliance member networks will be merged into a single $ASI token that will function across the combined decentralized AI network, providing unprecedented scale and&nbsp;power.</p> Built for Super Intelligence <p>“As the AI revolution intensifies it is imperative that AGI and ASI are not owned and controlled by any particular party with their own biased interests,” comments Dr. Ben Goertzel, CEO and Founder of SNET. “They should be rolled out in an open, democratic and decentralized way. This has been the joint vision of SNET, Fetch.ai and Ocean Protocol from their inception, and for this reason it makes total sense that our three projects come together to form a tokenomic network that has greater power to take on Big Tech and shift the center of gravity of the AI world into the decentralized ecosystem.”</p><p>“In a world of exponential AI innovation, the giants of Big Tech dominate the headlines and conversation,’” remarks Humayun Sheikh, Fetch.ai CEO &amp; Founder. “We are forging a different path. Our mission with this merger is to combine our platforms to ensure ethical and transparent AI that facilitates direct interactions between developers and users to bypass the traditional gatekeepers of centralized authorities. This enhances data privacy and paves the way for a more democratic and trustworthy AI ecosystem and encourages global participants to contribute.”</p> Compelling Strategic Rationale   Capitalizes on Rise of AI and Growth of Three AI Projects: The combination is born of a period of unprecedented growth for the AI projects. The deal provides an unparalleled opportunity for these three influential leaders to create a powerful compelling alternative to Big Tech’s control over AI development, use and monetization.  Creates a Decentralized AI Infrastructure at Scale: Decentralized AI leverages blockchain technology to turn AI systems, whose inner workings are hidden from the public, into open networks for coordinating machine intelligence towards shared objectives. The fusion of SNET, Fetch.ai and Ocean Protocol’s research, brands, technologies and products creates a foundation to build a scalable AI infrastructure which ensures ethical and trustworthy practices.  Accelerates Investment into AGI: Goertzel, Sheikh and McConaghy have long been acolytes and early-adopters of Artificial Intelligence — all focused on making AGI a reality. This Superintelligence Alliance facilitates the commercialization of each foundation’s technology, and enables wide scale access to cutting-edge AI platforms and large databases. This groundbreaking move advances the path to AGI on the blockchain.   Transaction Details <p>Bruce Pon, Ocean Protocol CEO &amp; Co-Founder, believes the combination can deliver on the promise of a vertically integrated stack of decentralized technologies with scale to compete globally. “The combination of our technologies creates a leader in R&amp;D, applications and commercialization of AGI,” Pon notes. “The unified $ASI token is the glue to orchestrate all actors with common incentives. $ASI tokens are used to secure the public network, as data access tokens and to unlock computation without needing traditional banking and payment rails. It is the native currency for the machine economy.”</p><p>When the proposal receives majority approval from the respective communities, the following will&nbsp;occur:</p>  $FET becomes $ASI with a total supply of 2.63055 billion tokens, and a starting price of&nbsp;$2.82  $AGIX tokens migrate to $ASI, at a conversion rate of 0.433350:1  $OCEAN tokens migrate to $ASI, at a conversion rate of 0.433226:1  $ASI will have a total FDV of $7.6 billion USD (combined value as at March 26,&nbsp;2024).   Leadership and Governance <p>Upon closing of this token merger, a governing council for the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance will monitor and guide operations of the newly merged tokenomic network. The Alliance will be led by Ben Goertzel, Humayun Sheikh, Bruce Pon and Trent McConaghy. The organizations that guide development of the three merging networks, Fetch.ai, Ocean Protocol Foundation and SNET Foundation, will continue to operate as separate entities, but will collaborate closely in the shared $ASI tokenomic ecosystem and in the operation of the Alliance.</p><p>“Among our many commercial and research goals for this combined network to work is to launch a decentralized neural-symbolic AGI system with globally-superior capabilities in key areas like logical and scientific reasoning and artistic creativity,” Goertzel continues. “The impact of such a system may greatly exceed what we’ve seen from significant LLMs and lead the global economy into a new era of beneficial decentralized AGI and&nbsp;ASI.”</p><p>“This alliance is a fantastic step forward for those who are left out of the technologies produced by big tech, which mainly targets the affluent. Billions of people on our planet do not currently have access to advanced AI technologies and tools. The Superintelligence Alliance is here to tear down barriers towards a decentralized, democratic, and ethical AI future, reducing inequalities and making the world a better place for us, for our children and grandchildren and generations to come. Decentralised governance gives everyone a voice and a say in the ethics and oversight of the most powerful tools ever invented.”</p><p>About SingularityNET</p><p>SingularityNET was founded by Dr. Ben Goertzel with the mission of creating a decentralized, democratic, inclusive and beneficial Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). According to Dr. Goertzel, AGI should be independent of any central entity, open to anyone and not restricted to the narrow goals of a single corporation or even a single country. The SNET team includes seasoned engineers, scientists, researchers, entrepreneurs, and marketers. The core platform and AI teams are further complemented by specialized teams devoted to application areas such as finance, robotics, biomedical AI, media, arts and entertainment.</p><p>For additional information on SNET, visit: <a href="https://singularitynet.io/">https://singularitynet.io/</a></p><p>About Fetch.ai</p><p>Fetch.ai, a Cambridge-based AI company, is redefining the possibilities of an intelligent and connected world through its AI agent-based technology.

<p>The end of March marks the conclusion of Women’s History Month. And despite the increased focus on women’s issues and contributions to society throughout the month, the conversation would be incomplete without recognizing how indispensable the success of women—past and present—has been in the tech industry. In particular, women are leading the way every day toward a new era of unprecedented global innovation in the field of generative AI.</p>



<p>However,&nbsp;a New York Times piece that came out a few months ago failed on its list of people with the biggest contribution in the current AI landscape. The piece rightly received criticism for reflecting a broader narrative that has long minimized the contributions of women in technology. That narrative says the contributions of women in AI and technology are peripheral; but we know this isn’t true. In fact, they are central to the innovation and continued development of this field.</p>



<p>Women have been challenging the outdated notion that AI development solely belongs to those who code and construct algorithms—a field that, while shifting, remains significantly male-dominated—for years. Many have been doing this by leading the charge on responsible AI innovation, centered on ethics and transparency, throughout their entire careers.</p>



<p>Women like Kay Firth Butterfield, the world’s first Chief AI Ethics Officer; Elham Tabassi from NIST, spearheading initiatives on ethical AI standards; Miriam Vogel from EqualAI and NAIAC, championing AI equality; Paula Goldman from Salesforce; and Navrina Singh from Credo, advocating for responsible AI use are just a few of the many examples of women leading the way in this space.</p>



<p>Other prominent women figures in tech include Fei-Fei Li from Stanford’s Human-Centered AI Institute, renowned for her contributions to AI image recognition and her advocacy for inclusive and ethical AI development; Joy Buolamwini, the founder of Algorithmic Justice League, highlighting and mitigating biases within AI systems; Lila Ibrahim from DeepMind, responsible for operational strategy behind one of the world’s leading AI research organizations; and Francesca Rossi, leading Global AI Ethics at IBM®, who stands at the forefront of addressing critical AI governance, ethics, responsibility and responsible innovation matters.</p>



<p>These are just a few of the many, many examples of women leading in this field. Leaving women out of the conversation and coverage not only overlooks the diverse perspectives necessary for responsible innovation, but also fails to recognize the vital role of ethics, governance, and consideration of societal implications in the development of AI. It is time for a critical reevaluation, one that acknowledges innovation is as much about its impact as it is about invention.</p>



<p>In a study conducted by the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/women-leadership-ai">IBM Institute for Business Value</a>, Debra D’Agostino, Managing Director of Thought Leadership at Oxford Economics, reinforces the importance of diverse leadership in AI’s evolution. She highlights how women don’t need to be IT experts to lead AI innovation. The study revealed that women are already more likely than men to have used AI to generate, edit and summarize content; and 40 percent say using generative AI has resulted in a greater than 10 percent increase in productivity. Understanding and anticipating how AI can best augment the unique needs and capabilities of a business or team <a href="https://www.businesstoday.in/bt-tv/video/nvidia-ceo-no-need-to-learn-coding-anybody-can-be-a-programmer-with-technology-419015-2024-02-26">is as crucial</a> as working with the right people in IT to make it happen, D’ Agostino said.</p>



<p>As Women’s History Month comes to an end, it’s important to acknowledge how the contributions of women in AI are not just paving the way for more equitable technology, but are also crucial in realizing the possibility, and confronting and mitigating the immediate and long-term risks that AI poses to our society. Their work is setting the standards for how we, as a global community, approach the integration of AI into our lives.</p>



<p>The future of AI is being written today and women are not just supporting roles in that narrative—they are leading characters in the story. As we forge ahead, it’s important to remember that the true measure of AI’s advancement goes beyond its technical capabilities. It’s about how we harness this technology to reflect our collective values, address our shared challenges and create a world where innovation benefits all of society, not just the privileged few.</p>

   It’s time for banks to heed the warning signs about legacy payment types, and actively move toward solutions that remove cost and friction.

<p>Here’s an argument for modernizing payments: Profits from traditional payment types are caught in a death spiral. As usage of traditional methods of payments decline, the high fixed cost to maintain them begins to seriously hurt margins as the revenue from smaller volumes declines. Increasing the price for the remaining transactions only hastens the decline. If you or your retirement savings are a shareholder of a bank, you care.&nbsp;</p>



 The decline of cash&nbsp; 



<p>Exhibit A: Australian banks are trying to figure out <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/banks-want-to-band-together-to-secure-cash-supply-20231129-p5ensj.html">how to handle cash as its usage declines</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are considerable costs to banks who handle cash, which is why they often charge businesses for each cash deposit by volume. The decline in cash usage, accelerated by the pandemic, has undermined the economies of scale in handling it. Handling cash costs more per cash bundle now, since the smaller volume is spread over a large cost base. There has already been a consolidation in Australia among the armored car/cash handling companies, and now the last one standing is losing money. The banks are all in a pickle, since, among them, they have a high fixed cost to handle cash through their branch and ABM networks, and for the handling of cash from businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This will only get worse. Until you implement a system where everyone has access to digital payments (and it would need to be 100% of the population), you can’t eliminate cash. But bank shareholders won’t be tolerant of a bank whose profitability is being challenged because it ends up being one of the last bastions of cash handling.&nbsp;</p>



 The decline of checks&nbsp; 



<p>Exhibit B: Check processing volumes are also declining in most countries where this is still an accepted payment method. Again, as with cash, there are high operational costs that are associated with check processing, even if you have moved to image exchanges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There was a time that some banks outsourced check processing to third parties, but regardless, with declining volumes, the economies of scale dry up. The cost of maintaining systems to support elements such as imaging, Day 2 operations (such as returns), and exception handling are fixed. Once again, as a financial institution, if you still offer checks as a service offering, you will face declining margins. You might, of course, raise the price, but that would likely only accelerate the volume decline.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 The aging bill payment system&nbsp; 



<p>Exhibit C: Pre-authorized debits, also known as ACH Debits, also known as SEPA Debits, and bill payments. In the Canadian case of bill payments, the nationwide Canadian bill payment system is built on a backbone relying on Electronic Data Interchange&nbsp;(EDI). But every single direct clearer in Canada has a legacy platform for EDI that is not supportable indefinitely.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The banks have been asking their service providers and the payments system overseer, Payments Canada, what the future of this EDI system is. Satisfying answers are slow to come, since the investment to modernize and maintain a legacy system is not strategic if one is also contemplating its inevitable replacement with a real-time rail. Note, though, that Canada isn’t the only region that has yet to figure out how to handle debits with a real-time rail that only pushes credits. And Canada isn’t the only country with costly legacy systems pushing debits.&nbsp;</p>



 So, what are the solutions?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>For cash, the answer is to move to central bank digital currencies, but several hurdles must be overcome, apart from the problem with ubiquity for the population. In the meantime, costs will rise as volumes fall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For checks and other legacy payment methods, the banks can forestall doom by adopting payments-as-a-service platforms that don’t rely on every bank having the systems within their four walls. IBM® can help in this area: the IBM Payments Center® has already proven we can deliver check servicing on the cloud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For pre-authorized debits, bill payments and EDI, a real-time rail with service overlays can be adopted. Such as the PayTo service overlay riding on NPP, found in Australia (which works just fine, by the way—ask an Aussie). Existing real-time payment services can accommodate richer, structured data for things such as bill payments. In some cases and jurisdictions, it’s simply that not all financial institutions have agreed to use the data fields or read them all the same way, a problem that might be easily solved with a little effort.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s time banks and market infrastructures heeded the warning signs about legacy payment types, and started actively moving to solutions that remove cost and friction. The future can’t come soon enough for bank shareholders, consumers and businesses.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Many strictly regulated industries such as banking and finance rely heavily on identity and access management solutions to secure their systems and infrastructure. Unfortunately, as demonstrated by the Okta breach last year, these organizations are attractive targets for hackers due to the nature and quantity of the information they handle. While hackers use sophisticated ransomware once access is gained, they obtain that access through surprisingly low-tech means: for example, by calling the companies’ help desks and, using a simple voice phishing (vishing) tactic to induce IT employees to disable two-factor authentication.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Phishing awareness and resistance play a big role in protecting customer and corporate data, but organizations need a secure solution to safeguard their systems against phishing and credential theft, mitigating these attacks before they can occur. Many companies already manage physical access with ID badges, but integrating digital access control into these badges can offer one comprehensive solution that provides:</p> 
  
  Photo ID for visual verification  
  Access badge for door readers&nbsp;  
  Access token for passwordless digital authentication  
  
 The Value of Security Convergence — Combining Physical Security with Digital Security  
<p>Historically, physical security and digital security have been managed separately, working in parallel. Due to increasingly complex security threats, however, organizations require a more comprehensive approach to securing both physical and digital assets to reduce the risk of breaches.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Following the 2023 breach, Okta recommended customers take several steps to better defend themselves against potential attacks by adding:</p> 
  
  Multi-factor authentication (MFA) to secure administrator access  
  “Admin session binding,” requiring administrators to reauthenticate in certain instances  
  “Admin session timeout” defaulted to a 12-hour session duration and 15 minutes of idle time  
  
<p>These settings provide organizations with a more secure layer of roadblocks that limit how much hackers can do once they gain access to any systems. These settings require more frequent re-authentication by users, but a converged credential with FIDO2 authentication makes this a simple and more convenient process.</p> 
<p>The converged approach to identity management not only enables organizations to take a more holistic approach to threat management and have a more prepared security posture for preventing, mitigating, and responding to threats, but it provides users with a more convenient, passwordless solution for authentication.</p> 
 Example of a Converged Credential:  
<p></p> 
 Features of a Strong and Effective Converged Credential  
<p>Organizations in regulated industries need an identity solution that both complies with regulations and safeguards their operations against phishing and fraud. A converged credential streamlines security at both the physical and digital level, and includes the following features to eliminate the threat of phishing attacks:</p> 
  
  Secure, Phishing-Resistant Multi-Factor Authentication. Requiring more than two authentication factors increases security. Such factors may include something the user has (the card), something the user knows (a PIN), and something the user is (biometric data, like fingerprints) to provide a higher level of confidence in the authenticity of the user’s identity. This means it does not use a password, OTP or other shared secret as a factor.  
  Alignment with Current Security Trends. Using a converged credential that aligns with modern security trends and standards – including FIDO2, Mifare®, and DesFIRE® – enables organizations to be confident that they comply with security regulations.  
  Passwordless Experience. Replacing passwords with local authentication methods enhances the user experience while reducing vulnerabilities associated with password breaches.  
  
 Conclusion  
<p>While phishing is a relatively simple tactic, it has the potential to expose organizations to more complex and costly cyberattacks that could result in significant financial consequences, reputational harm, and customer dissatisfaction.</p> 
<p>By implementing a phishing-resistant solution, such as the converged physical and digital access credential solution offered by <a href="https://www.hypr.com/integrations/idemia">HYPR and IDEMIA</a>, organizations can be more confident in their ability to safeguard their operational and customer data from cyberattacks.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/banking/2024/consumers-look-at-security-first-costs-second-when-opening-a-bank-account/">PYMNYS study</a>, over 25% of consumers said safety (of money and personal information) is the most influential factor when opening a primary bank account. Previously, higher security was at odds with creating a member experience, but there is a new approach.</p>



<p>You can create a better member experience AND increase security simultaneously with <a href="http://chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://go.sudoplatform.com/rs/971-PEA-288/images/KYC%20eBook%202b.pdf?version=0">reusable credentials</a>&nbsp;.</p>



<p>What are reusable credentials? Using cutting-edge verification technology, your members only verify themselves once during onboarding. After that, they will have credentials that work across all interactions with your credit union. The credentials cut down wait times, eliminate repetitive verification hassles, and create a seamless member experience at every touch point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why this matters: This revolutionary approach has the potential to reshape the member journey by creating seamless interactions, increasing efficiency, and providing unparalleled member satisfaction. In addition to these benefits, this method also significantly minimizes fraudulent activities within your identity verification process.</p>



<p>How reusable credentials create a better member experience:</p>







 
 Streamlined Interactions: Reusable credentials eliminate the need for repetitive identity verification, ensuring a smooth and efficient member journey. 
 







 
 Reduced Wait Times: Members no longer need to endure long queues or waiting periods, as the verification process now takes seconds. 
 







 
 Smooth Branch Visits: With credentials persisting across interactions, in-person visits to the branch are quicker and more personalized, enhancing the overall experience. 
 







 
 Effortless Call Center Interactions: Members experience faster and more efficient interactions with call centers, as there is no need for extensive identity verification. 
 







 
 Stress-Free Teller Transactions: Teller interactions become stress-free as the burden of repetitive verification is lifted, allowing staff to focus on delivering a superior member experience. 
 







 
 Enhanced Security: While providing convenience, reusable credentials maintain the highest level of security. With unbreakable encryption, reusable credentials are tamper-proof and make fraud almost impossible. 
 







 
 Consistent Experience: Whether online or through mobile apps, members enjoy a consistent, secure, and frictionless digital experience, fostering trust and loyalty.

 How do Reusable Credentials Work? 



<p>Reusable credentials are a shift in the way identity is managed. It is moving away from centralized systems controlled by organizations to a model where individuals have greater control over their own identity information.</p>



<p>In the end, members can show their encrypted and unique credentials on their phones as irrefutable proof of who they are without disclosing information that can be used maliciously.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The process looks like this:</p>







 
 Initial verification: Once a member is verified using robust authentication methods, the system creates a reusable credential that can be used across various services and applications. 
 







 
 Decentralized identity: Decentralized identity (DI) technology powers reusable credentials. This technology (that utilizes encryption and other cutting-edge tech) ensures that the data is secure, tamper-proof, and resistant to single points of failure.&nbsp; 
 







 
 Secure communication: The DI system provides irrefutable and secure communication across all channels, with built-in, ultra-secure identity validation. 
 







 
 User control&nbsp;: Individuals own and control their identity information. Unlike traditional systems where large organizations store and manage user data, DI empowers individuals to own and manage their digital identities. Protecting both individuals and organizations.

 How Reusable Credentials Make a Better Member Experience for Credit Unions 



<p>Transforming Branch Dynamics for a Better Member Experience</p>



<p>The traditional branch experience often involves members waiting in queues for identity verification, leading to frustration and dissatisfaction. Not to mention that traditional identity verification methods (IDs, security questions, etc.) can be maliciously reproduced.</p>



<p>Reusable credentials significantly reduce branch wait times. Members breeze through the verification process, allowing them to focus on their financial needs rather than waiting in line. This streamlined experience enhances efficiency and leaves a lasting positive impression on members, contributing to their overall satisfaction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consistent Seamless Interactions for a Better Member Experience</p>



<p>Reusable credentials create a credit union experience where every member interaction is smooth regardless of the channel. Whether a member interacts in-branch, over the phone, or through digital channels, the authentication experience remains seamless. Repetitive security questions and cumbersome verification processes that differ in every channel are replaced with a unified, efficient system, fostering a sense of trust and reliability.</p>



<p>Remember, in the <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/banking/2024/consumers-look-at-security-first-costs-second-when-opening-a-bank-account/">PYMNYS study</a>, over 25% of consumers said that safety (of money and personal information) is the most influential factor when opening a primary bank account. You can give members next-level security with reusable credentials.</p>



<p>Liberating Tellers for Member-Focused Excellence</p>



<p>Tellers are the face of the credit union, influencing member perceptions and experiences. However, the burden of identity verification often diverts their attention from delivering personalized service to preventing fraud.</p>



<p>“Tellers are the first line of defense. It’s our job to protect your account. But we aren’t perfect. Just like any sort of defense, we make mistakes or miss things. We are human and are subject to human error.” – A teller explaining <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourBank/comments/ag2aiv/bank_tellers_of_reddit_what_security_do_you_guys/">their experience on the job.</a></p>



<p>Reusable credentials liberate tellers from the time-consuming and stressful verification process, enabling them to concentrate on building meaningful connections with members. This shift in focus enhances the overall member experience, making each interaction more personalized, efficient, and satisfying.</p>



<p>Reusable Credentials are the New Era of KYC and Identity Verification</p>



<p>Reusable credentials are the perfect opportunity for credit unions to deliver an outstanding member experience. Beyond the technological upgrade, it signifies a commitment to efficiency, trust, and member-centric banking.</p>



<p>Reusable credentials will be the future of credit union success by minimizing wait times, ensuring seamless interactions, and empowering tellers to prioritize member experience. Anonyome Labs is here to help you seamlessly add reusable credentials to your credit union.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Climate change causes extreme weather events across the world that <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/climate-change">endanger people’s lives and disrupt the businesses</a> on which they depend. In Africa, for example, recurring droughts, floods and cyclones due to climate change <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/climate-change-examples/%22%20HYPERLINK%20%22https://www.ibm.com/blog/climate-change-examples/">might cause crop failures and food insecurity.</a> As businesses make plans to mitigate climate risks such as extreme weather events, they have <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/climate-change-future/">an opportunity to innovate</a> with new business models and demonstrate leadership by implementing more sustainable practices.&nbsp;</p>



 What is climate risk?&nbsp; 



<p>To put it simply, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/resources/business-operations/manage-climate-risk">climate risk</a> is the potential for the effects of climate change to disrupt our current economic and social structures. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The United States saw <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/">25 climate disaster events</a> in 2023 with losses of more than USD 1 billion each. These events included floods, severe storms and a drought.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These kinds of disruptive events might be temporary or result in long-term damage to infrastructure or buildings. Power shutdowns might occur across the grid, and supply chains might face interruptions. Substantial repair costs might arise, particularly impacting insurance companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to extreme weather risks, there can be chronic climate risks, such as rising sea levels and sustained higher temperatures. These risks can make it difficult or impossible for organizations to operate in affected locations.&nbsp;</p>



 Why should businesses act now on climate change?&nbsp; 



<p>Climate change exposes organizations across a range of sectors to operational and financial risks. Whether it be through asset and infrastructure damage, operational impact, displacement or logistical delays, climate risk threatens essentially every business. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dealing with these problems is difficult and expensive. When an extreme weather event occurs, a company might need to change its infrastructure and processes suddenly, either for the short term or permanently. There are likely to be direct expenses, along with missed opportunities and lost business. To best prepare, organizations need to develop a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/6-climate-change-adaptation-strategies-every-organization-needs-today/">climate risk strategy</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, companies are under pressure from their customers, employees and shareholders to be more sustainable. People increasingly view <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/sustainability%22%20HYPERLINK%20%22https://www.ibm.com/topics/sustainability">sustainability</a> as a crucial element in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/corporate-social-responsibility">corporate and social responsibility</a> initiatives. Organizations must reduce their impact on the planet by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/energy-management">driving down energy consumption</a> and waste. They also need to ensure they can continue to operate in the face of climate risk. In some business sectors, such as financial services, fast-moving consumer goods and healthcare, business interruptions can have a significant detrimental impact on daily life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regulations help shareholders, employees and business partners understand the impact a company has on the environment:&nbsp;</p>



 
 The <a href="https://www.sec.gov/securities-topics/climate-esg%22%20/h%20%20HYPERLINK%20%22https://www.sec.gov/securities-topics/climate-esg">US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a> has new rules mandating certain disclosures for climate-related risks as well as reporting on Scope 1 and Scope 2 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/greenhouse-gas-emissions%22%20HYPERLINK%20%22https://www.ibm.com/topics/greenhouse-gas-emissions">greenhouse gas emissions for some companies</a>.  



 In the EU, the <a href="https://finance.ec.europa.eu/capital-markets-union-and-financial-markets/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-reporting/corporate-sustainability-reporting_en">Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)</a> came into force in January 2023, strengthening the rules around the environmental information companies must disclose.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Leaders must evaluate the types of climate hazards their organizations should prepare for and identify the locations most at risk from climate change. They should also assess how severe the financial impact of these climate hazards might be on their organizations. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Apart from operational and financial considerations, there’s a moral obligation. Businesses that have the power to help address the climate emergency should do so.&nbsp;</p>



 How can businesses adapt and maintain resiliency against climate risk? &nbsp; 



<p>As organizations shift to a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/decarbonization">lower-carbon economy</a>, they might be able to save costs by reducing the use of energy, materials and water. New low-emission products and services might also help a company compete by winning more sales from environmentally conscious buyers. By strengthening their resilience against climate risks (for example, introducing redundancy in supply chains), organizations can also be more resilient against other risks.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">Artificial intelligence (AI)</a> can play an important role in many solutions for tackling climate risk. In India, for example, the states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are in a region of extreme summers and winters. Their state governments must order electricity for their citizens in advance, and they used to predict demand manually by using spreadsheets. Predicting energy consumption is closely linked to weather patterns. Therefore, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/mercados-emi">the states worked with Mercados EMI</a>, a consultancy firm specializing in the energy sector, to build an AI-based demand forecasting system that uses weather pattern data and electricity demand data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the US, the Texas Department of Agriculture identified climate change as a potential threat to the state’s food supply. The state experienced one of its driest years on record in 2022. Smallholder farmers didn’t know how much water to use for specific crops. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/ibm-and-texas-am-agrilife-provide-data-technology-and-expertise-to-farmers-in-need/%22%20HYPERLINK%20%22https://www.ibm.com/blog/ibm-and-texas-am-agrilife-provide-data-technology-and-expertise-to-farmers-in-need/">IBM and Texas A&amp;M AgriLife developed a tool</a> that uses low-cost soil sensors and weather forecast data from the IBM® Environmental Intelligence Suite together with crop-specific information. The solution helps farmers avoid overwatering and underwatering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Costa Rica, Ecuador, Colombia, Chile and Argentina, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/food-security-smallholder-farmers/%22%20HYPERLINK%20%22https://www.ibm.com/blog/food-security-smallholder-farmers/">over 1,300 farmers are piloting a mobile app that gives farmers training</a> on using weather data, agronomic data and carbon footprint calculations to adapt to climate change. &nbsp;</p>



<p>These stories show that organizations can use climate data and AI to improve their decision-making and their resilience against climate risks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With climate change posing a significant threat to many businesses, and regulatory change intensifying the pressure to mitigate those risks, now is the time for organizations to draw up a climate risk adaptation strategy.&nbsp;For more information, visit our <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/environmental-intelligence-suite/climate-risk">Climate risks insights page</a>.</p>

<p>Certificate lifespan is getting shorter</p>
<p>Over the years the cybersecurity industry has undergone notable transformations requiring organizations to implement new best-practice standards, often at a short notice.</p>
<p>In 2020, Apple unilaterally opted for shorter TLS certificate durations, reducing them from three years to 398 days, thereby increasing the burden on certificate management. Subsequently, Apple introduced shorter lifespans for S/MIME certificates at the start of 2022. In the past year, both code signing and S/MIME users faced additional alterations, while <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/04/googles-90-day-proposal-for-tls-certificates/">Google proposed transitioning to 90-day certificates</a>, a subject we have explored in our <a href="https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/17380/608200?utm_source=brighttalk-portal&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=player-page-feed&amp;utm_content=summit-page">latest webinar</a>. Anticipating further changes, particularly with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and the looming risk of post-quantum (PQ) computing, organizations must enhance their agility.</p>
<p>Today, TLS/SSL certificates are typically valid for about a year, according to the Certification Authority Browser (CA/B) Forum requirements. This yearly renewal cycle is convenient for organizations to manage and schedule. However, transitioning to shorter-lived certificates, like the proposed 90-day validity period, will require more frequent renewal efforts. With 90-day validity, organizations will need to renew certificates four times every 12 months within that timeframe. In practice, due to the need for buffer time, certificates may need to be renewed every 60 days. Ultimately, this change could lead to replacing certificates more than six times every 12 months, depending on the renewal window chosen.</p>
<p>Enterprises will be required to handle both the management of digital certificates within their systems and the reverification of their domains every 90 days. According to Google’s <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/root-ca-policy/moving-forward-together/">Moving Forward, Together</a> initiative “more timely domain validation will better protect domain owners while also reducing the potential for a CA to mistakenly rely on stale, outdated, or otherwise invalid information resulting in certificate mis-issuance and potential abuse.”</p>
<p>Shorter certificate lifecycles will drive automation</p>
<p>Shorter-lived certificates offer numerous advantages, with automation being the foremost benefit. Google and other root programs advocate for automation to streamline certificate lifecycle management. Additionally, shorter certificate validity aligns with the upcoming adoption of post-quantum cryptography (PQC). PQC algorithms lack a proven track record as they are still relatively new. Consequently, there’s a necessity to potentially switch algorithms more frequently, with an unpredictable timeframe, including the vulnerability window of existing algorithms to quantum computer attacks. Automation plays a crucial role in supporting this increased renewal frequency.</p>
<p>Industry calls for automation to reduce security risks</p>
<p>While the 90-day proposal from Google has not officially been discussed in the CA/Browser Forum, both certification authorities and certificate consumers agree that automation is a necessity for a smooth transition to certificates with a shorter validity period. We can see a similar recommendation in <a href="https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/publication/1800-16/">NIST Special Publication 1800-16</a>:</p>
<p>“Automation should be used wherever possible for the enrollment, installation, monitoring, and replacement of certificates, or justification should be provided for continuing to use manual methods that may cause operational security risks.”</p>
<p>Challenges of a 90-day certificate validity period for organizations</p>
<p>The need for TLS certificate workflows to be done multiple times a year means an increased workload for certificate operations, server owners, infrastructure, and webmaster teams. The inability to renew the domain verification and replace certificates at a rapid pace may increase the risk of outages. Additionally, the automated solutions do not guarantee a one-size-fits-all approach, as each context and organization has unique requirements and constraints.</p>
<p>Next steps</p>
<p>We strongly recommend that you consider your next steps and plan your strategy with these key points in mind:</p>
 
 Spend the time to prepare for a 90-day or shorter maximum certificate lifetime future so that you can seamlessly handle the change 
 Start thinking about your security model(s) and <a href="https://www.entrust.com/solutions/post-quantum-cryptography">post-quantum</a> readiness 
 Consider how you pay for your certificates and evaluate how <a href="https://go.entrust.com/SSL-Flex2">subscriptions</a> can provide more deterministic costs 
 Invest in robust <a href="https://www.entrust.com/products/digital-certificates/tls-ssl/entrust-certificate-services">certificate management</a> capabilities 
 Focus on standards-based APIs and integrations 
 Plan a path to support 100% automation, even if it means applying a hybrid approach for different parts of your organization

<p>Businesses seeking to accelerate <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/business-sustainability">sustainability</a> initiatives must take an integrated approach that brings together all business and technology functions. Sustainability is no longer the responsibility of only the chief sustainability officer (CSO). It is not managed by a single department in a silo. Driving true sustainable impact, at scale, takes place when an enterprise is fully aligned to that <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/sustainability-transformation">transformation</a>. To scale progress in combating climate change, this alignment and collaboration must happen across value chain partners, ecosystems, and industries.</p>



 Sustainability and ESG: An opportunity for synergy 



<p>Sustainability and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/environmental-social-and-governance">ESG</a> are not synonymous. While ESG seeks to provide standard methods and approaches to measuring across environmental, social and governance KPIs, and holds organizations accountable for that performance, sustainability is far broader. ESG can serve as a vehicle to progress sustainability but it can also distract from the urgent need of combating climate change and working toward the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">17 UN SDGs</a>.</p>



<p>As we have seen with any sort of external reporting liabilities, this type of accountability does drive action. It’s our responsibility to ensure we don’t just do ESG reporting for the sake of reporting, and that it doesn’t impede actual progress in sustainability. We must ensure ESG progress and sustainability are driving towards a common goal. The reality is companies might be ready to fund ESG initiatives, but not as ready to fund ‘sustainability’ initiatives.</p>



<p>If designed intentionally, these do not have to be separate initiatives. When something is ‘regulatory,’ ‘mandatory,’ or ‘involuntary,’ companies have no choice but to find a way. A pre-existing sustainability office may find resources or funds shifted to ESG, or a reprioritization of targets based on ESG measurements. However, to capture both the business value behind ESG compliance as well as its ability to drive impact, it requires a holistic approach that strategically captures these synergies. &nbsp;</p>



<p>We are helping our clients maximize those investments, leveraging the requirements of ESG to drive compliance as well as sustainability. Our clients are improving their ability to measure and track progress against ESG metrics, while concurrently operationalizing sustainability transformation.</p>



 Maximizing value with a holistic strategy 



<p>The first step in maximizing that dual value is upfront due diligence. It is necessary to assess the current state of reporting readiness, the alignment between ESG requirements and voluntary sustainability initiatives, and any consideration on how to drive acceleration with future-proofed solutions. Questions might include:</p>



 
 Where is the organization relative to its required and voluntary sustainability goals? 



 Have the sustainability goals evolved in response to recent regulation or market shifts?&nbsp; 



 How aligned is the sustainability strategy to the business strategy?&nbsp; 



 Is ownership of delivering sustainability goals distributed throughout the organization or is every leader aware of how they are expected to contribute? 



 How is sustainability managed—as an annual measuring exercise or an ongoing effort that supports business transformation? 



 What regulations are owned by specific functional areas that may contribute to a broader ESG roadmap if viewed holistically? 



 Are there in flight business or technology initiatives where I can embed these requirements? 
 



<p>Up until recently, sustainability was most likely handled by one central team. Now, functional areas across the organization are recognizing their role in measuring ESG progress as well as their opportunities to help make their company more sustainable. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Similar to a company executing any corporate strategy, progress is made when the organization understands it, and employees are aware of how they play a role in bringing it to life. All leaders must enable teams and departments to understand how sustainability is part of the corporate strategy. They must provide the enablement and tools so these teams can integrate the overarching sustainability purpose and objectives within the corporate strategy into their respective roles in accelerating sustainable outcomes.</p>



<p>I see a clear shift in companies becoming more aware that they must work across departments to drive sustainability. A company cannot report on <a href="https://ghgprotocol.org/corporate-value-chain-scope-3-standard">scope 3 category 7 of employee commute</a> without employee data from HR or facilities management data, or without the technology platform and data governance to have an auditable view of that data. Businesses cannot prove there is no forced labor in their supply chain without working with procurement to understand their supplier base, where they are located, and what might be high risk, and then solution to embed proactive risk management in vendor onboarding.&nbsp;</p>



 Embedding sustainability in practice 



<p>Accountability is where an enterprise can ensure that sustainability is embedded and activated. The idea of embedding is integrating it into the day-to-day role. It’s enabling employees to make informed decisions and understanding the climate impact based on that decision. Any business or investment decision has a profit lever, a cost lever, and sometimes a performance lever, such as an Service Level Agreement (SLA). Now, sustainability can be a lever to truly embed impact into everyday operations. Employees can make more sustainable decisions knowing the tradeoff and impact.</p>



<p>A recent study from the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/sustainability-business-value">IBM Institute for Business Value</a> surveyed 5,000 global C-suite executives across 22 industries to find out why sustainability isn’t generating more impact for organizations. The study found companies were just “doing sustainability,” or approaching sustainability as a compliance task or accounting exercise rather than a business transformation accelerator.</p>



<p>Executives recognize the importance of data to achieve sustainability objectives; 82% of the study’s respondents agree that high-quality data and transparency are necessary to succeed. However, a consistent challenge they encounter in driving both ESG reporting and sustainable transformation is the shared reality is that companies cannot manage what they cannot measure.</p>



<p>Data not only provides the quantitative requirements for ESG metrics, it also provides the visibility to manage the performance of those metrics. If the employees of a company don’t have the data, they cannot publish financial grade reporting, identify opportunities for decarbonization, or validate progress towards becoming a more sustainable company.</p>



<p>One point addressed in our study surrounds the data specific challenges that can come with sustainability. Findings revealed that “despite recognizing the link between data and sustainability success, only 4 in 10 organizations can automatically source sustainability data from core systems such as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/enterprise-resource-planning">ERP</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/enterprise-asset-management">enterprise asset management</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/crm">CRM</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/energy-management">energy management</a>, and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/facilities-management">facilities management</a>.”</p>



<p>When clients embed the right processes and organizational accountability across ESG reporting and sustainability, they can make sure they are getting the right information and data into the hands of the right people, often system owners. Those ‘right people’ can now make more informed decisions in their respective roles and scale transformation from one team to the entire organization while also incorporating these needs of ESG data capture, collection, and ingestion for the sake of both reporting and operationalizing. <a></a></p>



<p>The study found organizations that successfully embedded sustainability approached the data usability challenge through a firmer data foundation and better <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-governance">data governance</a>. The criticality of a clear data strategy and foundation brings us to our final topic: how <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai">generative AI</a> can further accelerate sustainability.</p>



 Utilizing generative AI to embed sustainability 



<p>There are many different applications for generative AI when it comes to embedding sustainability, especially when it comes to filling in data gaps. The data needed for ESG and sustainability reporting is immense and complex. Oftentimes, companies don’t have it available or have the correct protocols to align their data and sustainability strategies.</p>



<p>Most clients, regardless of the size of the company, have sustainability teams that are stretched, trying to manually chase data instead of focusing on what the data is saying. Generative AI can unlock productivity potential, accelerating data collection and ingestion reconciliation. As an example, instead of sustainability teams manually collecting and reviewing paper fuel receipts, technology can help translate receipt images into the necessary data elements for fuel-related metrics. This allows these teams to spend more time on how to optimize fuel use for decarbonization, using time for data insights instead of time chasing the data.</p>



<p>By spending all your time on reconciling invoices or collecting physical fuel receipts, how are you or others in your organization going to have the time to understand the data and in turn make changes to drive sustainability? If time is spent collecting data and then pulling together reports, there is little time left to garner actionable insights from that data and enact change. Systems and processes must be in place so that an organization can drive sustainability performance, while meeting ESG reporting requirements, and not use all of its resources and funding on data management that provides eventual visibility without the capacity to use it for impact.</p>



<p>As mentioned in the study, generative AI can be a “game changer for data-driven sustainability, enabling organizations to turn trade-offs into win-wins, identify improvement opportunities, and drive innovation at speed and scale.” It is little wonder why 73% of surveyed executives say they plan to increase their investment in generative AI for sustainability.</p>



<p>To truly leverage the power of generative AI tomorrow, companies must first understand their data readiness today. Then, we can prioritize how generative AI can improve existing data for visibility and use that data for performance insights.</p>



<p>Companies can identify immediate opportunities for generative AI to help them move faster, while concurrently ensuring that the core data collection and management is established to support current and future reporting needs. We want our clients to focus on leveraging ESG reporting to have a return on investment (ROI) financially, as well as in driving sustainable impact. While external mandatory requirements will be a driver for where an organization’s budget is allocated, organizations can intentionally embed sustainability as a part of those initiatives to capture the full value of their transformation efforts.</p>

 IDnow explores the UK’s attitudes toward fraud prevention technology and the steps they’re taking to protect themselves. 



 



<p>Our recently released UK Fraud Awareness Report revealed worrying behavioral trends, such as a third of the public sharing ID documents via unencrypted channels and almost half of respondents not knowing what deepfakes were.</p>



<p>For an overview of the UK’s education gap when it comes to fraud, read our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/attitudes-awareness-uk-fraud/">blog, ‘What does the UK really know about fraud?’</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the second of a three-part series, we explore the nation’s attitudes toward fraud-prevention technology and the steps Brits are willing to take to protect themselves.</p>



 Fight fraud with biometrics. 



<p>Biometric identification, such as automated facial recognition, is an optimal way of identifying business partners and customers, achieving security goals and complying with regulatory requirements. Our survey discovered that almost two-thirds of Brits (63%) were already using biometric technology, like fingerprint scans or FaceID, to access their online bank accounts, or approve bank transfers, with another 10% planning on using it in the future.</p>



<p>Less than a quarter of the population (24%) do not use biometric technology and do not plan on using it in the future.</p>

 Customer journeys: Start as you mean to go on. 



<p>The odd adage ‘start as you mean to go on’ rings true in every walk of life, especially in business, and especially at the beginning of a customer journey. Onboarding, the point at which the identity of the user is established and verified, is one of the most vulnerable stages for fraud. This is why service providers, especially banks or insurance companies, often establish more secure, but lengthier onboarding processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While speedy, seamless customer journeys are incredibly important, especially in the digital world, 75%&nbsp;of the UK population said they would be willing to go through lengthier online onboarding processes for accounts connected to larger sums or investments, if it made it safer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the UK, over <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy/">£3 billion is lost to fraud every single year</a>. According to our survey, while over half of Brits (54%) would move banks, if they were to become a victim of banking fraud, almost a quarter (24%) would remain loyal and stay with their bank, while another 21% were unsure what they would do in the event of banking fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lovro Persen, Director Document Management &amp; Fraud at IDnow said that this should act as a wake-up call for traditional banks and fintechs that want to protect their customers, and in turn their business. ““Between deepfake videos and spoof texts that pretend to be from banks, it’s becoming harder for consumers to know what’s genuine and what is fraud. Meanwhile, huge amounts of data are stored online, making everyone ever-more vulnerable to data breaches.”</p>



<blockquote><p>While technology can be a curse when it comes to tackling fraud, it also has the potential to be a solution to the problem.</p>Lovro Persen, Director Document Management &amp; Fraud at IDnow.</blockquote>



 Preferred identity verification methods. 



<p>The digital identity verification market has never been healthier. Most industries are either required by regulation to implement identity verification checks or have chosen to do to optimize processes or fight fraud. Such checks are required for <a href="https://www.idnow.io/traditional-banking/">account opening in Banking</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">compliance checks in Crypto</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/">age verification in Mobility</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/travel/">streamlined check-in processes in Travel</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">financial risk checks in Gambling,</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/telecommunication/">contract signing in Telecommunication</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed, there were&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/identity-first-future-trends-2024/">61 billion digital identity verification check</a>s conducted in 2023, a number that is predicted to grow by 16% to 71 billion by the end of 2024. In a world of just 8 billion people, these numbers are simply staggering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Identity verification requires users to provide and have information associated with their identity verified. This may be a physical identity document, such as a driver’s license, passport, or a nationally issued identity document. Identity verification services can range from automated, expert-led to in-person. Each method fulfils different security, regulatory and convenience requirements. &nbsp;</p>



<p>There are numerous different methods of identity verification.</p>



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/automated-identity-verification/">Automated identity verification</a> provides seamless 24/7 online experiences, enabling businesses to grow and scale with confidence, without compromising on security or data privacy. We offer extensive data checks from diverse and trusted sources, including official databases and credible records to confirm the existence of a legitimate identity in an intuitive and frictionless way. We also can validate more than 3,000 identity documents from 195 countries and growing. Our automated identity verification solutions leverage the latest in facial recognition and liveness technologies for seamless biometric verification, utilizing liveness, selfies and video to confirm the existence of an identity and that the person is physically present during the verification process.<br>  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/expert-led-verification/">Expert-led video verification</a> ensures optimal KYC customization while maintaining a balance between security and accessibility. Our face-to-face video verification with expert assistance allows businesses to compare photo taken during account creation process with photo from identity document. And, with liveness detection, you can add an additional layer of assurance to detect and protect against a variety of presentation attacks. Our specially-trained experts ask specific questions to identify social engineering. Expert-led identity verification can also help organizations improve inclusivity, accessibility, safety and convenience. Protect your most vulnerable customers and ensure they don’t miss out on the services they deserve.<br>  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/in-person-verification/">In-person identity verification</a> enables your customers to have their identities verified at a public location, such as a gas station, near them. It also allows businesses to perform Point of Sale (POS) identification processes on-site. In-person verification ensures compliance with the German Money Laundering Act (GwG) and the Telecommunications Act (TKG) and a premium high-touch experience that doesn’t compromise on the speed and convenience of a digital solution.  



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer (KYC) processes</a> are an integral part of identity verification and are crucial for businesses to protect their customers – and themselves – from fraudsters. KYC can ensure the power of identity is put back in the hands of the people it belongs to and the businesses they are trying to interact with.</p>



 



    



 



<p>According to the UK’s Fraud Awareness Report, the most popular method of identity verification in the UK is a combination of data checks and document / facial recognition. Although not particularly commonplace in the UK, 9% of Brits said they would trust a human agent conducting a live video verification call. In Germany, this is considered the most secure and accurate method of identity check, as the fraud expert&nbsp;can pick up emotional signs of distress or suspicious behavior.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, around a fifth (19%) of respondents do not know what method to trust the most, which reveals a deeper lack of understanding of the different verification methods, their benefits and their drawbacks. This is something that should be addressed as part of ongoing fraud education efforts.</p>

<p>The global adoption of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai">generative AI</a> is upon us, and it’s essential for marketing organizations to understand and play in this space to stay competitive. With content demands expected to grow in the next few years, organizations need to create more content at a faster pace to meet customer expectations and business needs. Knowing how to manifest these improvements is not always clear: Enter generative AI and the content supply chain.</p>


<a href="https://ibm.co/content-supply-chain">Get the study: The Revolutionary Content Supply Chain</a>



<p>A <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/3-ways-ibm-and-adobe-are-transforming-content-supply-chains-with-generative-ai/">content supply chain</a> brings together people, processes, and technology to effectively plan, create, produce, launch, measure, and manage content. It encompasses an end-to-end content journey—a journey that can create faster time to value. We know that infusing generative AI into the content supply chain will enable companies to produce more personalized content faster and more efficiently. So, what is stopping companies from delivering content with generative AI across their content supply chain?</p>



 Leadership and the content supply chain 



<p>The advent of generative AI is raising several questions and concerns for leaders. In recent years organizations have been concerned with their ability to create and deliver content fast enough to meet customer expectations, and now that generative AI could address those issues, another question comes to the fore: Can we trust AI tools and technology to augment employees. Leaders across the world are experiencing a mix of emotions when it comes to implementing and embracing generative AI. There is excitement, curiosity, and a bit of angst—sometimes felt simultaneously. Most of us are familiar with the term “FOMO”, or fear of missing out. But people are also feeling “FOGI”, fear of getting in, with generative AI.</p>



<p>The FOMO these organizations face relates to not being able to create content fast enough to keep up with expectations or wasting money on tools that may not turn out to be as efficient as once thought. The FOGI concern revolves around trust, and whether they can trust the AI tools and technology to augment employees. Will the outputs deliver content that will resonate with their customers? Can they trust the AI will operate in a secure way? Can they trust that the AI will reward the initial individual creator? Can they trust that what’s created isn’t going to break any brand guidelines?</p>



<p>This blog and the IBM Institute for Business Value study <a href="https://ibm.co/content-supply-chain">The Revolutionary Content Supply Chain</a> aim to answer these questions to help &nbsp;executives and their employees to better understand the changing landscape in content creation and embrace the power of generative AI models when it comes to optimizing their content supply chains.</p>



 A new way to create and manage content 



<p>Any new concept or major change comes with some hesitancy and push back. Change isn’t linear; it requires strategic change management to deal with the transition. Employees and executives alike struggle to take on a new way of thinking or working when they’ve been operating the same way for years. Modernizing a workflow to introduce a content supply chain means disruption and uncertainty. But it also means creating an end-to-end content journey that is fast and accurate and, ultimately, meets customers at the level of their expectations.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/change-management">Change management</a> is a crucial part of adopting a new content supply chain and trusting the process. These new technologies can garner a lot of power and a level of uncertainty. However, the adoption of generative AI and a content supply chain can be a massive opportunity for your organization.</p>



<p>Respondents to the study are “keenly aware” of where their content processes need improvement. 88% said they need an easier way to access approved assets for activation across applications and 79% want to experiment with content, audience, and experience variation to drive customer engagement and the customer experience.</p>



<p>As described in the IBM Institute for Business Value study, an ad hoc “Frankenstein” like system that engages a variety of platforms and tools, can turn to a consolidated system and operating model to meet the increasing demand for more and more data integration, content generation, and intelligent automation.</p>



<p>Separately, the findings from the study show that while most respondents are already engaging with generative AI, a very small number—just 2%—are optimizing the technology. Organizations are seeking out new approaches to managing their content supply chain and generative AI embedded in platforms, such as Adobe Firefly, could be the most impactful.&nbsp;</p>



 Understanding the potential of generative AI 



<p>Generative AI isn’t just for one area of a business. Instead, it can help content creators across many functions, such as marketing, customer support, product development, operations, and more. The study found 95% of respondents agree that generative AI will be a game changer. And nearly all CMOs surveyed believe that generative AI will free up marketing teams from mundane tasks so they can focus on more creative endeavors.</p>



<p>Content supply chains and generative AI are still very much in the early days, but it’s important to power your ecosystem prior to engagement. For these new technologies to be successful, it means bringing together different business units and stakeholders to align on a shared vision. More than 80% respondents report already engaging with generative AI. Additionally, almost three in four (74%) report that they’re still in a pilot mode, while just a quarter have gone beyond pilots to start implementation.</p>



<p>In addition to internal ecosystems, it’s also important to power your external ecosystem so that external parties—such as Adobe, IBM and AWS—can work together to enable generative AI to supercharge a content supply chain. Specifically, the study points out, many organizations are taking a hybrid approach to AI by blending their proprietary models with best-in-class SaaS platforms infused with AI and public and open-source models. It’s no surprise that adoption of AI has been so popular given its wide swathe of activities across the full content supply chain journey.</p>



<p>To deliver the most value from generative AI, taking the time to set a solid foundation is key. It is clear there is still a lot of work to be done, with only 5% of respondents saying they have an organization-wide approach for generative AI best practices and governance, and half of organizations still in the process of establishing these measures.</p>



 Setting a solid foundation for generative AI 



<p>We’ve established the benefits that generative AI has to offer and the potential it can bring to transform the content supply chain. But with major transformations such as these come potential risks and any organization interested in generative AI should be taking steps to mitigate said risks.</p>



<p>The IBM Institute for Business Value study found 43% of survey respondents confess their organizations have not set up an AI ethics council. Beyond ethics risks, the study points out, there are also cost risks to consider. Organizations must weigh the impact that a content supply chain expansion fueled by generative AI will have on their back-end technologies. If organizations are aiming to produce more content, then more high-performance computing is required and could in turn increase on-premises computing costs.</p>



<p>These risks must be assessed in the context of benefits and trusting the generative AI tool your organization chooses to implement. The end-to-end makeup of an enterprise content supply chain is one of its biggest advantages, but is also one of its biggest challenges, with ownership being one of the main areas of contention. The respondents’ answers varied widely when it came to who was the primary owner of their content supply chain.</p>



<p>Therefore, it’s no surprise that many respondents surveyed said they are worried about the potential for organizational silos, complex stakeholders and competing agendas. The lack of change management strategy for new processes and tools is apparent across organizations and needs to be addressed in order content supply chain to set up the content supply chain for success. Instead of moving quickly to demonstrate positive outcomes and ultimately shortchanging this long-game effort, organizations need to take preliminary action at the requirements-gathering stage. By doing so, it enables trust from employees who then help to navigate the transformation within their teams and across the organization.</p>



 Revolutionizing the content supply chain 



<p>The disruptive nature of generative AI can feel overwhelming, but through long-term change management and trust, organizations can transform their content supply chain and be the catalyst for a needed organizational culture shift.</p>



<p>The study highlights the advantages of content supply chain. It provides readers and clients a better understanding of how generative AI can enhance outcomes and overcome some of the operational challenges suppressing progress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Content supply chain transformation touches many functions and requires cooperation across executives. The study provides a detailed breakdown of practical actions for key C-suite executives, including CMOs, CTOs, and CFOs, to help prepare them for content supply chain enhancements.</p>



<p>Generative AI is changing the world and now is the time to establish your organization as a leader in your industry. Get started by embracing the technology and ensuring your organization has the right internal and external ecosystems to manage the transformation. Breaking down silos is not easy and won’t be fast, but organizations taking the more calculated route will lay the groundwork for innovation that can keep up with the pace of change brought to bear by generative AI. This is only the beginning. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Ever since <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/05/19/a-short-history-of-chatgpt-how-we-got-to-where-we-are-today/?sh=66fdb2ca674f">ChatGPT</a> debuted in November 2022, the hype and hysteria surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) has continued to accelerate. Indeed, rarely can you read an article or watch a news clip without AI being inserted into the conversation. With AI-enabled <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202402/the-law-is-not-keeping-up-with-ai-deepfake-fraud-and-it-will-only-get-worse">deepfakes</a>, AI-displaced workers, alleged AI theft of intellectual property, and AI-fueled cyberattacks, the <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/risk-and-resilience/our-insights/as-gen-ai-advances-regulators-and-risk-functions-rush-to-keep-pace">raging debate</a> is not only if and how to regulate AI, but also when and by whom.</p>
 Global Legislative Developments and Directives 
<p>Early calls for AI governance and industry self-regulation seem to be giving way to more rigid and enforceable legislative efforts. Afterall, world leaders are loath to repeat the unregulated social media experiment of the past 20 years that led to such unforeseen consequences as the rampant dissemination of misinformation and disinformation, fueling political and social upheaval.</p>
<p>To wit, the European Union is on the verge of passing the first comprehensive piece of legislation with the <a href="https://hbr.org/2024/02/the-eus-ai-act-and-how-companies-can-achieve-compliance">AI Act</a>, which promises to set the global benchmark for AI, much like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) did for data privacy protection. The AI Act provides prescriptive risk-based rules as to when AI can and cannot be employed, with severe penalties for non-compliers that include up to 7 percent of an enterprise’s global annual revenue.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the White House issued the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/">Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence Executive Order</a> this past fall, which is more expansive than the EU AI Act, contemplating everything from consumer fraud to weapons of mass destruction. The order demands more transparency from AI companies on how their models work and provides labeling standards for AI-generated content. However, an executive order is not a legislative act and the U.S. has already started down a decentralized path with individual states proposing their own legislation, including California’s <a href="https://statescoop.com/california-bill-would-form-new-ai-regulation-division/">Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Systems Act</a>, which aims to protect consumer privacy and promote ethical standards in the use of AI. Among provisions for transparency, accountability, and public engagement the <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/privacy-and-data-security/californias-draft-ai-privacy-rules-show-ambitious-approach">draft rules</a> would require companies to conduct regular assessments of their AI systems to ensure compliance.</p>
 Perspectives and Considerations on AI Regulation 
<p>Proponents of AI legislation cite the protection of health, safety, fundamental human rights, democracy, rule of law, and the environment as paramount. However, others are concerned that legislation will hobble their domestic industry, ceding profits and AI supremacy to others, especially bad actors. On this note, the UK has taken a decidedly contrarian position with a <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/artificial-intelligence/2024/united-kingdom-government-takes-pro-innovation-ai-approach-contrast-europe?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Main%20NL%2002/28&amp;utm_term=Main%20Newsletter">pro-innovation AI approach</a> that provides a policy of non-binding principles. Still others feel that <a href="https://medium.com/60-leaders/to-regulate-or-not-how-should-governments-react-to-the-ai-revolution-c254d176304f#:~:text=%2D%20AI%20is%20a%20powerful%20technology,reducing%20the%20risk%20of%20abuse">AI does not warrant new or different regulation than traditional software</a>, stating that the only difference between the two is the ratio of data-driven to rule-driven outcomes, which does make AI behavior less transparent but not less deterministic.</p>
<p>Then there is the conversation around AI ethics and empathy, or rather the lack thereof. Those favoring a more laissez-faire approach to AI regulation assert that regulating empathy and ethics is not really an AI problem per se but embedded in the historical data on which the <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3697649/what-are-large-language-models-and-how-are-they-used-in-generative-ai.html">large language models</a> (LLMs) are trained. And this will take time to resolve with or without AI, and with or without regulation.</p>
<p>It seems regulators are damned if they do and damned if they don’t. No one wants to be the hapless bureaucrat that inadvertently enabled Skynet in the Terminator movie series, or the overeager regulator that quashed domestic innovation on the eve of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, ceding AI global leadership and economic prosperity for generations to come.</p>
<p>The path forward will be a balancing act, but the guiding star should be one in which AI is beneficial to all of humanity, regardless of country, status, or any other factor. A popular framework in this regard is that of Harmless, Honest, and Helpful AI. Initially proposed by the team at <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/training-a-helpful-and-harmless-assistant-with-reinforcement-learning-from-human-feedback">Anthropic</a>, this approach focuses on reinforcement learning from human feedback and supervised fine-tuning to align a model that roots out inaccuracy, bias, and toxicity. This more curated approach can also help ensure that the AI is more secure as it can avoid eliciting a harmful and untrue output, and flag vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>For more than 100 years, IBM’s founding principles have inspired efforts to promote equality, fairness and inclusion in the workplace and society. The company has lived the value of “respect for the individual” by championing employment practices that reward ability over identity and that make work more attainable for all.</p>



<p>In 1935, approximately twenty years after IBM was founded, it began hiring women into professional roles. Three decades before the US Equal Pay Act of 1963, IBM’s CEO, Thomas J. Watson Sr., stated, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/history/diversity-policies#:~:text=IBM%20began%20hiring%20women%20into,month%20sales%20course%20at%20Endicott.">“Men and women will do the same kind of work for equal pay. They will have the same treatment, the same responsibilities, and the same opportunities for advancement.”</a></p>



<p>Through the years, many women have held leadership roles at IBM, including former CEO, Ginni Rometty. Women have played key roles in initiatives throughout the organization, including the rise of AI.</p>



<p>“Women are as capable as anybody else to contribute to the technical development of AI, and they also care deeply about the impact of AI on people and society. This combination is exactly what we need now, to design and build a future with purpose, where technology supports human values rather than the opposite. An increased presence of women in AI will also make it fairer and more inclusive. A multi-disciplinary approach to AI education is fundamental to help women understand that this is a great match for their talent and passion.”&nbsp; -Francesca Rossi, IBM Fellow, AI Ethics Global Leader, IBM Research</p>



<p>As IBM continued to research and develop AI, it became clear that along with the positive aspects of the technology, there were also potential issues that needed attention. “AI will have a transformative impact on everyday life, business and more. As with other technologies, there are ethical components that must be followed to build systems based on trust,” says Justina Nixon-Saintil, Chief Impact Officer and AI Ethics Board member at IBM. “In our historical experience at IBM, we know women play a fundamental role in shaping the future. That’s why two women IBMers led the way when we established our AI Ethics Board, and that’s why we are using our technology and expertise to empower more girls and women in ethical AI, among many other areas.”</p>



<p>Since 2019, the AI Ethics Board has been co-chaired by two leaders: Christina Montgomery (Vice President, Chief Privacy and Trust Officer) and Francesca Rossi (IBM Fellow, and AI Ethics Global Leader). Their unique backgrounds and views have helped the Board instill governance and a culture of ethical and responsible technology throughout IBM.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The AI Ethics Board is comprised of leaders from across the company, including many esteemed women leaders. Supporting the work of the AI Ethics Board and its members are its AI Ethics Focal Points. IBM is incredibly fortunate to have many women in leadership at this level as well.</p>



<p>Along with establishing policies and practices around AI ethics, the AI Ethics Board sponsors workstreams, which bring together experts from across the business to address key business challenges, questions and opportunities. These workstreams often include women as executive sponsors<a>.</a></p>



<p>A team of female leaders from the AI Ethics Board and IBM’s AI Ethics Project Office drew on experts from across IBM to publish this <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/expanding-on-ethical-considerations-of-foundation-models/?utm_source=slack&amp;utm_medium=blogshare&amp;utm_campaign=fm24refresh">point of view on foundation models</a>. They also collaborated with IBM Research and watsonx.governance™, led by Heather Gentile, Director of watsonx.governance Product Management and AI Ethics Focal Point. Together, they developed the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx-as-a-service?topic=ai-risk-atlas">AI risk atlas</a>, which helps readers better understand the risks of working with generative AI, foundation models and machine learning models.</p>



<p>“In this unprecedented new era of global AI innovation, women are leading the charge towards acknowledging that the importance of innovation is as much about its impact as it is about invention. This crucial work in confronting and mitigating the immediate and long-term risks that AI poses to our society is setting the standards for how we, as a global community, approach the integration of AI into our lives.” -Christina Montgomery, IBM Chief Privacy &amp; Trust Officer</p>



<p>For six years in a row, IBM has been listed as one of the <a href="https://worldsmostethicalcompanies.com/">World’s Most Ethical Companies</a> by Ethisphere. This recognition reflects IBM’s commitment to a strong governance structure and a culture of ethics, embodied in its AI Ethics Board and AI Ethics Focal Points. It also honors the strong women leading IBM forward.</p>

             March 2024   
	 
		 
			 Hong Kong’s Competitive Leap: Fueling Tokenization Growth Across Asia 
<p>This month, we attended the Digital Assets Week Hong Kong conference and were struck by the rapidly growing ecosystem surrounding tokenization in the region. The gathering of regulator SFC and major institutions at the event sent a strong message:&nbsp;Hong Kong is positioning itself as a frontrunner jurisdiction for the tokenization of securities.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>Hong Kong has witnessed the emergence of numerous live tokenized securities projects alongside the CBDC pilot program (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hkma.gov.hk/eng/news-and-media/press-releases/2023/02/20230216-3/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_xTXV0IF3iky4tWzu_yFdv-rUaTmO6tVEwN8nr9eLj4LcuI_j6fiUP59z0Vi0xsnSwGMZb">HKSAR Government tokenized a green bond</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theasset.com/article/50768/hgi-launches-first-tokenized-fund-in-hong-kong?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_xTXV0IF3iky4tWzu_yFdv-rUaTmO6tVEwN8nr9eLj4LcuI_j6fiUP59z0Vi0xsnSwGMZb">HGI tokenized a fund</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ubs.com/global/en/media/display-page-ndp/en-20240207-tokenized-warrant.html?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_xTXV0IF3iky4tWzu_yFdv-rUaTmO6tVEwN8nr9eLj4LcuI_j6fiUP59z0Vi0xsnSwGMZb">UBS tokenized warrant</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/3254551/hong-kong-launches-worlds-first-wholesale-cbdc-pilot-city-positions-itself-cutting-edge-blockchain?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_xTXV0IF3iky4tWzu_yFdv-rUaTmO6tVEwN8nr9eLj4LcuI_j6fiUP59z0Vi0xsnSwGMZb">wholesale CBDC pilot</a>, …). The regulator provides clear guidelines, nurturing tangible use cases.&nbsp;This fosters regional competition for leadership in tokenization, driving the industry and the region forward.</p>
<p>Specifically, on 2 November 2023, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) announced two circulars related to tokenized financial instruments: “<a href="https://apps.sfc.hk/edistributionWeb/gateway/EN/circular/doc?refNo=23EC52&amp;utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_xTXV0IF3iky4tWzu_yFdv-rUaTmO6tVEwN8nr9eLj4LcuI_j6fiUP59z0Vi0xsnSwGMZb">Circular on intermediaries engaging in tokenized securities-related activities</a>” and “<a href="https://apps.sfc.hk/edistributionWeb/gateway/EN/circular/doc?refNo=23EC53&amp;utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_xTXV0IF3iky4tWzu_yFdv-rUaTmO6tVEwN8nr9eLj4LcuI_j6fiUP59z0Vi0xsnSwGMZb">Circular on tokenization of SFC-authorized investment products</a>”.</p>
<p>The guideline is straightforward:&nbsp;same securities, same rules, but with digital controls.&nbsp;There are four points we want to highlight:</p>
 
 Open for retail investors:&nbsp;Evolved from March 2019 “Statement on Security Token Offerings” where security token offerings are restricted only to professional investors (PIs), the new circulars permit primary dealings of tokenized SFC-authorized investment products by retail investors. These offers have to be authorized under Part IV of the SFO or have complied with the prospectus regime and not fall under any other applicable exemption under the Public Offering Regimes. Otherwise, the offers can only be offered to PIs. 
 Same business, same risks, same rules:&nbsp;The new circulars define that tokenized securities are fundamentally traditional securities with a tokenization wrapper, the existing legal and regulatory requirements governing the traditional securities markets continue to apply to tokenized securities. 
 Blockchain agnostic: SFC recognized all types of blockchain networks, including private-permissioned, public-permissioned, and public-permissionless. However, issuers have to address risks by implementing adequate controls regardless of the blockchains they use. 
 New risks management: Issuers have to address risks related to ownership (e.g., how it is transferred and recorded) and technology (e.g., forking, network outages, and cybersecurity). Elizabeth Wong from SFC emphasized in a panel during the DAW conference that issuers have to demonstrate to the regulators they have controls over their tokenized securities (e.g., recover tokens). 
 
<p>Here is an illustrative example of tokenized funds by SFC:</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>The risks highlighted in the circulars can be addressed with open-source ERC-3643, the validated and audited permissioned token standard:</p>
 
 Enforce compliance&nbsp;to ensure adherence to existing laws, and only eligible investors can interact with tokens, regardless of blockchain type. 
 Track ownership through identity-based on-chain registries to maintain the integrity of ownership records. 
 Take full control&nbsp;over their tokenized security to freeze or recover tokens as needed. 
 Enable multichain capability&nbsp;to address forking and network outage issues. 
 Upgradable implementation of smart contracts&nbsp;to ensure flexibility to address any vulnerability of the smart contract or updates of regulation. 
 
<p>Moreover,&nbsp;the circular mandates due diligence for tokenization technology, highlighting the importance of partnering with established players. With over 6 years of proven experience and enterprise-grade certifications like SOC2, Tokeny is well-equipped to support the Hong Kong market.&nbsp;The regulatory framework is in place, the technology is primed, and the market is set for rapid evolution!</p>

<p>This is the transcript to my <a href="https://youtu.be/m8umHdZBbHM">YouTube explainer video</a> on the browser changes underway to replace the functionality of third-party cookies when it comes to authentication services. Likes and subscriptions are always welcome.</p>



<p>There are several web features out there that support critical, basic security features like logging in and logging out. Those same features enable tracking individuals as they surf the web. Unfortunately, fixing this is not as simple as turning those features off for trackers. From a purely technical perspective, whether these features are used for authentication-related purposes or tracking, they are indistinguishable from the web browser’s perspective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, of all the features described in a <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/03/16/understanding-browser-tracking-logins-the-invisible-trail/">previous post</a> that serve legitimate and clandestine purposes, third-party cookies are one of the more tractable problems to resolve. So, let’s look at where the work is happening, one of the new mechanisms being developed, and what the changes will look like.</p>



 The Role of the W3C in Browser Changes 



<p>The <a href="https://w3.org">World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C) is where most of the work happens between browser vendors and various other stakeholder groups to standardize functionality on the web. This global community effectively shapes the web, ensuring it’s secure, efficient, and open for everyone. Their work is crucial for the standards we rely on daily.</p>



<p>Diving into the details of how the W3C works is beyond the scope of this video, but feel free to reach out if you’d like to learn more!&nbsp;</p>



 Federated Credential Manager (FedCM) 



<p>Now, onto <a href="https://fedidcg.github.io/FedCM/">FedCM</a>. Developed by Google and incubated within the W3C, this API represents a significant shift in managing privacy and online authentication. As I mentioned earlier, a browser’s biggest challenge is distinguishing between acceptable use and hidden tracking. The purpose of the FedCM API is to help the browser determine whether a transaction is happening with the individual’s knowledge and consent. Let’s delve into how it works and why it matters.</p>



<p>Rather than acting like one of those annoying cookie banners, FedCM is designed to be called when an individual clicks on the login or sign-in button on a website. Before the website (the relying party, or RP) and the site responsible for authentication (the identity provider, or IdP) share any information, FedCM exists to mediate the transaction and make sure the individual is aware and ok with what’s happening.</p>



<p>Again, though, it’s not that easy. The FedCM developers must find a way to support some conflicting goals. For example:</p>



 
 Of course, the IdP needs to know what RP is asking for an authentication request! Our IdPs don’t talk to just anyone! 



 Of course, the IdP shouldn’t know anything about the RP! The IdP might track the sites the user visits! 
 



<p>Both statements reflect use cases that are 100% valid. There’s a reason this problem hasn’t been solved yet.</p>



 Other Initiatives 



<p>&nbsp;FedCM is just the tip of the iceberg. Google, Apple, Mozilla, and others are all innovating under the W3C’s umbrella, working together towards a more private web. These initiatives are reshaping our online experience. Some of their work focuses on enabling ethically targeted advertising (that’s happening in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/patcg/">Private Advertising Technology Community Group</a>. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/privacycg/">Privacy Community Group</a>, on the other hand, has more than a few efforts in incubation, including one that’s focused on link decoration, known there as navigation-based tracking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each browser vendor also has their own internal projects that influence (and are influenced by) what’s happening in the W3C. Google’s <a href="https://privacysandbox.com/">Privacy Sandbox</a> is the most public of these efforts and describes various tools they’re trying to build a more privacy-preserving web experience.</p>



 Google’s Cookie Countdown 



<p>Coming back to third-party cookies, a major milestone is approaching. In Q1 2024, Google begins turning off third-party cookies for <a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/privacy-sandbox-tracking-protection/">1% of Chrome users</a>. This test run is critical for their long-term privacy strategy. They are years behind Apple, a company that turned off <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/features/">third-party cookies in 2017</a> for Safari users. <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/firefox-rolls-out-total-cookie-protection-by-default-to-all-users-worldwide/">Firefox</a> turned off third-party cookies by default in April 2023. Any changes Google makes, though, impact far more people. The Chrome browser has, by far and away, the largest market share of desktop browsers. They are also part of a much larger company, Alphabet, which still has several products that require third-party cookies to be available.&nbsp;</p>



 Real-world Impacts and Preparations&nbsp; 



<p>This shift on Google’s part to turn off third-party cookies by default for just a tiny fraction of their users might seem minor, but its implications are vast. Organizations must prepare for potential challenges and educate their people on these evolving technologies. Support desks already know to check to see a browser’s settings, but not everyone can or will call support. Companies should start turning third-party cookies off by default now to develop their plans, including testing out FedCM, to adapt to the changes.</p>



 Proactive Organizational Strategies 



<p>It’s time for businesses that aren’t browser vendors to be proactive in helping the web develop. Develop strategies, train your teams, and help define the solutions.&nbsp; It’s not just about reacting; it’s about being prepared for a new era of the web. I’ve had this conversation with individuals representing dozens of organizations in the last three years, and the biggest challenge is the executives who are entirely focused on their bottom line. And I get that. These executives want to know what to do and when to do it. Until they have answers to those questions, they are not inclined to assign resources to help other organizations figure out solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But if these organizations want to make sure the web works the way they need it to, they need to invest in that bit of speculation. They need to assign people to test the proposed APIs and offer constructive feedback on how the code might be changed to suit their use cases.</p>



 Viewer Engagement and Further Learning&nbsp; 



<p>Eager to learn more about upcoming browser changes or get involved? There are links in the show notes to where the work is happening and how you can find out more. Your participation can influence the future of web privacy.</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>We’ve covered a lot today, from the W3C’s vital role to the specifics of FedCM and beyond. Remember, these changes are shaping a safer, more private web for us all. Stay curious, stay informed.

 As the 2024 Olympic Games approach, the city of Paris is preparing to welcome an unprecedented influx of visitors. Mobility operators must be ready to respond to a substantial number of new customers in a very short span of time. 



<p>Over the past decade, urban <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/">mobility</a> has experienced major alterations, driven by rapid technological change. While getting around has never been easier, experiences vary from one operator to another. The advent of mobile-first is leading mobility service providers to focus their mobility journey around mobile-usage, in favor of a resolutely simplified experience.</p>



<p>In a world where mobility is at the heart of our lives, the organization of large-scale events raises major challenges in terms of accessibility and security. From July 26 to August 11, 2024, France will host the Summer Olympic Games, and is preparing for an unprecedented influx of visitors. These foreign visitors, accustomed to other modes of mobility and transport, will have to familiarize themselves in a short span of time with sometimes unfamiliar travel and booking experiences. Paris is equipped with many different means of transport, combining micromobility, public transport, service providers, transport rental companies and car-sharing. For mobility operators, the question arises as to their ability to accommodate a substantial number of new customers in a very short amount of time.</p>



 Let the games begin: challenges facing mobility operators. 



<p>Transport and urban mobility operators face a number of challenges: rapid user authentication, age and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/driver-license-verification/">driver’s license verification</a>, and the collection of documentation and user information. To address these issues, identity verification service providers are positioning themselves as key players in meeting these needs, while ensuring a fluid and secure user experience.</p>



<p>In the context of a major event such as the Olympic Games, all mobility operators will be faced with many more demands during this period. Numerous people will be moving from various key points in a limited span of time. It therefore seems essential to simplify access to means of transport requiring a stronger means of identification, without compromising transaction security.</p>



 A seamless user journey, reflecting a smooth transport experience. 



<p>For mobility players, offering instant access to their services is crucial. When service users are confronted with a complex and unclear <a href="https://www.idnow.io/customers-experience/">onboarding process</a>, their frustration increases, as does the abandonment rate. A fast, accessible onboarding process, whatever the channel, becomes a major competitive advantage.</p>



<p>Operators are therefore seeking to offer their users a seamless experience, notably through a simplified, instantaneous and entirely mobile onboarding process. This means being able to quickly verify users’ age, the validity of their driver’s license or, in the case of some car rental companies, proof of address. One of the main challenges is therefore to minimize the time needed for these checks, while maintaining a high level of security.</p>



<p>At major events, such as the Paris Olympics in 2024, where mobility services will be particularly in demand, the ability to handle a high volume of requests becomes even more critical. Automated identity verification solutions can play a key role in this context. Not only do they considerably speed up the onboarding process by eliminating the need for manual account validation, they also ensure that the user meets the necessary conditions (age, valid license) to access the service.</p>



<p>In the case of rental contracts, the use of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/digital-signatures/">electronic signatures</a> to finalize transactions, and the automatic capture and extraction of information from identity documents, further accelerate the subscription process, without compromising the security of the transaction. Finally, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/identity-verification-service/">video biometrics</a> enhances the security of mobility operators by ensuring that the person creating the account is who they claim to be, thus reducing the risk of identity fraud.</p>



<p>For mobility operators, these tools are not only a means of improving the user experience, but also represent an opportunity to set themselves apart from the competition. In a context like that of the Olympic Games, it will also be important to respond efficiently to peaks in demand, while guaranteeing continuity and quality of service.</p>



 Mobility as a Service: the future of urban mobility? 



<p>For providers of transport services requiring advanced identity verification, such as car rental or <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/francois-hoehlinger-the-future-of-micromobility/">micromobility services</a>, the implementation of appropriate solutions is crucial to effectively meet the influx of requests. Without automated systems, these operators risk being forced to invest in additional human resources, a costly and less efficient solution in the face of highly variable demand.</p>



<p>The solution could lie in the adoption of a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mobility-as-service-digital-identity-partnership/">Mobility as a Service (MaaS)</a> service, offering a single account to access all a city’s transport and mobility facilities. Berlin’s <a href="https://www.jelbi.de/en/home/">JELBI </a>sets the standard. By downloading this application, users fill in their information just once and can then access all the mobility services available in the city. This centralized approach considerably simplifies the user experience, reducing the complexity of accessing the various transport services. France, meanwhile, has yet to find its own MaaS operating model.</p>



<p>At a time when mobility is reinventing itself, security and ease of access to services are becoming major issues. As mobility is constantly on the move, it’s vital to understand the issues involved in order to anticipate tomorrow’s needs. The Paris Olympics will be an opportunity to test operators’ ability to manage the diversity of means of transport, to absorb the influx of visitors and also to test the means of identity verification available.</p>



<p>In this context, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/automated-identity-verification/">automated identity verification</a> is an indispensable solution, eliminating several points of friction for mobility operators. The aim is to enable users to access desired services quicker and to make their experience as seamless as possible. Operators, for their part, can look forward to being able to process flows faster by automating time-consuming and complex processes.</p>

DF81 payout (Mar 21, 2024) was the first time the bug fix was applied. The Volume DF payout for DF81 was 7,500 OCEAN. That is, a 2.67x-3.33x reduction.

Practically speaking, it means that the Volume DF payout going forward is ≈37,500&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>(And can rise with higher DCV, all the way to the 112,5000 OCEAN budget for Volume&nbsp;DF.)</p><p>Also, we have retroactively applied this to the DF81 payout by <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x785ecb5dc208de89f4bab854e3b519223d7178b4446404ded3f022df9bb6194e">airdropping</a> each account another 4x Volume DF rewards compared to what it got yesterday.</p><p>AMA coming&nbsp;soon!</p> Introduction / Contents of&nbsp;Document <p>The rest of this document describes DF budgets, then zooms in on Volume DF. It describes the “why” of a DCV bound on Volume DF rewards, what OCEAN rewards it led to, and how those numbers improved under Predictoor DF. It describes the bug and the fix, and how the Volume DF rewards changed due to the fix. It describes the issue of violating community expectations somewhat. Finally, it describes the fix: 5x Predictoor Boost, which restores Volume DF Rewards to ≈37,500&nbsp;OCEAN.</p> DF Budgets <p>Overall DF budget. We are in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-main-2-is-here-3d46506a141e">Data Farming Main 2 phase</a>, as Mar 14, 2024. From DF Main 1 to DF Main 2, the overall DF budget increased 2x.</p><p>Now, weekly rewards budget is 300,000 OCEAN (plus ROSE for Predictoor DF).</p><p>DF Budgets per Stream. DF is divided into streams. The “Passive DF” stream rewards people for locking OCEAN. The “Active DF” stream rewards doing more work to add value to ecosystem; it has two sub-streams “Volume DF” and “Predictoor DF”.</p><p>Here is reward allocation &amp; some detail per each stream, as of DF Main&nbsp;2.</p>  <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/passive-df">Passive DF</a>. 150K OCEAN / week. Lock OCEAN for <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-veocean-c5f416c1f9a0">veOCEAN</a>. The longer you lock for, the more veOCEAN (details below). Rewards are pro-rata to veOCEAN holdings.  Active DF. 150K OCEAN / week. It has these substreams:<br>i. <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/volume-df">Volume DF</a>: 112.5K OCEAN / week. Allocate veOCEAN towards data assets with high DCV, to earn more. Rewards are a function of DCV and veOCEAN stake.<br>ii. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf">Predictoor DF</a>: 37.5K OCEAN / week + 20K ROSE / week. Predict future price movement, continuously (as a predictoor).  <p>For further details on each stream, please consult the <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">DF&nbsp;docs</a>.</p> About Volume&nbsp;DF <p>Volume DF is a substream of Ocean Data Farming. In it, users allocate veOCEAN towards data assets with high DCV, to earn more. Rewards are a function of DCV and veOCEAN&nbsp;stake.</p><p>Volume DF is not Active DF per se; it’s a subset of Active DF. Volume DF is not DF: there are several streams / substreams and it is one of them. Each stream is meaningful on its&nbsp;own.</p> The Wash-Consume Problem, and&nbsp;Fix <p>Early versions of Volume DF encountered a problem: <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-reward-function-tuned-d74b5134b5d1">wash consume</a>. Let’s explain. Volume DF rewards on DCV. People found a way to game this: publish data assets, then buy &amp; consume those assets themselves. A circular loop that drove up DCV. Volumes ballooned to&nbsp;$Ms.</p><p>This was not real volume, of course. And it is wasteful to reward OCEAN for this behavior. The aim is to reward OCEAN for things that truly drive value ot the ecosystem.</p><p>Here’s how we fixed wash consume: we ensured that rewards paid never exceed $ from fees. This works because fees themselves do not go into the pockets of the wash-consumers. Therefore anyone wash-consuming would lose $. (In Ocean, fees are baseline 0.1%; and baseline 20.1% for Predictoor feeds.)</p><p>The specific implementation is:</p><blockquote>Volume DF rewards for asset and each veOCEAN holder, are bound by: asset’s DCV * (% stake in asset) * DCV_multiplier.</blockquote><p>The value DCV_multiplier is 20.1% for Predictoor feeds, and 0.1% otherwise. Call this the “DCV bounds” on the Volume DF&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This also means that some of the OCEAN budgeted for Volume DF for a given week may not get deployed as rewards for that week. Any OCEAN not rewarded goes back into the DF pot for future DF&nbsp;rounds.</p> How much OCEAN is rewarded to Volume&nbsp;DF? <p>Before Predictoor was rolled out, DCV in Ocean was very small. And DCV_multiplier was 0.1%. So the DCV bounds (small DCV) * (small DCV_multiplier) = negligible number. Therefore OCEAN rewarded for Volume DF was negligible.</p><p>Then Predictoor &amp; Predictoor DF was rolled out, which caused both larger DCV and larger DCV_multiplier of&nbsp;20.1%.</p><p>Decent DCV. Predictoor came with Predictoor DF, where 37,500 OCEAN is spent as sales to buy Predictoor feeds. This is a “baseline” that incentivizes people to run Predictoor bots. In practice, it’s working extremely well, driving high activity and stake-to-predict volume. Predictoor feeds are the only meaningful contributor to DCV. So, DCV is basically the Predictoor DF rewards of 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>Decent DCV_multiplier. Where other feeds had 0.1%, Predictoor feeds&nbsp;20.1%.</p><p>Let’s combine those: DCV bounds (decent DCV) * (decent DCV_multiplier) = decent-ish number. So, OCEAN rewarded for Volume DF comes out decent-ish.</p><p>Let’s do exact numbers. We apply the formula above: 37,500 OCEAN volume, times DCV_multiplier=20.1% gives a bound of ≈7,500 OCEAN total. Therefore ≈7,500 OCEAN is practically available to Volume&nbsp;DFers.</p><p>The implementation described above was the intended behavior.</p> Discovery: a bug in DCV-bounds code <p>Thanks to decent DCV and decent DCV_multiplier in Predictoor DF, the Volume DF payout was supposed to be ≈7,500 OCEAN /&nbsp;week.</p><p>However the payout ended up between ≈20,000-25,000 OCEAN /&nbsp;week.</p><p>That is, 2.67x-3.33x more OCEAN was being paid out for Volume DF, compared to the intended design of Volume DF. (Remember, this is only a bounds based on DCV of 37,500 OCEAN/week. If DCV was high enough, the full budget of Volume DF would be paid out: 112,500 OCEAN/week.)</p><p>Something was up in Volume DF payout calculations. We dug deeper. As of Fri Mar 15, 2024, we discovered the specific bug in those calculations.</p><p>The bug had applied data consume volume (DCV) bounds too loosely, which over-rewarded each individual account during&nbsp;payout.</p><p>Recall that the DCV bound for each asset and each veOCEAN holder: asset’s DCV * (% stake in asset) * DCV_multiplier. Where “% stake in asset” is the amount of veOCEAN that a user has allocated, compared to the all veOCEAN allocated, for a given&nbsp;asset.</p><p>The bound was supposed to be on a per-asset, per-staker level.</p><p>But, the DCV bound code was written was only on a per-asset level. That was the bug. It missed the per-staker part. That is, “% stake in asset” was&nbsp;missing.</p><p>It meant that a user could create 10 separate accounts with 1/10 of her veOCEAN in each account, and get 10x more rewards compared to a single account. Yes, a Sybil attack. Anyone exploiting this flaw would be rewarded unfairly&nbsp;highly.</p><p>(To be clear: it wasn’t a security issue per se; there were no funds at risk. But it enabled people to game the system and get unfair rewards&nbsp;.)</p> Fixing the bug in DCV-bounds code <p>The core fix was to apply the DCV bound on a per-asset per-staker level. That is, to add the “% stake in asset”&nbsp;term.</p><p>We fixed the bug within hours of finding it. The first payout on the fixed code was for DF81, on Thu Mar 21. The <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/df81-completes-and-df82-launches-6ccd09db2ac9">DF81–82 blog post</a> provides further information: in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/df81-completes-and-df82-launches-6ccd09db2ac9#a4c1">Section 5</a> (highly detailed); and with a complementary explainer in its <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/df81-completes-and-df82-launches-6ccd09db2ac9#2693">Appendix</a>.</p><p>The OCEAN budgeted for Volume DF never reduced. However, the amount paid out was reduced, because that payout is bounded by DCV, and DCV hasn’t been high enough to ignore this&nbsp;limit.</p> Bug Fix’s Effect on Volume DF&nbsp;Rewards <p>As expected, accounts doing Volume DF got reduced rewards in DF81&nbsp;payouts.</p><p>Smaller stakers (those with a small % stake on an asset) had larger APY drops than larger stakers. This is because the same DCV bound was (wrongly) only at the per-asset level. Each account saw the same bound. After the bug fix, the APYs should be identical.</p><p>Let us illustrate.</p>  If an asset has just one staker, where % stake = 100%, their Volume DF payout for that asset doesn’t change at all, because the new term “% stake in asset” = 1.0. So introducing it doesn’t change the&nbsp;numbers.  If a larger staker had 50% stake in an asset, their payout would be multiplied by 50%, ie a 1/0.5 = 2x reduction for the asset. Reduced APY for Volume DF&nbsp;follows.  If a smaller staker had 10% stake in an asset, their payout would be multiplied by 10%, ie a 1/0.1 = 10x reduction for the asset. Reduced APY for Volume DF&nbsp;follows.  <p>The above APY discussion is all for Volume DF. The APYs on Passive DF are independent; they’re at ≈20% these days. Passive DF APYs were not affected by this fix, since the fix is for Volume DF. Please don’t confuse Passive DF and Volume&nbsp;DF.</p> Bug fixed, but a second issue&nbsp;emerged <p>Like any professional software development team: we identified a bug; we fixed it asap; we deployed it; we communicated the&nbsp;changes.</p><p>However this caused a problem: people had locked OCEAN for years on the basis of seeing historical APYs in Passive DF and Volume DF. A long-term commitment which we appreciate.</p><blockquote>Those expectations got violated somewhat, due to the reduced rewards for Volume&nbsp;DF.</blockquote><p>Many were upset. We get&nbsp;it.</p><p>At the heart of the problem: Volume DF with the bug was ≈20,000–25,000 OCEAN / week. After the bug fix, payout was ≈7,500 OCEAN / week (ie payout of DF81). That is, a 2.67x-3.33x reduction. There were corresponding reductions in Volume DF APYs; those vary per-user as described above.</p> Towards addressing the second&nbsp;issue <p>How can we fix the problem of: expectations got violated somewhat, due to the reduced rewards for Volume&nbsp;DF?</p><p>To make a specific goal: can we get Volume DF rewards back to at least ≈20,000–25,000 OCEAN /&nbsp;week?</p><p>We have constraints:</p>  It doesn’t make sense to “undo” the bug fix, because then we’d still have the bug, with the issues it&nbsp;entails!  We want to ensure that DF code implementation reflects the intent of its designers (us).  As always, the design of DF and its sub-streams needs to remain flexible enough to keep evolving. All so that OCEAN rewards deployed most effectively drive traction in Ocean, and especially data consume volume&nbsp;(DCV).  Related to the last point, some alpha: we do have other Data Farming sub-streams in the works! Those need breathing space. And, Predictoor is growing so the Predictoor DF weekly budget may increase&nbsp;too.   Introducing 5x Predictoor Boost <p>We are proud to announce the 5x Predictoor Boost program. It is a solution to the problem&nbsp;above.</p><p>Recall:</p><blockquote>Volume DF rewards for asset and each veOCEAN holder, are bound by: asset’s DCV * (% stake in asset) * DCV_multiplier.</blockquote><p>Before, Predictoor feeds had DCV_multiplier = 20.1%. 5x Predictoor Boost gives a 5x to this multiplier.</p><p>With 5x Predictoor boost, Predictoor feeds get DCV_multiplier =&nbsp;100.5%.</p><p>Let’s do exact numbers. We haveDCV of 37,500 OCEAN from (due to Predictoor DF), times DCV_multiplier=100.5% gives a bound of 37,687.5 OCEAN total (≈37,500 OCEAN). Therefore 37,687.5 OCEAN is practically available to Volume&nbsp;DFers.</p><p>(And as DCV rises, up to the whole Volume DF budget of 112,500 OCEAN becomes available to Volume&nbsp;DFers.)</p><p>The 5x boost only applies to the first 37.5K rewards given out on Volume DF. After that, the usual dcv_multiplier=20.1% applies. This helps to ensure breathing space for new DF substreams or increased Predictoor DF&nbsp;budget.</p> Implementation of 5x Predictoor Boost <p>What happens&nbsp;today:</p>  Retroactively apply this new formula to DF81 payout (which was yesterday — Thu Mar 21, 2024). In practice, we have airdropped each account another 4x Volume DF rewards compared to what it got yesterday. <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x785ecb5dc208de89f4bab854e3b519223d7178b4446404ded3f022df9bb6194e">Here’s the&nbsp;tx.</a>  <p>What happens in before next DF&nbsp;payout:</p>  Update the DF payout code to apply the 5x Predictoor boost, for future weeks. (Applicable to first 37.5K&nbsp;rewards)  Update documentation, etc as&nbsp;needed.   Conclusion <p>Due to a bug fix, the Volume DF OCEAN payouts shrunk. Previously, under the bug, payouts were about 20,000–25,000 OCEAN. DF81 payout (Mar 21, 2024) was the first time the bug fix was applied. The Volume DF payout for DF81 was 7,500 OCEAN. That is, a 2.67x-3.33x reduction. (APYs for Passive DF and Predictoor DF were not affected.)</p><p>While this was a legitimate bug fix, the drop in reward caused community expectations to be violated somewhat.</p><p>Many were upset. We get&nbsp;it.</p><p>To address this issue, we are proud to announce the 5x Predictoor Boost program. Practically speaking, it means that the Volume DF payout going forward is ≈37,500&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>(And can rise with higher DCV, all the way to the 112,5000 OCEAN budget for Volume&nbsp;DF.)</p><p>Also, we have retroactively applied this to the DF81 payout by airdropped each account another 4x Volume DF rewards compared to what it got yesterday.</p><p>AMA soon!</p> About Ocean, DF and Predictoor <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>As the effects of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/climate-change">climate change</a> intensify, extreme weather events are becoming increasingly frequent and severe. The US experienced <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/">25 extreme weather events</a> in 2023, each causing losses of over USD 1 billion, with a total cost of USD 73.8 billion. &nbsp;</p>



<p>These climate events have a huge potential impact on financial institutions. In 2021, large-scale floods affected the European countries of Austria, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, causing <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/01/extreme-weather-economic-cost-wef23/">USD 43 billion</a> worth of damage in addition to a tragic loss of life. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/berenberg-sees-2-3-bln-reinsurance-losses-european-floods-2021-07-19/%22HYPERLINK%20%22https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/berenberg-sees-2-3-bln-reinsurance-losses-european-floods-2021-07-19/">According to Berenberg analysts</a>, individual insurance companies faced total claims estimates of up to approximately USD 300 million. Berenberg estimated that reinsurance losses ranged between USD 2 billion and USD 3 billion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For other financial services firms outside of the insurance sector, property accepted as loan security might face climate-related risks as well. Longer-term local <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/climate-change-examples/">climate change risks</a> might still devalue property that hasn’t suffered damage. These risks might include threats posed by sea level rises, wildfires, heat waves, flooding or other natural disasters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some firms might choose not to invest in certain landscapes where the physical risks are considerably too high. As a result, their market would shrink.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Across the financial sector, there are transition risks to consider as we move to a low-carbon economy. Many financial services firms will have to re-evaluate a significant portfolio of investments across the stock market. Financial markets might reprice shares in some carbon-intensive sectors by favoring <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/renewable-energy">renewable energy</a> over fossil fuels. There might be reputational damage associated with investing in companies that are seemingly causing global warming with excessive <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/greenhouse-gas-emissions">greenhouse gas or carbon emissions</a>, rather than mitigating it. Supply chain or other business interruptions due to extreme weather might also hit balance sheets in listed companies. As a result, pension funds and other stock market investments might suffer adverse effects.&nbsp;</p>



 Developing a risk management strategy for insurance and other financial services&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>In recent years, financial services firms have realized that they need a decision-making strategy that accounts for the implications of climate change. Methodologies used in the past might not be enough to account for new weather patterns and extreme weather events. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Firms can also reduce their investment risk by using weather and climate data to make investment decisions. When firms are trading energy, for example, they can forecast renewable electricity generation based on predicted solar and wind patterns. Companies can follow this three-step process to address the implications of climate change in their business:&nbsp;</p>



 1. Get tools to accurately assess potential climate impacts 



<p>The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/environmental-intelligence-suite/financial-services">IBM® Environmental Intelligence Suite</a> models 40 years of historical weather patterns. It enables forecasting on these time scales:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Immediate weather scale, looking two weeks ahead&nbsp; 



 Sub-seasonal scale, forecasting one year ahead&nbsp; 



 Climate scale, modeling up to the year 2100&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p>Using a graphical user interface (GUI), financial services firms can view properties in the context of the climate risks in their specific location. This GUI enables a more complete risk assessment when considering an insurance or mortgage application. Financial services firms can use the tool for “what if?” analysis to better understand the likelihood of various climate scenarios and help to draw up mitigation plans to counter extreme weather risks. &nbsp;</p>



 2. Create an operational strategy to use weather data 



<p>A new or expanded team might have to fully take advantage of weather data throughout the business. Firms might need to overhaul their risk assessment and portfolio management practices to include climate risk and opportunity. Companies can use weather data to help write damage assessment reports, guide risk assessors on location and identify insurance claims fraud. Investment decision-makers also need weather and climate data so they can use it for better-informed trading in sectors such as energy, agriculture and food. &nbsp;</p>



 3. Engage customers with new offers 



<p>There are new opportunities to attract and retain customers by sharing climate intelligence. Insurance companies can, for instance, alert their customers to threats that their properties face so they can protect them. To defend against wildfires, property owners could clear furniture and vegetation around the property that might spread flames to the building. In areas vulnerable to flooding, they could add flood defenses and protections. In this way, financial services firms can reduce their financial risk while also increasing customer satisfaction. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Financial services businesses can also create new products by using weather and climate data. For example, if an extreme weather event happens, parametric insurance offers an agreed fixed payment. Customers can get paid faster because there’s no need to assess damage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To respond to climate disruptions and manage the increased risk resulting from extreme weather events, financial services firms need accurate weather insights. The delivery of these insights should enable firms to understand the climate risk associated with countries or properties that they are interested in. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Not only does weather data help reduce the extent of losses, but it also creates new opportunities. Renewable energy forecasting can inform energy trading and insurance companies can help homeowners understand both the threats their properties face and how to counter them. By cutting the cost of extreme weather events and seizing new business opportunities, financial services firms can turn weather data into a powerful competitive advantage.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>In a <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/how-tenant-restrictions-v2-can-be-used-to-prevent-data/ba-p/3915339">previous blog</a> in the Data Exfiltration series, we discussed different types of tenant restrictions policy. In this blog, we’ll discuss migrating from tenant restrictions v1 to authentication plane tenant restrictions v2. In future blogs, we’ll discuss migrating to Universal tenant restrictions v2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tenant restrictions are a vital tool to help prevent data exfiltration from unauthorized access to external Microsoft Entra ID tenants and consumer Microsoft accounts. Tenant restrictions v1 lets you create an allow list of tenant IDs and Microsoft sign-in endpoints to ensure that users access external tenants that your organization authorizes. While tenant restrictions v1 served well for many years, tenant restrictions v2 offers more granularity and easier policy management with no additional licensing requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tenant restrictions v2 has several benefits over tenant restrictions v1. For example, admins can:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
  Update the policy from the Microsoft Entra portal rather than from each network proxy. There’s no need to update the header.&nbsp; 
  Increase the size limitations of your maximum proxy header length. There’s no limit to the number of partners you can add with tenant restrictions v2.&nbsp; 
  Selectively indicate which user groups access which apps in external tenants rather than allowing entire tenants for all identities.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this blog post, I’ll explain the differences between how the two tenant restriction types work independently from, and in tandem with, cross-tenant access settings (outbound) to highlight the benefits of upgrading to tenant restrictions v2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Getting started with tenant restrictions&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tenant restrictions require routing all user authentication traffic through a proxy. Typically, the proxy is the on-premises network egress, but it can also be a cloud-based proxy. The proxy injects a header indicating that an allow list of destinations is enforced on the traffic, regardless of the originating device or network location. In tenant restrictions v1, the destination allow list is in the header. In tenant restrictions v2, the header has a tenant ID and policy ID. Traffic arrives at Microsoft Entra ID, which reads the header and enforces the policy. If the traffic destination isn’t in the allow list, the user receives an error message.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Example of a user getting blocked by tenant restrictions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How tenant restrictions v1 works&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two types of identities: internal and external. Your organization creates and manages internal identities with your identity provider (IdP) but doesn’t manage external identities such as personal accounts or those created by an external organization. Tenant restrictions v1 applies to both account types.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the following diagrams, two types of identities (green is internal and black is external) are on the corporate network or connected with a virtual private network (VPN). Both identity types go through the corporate network egress proxy when attempting to access Microsoft 365 services. Typically, both receive the same header injection of allowed destinations. This enforcement has some limitations. If you maintain the allow list in the network proxies, administrators update the header at each proxy when you add or remove a tenant. It’s also important to note that the headers have size limitations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: Tenant restrictions v1 applies to external tenant destinations equally with no user or app granularity</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can improve tenant restrictions v1 by adding cross-tenant access settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Tenant restrictions v1 with outbound cross-tenant access settings&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Microsoft Entra ID, you can configure the cross-tenant access settings feature to control outbound access on a per-user, per-group, and per-application basis. This policy applies to your internal identities, regardless of device or network location.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the following diagram, the users go through the egress proxy. Cross-tenant access settings and tenant restrictions are applied. However, the tenant restrictions v1 allow list is the only policy that applies to external identities. This option improves internal user management, but the architecture has limitations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both tenant restriction v1 and cross-tenant access settings are evaluated, and the most restrictive policy is applied. However, cross-tenant access settings only apply to internal identities. If you allow access to an external tenant for your users, even with group or application restrictions, you enable all external identities to access any resource in those tenants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3: Cross-tenant access settings adds user and app granularity for internal identities</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Tenant restriction v2 with cross-tenant access settings&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tenant restriction v2 works in tandem with cross-tenant access settings. Tenant restriction v2 is a cloud-based policy that applies to external identities. Internal users’ access is controlled by cross-tenant access settings. This separation allows per-user and per-application granularity for internal and external identity scenarios.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the following example, the organization puts group and application restrictions on their internal identities. However, they can block other external identities from accessing external tenants unless they create exceptions. In this case, an exception is made for Bob from Tenant C. He is allowed access to only Microsoft Exchange so he can check email while on the corporate network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 4: Tenant restrictions v2 adds granular user and app awareness to external identities</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The previous diagram demonstrates the flexibility that tenant restrictions v2 offers. Because tenant restrictions v1 and v2 have the same licensing requirements, the one-time migration involves recreating policies and updating the header injection at your network proxies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can learn more in the tenant restrictions v2 <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/tenant-restrictions-migration">migration deployment plan.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To further enhance tenant restrictions, learn about <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-universal-tenant-restrictions">Universal tenant restrictions</a>. This feature adds data layer protection and prevents token infiltration that can bypass your corporate network proxy’s tenant restrictions header injection. The feature injects the headers and has a low latency connection to Microsoft 365 resources without needing to hairpin traffic through your corpnet proxies.&nbsp;</p>

 Creating Value with Identifiers  Why identifiers are essential to secure cross border trade, and how we have applied best practices and design principles <p>Transmute enables global trade digitization. Essential to this mission is facilitating an optimal digital identifier strategy for our customers, in which our Verifiable Data Platform plays an important part. In this white paper we discuss some points of inspiration and the design choices and principles we have made to bring efficient, safe, intuitive — and beautiful — identifiers to the supply chain&nbsp;sector.</p> Inspiration <p>In designing our identifiers, we have looked to major internet players for inspiration: HBO, LinkedIn and&nbsp;GS1.</p> HBO <p>HBO is a great source of inspiration, consistently following identifier design practices. For example, here is the URL for accessing the movie Dune:<br>https://play.hbomax.com/player/urn:hbo:feature:GYUjdLgBiJp5otAEAAAAJ</p><p>This URL consists&nbsp;of:</p>  Scheme (https), indicating that there is a resource resolvable over secure&nbsp;HTTP  Host (play.hbomax.com) with HBO’s domain&nbsp;name  Path of HBO’s video player (player), available to authenticated HBO&nbsp;users  Sub-path with a unique identifier of the movie Dune (urn:hbo:feature:GYUjdLgBiJp5otAEAAAAJ)  <p>We will dissect the structure of the identifier in a moment, but first it’s important to note the same identifier of Dune is used elsewhere to resolve different resources. For example:<br>https://www.hbomax.com/dk/da/a/param-feature/urn:hbo:feature:GYUjdLgBiJp5otAEAAAAJ</p><p>Which links to a publicly available “movie poster” page, in this case on a Danish microsite as per the&nbsp;path.</p><p>Looking closer at Dune’s identifier, urn:hbo:feature:GYUjdLgBiJp5otAEAAAAJ, this is a URN consisting of:</p>  Scheme (urn)&nbsp;, indicating a unique but not necessarily resolvable identifier  Namespace, NID (hbo)&nbsp;, which arguably should be registered with IANA, <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces/urn-namespaces.xhtml">but&nbsp;isn’t</a>  Namespace-specific string, NSS (feature:GYUjdLgBiJp5otAEAAAAJ), which notably consists of a categorization of what is identified (feature:) as well as a unique&nbsp;string   LinkedIn <p>LinkedIn follow a very similar pattern as HBO for linked in posts:<br>https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7062908400073887744</p><p>Again, the URL is comprised of:</p>  Scheme (https),  Host (www.linkedin.com)  Path (feed/update)  Sub-path with a URN identifier (urn:li:activity:7062908400073887744)  <p>And again, the identifier is a URN constructed as:</p>  Scheme (urn),  NID (unregistered) (li),  NSS (activity:7062908400073887744), consisting of a categorization of what is identified (activity:) and a unique&nbsp;string.  <p>LinkedIn also allows for natural identifiers for identifying people (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nis-jespersen/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/nis-jespersen/</a>) and companies (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/transmute-industries">https://www.linkedin.com/company/transmute-industries</a>). There are two interesting points to note&nbsp;here:</p>  The use of natural keys (nis-jespersen and transmute-industries). When this is possible, humanly recognizable keys derived from the business domain is a strong&nbsp;feature.  A more questionable part of this design is that LinkedIn is not sticking with URN identifiers. A better and more consistent design could have been for example: https://www.linkedin.com/company/urn:li:company:transmute-industries   GS1 <p>GS1 governs identifiers for elements used in trade such as product types (GTIN), organizations (GLN) and transport identifiers (SSCC). These can be extended, for example a GTIN with a lot number traditionally looks like this: (01)09520123456788(10)ABC123 where (01) and (10) are codes for GTIN and lot respectively, followed by their values, in combination forming a unique compound key for the&nbsp;lot.</p><p>GS1’s <a href="https://ref.gs1.org/standards/digital-link/uri-syntax/">Digital Link standard</a> defines how the GS1 identifier must be represented as URIs. The Digital Link of the above example could be <a href="https://id.gs1.org/01/09520123456788/10/ABC123">https://id.gs1.org/01/09520123456788/10/ABC123</a> (this is the so-called canonical form). Importantly, it could also be <a href="https://brand.example.com/01/09520123456788/10/ABC123">https://brand.example.com/01/09520123456788/10/ABC123</a>, allowing the brand owner to host resolvable information about the&nbsp;product.</p><p>Per the spec, identifying properties are on the path, whereas non-identifying properties are placed in query parameters. Weight, for example, is non-identifying, so the Digital Link for (01)09520123456788(3103)000195 where (01) codifies the GTIN followed by its value, and (3103) codifies Net Weight and 000195 is 195 grams, can be <a href="https://brand.example.com/01/09520123456788?3103=000195">https://brand.example.com/01/09520123456788?3103=000195</a>.</p><p>Peculiarly, GS1 has not opted to leverage the registered <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5134.html">“epc” URN namespace</a> in the Digital Link standard. The above GTIN could be represented like this:<br>https://brand.example.com/urn:epc:id:gtin:0952012.3456788.</p><p>Granted, the QR code for this would be bigger; an important argument. Apart from that this seems like a missed opportunity to spread a best practice identifier pattern broadly into GS1’s established user&nbsp;base.</p><p>In conclusion of this little tour of inspiration, we’ve found that HBO and LinkedIn have taken practically identical approaches to identifying and localizing their platform resources. GS1 seems to have been on a similar path before changing direction for Digital Link. Next, we will look into some of the drivers which have led HBO and LinkedIn to the same best practice&nbsp;design.</p> Design Principles <p>In this section we will focus on properties which make a good identifier. We will also consider some properties which make them bad, if not dangerous.</p><p>Why does HBO bother adding urn:hbo:feature: and not just a “naked” identifier such as <br>https://play.hbomax.com/player/GYUjdLgBiJp5otAEAAAAJ</p><p>And, similarly, why do we consider this to be well formed:<br>https://platform.transmute.industries/presentations/urn:transmute:presentation:bdb8a296-ed17-41a6-b5e6-46n157747bee</p><p>But not this:<br>https://platform.transmute.industries/presentations/bdb8a296-ed17-41a6-b5e6-46n157747bee</p> Unique Resource Identifier <p>First of all, bdb8a296-ed17–41a6-b5e6–46n157747bee is not a URI, whereas urn:transmute:presentation:bdb8a296-ed17–41a6-b5e6–46n157747bee is.</p><p>There is a caveat, formally the URN namespace should be registered with IANA such that they can guarantee uniqueness. Our stance is that our use of the unregistered namespace (transmute) is sufficiently unique; a stance which we share with the likes of HBO and LinkedIn.</p> Usability <p>During development and integration, engineers often juggle identifiers from various platforms at once. Hints about which platform and type of resource the identifier is associated with makes it much easier to work with. As you glance over a table of identifiers, being able to pick out the one you are looking for is a time saver. Platforms often prefix identifiers with such context, in our case for example transmute:presentation intuitively and clearly point towards the origin and type of resource.</p><p>A developer should also intuitively trust that an identifier is unique. While UUIDs are a little long, they are recognizable and a developer instinctively comprehends the identifier’s uniqueness.</p><p>Finally, these aspects should come naturally. In working with identifiers, the good experience is the one you don’t experience.</p> Casing Convention <p>The natural keys employed by LinkedIn were kebab-cased (nis-jespersen). This is preferred because most operating systems and <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-bing-handle-underscores-dashes-differently-89672">search engines</a> treat dash-separation as separate words. In contrast, both camelCasing and snake_casing are generally considered one big word. Kebab-casing is also considered <a href="https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/41595/what-is-the-casing-convention-for-url-routes">more readable</a> than the alternatives.</p> Location Decoupling <p>The decoupling of the resource and its location(s) allow us for example to get Verifiable Credential data with<br><a href="https://platform.transmute.industries/credentials/urn:transmute:credential:9ni5070c-102f-46cf-9e40-82de4874fdb6">https://platform.transmute.industries/credentials/urn:transmute:credential:9ni5070c-102f-46cf-9e40-82de4874fdb6</a></p><p>And verify it with<br>https://platform.transmute.industries/credentials/urn:transmute:credential:9ni5070c-102f-46cf-9e40-82de4874fdb6/verify</p><p>This is similar to how urn:hbo:feature:GYUjdLgBiJp5otAEAAAAJ was used to retrieve both the Dune trailer microsite and the full movie&nbsp;player.</p> Security <p>Without this decoupling, there is just one identifying URL, for example:<br><a href="https://platform.transmute.industries/presentations/bdb8a296-ed17-41a6-b5e6-46n157747bee">https://platform.transmute.industries/presentations/bdb8a296-ed17-41a6-b5e6-46n157747bee</a> <br>which means the entire identifier string is now a WHATWG URL, not an IETF URI, in turn allowing for UNICODE encoded internationalized domain&nbsp;names.</p><p>It is Transmute’s position that UNICODE is great for display strings, but dangerous for identifier strings. We wholeheartedly support the ability to capture people’s name in their local representation. Indeed, the author’s full name includes an “ø”. But we are saddened by the careless adoption of UNICODE in international domain names, which has unnecessarily exposed an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDN_homograph_attack">internationalized domain name homoglyph attack</a> surface. For example an ASCII o is very difficult to tell apart from a cyrillic о (not the same character!), allowing for microsoft.com and mіcrоsoft.com (not the same domain!) to&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200102175251/http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~gabr/papers/homograph_full.pdf">coexist</a>.</p><p>We do not fancy ourselves that we can fix the internet. But we vigilantly seek to minimize exposures anytime we have the chance; in this case by adopting ASCII-based URN identifiers where we have the&nbsp;chance.</p> Key Origins <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_key">natural key</a> is derived from business or application data which are unique in their nature and are typically intuitively understood by humans. By contrast, a synthetic or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogate_key">surrogate key</a> is technically generated solely for the purpose of uniqueness, without direct linkage to the real&nbsp;world.</p><p>We saw how LinkedIn in some cases uses the person or organization name as natural keys. This is possible for finite resources which carry such natural identifiers. In such cases it is preferable to adopt human recognizable and intuitive keys. Where possible we have similarly adopted natural keys where resources are finite and under Transmute’s control. Prevalently, though, v4 UUID synthetic keys are used, in particular for all customer controlled resources.</p> Transmute Identifier Design <p>This section attempts to formalize Transmute’s identifier design, pertaining to our Verifiable Data Platform&nbsp;(VDP).</p> Resource Identifiers <p>VDP resources are identified with&nbsp;URNs.</p><p>The general pattern for VDP URN identifiers are as&nbsp;follows:</p><p>urn:transmute:[resource-type]:[v4-uuid|natural-key]</p><p>Where:</p>  urn, the URN&nbsp;scheme,  transmute, the unregistered URN&nbsp;NID,  [resource-type]:, first part of the URN NSS, indicating the type of resource in singular&nbsp;form.  [v4-uuid|natural-key], second sub-delimited (unique) part of the URN NSS; a v4 UUID for user governed resources, kebab-cased natural key for Transmute governed resources.   API Resources <p>Resources are accessed on the VDP <a href="https://restfulapi.net/">REST</a> (REpresentational State Transfer) API following this general&nbsp;pattern:</p><p><a href="https://platform.transmute.industries/[resource-type]/[resource-identifier]">https://platform.transmute.industries/[resource-type]/[resource-identifier]</a></p><p>Where:</p>  https, the HTTPS&nbsp;scheme,  platform.transmute.industries, the platform&nbsp;host  [resource-type], first part of the path, indicating the resource type in plural according to <a href="https://restfulapi.net/resource-naming/">REST naming best practices</a>.

However, this identifier is entirely in our customer’s control, and can like any other property during issuance; or it could be issued on a different platform and only stored on VDP. Such untrusted user input is ill fitted as database primary keys, as we cannot guarantee uniqueness.</p><p>Moreover, the @id property is optional per the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/">VC Data Model</a> specification, which further underscores the point: a primary key cannot be optional.</p><p>Adopting the VC and VP’s @id as platform resource would have led to very unintuitive and intrusive platform behavior: rejecting storage requests, injecting identifiers into customers’ data objects, etc — clearly unacceptable from a business platform dealing with trade data. We believe this is a generic challenge faced by all but the most puristic Linked Data platforms, in which users expect, understand, and appreciate such behaviors and restrictions.</p><p>So, instead VDP maintains these classes in abstracted resources which wrap around the basic VC and VPs, separating the VC/VP itself from the platform’s representation of it. This has several benefits:</p>  There can be perfectly acceptable business reasons to have non-unique or anonymous nodes in a data graph, and this lets customers be in complete control of their verifiable data&nbsp;graph.  The wrapper can contain valuable metadata about the resource, for example the sender and receiver of a verifiable presentation.  The abstraction allows for storing multiple representations of the same credential, kept as different formats, controlled as media&nbsp;types.  Example of a presentation containing two credentials with colliding ids, urn:ex:x, stored comfortably in VDP within resources urn:transmute:credential:1 and urn:transmute:credential:2 (URNs simplified for clarity). Status List Credentials <p>Bitstring revocation credentials are an exception to this principle. Per <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-bitstring-status-list/">the spec</a>, revocation credentials must be resolvable, so their identifier (referenced by the revocable credential) must be a URL, not a URN. For&nbsp;example</p> ‘id’: ‘https://platform.transmute.industries/credentials/97abfc14-5n1s-45ff-bfde-de30eb772c20’ <p>As a consequence, revocation credentials are bound to VDP in that they cannot be moved neither to nor from other platforms. This is both acceptable and a logical consequence of the purpose they&nbsp;fulfill.</p> Execution Challenges <p>This section is based on interviewing our engineering team, reflecting upon the process of designing and implementing the above identifier design. The truth is developing this part of our platform has led to challenges and frustrations amongst the team. It is our hope that others can learn from our experience and plan for a smoother process towards implementing a great identifier design.</p> Leadership <p>Management has struggled to share the vision for Linked Data and combine it with pragmatic execution. Designing Linked Data relationships permeates the stack, and often got in the way of fast execution. When not communicated properly, there were tendencies towards disliking Linked Data before it was even properly understood.</p><p>This experience was mirrored in the engineering team as a sense of being too involved in the design process: “the vision gets muddy with too many people involved”.</p><p>Indeed, authoring this document is meant as an attempt to once and for all get team alignment on the company’s identifier strategy.</p> Value <p>Consistency in the API design has been a reoccurring challenge. When the vision and principles are not communicated well enough to the team, the normal self-correction mechanisms do not kick in, and so inconsistencies slip through. The deviations add up and become self-perpetuating, leading to bugs, miscommunication, and frustration.</p><p>When consistency is essential, it means the normal MVP feature approach fits poorly with identifiers. There is clearly an investment to be taken seriously. You should not do a half baked job of this; you are better off not starting at&nbsp;all.</p><p>The engineering team have had periods where this tweaking identifier semantics sugar has felt like “work, not value” which could be forever improved, but with diminishing impact.</p> Requirements <p>Something as fundamental as identifiers takes strong requirements up front. Sporadic bug tickets, for example that a collection should be plural, becomes a debate of the framework which it is held against, whether it is a bug at&nbsp;all.</p><p>In interviewing, one engineer requested a README document to avoid inconsistencies — essentially requesting this document. Once we had gone through it he immediately explained an API endpoint which he believed was inconsistent. The team self-correction worked! It is clear that a document like this one should have been produced much sooner in the&nbsp;process.</p> Commercialization <p>There is a duality in the team’s feelings about where we have gotten. We are proud of our identifiers! But we also recognize that they are long and may seem over-engineered and unapproachable, not least in our target supply chain sector market where it is common practice quoting for example “manufacturer numbers”. As much as we love the technical details, we realize they may be a hard selling&nbsp;point.</p><p>However, we insist that identifiers are essential to building systems with safety, privacy and value in focus, especially in today’s increasingly connected world. It has always been true that identifier collisions can be costly. The context and requirements for identifiers have changed dramatically since the analogue days. We take it upon ourselves to design for a safe and efficient future, even if — especially if — our customers do not fully appreciate everything which this&nbsp;takes.</p> Database Identifier Decoration <p>Rather than storing the full URNs at database level, we still only store the raw keys, adding the URN decoration around it. This means removal before it goes into the DB, and add it back on the outbound. There is a lot there you have to remember when making changes. And you have to think about future scenarios too, for example if Transmute got bought, that might affect the transmute namespace, and you would be adding more layers. As one engineer puts it “adding context adds complexity”.</p><p>Not storing the URNs is effectively a case of not making full use of our own investment. Partly due to history, partly due to the mid-process confusion described above. For example, there have been worries that the special code would have to deal with lower environments identifiers (subdomains used only internally), a result of conflating URLs with URNs. The database level is essentially the last, missing step of the process described in this section, and now that the principles are fully understood it will be a matter of time before we get&nbsp;there.</p> Conclusion <p>Transmute sells identifiers, and we aim to sell amazing products. So our identifiers need to be&nbsp;amazing.</p><p>We have studied examples of major internet players, HBO and LinkedIn, how they both construct URN identifiers, which are then used in URLs. We also studied the GS1 Digital Link, which has good reason to take a different approach, prioritizing backwards alignment.</p><p>We analyzed the drivers behind these design principles: URI benefits, separation of concerns, security, and key origins. Based on these, we were able to formalize VDP’s identification design.</p><p>Finally, we shared some honest reflections on the real-life transformation our team has been through. It is our hope that others who share our ambition will benefit from these learnings.</p><p>Consistency is an essential measure of quality. This document should make clear not just what quality identifiers look like, but also motivate&nbsp;why.</p><p>We encourage comments and discussion on this article, as well as signing up for free on <a href="https://platform.transmute.industries">https://platform.transmute.industries</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/creating-value-with-identifiers-ef9446b87835">Creating  Value with Identifiers</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 As the Brazilian igaming market prepares for lift off, we discuss regulatory surprises, the challenges of encouraging players to leave the black market, and the feasibility of Brazil becoming the largest gambling market in the world. 



 



<p>Although at first glance, there may not appear to be a huge amount in common between the Brazilian aviation industry and the Brazilian gambling industry, for lawyer Neil Montgomery, there are parallels that gambling operators would be well served to follow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Late last year, the Brazilian online gambling industry took significant steps toward regulation, when Law No. 14,790/2023 was enacted further addressing fixed odds sports betting and igaming. While last month’s departure of <a href="https://www.telecomasia.net/news/other/mansurundefineds-resignation-could-impact-launch-of-bets-in-brazil/">government chief advisor, Jose Francisco Mansur</a>, is likely to result in considerable delays to the licensing process, it will not dampen the appetite for the official launch of a fully regulated gambling market in Brazil at federal level.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The excitement and anticipation for a regulated market at federal level (since some Brazilian states – like Paraná and Rio de Janeiro – have already made state licenses available) is borne largely from two things: the federal government realizing it is missing out on significant tax revenue, and Brazilian players being able to benefit from a safer and more secure player experience that only a regulated platform can offer. However, Neil does warn that unless gambling operators take the necessary steps to become ‘regulation-ready,’ including adherence to KYC, identity verification, and responsible gambling measure requirements, there is likely to be trouble ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Consumer legislation is strict and strictly enforced in Brazil so foreign operators are going to have to confront the nightmare of doing business when it comes to consumer claims.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neil explains that Brazil is infamously ranked number one in the world in terms of airline passenger claims. The reason, he suggests, is that although Brazil complies with international conventions on the limitation of carrier liability, said conventions do not apply to so-called ‘moral damages,’ or the pain and suffering inflicted on the passenger.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I believe a similar situation will repeat itself in the gaming industry because disgruntled consumers will now have a local door to knock on and use the Brazilian courts to obtain favourable awards. Brazilian courts will look at sports betting and igaming operators as wealthy companies and an expectation for companies to compensate damages cost to consumers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this interview, Neil explains all about consumer legislation, tax, KYC, and why Brazilian gambling operators may have the upper hand on their stronger foreign counterparts.</p>



 Now that Brazilian regulations for sports betting and online casinos have passed, was there anything in the final draft that surprised you, positively or negatively? Is there anything you would like to see revised in future iterations? 



<p>Well, I think that in general terms, it was very positive. We had to wait until the very last minute in 2023 to see the law passed because there was a lot of discussion as to whether this was coming out this year or not. The federal government, of course, was focused on getting it passed since it has an objective of reaching zero tax deficit in 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Any additional revenue is welcome and of course the sports, betting and gaming markets are seen as a very good source of additional revenues. For this revenue to be included in the 2024 budget, everything had to be passed in 2023. A positive surprise was the inclusion of igaming in the law because it was originally only supposed to govern fixed odd sports betting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under Brazilian law, we still need to wait and see what the Ministry of Finance will do with its many ordinances. There are 12 expected to be released, and we’ll see what the definition of igaming is. Another surprise was the fact that operators will need to have 20% Brazilian ownership. However, the way it is worded was a bit ambiguous because it doesn’t explicitly refer to a Brazilian individual and so adopting a two-tier corporate structure in Brazil (where the foreign operator would first incorporate a local holding company and have that company incorporate the local operator applying for the license – the latter thereby having a 100% Brazilian shareholder). The other positive was player tax being reduced from the initially proposed 30% to 15%. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>There were certain paragraphs vetoed by President Lula, such as the player having to calculate income tax on net winnings on an annual basis. All vetoes are still to be heard at Congress, and there’s a lot of uncertainty as to how the income tax is going to be calculated and collected.</p>



 Have you noticed a surge in interest or activity among Brazilian gaming operators since it passed? 



<p>Well, there are very few Brazilian operators because most of them are all foreign operators that will now have to set up shop in Brazil to obtain a federal licence. For many years, players have been used to playing on offshore platforms. Upcoming law changes will make the experience of using an unlicensed platform much harder. For example, there will be restrictions on advertising and on payment methods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Foreign operators will therefore have to obtain a licence from the Ministry of Finance and players will have to play only on licenced operators in Brazil. Right now, we’re in a<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/grey-market-online-gambling-brazil/"> grey market</a> until the full legal framework is laid out, but from the moment licences are made available at federal level, it will officially become a black market, and will be considered significantly riskier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There will always be ways of circumventing the regulated market, but I think it’s going to be more cumbersome for them to be able to play in the black market. So, hopefully the ordinances will allow a balance between what operators need to do, what the players need to do, and what the government needs to do so that the new regulated market will be sufficiently attractive to encourage players to bet in a licenced environment.</p>

 With many Brazilian players already familiar with gambling on the grey market, how ready and willing do you think players will be to switch to regulated, domestic platforms, where they will be required to complete a KYC process and follow tax payments? 



<p>It all depends on how easy it is to operate in the regulated market. I think there’s still some uncertainties regarding how the tax will be calculated and collected. I think if they had published the methodology of how the player’s income tax will be calculated then that would have been very positive in terms of encouraging players to place their bets in the domestic market. We just need to wait and see what happens. However, if the legal framework is more time and cost consuming than continuing to place bets on the black market, then of course we’re going to have channelization issues, which of course the federal government would like to avoid. Also, will the regulations leave enough room to guarantee the return on investment, because the licence fee is going to be quite high: 30 million Brazilian Reals, which is about $6 million for a 5-year licence. That puts Brazil as one of the most expensive places in the world to obtain a licence.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Also, of course, let’s not forget the real reason for regulating the market, which is player protection and investment protection, so hopefully the balance will be found to avoid players continuing to place their bets on the black market.</p>



 Brazil is forecast to become the largest gambling market in the world. Do you see any obstacles in its way to achieving that? 



<p>Well, I’m an eternal optimist, so if a good balance can be found, which will require all stakeholders to make concessions, then I think so. In Brazil, professional football depends massively on sponsorship provided by operators, and there has been an increase in the value of sponsorship over the years and now that the law has passed, I have seen the amounts go up quite significantly. It’s likely to lower again at some point in the future, but right now sponsorship amounts are record-breaking, and every week we receive news that a football club is receiving twice, three times the amount of sponsorship of previous deals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, there’s a lot of appetite for Brazil to become the largest gambling market in the world, and I think it will generate a lot of jobs, a lot of investment, but we need to find the balance. This is the key issue; we are in a newly regulated market and everything’s new for everyone. This is the big opportunity we have been waiting decades for, and now is the time to get it right.</p>



 As a lawyer, what is your opinion of the Brazil licensing requirements? Too arduous, too many loopholes, or to be expected? 



<p>Well, the law has been framed in a way that if an operator doesn’t obtain a licence, they’re going to be subject to many restrictions to access the Brazilian market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Brazilian federal government has always said that once licences are made available then they are going to enforce legislation. We have seen at state level many enforcement actions by certain states, especially Rio Janeiro and Paraná, because not only do we have the federal licence regime, but we also have state licences because federal legislation has taken so long to be enacted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since 2020, states have enacted their own legislation to grant state licences for traditional lottery and for fixed odd sports betting, as fixed odd sports betting was legalized in Brazil as a form of lottery, and we have seen many clients of ours receive notices and subpoenas as they have not obtained a state licence. One of the main problems we have is of the legal problems caused by the dichotomy between federal and state licences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re awaiting the official licencing requirements. We only have the main points in the law. So, we know it’s an open licencing model with no limit on the number of licences issued, which is good, that’s the model I have been advocating for many years. We know it’s going to cost 30 million Brazilian Reals for a five-year licence, and each operator can promote up to three brands, and not necessarily the operator’s own brand, so there could be licencing arrangements with other brand holders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plan is to have two windows per year during which the applications can be filled. 134 companies submitted applications last year, well, submitted an expression of interest and the federal government has promised priority in the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;Hopefully the Ministry of Finance will have sufficient human resources to process all these applications, because they are going to be flooded with a lot of paperwork. Everything is going to be done electronically, which should be more efficient, but there’s going to be a lot of documents that need to be provided. We still do not know whether documents coming from overseas will have to satisfy the formalities of notarization. It’s going to be the first experience in Brazil in terms of licencing at federal level, but hopefully we’ll get there!&nbsp;</p>



 In your legal opinion, how well-prepared are Brazilian operators, particularly start-ups, to navigate the complexities of the new regulatory landscape in the online gambling sector? 



<p>Well, there’s going to be a surge in igaming lawyers in all aspects of the law, because this is a very detailed, regulatory environment. So, there are many different aspects to it. So, I think Brazilian operators may have an advantage of knowing the law better, and how it could evolve with upcoming regulations, as they know the market so well. Maybe they don’t have the strength that foreign operators have, but at least they have the knowledge of the local market and knowledge of the local law, which should give them a certain competitive advantage. Foreign operators who set up shop in Brazil will gradually have to learn their way around the treacherous waters of the Brazilian legal system because, as we say, Brazil is not for amateurs.</p>



 With other countries in the Americas opening, such as Peru, how important do you think the region will become in the global gambling market in the next 5 to 10 years? Is the future bright? 



<p>I think Latin America is the new frontier of the gaming industry. So, most of it is still uncharted territory, especially Brazil, but I think things will become clearer with time. But, yes, Latin America is the place to be at the moment and I think we’ll be in the spotlight for many years to come.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have seen other surprise advancements, even in the Muslim world, with land-based casinos being floated in the UAE for example, and even places like Saudi Arabia are now considering casinos. So, I think igaming is seen as something that needs to be focused on and Latin America, Mexico, all the way down to Argentina and Chile are going to be in the spotlight with Brazil likely to become the main player in that regional market.</p>

In it, OCEAN rewards doubled to 300,000 OCEAN/week. This breaks down as follows. Passive DF &amp; Active DF now get 150K OCEAN/week. Within Active DF, Volume DF budget is 112.5K OCEAN/week and Predictoor DF gets 37.5K OCEAN/week. ROSE rewards continue at 20K ROSE/week.</blockquote><p>Data Farming Round 81 (DF81) has completed. 300K OCEAN + 20K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am March 14, 2024 and ended 12:01 am March 21. You can claim rewards at the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF82 is live today, March 21. It concludes on March 28. 300K OCEAN and 20K ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF82  <a>Section 5</a>: Bug Fixed in Volume&nbsp;DF  <a>Appendix</a>: Complementary Bug Fix Explainer   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: Passive DF, Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF, and Predictoor DF.</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF82 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;2.</p><p>Budget. This round has 300,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 150K OCEAN (50% of&nbsp;rewards)  Active DF: 150K OCEAN (50% of rewards). To each substream:<br>– Volume DF: 112.5K OCEAN<br>– Predictoor DF: 37.5K OCEAN + 20K&nbsp;ROSE  <p>Networks. Passive DF applies to OCEAN locked on Ethereum mainnet. Predictoor DF applies to activity on Oasis Sapphire. Volume DF applies to data assets published on Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/discover/networks">Here</a> is more information about Ocean deployments to networks.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by asset’s DCV * (% stake in asset) *DCV_multiplier. This <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-reward-function-tuned-d74b5134b5d1">prevents wash consume</a>. The value DCV_multiplier is 20.1% for Predictoor feeds, and 0.1% otherwise.  <p>Any OCEAN budgeted for Volume DF that wasn’t rewarded goes back into the DF pot for future DF&nbsp;rounds.</p><p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> 5. Bug Fixed in Volume&nbsp;DF  5.1 Summary <p>This week, we discovered and fixed a bug in Volume DF. It applied DCV bounds too loosely. We’ve fixed it now. Accounts doing Volume DF should expect reduced rewards from DF81 payouts&nbsp;onwards.</p> 5.2 Status Quo&nbsp;Behavior <p><a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/df-py/">df-py</a> is the GitHub repo implementing DF rewards formulae. The issue is in <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/df-py/issues/821">df-py issue #821</a>; we bring relevant info&nbsp;here</p><p>Here is the main formula for Volume DF rewards, before the fix. It’s from df-py’s <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/df-py/blob/cca4665cfb0670d23b67767ce6e724c56be338e3/df_py/volume/reward_calculator.py#L182C1-L205C18">reward_calculator.py</a>.</p> R[i, j] = min(<br>    perc_at_j * perc_at_ij * self.OCEAN_avail,<br>    ocean_locked_ij * TARGET_WPY,  # bound rewards by max APY<br>    DCV_OCEAN_j * multiplier,  # bound rewards by DCV<br>) <p>R[i,j] is the reward amount in OCEAN, for user i and asset&nbsp;j.</p><p>Inside the min() function, the first term is the baseline reward amount. The second &amp; third terms bound by max APY and DCV respectively. The problem is in the third term with DCV_OCEAN_j.</p><p>If DCV is sufficiently low that Volume DF rewards should be bounded it (typical), and if Alice splits her veOCEAN across 2 accounts, then Alice will get more rewards compared to if a single account. This is incorrect behavior.</p><p>We can tell that this happens in the DCV_OCEAN_j line, because it’s only a function of j and not of i as&nbsp;well.</p> 5.3 Problem with Status Quo&nbsp;Behavior <blockquote>The # rewards that Alice gets should only be a function of how much veOCEAN Alice has, not whether she has one account or two (or&nbsp;100).</blockquote><p>The bug exposed Volume DF to Sybil attacks: Alice got 2x more reward than she was supposed to for having 2 accounts. If she had 100 accounts, she would have got 100x more (up to where the asset-level DCV bounds kicked in). In other words, Volume DF over-rewarded each individual address.</p><p>It also meant that each account got over-rewarded, since they were only bounded by DCV of the asset, not by their pro-rata stake in the&nbsp;asset.</p><p>This was the case since asset-level DCV bounds were introduced: <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee">DF23</a> on Feb 2,&nbsp;2023.</p> 5.4 Reproducing the&nbsp;Problem <p>The following code exposes the issue, in test form. The first test is for one account; the second is for two accounts. It should have rewarded the same total OCEAN (50) whether there was one account, or&nbsp;two.</p> def test_bound_by_DCV_1nft_1accounts():<br>    DCV_OCEAN = 100.0<br><br>    stakes = {chain1_id: {nft1_addr: {user1_addr: 1e6}}}<br>    nftvols = {chain1_id: {OCEAN_addr: {nft1_addr: DCV_OCEAN}}}<br>    OCEAN_avail = 10000.0<br><br>    with patch("df_py.volume.reward_calculator.calc_dcv_multiplier") as mock_dcv:<br>        mock_dcv.return_value = 0.5<br>        rewards_per_user, _ = _calc_rewards(stakes, nftvols, OCEAN_avail)<br>    assert rewards_per_user == {user1_addr: 50.0}<br><br>def test_bound_by_DCV_1nft_2accounts():<br>    DCV_OCEAN = 100.0<br><br>    stakes = {chain1_id: {nft1_addr: {user1_addr: 0.5e6, user2_addr: 0.5e6}}}<br>    nftvols = {chain1_id: {OCEAN_addr: {nft1_addr: DCV_OCEAN}}}<br>    OCEAN_avail = 10000.0<br><br>    with patch("df_py.volume.reward_calculator.calc_dcv_multiplier") as mock_dcv:<br>        mock_dcv.return_value = 0.5<br>        rewards_per_user, _ = _calc_rewards(stakes, nftvols, OCEAN_avail)<br>    assert rewards_per_user == {user1_addr: 25.0, user2_addr: 25.0} <p>We had the first test before, and it passed. Whereas the newly-introduced second test failed. In it, of the two accounts got 50 OCEAN, for 50+50 = 100 OCEAN total. Correct would have been 25+25 = 50 OCEAN&nbsp;total.</p><p>This is good news: we had reproduced the issue in reproducible tests. <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/df-py/pull/809/files#diff-936f12da0a54dc6256a4ffd1e8418c94405af8f70bb269a34a6cbf968d88528c">Here’s the PR</a>; the code shown is modified slightly for readability.</p> 5.5 The Fix to the&nbsp;Problem <p>Here’s the change in code. The “before” line in red didn’t properly bound rewards. The “after” line in green does. The main fix was just one line. (<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/df-py/pull/809/files#diff-afc4732bb19ebf7622890387838941eddb3d67d74dee5cd6dc7127a6fe889a7f">Here’s the&nbsp;PR</a>.)</p>Red = before the fix, green = after the fix. DCV bounds are now scaled by the user’s proportion of rewards, perc_at_ij.<p>The specific fix is: the DCV bounds need to also scale by the account’s proportion of stake in the asset, perc_at_ij. Like all proportions, 0 &lt;=perc_at_ij ≤&nbsp;1.</p><p>With the fix in place, the previously-failing test now passed.&nbsp;Great!</p> 5.6 How does this affect users going&nbsp;forward? <blockquote>In previous rounds, accounts were being over-rewarded in Volume DF because it wasn’t properly bounding on&nbsp;DCV.</blockquote><blockquote>Accounts can expect the proper amount of reward now, from DF81 payouts onwards. It is almost certainly less than&nbsp;before.</blockquote><p>Here’s why one should expect less rewards in Volume DF. The additional term perc_at_ij in the rewards line has value between 0 and 1, and is rarely 1 because one user rarely has all the&nbsp;stake.</p><p>In other words, there’s an OCEAN reward allocated for a given asset (based on its DCV compared to other assets), and that reward is spread among different accounts (based on their relative stakes in the&nbsp;asset).</p> 5.7 Final Clarifications <p>Just to say it: we won’t retroactively reduce any rewards. For starters, even trying would be pretty uncool! Second, it’s not very pragmatic to implement.</p><p>Also, this only affects Volume DF rewards. There is no change to Passive DF Rewards, or to Predictoor DF&nbsp;Rewards.</p><p>It’s also not a security vulnerability. Yes it was a Sybil attack, but in this case it means that a person could Sybil-attack to take comparatively more rewards for themselves. Emphatically, it was not a security bug: there were no funds at risk, and there were no funds&nbsp;stolen.</p><p>UPDATE: one day after we published this post, we have introduced <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-5x-predictoor-boost-in-volume-data-farming-c9a93b33b928">5x Predictoor Boost</a> to restore Volume DF reward&nbsp;levels.</p> Appendix: Bug Fix Explainer <p>This subsection describes the bug fix changes end-to-end, in a different voice.</p><p>You may see see a significant drop in your Volume DF rewards this week. This is indeed the correct behavior after the bug&nbsp;fix.</p><p>Let’s elaborate. We discovered a bug that gave more rewards payout for Volume DF than the design intent. We fixed the bug within hours of discovery. With the bug fixed, users will see a sizeable drop in Volume DF payout compared to previous weeks. Although this drop is large, the code is updated with the correct functionality that Volume DF rewards were supposed to have all&nbsp;along.</p><p>Here’s that rewards&nbsp;logic:</p>  asset X generates data consume volume&nbsp;DCV.  then, Volume DF rewards for asset X are either DCV_multiplier= 20.1% (Predictoor feeds) or 0.1% other&nbsp;assets).  those asset rewards for are divided among veOCEAN holders who allocated veOCEAN to this asset, according to their stake. This is where delegations get counted&nbsp;too.  <p>Then, repeat the above for each of the&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Realistically, there is only volume on Predictoor feeds. So DCV is basically the Predictoor DF rewards of 37,500 OCEAN. Multiplying the 37,500 OCEAN times 20.1% for Predictoor feeds means about 7,500 OCEAN. The remaining 37,500–7,500=30,000 OCEAN that was budgeted for Volume DF goes back into the Data Farming pot for future DF&nbsp;rounds.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">Data Farming docs</a> provide all key info, guides on how to earn, and detailed info about reward schedule, APYs, and the&nbsp;like.</p><p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> blog post is a thorough listing of all DF articles in one&nbsp;place.</p> About Ocean, DF and Predictoor <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

 Unveiling a New&nbsp;Era <p>In our digital age, the management of digital identities has become a critical concern. Traditional centralized systems, managed by entities like Google and Facebook, often fall short in safeguarding user privacy and security. This introduces Decentralized Identity (DID), a paradigm shift that promises not just a technological revolution but a cultural transformation, emphasizing digital independence and security.</p><p>The evolution of identity management from centralized to decentralized models, with DID at the helm, marks a significant departure from the status quo. Initially, online identification relied on methods like emails and passwords, with enhancements such as WebAuthn bolstering user authentication. However, these centralized systems presented considerable privacy and security vulnerabilities, leading to an urgent call for a new approach. DID, utilizing blockchain technology, represents this new frontier. By empowering users with control over their personal data, DID ensures privacy and enhances security, heralding a new era of digital interactions that prioritize user autonomy.</p><p>This shift to DID introduces numerous benefits:</p>  Streamlined Verification: Simplifies the authentication process, allowing for safe and efficient identity&nbsp;checks.  Enhanced Security: By distributing data across a decentralized network, DID minimizes the risks associated with centralized data&nbsp;storage.  Greater Privacy: Users control their personal information, sharing only what’s necessary and with whom they&nbsp;choose.  Reduced Data Breaches: The decentralized nature and encryption methods lower the potential for large-scale data breaches.  <p>Blockchain technology underpins DID’s advantages, providing a decentralized framework that transforms personal data management. This not only secures information through encryption but also assures data integrity, as altering recorded information requires network consensus. Blockchain’s role is pivotal in overcoming the limitations of centralized systems, offering a verification mechanism that bolsters trust without compromising privacy.</p><p>As we look towards a future shaped by these advancements, DID stands as a beacon for a user-centric digital ecosystem. This evolution from centralized control to decentralized empowerment signifies more than technological progress; it marks a shift towards a digital existence where privacy, security, and user autonomy are paramount. The journey towards this future, driven by blockchain’s innovative capabilities, promises to redefine digital identity management, ensuring a more secure, transparent, and empowering online&nbsp;world.</p><p>In conclusion, the move to decentralized identity systems is not merely a response to the shortcomings of centralized models but a forward-looking vision for a digital society grounded in autonomy and trust. As this paradigm shift unfolds, DID emerges not just as a technological solution but as a cornerstone for a future where digital interactions are rooted in empowerment and transparency, reshaping our digital lives in profound ways. This transition to a decentralized framework marks a pivotal moment in our collective digital journey, promising a more secure, private, and user-centric online experience.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/basics-and-importance-of-decentralized-identity-56098fd64fe5">Basics and Importance of Decentralized Identity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>The National Security Agency (NSA), in conjunction with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), recently released its “<a href="https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Press-Releases-Statements/Press-Release-View/Article/3699169/nsa-releases-top-ten-cloud-security-mitigation-strategies/">Top Ten Cloud Security Mitigation Strategies</a>” for organizations to make their cloud environments more secure. The report contains a Cybersecurity Information Sheet (CSI) for each strategy, which includes MITRE ATT&amp;CK and D3FEND mappings and cloud-specific mitigation guidance.</p>  
<p>The agency emphasizes that these measures are critical for every company that uses cloud services as these environments are increasingly targeted by malicious cyber actors (MCAs). Earlier this year, the NSA, CISA and a host of international cybersecurity agencies <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Press-Releases-Statements/Press-Release-View/Article/3686651/russian-cyber-actors-target-cloud-hosted-infrastructure/">issued a joint advisory</a> analyzing the way that advanced persistent threat (APT) groups are evolving their tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) to focus on initial access and disruption of cloud services. The new guidance provides mitigation strategies to counter these threats.</p> 
<p>Full strategy list:</p> 
  
  Uphold the cloud shared responsibility model  
  Use secure cloud identity and access management practices  
  Use secure cloud key management practices  
  Implement network segmentation and encryption in cloud environments  
  Secure data in the cloud  
  Defending continuous integration/continuous delivery environments&nbsp;  
  Enforce secure automated deployment practices through infrastructure as code  
  Account for complexities introduced by hybrid cloud and multi-cloud environments  
  Mitigate risks from managed service providers in cloud environments&nbsp;  
  Manage cloud logs for effective threat hunting  
  
 NSA Cloud Security Guidance Takeaway #1: Cloud Security Starts With Identity Security&nbsp;  
<p>Much of the guidance centers on having a robust identity security program. Insufficiently secure identity systems leave organizations exposed to any number of threats including phishing, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-prevent-man-in-the-middle-attacks">man-in-the-middle</a> attacks, identity fraud, MFA bombing attacks and more. Last year saw a 71% spike in cyberattacks that exploited stolen or compromised credentials, according to IBM’s <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/threat-intelligence">2024 threat report</a>, accounting for 30% of attacks. The report also revealed that 90% of the cloud assets for sale on the dark web were cloud account credentials.</p> 
 Phishing-Resistant MFA Is No Longer Optional  
<p>Two of the top strategies directly relate to secure identity practices, and several others on the list call out the need to protect credentials and the threat posed by passwords and shared secrets. Specifically, the guidance recommends the use of phishing-resistant MFA as widely as possible. It defines phishing resistant methods as FIDO standards based public key cryptography or PKI-based CAC/PIV cards, pointing to the <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-the-cisa-multi-factor-authentication-guidance-means-for-enterprises">phishing-resistant MFA fact sheet</a> issued earlier by CISA.</p> 
<p>Example of phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication flow:</p> 
<p></p> 
 NSA Cloud Security Guidance Takeaway #2: Context Is King  
<p>Multiple measures in the guidance emphasize the need for detailed contextual information about the system’s activity and behavior. This data is critical to govern access and drive appropriate and timely responses to potential threats. For example, the report highlights the need for <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/context-based-authentication-to-improve-security">context-based authentication</a>, using conditions such as geo location</p> 
<p>The effectiveness of such context-based access controls depends on the fidelity of the information flow, which in turn depends on monitoring risk from a wide variety of sources. Ideally, an organization’s cloud identity control systems would leverage the same risk data being collected for threat hunting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 NSA Cloud Security Guidance Takeaway #3: Minimize Complexity  
<p>Before rolling out MFA and other cloud security solutions, it's crucial to fully understand the range of scenarios they'll be used in. The NSA guidance cautions against an uncoordinated approach, which can leave gaps in coverage and create complexity. Using multiple IAM systems and different authenticators can create confusion for users and hinder adoption. It also makes it harder to manage and monitor security effectively.</p> 
<p>This becomes especially critical in multi-cloud and hybrid environments. Attackers move back and forth between on-prem and cloud environments. The guidance recommends the organizations implement identity solutions that can unify disparate systems and support all of their use cases. Authentication protocols should follow the <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST SP 800-63 </a>Digital Identity Guidelines.</p> 
 NSA Cloud Security Guidance Takeaway #4: Embrace Zero Trust Principles  
<p>Whether you’re of the camp that Zero Trust is a marketing buzzword, or if it’s your guiding north star, the principles behind Zero Trust are solid security best practices. A Zero Trust approach makes data, systems, and networks harder for attackers to compromise in the first place, and slows them down if they do manage to get a foothold.&nbsp; Much of the NSA Cloud Security guidance is, in effect, Zero Trust tenets made actionable, starting with <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/zero-trust-authentication">Zero Trust authentication</a> and least-privilege access control, to strong cryptographic protocols and network segmentation. Implicit in all of the guidance is to bake in Zero Trust best practices as you migrate to the cloud. It’s harder to re-architect already established systems, especially if there is not adequate segregation of duties. For example, your authentication systems should be separate from your IdP.</p> 
 Tips for Implementing Phishing-Resistant MFA  
<p>The NSA recommendation for phishing-resistant MFA stands out as one of the simplest yet most effective strategies. Until now, it's been the high-stakes sectors like financial services, insurance, and critical infrastructure leading the charge in adopting phishing-resistant controls. The NSA guidance makes clear that it’s time for security teams across the board to catch up. Here are some things to keep in mind:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
  
  Prioritize a consistent experience. Users want a simple login process that is the same across cloud systems and resources as well as other channels. Employ independent, phishing-resistant authentication controls that work with multiple identity sources to provide a uniform experience.  
  Take a phased approach. Start with critical systems and high-risk users to minimize disruption and maximize impact. As you troubleshoot and succeed, gradually extend the approach to wider systems and user groups.  
  Beware of FIDO imitators. There is a vast difference between "FIDO-like" or "FIDO-compliant" and "FIDO Certified." Verify vendors' certifications on the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/fido-certified-products/">FIDO website</a>, ensuring all solution components, authenticators and servers, are certified.  
  
 How Organizations Can Meet NSA Cloud Security Provisions  
<p>The new guidance from NSA underscores the critical role identity plays in fortifying cloud security defenses. With malicious actors increasingly targeting cloud environments, and specifically identity systems, following recommended best practices becomes indispensable. The rapid <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/preventing-generative-ai-attacks">weaponization of generative AI</a> in attacks makes this even more critical.</p> 
<p>HYPR's Identity Assurance platform, which includes HYPR Authenticate, HYPR Adapt, and HYPR Affirm, ensures that identity security meets NSA standards. It combines advanced passkey-based authentication with adaptive identity risk management, automated identity verification, and a user-friendly experience.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>If you’re an IAM (Identity and Access Management) manager in a small or medium-sized business, you know the challenge of trying to secure a growing ecosystem of SaaS (Software as a Service) applications. Every day, there’s a new app that one of your employees must have, and it’s your job to ensure access is granted quickly, consistently, and securely. But with each new app, the risks of inconsistent access management grows. Is there a way to solve this challenge? Of course, there is. Why else would I be writing this and you reading it?</p>
<p>Read on.</p>
<p>Many apps can’t be easily integrated into your IAM system. The apps might support SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) for single sign-on (SSO), but that’s often locked behind an expensive “Enterprise” tier. And even if you can afford it, automated provisioning requires SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management), which is even less commonly supported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SCIM is an open standard that defines a schema for exchanging user identity information between systems. It allows IAM systems to automate the provisioning, de-provisioning, and management of user accounts in SaaS apps, ensuring that access is always in sync with the user’s current role and employment status.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Without SCIM, IAM managers are forced to rely on manual processes and custom integrations to manage SaaS app access. As your team and SaaS portfolio grow, these manual processes become increasingly unsustainable and error-prone.</p>
 The Challenge: SaaS App Sprawl and Access Management Complexity 
<p>So what do you do? Many fall back on spreadsheets and a patchwork of playbooks to try to keep up. But this approach has serious risks – and the risks get worse as you add more apps and more people with varying access needs and roles. This perfect storm of complexity spirals out of control, leading to inconsistencies, security risks, and compliance issues.</p>
 The Risks of Inconsistent Access Management 
<p>When onboarding and offboarding processes vary from app to app, it’s easy for things to fall through the cracks.</p>
<p>Imagine a new sales rep who starts work excited to dive in and close some deals, only to find they can’t access the CRM because their account hasn’t been provisioned. Or consider the IT team that thinks they’ve completed an employee’s offboarding, only to discover weeks later that the ex-employee still has access to sensitive data in a cloud storage app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These inconsistencies not only frustrate employees and waste time they also create serious security risks that compound with each new app.</p>
 The Dangers of Access Creep 
<p>Then there’s the access creep. As employees move between roles, their permissions don’t always keep up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Ex-engineer Al Sutton revealed that despite quitting 18 months ago he still retained access to Twitter’s central file store on GitHub, a website used by software developers to store source code.” — <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/08/24/ex-twitter-staff-have-access-secret-software-code-whistleblower/#:~:text=Ex%2Dengineer%20Al%20Sutton%20revealed%20that%20despite%20quitting%2018%20months%20ago%20he%20still%20retained%20access%20to%20Twitter%27s%20central%20file%20store%20on%20GitHub%2C%20a%20website%20used%20by%20software%20developers%20to%20store%20source%20code.">The Telegraph</a></p>
<p>Consider a tech startup that uses GitHub Teams to manage their code repositories. When an engineer leaves the company, their GitHub account isn’t always immediately deprovisioned from the company’s GitHub organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the IT team is busy or forgets to follow up, the ex-employee could retain access to critical codebases, infrastructure-as-code templates, and other sensitive IP long after they’ve left. This lingering access is a major security risk even if the engineer has no malicious intent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>If the engineer’s personal GitHub account is ever compromised, hackers could then gain access to the company’s crucial assets. As your company grows and more employees cycle through, the risk of this happening increases.</p>
 The Danger of Poor Visibility 
<p>Perhaps most concerning is the lack of visibility into user permissions across SaaS apps. Even with an IAM system in place, the lack of automation makes it impossible to fully track and manage access across all SaaS apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider an auditor who asks to see a report of everyone who has admin access to your financial systems. If those permissions are managed in a spreadsheet or worse, in someone’s head, you’re going to have a tough time pulling that report together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if you can’t confidently prove who has access to what, you risk failing the audit and losing out on big deals with security-conscious customers. Achieving SOC2 compliance with inconsistent access management is a daunting task that only gets harder as your SaaS ecosystem expands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And even if you’re not pursuing SOC2 compliance, put yourself in your customers’ shoes: would you buy a product from a company that can’t even track something as basic as what their employees have access to?</p>
<p>The longer you wait to address these issues, the more entrenched and intractable they become. That’s why it’s critical to implement a solution now, before your SaaS environment grows too complex to manage.</p>
 The Solution: Centralized IAM Playbooks 
<p>By bringing all your access management processes together in one place – including manual steps, automated workflows, and everything in between – you can ensure consistent, timely execution of access changes across all your apps, now and in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You gain a single pane of glass to monitor and manage permissions. And you can easily generate the reports you need to breeze through your next compliance audit, no matter how many SaaS apps you’ve added to your stack.</p>
 Why Legacy IAM Falls Short 
<p>But not all IAM solutions are up to this task. Legacy IAM systems often lack the flexibility and extensibility needed to implement truly centralized playbooks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They might handle the basics of single sign-on and provisioning, yet struggle to accommodate the custom workflows and manual steps that are a reality of life with SaaS apps, especially as your app portfolio diversifies.</p>

<p>With the turn of the 20th century and the rise of the internet, transactions and services became increasingly digital – and so did our identities. Unlike physical identities where a person is in complete control of their identification documents and knows when these documents are missing or stolen, digital identities are stored on servers and databases owned by third-party vendors that offer their services in a digital format. So, it’s highly unlikely a person would know when their digital identity is stolen or compromised. In effect, a cybercriminal could pose as a legitimate user and inflict financial and reputational damage over a long period of time before the breach is detected.</p>
<p>As cloud adoption and digital transformation has accelerated over the last few years, so has application sprawl, with the average company having over 254 SaaS apps, and less than half of those being used on a regular basis, according to a Productiv study. And an average mobile phone user has 80 apps installed, with 62% of those apps not used on a regular basis, according to a DataProt study. This SaaS sprawl has led to password fatigue and reuse as well as dormant accounts, increasing the attack surface for cybercriminals to launch successful identity-based attacks. It’s no wonder that phishing and credential compromise are the two most common initial attack vectors.</p>
<p>Taking a layered approach to identity-first security</p>
<p>With the advent of generative AI technologies and criminal SaaS offerings such as phishing as a service that enable cybercriminals to launch effective and targeted phishing campaigns, identity has quickly become the perimeter that organizations need to secure against cyberattacks.</p>
<p>In order to build an effective identity-first security strategy, organizations need to take a layered approach to a proactive defense – starting with an effective AI-based biometric solution to verify identities accurately while detecting fake IDs and deepfakes.</p>
<p>Then, enabling high assurance phishing-resistant <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/identity-and-access-management/capabilities/passwordless-login">passwordless authentication</a> (e.g., certificate-based authentication with passkeys) can help authenticate seamlessly while protecting against phishing and MFA-bypass attacks.</p>
<p>You can further eliminate the dangers that come with SaaS application sprawl and password fatigue&nbsp;by implementing a true passwordless experience with <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/identity-and-access-management/capabilities/single-sign-on">single sign-on (SSO)</a> and just-in-time user provisioning capabilities. This can streamline the authentication process and help eliminate dormant accounts, reducing license costs associated with granting user licenses for applications that users never log in to.</p>
<p>Finally, tying in a robust adaptive risk engine that can evaluate the risk score of a user based on contextual information (IP address, geolocation, travel velocity, behavioral biometrics, etc.) introduces friction in the process by requiring a second <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/identity-and-access-management/capabilities/multi-factor-authentication-mfa">MFA</a> or blocking access when risk levels are higher than a set threshold.</p>
<p>As we’ve seen in some recent breaches, bringing in an identity verification step with physical credentials and liveness detection during MFA/password resets – to secure a high-value transaction or out-of-compliance user –&nbsp;can build a robust, proactive identity-first security strategy.</p>

<p>Ensuring the safety of sensitive data and privacy shifts from just a priority to an absolute necessity. Authentication, the gatekeeper of these digital resources, is crucial in this fight against cybercrime.&nbsp; In this article, you will learn what it is, why it’s helpful, how it differs from other types of authentication, and how you could implement it in your organization.</p>
 What is Step-Up Authentication? 
<p>Step Up Authentication is a dynamic form of multi-factor authentication. It works by adjusting the level of security and user verification based on the associated risk of a specific action, transaction, or mobile account.</p>
<p>Different triggers can prompt Step Up Authentication’s activation, like irregular user behavior, access requests from unfamiliar locations or devices, or high-risk transactions accessing sensitive data. Users may initially authenticate via traditional methods (username/password), but Step Up Authentication comes into play as the perceived risk escalates, demanding additional login credentials.</p>
<p>Step Up Authentication uses a hierarchical model adaptive authentication scheme, scaling from simple to complex; it provides the flexibility to apply the optimal level of security based on the perceived threat or the user’s risk profile.</p>
 The Anatomy of Step-Up Authentication 
<p></p>
<p>The behind-the-scenes operation of Step Up Authentication is a balance between risk assessment and corresponding adjustments to the step up authentication work up level. Each transaction or request initiates a process where the system evaluates the risk level and prompts the user for a related step up authentication.</p>
<p>To make these decisions, the system utilizes various risk assessment metrics. These include factors such as the sensitivity of the requested data, the location of the user’s location request, the behavior of the user, and even the time of the request.</p>
<p>Policy management plays a big role here, as it sets the rules and parameters for when and how the system should step up the authentication process. These policies, dictated by the nature of the business and its unique security requirements, ensure that the system remains secure and user-friendly.</p>
 The Evolution of Authentication 
<p>The progression of authentication techniques paints an interesting picture of human ingenuity in the face of evolving threats. Beginning with the humble password, these techniques have developed in response to escalating risks and more sophisticated threat actors.</p>
<p>The initial stage was dominated by password-based authentication systems, a straightforward and user-friendly method, yet not without its weaknesses. Passwords, being susceptible to breaches via techniques like brute-force attacks and phishing, necessitated a more robust system.</p>
<p>Subsequently, security tokens emerged as a new layer of protection. Yet, their physical nature introduced inconvenience and added risk of loss or theft. Later, the advent of biometric authentication marked a significant stride forward against identity theft, tying access to unique human characteristics such as fingerprints or retinal patterns.</p>
<p>The most significant leap in this evolutionary process was the introduction of multi-factor authentication, combining multiple layers of security to create a formidable barrier to unauthorized access to sensitive information.</p>
<p>While both Step-Up Authentication,&nbsp; Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and Adaptive Authentication serve the goal of improved security, they differ significantly in their approach.</p>
<p>MFA  involves presenting two or more independent credentials at every step up authentication vs. event. This could include something the user knows (password), something the user has (token), or something the user is (biometrics). MFA’s strength lies in its layered defense, using multiple authentication factors and making it challenging for unauthorized users to gain access even if they compromise one aspect.</p>
<p>Adaptive Authentication employs real-time risk assessments, considering many factors such as device reputation, IP reputation, geolocation, and behavior anomalies. Based on these assessments, Adaptive Authentication may permit, or deny authentication apps, or step up the authentication process.</p>
<p>Step-Up Authentication adjusts its various authentication factors and requirements based on the perceived risk level of a transaction or request. It might begin with a simple or two-factor authentication, such as a password, and add more layers as risk escalates. It offers the flexibility of user-friendly authentication for low-risk actions and robust security for higher-risk operations.</p>
 Viewing vs. Editing Data 
<p>One of the significant features of Step-Up Authentication is its ability to adapt to the nature of the user’s actions. For instance, when a user views data, the authentication process might require only the user’s password or a simple username and password in/password combination. This allows users to perform low-risk actions with minimal friction.</p>
<p>However, when the same user attempts to edit or export sensitive data, the system recognizes the higher risk and steps up the authentication process. This could involve using additional authentication credentials, such as a one-time password, biometric verification, or answering security questions. This dynamic response to requires users based on the action type underlines the adaptability and intelligence of Step-Up Authentication.</p>
 Step-Up Authentication in Practice 
<p>In practice, you’ll encounter Step Up Authentication in different scenarios, Financial institutions often apply it during high-value transactions. Cloud services employ it when users request access to susceptible information. It’s becoming increasingly ubiquitous across digital platforms, from email services to social media networks.</p>
<p>Sectors like healthcare, finance, education, and corporate entities, utilize Step Up Authentication as an essential tool in their security arsenal. It is increasingly recognized as a powerful means to secure sensitive data, protect user identities and stolen credentials, and maintain system integrity.</p>
 Step-Up Authentication Use Cases 
<p>Step-Up Authentication is not just a theory but a reality with practical applications across various digital platforms. For example, take a standard action like transferring funds from a banking app. Users might log in to the app using a username/password or biometric authentication. However, when the user initiates a high-value transfer, the system might request additional identity verification as a one-time password (OTP) sent to the user’s registered mobile number or email.</p>
<p>Another use case can be found within corporate systems; an employee may be able to access common, low-sensitivity resources using a simple password. Still, when attempting to access further sensitive resources, more sensitive information, or administrative controls, the system prompts them to undergo further authentication, such as answering security questions or presenting a physical token.</p>
 The Strengths of Step-Up Authentication 
<p></p>
<p>By assessing its impact, the merits of Step Up Authentication become abundantly clear. Its greatest strength lies in its ability to bolster security, creating a robust defense against a wide array of cyber threats.</p>
<p>But its benefits extend beyond security; it contributes significantly to improving user experience, as the need for rigorous additional authentication factors and measures only arises under elevated risk conditions. This reduces friction and potential frustration in day-to-day user interactions.</p>
<p>From a compliance perspective, Step Up Authentication also aids in meeting regulatory requirements for data breach protection. Moreover, it has become a potent tool in the risk management arsenal, offering an adaptive and responsive approach to data breaches and threat mitigation.</p>
 Pitfalls and Proactive Measures 
<p>Like any system, Step Up Authentication has its potential pitfalls. These include technical implementation challenges, user acceptance, and the ever-present struggle to balance security with ease of use. However, with a strategic approach, these obstacles can be navigated effectively.</p>
<p>Proactive problem-solving measures, such as comprehensive user education programs, policy optimization, and ongoing system monitoring and updating, are key to addressing these challenges.</p>
 Security Implications and Concerns in Step-Up Authentication 
<p>Though a significant security improvement, step-Up Authentication has potential risks and vulnerabilities. Understanding these security implications and how they can be mitigated is essential to ensure robust protection against cyber threats.</p>
<p>One potential concern is user acceptance and cooperation. Given its nature, users may need clarification on the changing requirements for authentication. This issue is not just a usability concern but also a security concern, as user non-compliance or bypass attempts can introduce vulnerabilities into the system.</p>
<p>Another concern revolves around the accuracy of risk assessment. The effectiveness of Step-Up Authentication depends primarily on correctly identifying and responding to potential risks. Inaccurate risk assessments can lead to security breaches if high-risk actions are not identified correctly and high-risk resources don’t trigger a step-up in authentication.</p>
<p>The additional security measures used in Step-Up Authentication, like biometrics or security questions, bring potential vulnerabilities. For instance, biometric data can be spoofed, and security questions can often be guessed or discovered through social engineering.</p>
 Mitigation Practices for Step-Up Authentication 
<p>Mitigating these concerns involves several strategies:</p>
 
 Clear communication about how the system works and its necessity can be beneficial to increase user acceptance. 
 User training can also help ensure that users understand the authentication requirements. 
 Refinement of the risk assessment algorithm and learning from past mistakes are critical for improving risk assessment accuracy. 
 Regular auditing and testing can help identify potential weaknesses in the risk assessment process. 
 
<p>As for the vulnerabilities related to additional security measures, it is key to ensure these are implemented with their own security best practices. For instance, biometric data should be stored securely, and liveness detection tools, like <a>BlockID,</a> should be used to prevent spoofing.</p>

<p>Announcing significant security and performance upgrades</p>Fast and Reliable Security for Digital Supply&nbsp;Chains<p>The Transmute Team is announcing significant performance and security upgrades to our Verifiable Data Platform, following the successful launch of new features such as <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/bridging-the-digital-deserts-along-your-supply-chain-af6afbee8595">analog twins</a> and our <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/neo4j-graph-data-science-with-verifiable-credential-data-98b806f2ad78">Neo4J adapter</a>.

Addressing critical feedback, we have focused on improving performance and security to support enterprise-scale transactions.</p><p>What’s New</p><p>As of March 2024, the Transmute Verifiable Data Platform has transitioned to using <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-jose-cose/#securing-json-ld-verifiable-credentials-with-jose">W3C JSON Web Tokens (JWT) secured with JOSE</a> as the primary credential format, in compliance with the technical requirements set by US Customs and Border Protection (US CBP).

No further action is required for these credentials.

The conversion from JSON-LD to n-Quads, required for verifying DIP credentials, was not only time-consuming but also vulnerable to denial of service attacks. By adopting JWT, we can verify the sender’s signature before any further data processing, significantly reducing the attack&nbsp;surface.</p><p>For more technical details, visit:<a href="https://transmute-industries.github.io/vc-jwt-sd/"> Security Considerations for&nbsp;VC-JWT</a></p><p>Additionally, the performance of DIP was sub-optimal for large JSON-LD credentials commonly used in supply chain scenarios.

<p>On today’s episode we talked with Eric Scouten, Senior Engineering Manager at Adobe, who has been working for the last four years on solving content authenticity. What does that mean? We’ll get into it in the episode, but suffice it to say that it’s an effort to bring trust to content online.</p><p>Was the pope really photographed in that puffy jacket? Was the photo of a war zone really taken this week, or is that from several years ago? And we’ll get into how to identify the identity of the individual or business behind the content, in a privacy-preserving way.</p><p>We talk about adoption of the C2PA standard, how the content authenticity initiative recruited so many of the most influential tech and media platforms, and how Adobe built the conviction to ship the first versions into production despite a cold start problem.</p><p>We also talk about the user experience of content authenticity, both from the creator side and consumer side, and some thornier issues including potential for censorship and deceit.</p><p>This is a fascinating episode into an emerging standard that I believe will be an important part of all our lives over the coming years, and example of incredible innovation coming from a large technology company.</p><p>You can learn more about the Content Authenticity Alliance at <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/">https://contentauthenticity.org/</a> and you can find more about the C2PA standard at <a href="https://c2pa.org/">https://c2pa.org/</a></p><p>Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for more announcements related to the future of identity at <a href="http://trinsic.id/podcast">trinsic.id/podcast</a></p><p>Reach out to Riley (<a href="https://twitter.com/rileyphughes">@rileyphughes</a>) and Trinsic (<a href="https://twitter.com/trinsic_id">@trinsic_id</a>) on Twitter.

<p>In today’s fast-paced world, time is a precious commodity. While machines perform tasks at remarkable speeds, the human workforce often encounters periods of non-machine idle time, hindering overall productivity. Enter digital machine intelligence, a solution poised to transform the way we capture and analyze production performance to alleviate this issue and propelling the payment card issuance and personalization industry into a new era of efficiency and innovation.</p>
<p>What Is Idle Time?</p>
<p>In manufacturing, the widely accepted definition is that idle time is the duration of time we wait while a machine or person, though fully functional, is not productive.</p>
<p>Idle time = scheduled production time – actual productive time.</p>
<p>The key here is the machine is fully functional (no errors, no broken parts, no system down, no communication issues, etc.), but it is not producing output for one reason or another.</p>
<p>Why Is It Important?</p>
<p>The most recent data I have gathered as a business analytics consultant in the card issuance and personalization space suggests that the average availability time for a company without any analytics solution or continuous improvement program ranges from 16% to 38%. This means that anywhere from 62%-84% of the time machines are not running when they could be. Closing that gap is where we see the largest impact when implementing continuous improvement and data-driven productivity gains on the production floor.</p>
<p>What Are Sources of Idle Time?</p>
<p>There are many common sources of idle time shared across all industries, but here we focus on those related to card issuance and personalization centers:</p>
 
 Machine or operator waiting for work or jobs – this issue stems from job planning or an issue with the preceding steps. 
 Machine or operator not authorized to perform work and waiting on approval – this could be due to quality checks, security checks, supervisor checks, missing job instructions, and so on. 
 Machine or operator is missing raw materials needed such as consumables and operator materials. 
 Machine or operator not present – this can happen for a variety of reasons including scheduled or unscheduled break, reassignment to another activity, or absenteeism with no backup resource available. 
 Machine or operator is on standby due to personal process limitations such as dual custody is required and only one operator is available, missing card needs to be found, a security incident related to the previous job run occurs and an investigation is underway, or machine calibration checks are needed. 
 The machine is undergoing setup for a variety of reasons including job loading or material loading, machine is getting cleaned or calibrated, or the workstation is getting set up for the job. 
 External dependencies are at play including a halt to production ordered by the customer, a quality or maintenance lead who initiates immediate work stoppage, a power or network outage, a supplies shortage, external software delays, an emergency evacuation, or any situation where wait times are instituted. 
 
<p>How to Reduce Idle Time</p>
<p>The first step to resolving any problem is to understand the root cause and magnitude. This is the basis of knowledge-based management or Lean Six Sigma manufacturing: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control.</p>
 
 Define: The definitions have been made clear on what idle time is; now the next step is to measure them. 
 Measure: To gauge machine productivity accurately, track scheduled work time and measure actual operational periods, focusing on the cumulative bursts of output like finished personalized products. If a software-hardware solution is not available, your best bet is manual monitoring with a stopwatch for the entirety of the day, ensuring unbiased and unhindered data collection. However, one caveat is that an on-site observer may not pinpoint process and employee-related issues with the utmost precision. 
 Analyze: After obtaining data for a single machine’s scheduled work versus actual work for a day, calculate the idle time. If the idle time exceeds 15% (idle time divided by scheduled work time), there is a problem requiring attention. Achieving the industry average of 15% idle time is possible with the implementation of software-hardware tracking systems along with fostering a continuous improvement culture. Thorough data collection enables the creation of a Pareto chart, identifying the easiest-to-solve issues, or “low-hanging fruits.” Targeting these areas strategically will maximize gains. In cases of insufficient data, a return to the measure phase is necessary to confidently identify root causes. Implementing tools like Ishikawa diagrams helps isolate overlapping causes, guiding resource allocation and energy to the right focus areas. 
 Improve: Identifying the problem is just the beginning; the real challenge is solving it. Now armed with insights into the issue’s source, you can brainstorm solutions – whether it involves process modifications, personnel retraining, or technological changes. Often, this is where an external consultant can offer valuable perspectives, leveraging industry experience and unbiased insights. Once a solution is pinpointed and evaluated, an implementation plan, coupled with a trial and measurement system, ensures fair assessment and feedback from all stakeholders. This initial trial is crucial for the success of the broader rollout. Lack of an experienced continuous improvement engineer often leads to challenges and failures at this stage, making external consultation advisable. 
 Control: After the successful trial and subsequent large-scale rollout, sustaining the solution becomes the most challenging phase. The absence of proper controls, feedback mechanisms, and the ability to steer the process, teams, and operation often leads to solutions unraveling after a few months. Management’s shift in focus and personnel reverting to familiar habits contribute to this breakdown. Control is about identifying any future pains that come up and developing and adapting the solution to overcome these bumps on the road so the gains of the solution can be earned for the long run. The key to process control is to know when it is going out of control, which requires continuous monitoring and data collection every minute of every hour to identify long-term trends. This is where having software running in the background collecting data analytics is key. Without control, processes fall apart. 
 
<p>The Power of Production Analytics</p>
<p>Idle time is by far the largest contributor to operational inefficiencies in card issuance and personalization environments. Many factories are using logbook-based manual measurements to understand what is happening, which can be marred by bias, human error, and lack of detail. Without a software-hardware based analytics solution, many key opportunities to improve go undiscovered. Once these problems have been clearly identified, there is a critical process to analyze the data to identify key root causes. After that, a rigorous and creative solution-generating process must take place with a carefully orchestrated trial preceding a large rollout of the solution. Additionally, any gains from these depend entirely on the factories’ abilities to control and sustain those gains in the long run, which requires continuous data monitoring and solution steering.</p>

				  Verifiable credentials are a way to package and share tamper-proof digital information so that you can always authenticate where it originally came from. What makes this technology powerful is that anyone can cryptographically verify the issuer of the credential, and that no changes to the data have occurred since the credential’s creation, enabling the information inside to be trusted and immediately acted on.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>To put it simply, verifiable credentials are packages of data created in a decentralized network by issuing organizations or parties and stored locally by the data owner in a digital wallet.</p>
<p>Once created, the party issuing these packages can be verified by anyone with the appropriate software. As a credential is created, the issuing party digitally signs the information inside, and once it is signed, any attempt to alter the data will be visible on the network and “break” the credential, so to speak.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>What can a verifiable credential represent?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use cases are almost endless, any information tied to identification or an identity can be turned into a verifiable credential: you can represent a person, a car, a building, an organization, or a connected device, and any information that can be associated with these entities.</p>
<p>For example, colleges and universities can issue documents such as diplomas or transcripts to students&nbsp; as verifiable credentials. These can be easily shared with anyone who needs to verify that information. Verification is instant and doesn’t require going back to the university for manual proof, providing a much more efficient experience for everyone.</p>
<p>To learn more about this read our recent article on <a href="https://indicio.tech/why-use-decentralized-identity-and-open-badges-in-education/">Open Badges 3.0</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The end of paper documents and manual processes</p>
<p>In today’s system, credentials are everywhere: you likely have a driver’s license, passport, maybe a badge to access your place of employment.</p>
<p>But paper documents have several drawbacks:</p>
<p>They can be stolen, copied, forged or misplaced.</p>
<p>Someone needs to be in the same physical location to acquire them</p>
<p>They need to be stored securely.</p>
<p>Using them can share more data than needed, or require you to copy down the information they contain manually.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials enable you to hold all the same information, digitally, in a way that you have more control over and can share how you like.</p>
<p>From an organization standpoint they provide a way to quickly share information across different systems without a need for complex direct integrations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>Let’s walk through a quick example.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, the DMV can issue you a driver’s license, which contains personal information such as your date of birth, eye color, height, weight, full name, license number, and address. When attempting to purchase an age-restricted item, the vendor will often check your license to confirm your age and that you can legally purchase the item. When you hand over your ID, you hand over all of the information, not just your date of birth — and that information can easily be misused.</p>
<p>In the same scenario, a verifiable credential is still issued by the DMV, and it still contains all that personal data, but, crucially, the data can be separated and shared in a much more selective way. And we can even go a step further and simply share eligibility: the shop doesn’t need to know your actual birthdate, they just need to know if you’re over a certain age, which can be shared in the form of simple yes or no.</p>
<p>To learn more about making purchases with verifiable credentials read our article on how they will change <a href="https://indicio.tech/verifiable-credentials-digitally-transform-banking-finance-and-payments/">finance and payments.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why does decentralization matter?</p>
<p>This is a huge topic that deserves its own blog but a quick few points are:</p>
<p>As other digital identification methods start to catch on, such as mobile driver’s licenses, it’s important to remember that simply digitizing a document does not make it secure. What is critical is how that document is stored and shared.</p>
<p>By storing verifiable credentials locally on the end user’s mobile device you can be sure they control that data and can share it only with whomever they choose to.</p>
<p>If the mobile driver’s license is not decentralized, it means that the system needs to be contacted to verify a person’s identity. This provides a slower verification process, can run into issues if the database is unreachable, and represents a huge target for bad actors.</p>

 Recently released compliance survey reveals operators’ most common concerns, why players abandon onboarding and the likely effect of UK’s upcoming financial risk checks. 



 



<p>The online gambling market shows no signs of slowing. In fact, by the end of 2024 the revenue generated from the sector is <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/eservices/online-gambling/worldwide">projected to exceed $107 billion</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As new markets like Peru and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-gambling-license-structure/">Brazil</a> open, and established markets like the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-gambling-white-paper/">UK </a>and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/becoming-compliant-ontario-igaming-market/">Canada </a>revise their regulatory frameworks, the challenges faced by betting and gambing operators’ compliance teams are becoming increasingly complicated. &nbsp;</p>



<p>With this in mind, IDnow commissioned SBC Media to investigate the compliance challenges most likely to affect operators in 2024 and beyond.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ‘Challenges in Compliance Survey’ features insights and opinions from 104 global compliance professionals from the gambling industry, and looked at four areas: compliance, fraud, onboarding and financial risk checks.</p>



<blockquote><p>In understanding the compliance challenges that betting and gaming operators face, we believe we can better address our clients’ pain points and empower them to provide the journey that their customers deserve.</p>Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk, Vice President Global Gaming at IDnow. </blockquote>



 Biggest compliance pain points for gambling operators. 



<p>According to the survey, the most common compliance challenge was source of funds checks, which was cited as one of the most difficult issues by more than a fifth of global respondents, rising to nearly 30% of European-based compliance professionals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the other end of the spectrum, respondents found age verification the least difficult to deal with, followed by identity verification, reflecting the availability of robust third-party solutions to handle that crucial part of onboarding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another question posed in the survey was related to speed of implementation, and how long it took operators to fulfil certain compliance requirements, such as obtaining a licence, undergoing an audit and complying with regulatory requirements in a new market. While being first to market is obviously an important factor, and can be a significant competitive advantage, results from the survey suggest that becoming compliant is not something that should be rushed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two-fifths of operators said they typically take 6-12 months to fulfil the compliance requirements ahead of entering a new territory, while around 30% suggested the process took 3-6 months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, what is the most important thing to factor in when entering new markets. At around 60% each, respondents were split between the ability to utilize existing compliance software (identity verification and AML solutions) and speed of implementation as the most important factors.</p>



 Biggest fraud concerns in the gambling industry. 



<p>The second section of the survey was designed to identify the prevalence and trends of different types of fraud and the prevention of fraud attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It revealed that bonus abuse and attempts at document fraud remain most commonplace (65% and 57% respectively), despite improvements to identification and prevention tools.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking to the future, there is also concern about social engineering attacks (54%) and the growing threat of facial recognition spoofing attacks (33%).&nbsp;</p>



<p>[Read about the growing threat of social media fraud, which leverages social engineering, in our blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/social-media-fraud-investment-romance-scam/">‘The rise of social media fraud: How one man almost lost it all.’</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>There was also broad consensus on whether AI-powered anti-fraud tools were the way forward. More than 70% of respondents either already have such tools or plan to implement them in the next 12 months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The results of this survey should act as a wake-up call for gambling operators in the UK and elsewhere to prepare themselves for the emerging fraud and compliance challenges. To address these challenges, operators will need a multi-dimensional approach to identity verification and fraud prevention, that enables seamless gambling experiences anytime, anywhere,” said Roger.</p>

 The importance and dangers of onboarding. 



<p>Onboarding is a pivotal stage in the customer journey and can make or break your business. In a regulated industry, like financial services or gambling, the balance between offering a seamless yet safe and secure onboarding experience has never been more important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The importance of speed and simplicity in the onboarding process was emphasised by the survey responses, with regulatory requirements seen as less of a barrier (31%) to completion than a complex and lengthy registration experience (55%).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Document submission proved to be the biggest challenge for global players (51%), with both ID document submission and personal financial information submission (51%) proving to be an obstacle to the completion of onboarding.</p>



 What do operators really think about financial risk checks? 



<p>No topic has been more polarizing to the UK’s gambling industry than the proposed financial risk checks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As no operator yet has experience of working within the scope of these checks, the survey posed two questions: what they expected the impact of such checks would be on the UK market and what effect they would have on the wider international industry. Most compliance professionals (66%) expressed concerns that the move would lead to lower sign-ups for licensed operators, but would, in turn, strengthen the black market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is worth noting that some of the answers were nuanced and several respondents were open to the idea that an affordability check could have some positives for the industry such as improving trust levels among players, reducing fraud and helping to create a level playing field for smaller operators.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>As part of our <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/11/02/announcing-microsoft-secure-future-initiative-to-advance-security-engineering/">Secure Future Initiative, we announced </a><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/11/06/automatic-conditional-access-policies-in-microsoft-entra-streamline-identity-protection/">Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies</a> in November 2023. These policies are designed to help you secure your organization's resources and data based on your usage patterns, risk factors, and existing policy configuration, all while minimizing your effort. Our top recommendation for improving your identity secure posture is enabling multifactor authentication (MFA), which <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/security-insider/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2023">reduces the risk of compromise by 99.2%</a>. This is why our first three policies are all related to MFA for different scenarios.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since we announced Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies, we’ve rolled out these policies to more than 500,000 tenants in report-only mode. In this mode, the policies don’t impact access but log the results of policy evaluation. This allows administrators to assess the impact before enforcing these policies. Thanks to proactive actions taken by administrators to enable or customize these policies, over 900,000 users are now protected with MFA. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve been actively listening to your feedback. Customers shared that Microsoft-managed policies impact the number of Conditional Access policies that organizations can create. We’ve addressed this by making a significant change: Microsoft-managed policies will no longer count towards the Conditional Access policy limit. Another adjustment relates to existing Conditional Access policies. If you already have a policy in the “On” state that meets or exceeds the requirements set by the Microsoft-managed policy, the latter will not be automatically enforced in your tenant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Initially, we communicated that these policies would be automatically enabled 90 days after creation. However, based on customer feedback, we recognize that some customers need additional time to prepare for these policies to be enforced. As a result, we have extended the time frame before enforcing the policies for this initial set of policies. For these three policies, you will have more than 90 days to review and customize (or disable) your Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies before they are automatically enforced. Rest assured, you’ll receive an email and a <a href="https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?#/MessageCenter">Message Center</a> notification providing a 28-day advance notification before the policies are enforced in your tenant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Call to Action</p>
 
 Review these policies in the <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_ConditionalAccess/ConditionalAccessBlade/~/Policies/fromNav/Identity">Conditional Access policies blade</a>.  
 Add customizations such as excluding <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-policy-common?tabs=secure-foundation#user-exclusions">emergency accounts and service accounts</a>.&nbsp;<br><br>

<p>Earlier in February, SpruceID participated in Utah’s Outdoor Recreation Day on the Hill, a public event held in Salt Lake City at the Utah State Capitol. This yearly event celebrates Utah’s outdoor recreation opportunities and contributions to the state’s economy, health, and quality of life. SpruceID joined the Department of Natural Resources at a booth during the event to highlight our State of Utah pilot program for digital credentials, in partnership with the Division of Technology Services and the Department of Natural Resources.</p><p>The objective of the pilot program is to demonstrate the feasibility of verifiable digital credentials for state-issued credentials across various use cases, such as off-highway vehicle education course certificates. The pilot aims to pioneer a privacy-first digital credentialing program that empowers residents to take control of their online data and seamlessly integrate with the government’s existing infrastructure while ensuring a secure, efficient, and user-friendly experience.</p><p>The booth at the Outdoor Recreation Day on the Hill provided us with a platform to connect with policymakers, legislators, and the general public. We took the opportunity to demonstrate the digital credential experience for both holders and verifiers while educating attendees about the pilot program for digital credentials in Utah.&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s world, technology has transformed nearly every aspect of our lives, from paying bills and traveling to accessing healthcare and public benefits. This shift to digital services has highlighted the need for innovative government leadership in digital identity and credentialing solutions. Traditional paper or plastic credentials have increasingly shown limitations leading to privacy concerns, susceptibility to fraud, and poor user experiences.</p><p>As the pilot becomes publicly available, participants can download a digital credential for their OHV education course certificate to store on their mobile device and take it whenever they are on the trails. Whether in a highly trafficked area or remote location without cell service, the holder can access their permit and present it as a QR code for the verifier to scan in just a few taps. The verification checks the credential validity and that it has a digital signature by the Utah DNR without pinging back to the Utah servers. This means that verifications do not enable additional tracking or a new centralized database. Not only is this a more convenient and secure option for users, but it also saves significant time filling out and processing paperwork.</p> Looking Ahead <p>Our participation in Utah’s Outdoor Recreation Day on the Hill was an opportunity to showcase the pilot program for digital verifiable credentials and a pivotal moment to engage with the Utah community and gather invaluable feedback. </p><p>This event demonstrated the program's potential impact on improving the efficiency, security, and privacy of state-issued credentials. We are grateful for the chance to contribute to Utah’s outdoor recreation community and look forward to the journey ahead as we work towards a more connected, secure, and digitally empowered society.</p> <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

			 The Moreliquid Money Market EUR (MMMEUR) token unlocks easier, faster and cost-efficient access to low-risk yields from Euro Money Markets for professional investors by tokenizing the HSBC Euro Liquidity Fund. Qualified professional investors can subscribe to moreliquid’s money market token in either fiat or crypto currencies. For those investing in digital assets for the first time, moreliquid offers a secure and easily accessible web3 custody solution.&nbsp; 
<p>Luxembourg – March 19th, 2024 – <a href="https://www.moreliquid.io/">moreliquid</a>, a leading digital securities investment platform, today announced its groundbreaking initiative to tokenize the HSBC Euro Liquidity Fund by introducing the Moreliquid Money Market EUR (MMMEUR) token. This move signifies a major advancement in integrating traditional financial instruments with blockchain technology, offering institutional and high-net-worth investors a unique and dynamic way to engage with the Euro money markets.</p>
<p>Regulated under the jurisdiction of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the MMMEUR token offers monthly coupon payments, providing a steady and predictable income stream for institutional and high-net-worth investors. The token’s evergreen maturity date ensures long-term engagement possibilities. Reflecting its underlying asset, the HSBC Euro Liquidity Fund, the MMMEUR token is designed to give qualified investors exposure to a diverse portfolio of short-term securities, carefully curated to meet stringent criteria for maturity, issuer reputation, market listing, and credit ratings as required by law. The specifics about the HSBC Euro Liquidity Fund are available <a href="https://www.assetmanagement.hsbc.co.uk/en/institutional-investor/funds/ie0030028439">here</a>.</p>
<p>Issued on the Polygon network, the MMMEUR token sets its minimum investment at €100,000. It requires investors to be residents of the EEA, targeting primarily institutional and high-net-worth investors interested in the Euro liquidity market. This requirement ensures that the fund attracts committed and qualified investors, contributing to a stable and focused investment environment.</p>

This integration enhances the functionality of the MMMEUR token, providing investors with increased liquidity, versatility, and security in their investments. By leveraging moreliquid’s secure and compliant DeFi platform, investors gain control and flexibility over their digital real-world assets, merging traditional finance with blockchain innovation.</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — March 5th to March&nbsp;18th <p>Welcome to the Veriscope Regulatory Recap! In our latest edition, we delve into sweeping crypto regulatory updates worldwide, from Europe’s fresh stablecoin standards to the UK’s latest crypto compliance proposals, from Indonesia’s tech-forward finance guidelines to Nigeria’s firm stance on crypto operations within its borders. Let’s unpack the latest moves shaping the digital asset&nbsp;world.</p> Global Crypto Regulatory Shifts <p>The global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is undergoing significant transformations, driven by a common goal among nations to align digital asset markets with investor protection, financial stability, and anti-money laundering standards.</p><p>In Europe, the European Banking Authority (EBA) is focusing on new rules for stablecoins, which are digital currencies designed to have a stable value. These rules are part of a larger set of regulations known as&nbsp;MiCA.</p><p>Additionally, the UK treasury has proposed changes that could require stricter observation of crypto businesses to prevent money laundering. This means crypto companies might soon need to follow the same rules as traditional financial companies.</p><p>Over in Asia, Indonesia’s Financial Services Authority (OJK) is setting guidelines for using new technology in finance, including crypto, starting in 2025. This is to ensure that innovations are safe for users and the&nbsp;market.</p><p>In Africa, Nigeria’s Securities Regulator is making it mandatory for crypto businesses to set up in the country if they want to operate there. They’re also raising the fees these companies need to pay. This move aims to give the Nigerian government more control over crypto activities.</p> EU Advances Crypto Regulation with New EBA Stablecoin Draft <p>The European Union is making significant progress in clarifying crypto regulations as the European Banking Authority (EBA) unveils draft requirements for stablecoins under the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework.</p><p>This move, aimed at asset reference tokens (ARTs) capable of referencing a variety of currencies and assets, signifies a crucial step towards comprehensive crypto market regulation.</p><p>The potential impact on the crypto ecosystem is twofold. Positively, clearer regulations could enhance market confidence, attract more institutional investment, and foster a safer trading environment. Conversely, the stringent requirements might impose significant compliance costs, particularly affecting smaller entities, and potentially stifling innovation within the&nbsp;sector.</p><p>As the EU navigates the complex balance between innovation and regulation, the global crypto community watches closely, anticipating the ripple effects of these regulatory advancements.</p> UK Treasury Proposes Regulatory Refinement for Crypto&nbsp;Assets <p>The UK treasury’s latest consultation paper seeks to refine money laundering regulations, which will impact the crypto asset sector’s regulatory framework. The proposed changes, which build on the review of 2017’s Money Laundering Regulations (MLRs), indicate a shift towards integrating crypto assets more comprehensively within the UK’s financial regulatory system.</p><p>One of the pivotal changes includes bringing crypto asset service providers under the broader umbrella of the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) supervision, eliminating the need for separate MLRs authorization. This move is set to extend the FCA’s oversight to new crypto-related activities, aligning MLRs requirements more closely with the Financial Services and Markets Act (FSMA) standards.</p><p>The impact on the crypto ecosystem could be profound. Although, these revisions promise to streamline the regulatory process, potentially making the UK a more attractive hub for crypto businesses by clarifying compliance pathways, there is downside to it as well. After all, the increased FCA oversight could introduce more stringent control and operational challenges for crypto firms, especially smaller ones struggling with the nuances of expanded regulatory requirements.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://issuu.com/shyftnetwork/docs/global_crypto_regulatory_outlook_2024_-_shyft_netw#google_vignette">The Visual Guide on Global Crypto Regulatory Outlook&nbsp;2024</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-estonia">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in&nbsp;Estonia</a></p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>When it comes to cyberattacks, March has come in like a lion for Microsoft. Last week, Microsoft said in an SEC filing that that information stolen in a hack of senior leaders’ email accounts is now being used to “gain or attempt to gain access” to company source code repositories and other internal systems. The fallout remains unknown. Just a few days earlier, threat researchers at Proofpoint <a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/ta577s-unusual-attack-chain-leads-ntlm-data-theft">reported a phishing campaign</a> by the well-known threat group TA577 that targets Windows NT LAN Manager (NTLM) authentication information. Attackers sent thousands of tailored emails designed to steal employees' NTLM “hashes” (or challenge/response values) from hundreds of organizations around the globe. These “hashes” can be cracked with far-reaching consequences, depending on an organization’s security measures.</p>  
 Why Is NTLM Authentication Vulnerable  
<p>A still widely used protocol in Windows environments, NTLM provides a natively implemented and easy to use method for authenticating into applications on enterprise servers. At more than thirty years old, it’s also a perennial attack target.</p> 
<p>Weaker cryptographic algorithms, unsalted password hashes stored on the client and server / domain controller, and a lack of server authentication &nbsp;by default, leave the NTLM protocol susceptible to a variety of attacks, either in the first NTLMv1 or the newer NTLMv2 version. These include interception, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-prevent-man-in-the-middle-attacks">man-in-the-middle</a>, relay and pass-the-hash attacks, as well as straightforward brute force and password cracking — eight-character NTLM password hashes can be brute-forced using <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-a-rainbow-table-attack">rainbow tables</a> and other techniques within three minutes. NTLM does not support modern authentication methods like biometrics, multi-factor authentication, or phishing-resistant FIDO keys.</p> 
 What’s Different About the TA577 NTLM Authentication Campaign?  
<p>The abuse of the NTLM protocol for gathering victim’s information and potentially stealing NTLM challenge/response material is not a new technique, and has been observed in the past in different ways. One notable example was the <a href="https://blog.lumen.com/newly-discovered-watering-hole-attack-targets-ukrainian-canadian-organizations/">compromise of the San Francisco airport website</a> and several other organizations across the world, where threat actors used the compromised sites to serve malicious code that triggered SMB connections to attacker-controlled servers.</p> 
<p>The newest campaign takes a new twist by using phishing thread-jacking techniques to deliver zipped HTML attachments customized for each individual target.</p> 
 How the Attack Works  
<p>The malicious emails appear to be replies to a legitimate message thread. Upon opening, the HTML file triggers a meta refresh attempt to connect to a text file set up by the attacker on a rogue Server Message Block (SMB) server. The attacker-controlled server can then steal the NTLM authentication values when the protocol performs its standard challenge/response exchange. Those values change according to the version of the protocol, and whether it is a NTLMv1 or NTLMv2 exchange, but consist of a nonce (a random value of a single use) that’s encrypted using the user’ passwords as the key.</p> 
<p>A very common technique used to make it easier to then crack the obtained challenge/response values, is to leverage a well known and fixed server challenge. The protocol requires the server to include a challenge, consisting of a 16-byte random number, on every connection. By making the server challenge a fixed one, it’s possible to use pre-calculated hash tables and reduce the time and processing required to crack the user’s passwords.</p> 
<p>The following diagram shows the steps of the attack:</p> 
 NTLM Phishing  
<p></p> 
 Consequences of a Successful NTLM Attack  
<p>Stolen NTLM challenge/response values can be used to obtain victim’s credentials and hijack accounts, access sensitive information and potentially elevate privileges. Attackers can then move laterally within the network and compromise additional systems in the case they’ve already obtained a foothold into the victim’s organization network.</p> 
 How HYPR Protects Against the TA577 NTLM Attacks  
<p>Microsoft has long provided mitigations and mechanisms to disable the use of the NTLM protocol, including migrating to more secure replacements like Kerberos. However, organizations have been slow to implement these recommendations due to the complexity and dependency of multiple products and legacy systems on these protocols.</p> 
<p>When the legacy NTLM authentication protocols cannot be disabled and are still part of the organization’s environment, the resistance to NTLM attacks comes from the strength of the user’s passwords.&nbsp;In these environments, leveraging HYPR’s passwordless approach with certificate-based authentication allows organizations to enforce smart-card usage for passwordless, and remove the dependency of users having to login with their passwords. This provides opportunities to implement mitigation strategies to some of the NTLM weaknesses, such as the use of IT or programmatically-managed strong passwords.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>HYPR reduces the risk to organizations from attacks on NTLM authentication by TA577 and other threat actors. HYPR’s phishing-resistant <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/enterprise-passkeys">Enterprise Passkeys</a> were built to protect Microsoft Entra ID environments from credential-based attacks while making login easier for users. <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/press-releases/hypr-leads-passwordless-revolution-with-launch-of-microsoft-approved-enterprise-passkeys">Microsoft approved and validated</a>, Enterprise Passkeys use highly secure FIDO2 authentication protocols instead of passwords or other types of shared secrets. With HYPR in place, there is no password for an attacker to steal.</p> 
 Conclusion  
<p>As the NTLM authentication protocol relies on passwords, those — indeed all passwords — are a prime target for bad actors. It’s much easier to login with valid credentials than to find a new vulnerability to exploit. Moreover, attackers constantly come up with inventive ways to breach security controls. Organizations need to eliminate the source of insecurity. As a Microsoft partner and member of MISA, HYPR integrates tightly with Microsoft environments and products. Working seamlessly with Microsoft Entra ID, the HYPR Identity Assurance platform combines passkey-based authentication with continuous risk monitoring and automated identity verification to provide the highest level of identity security.</p>

  <p>The introduction of cross-tenant access settings for Microsoft Entra External ID marked a pivotal shift in how organizations manage security and collaboration across different tenants. This blog post dives into the essence of these settings, focusing on their significance for secure B2B collaboration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three key areas of focus, include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 The critical aspect of trusting multifactor authentication (MFA) from business collaborators, including the exploration into the balance between maintaining high security standards and ensuring a seamless user experience for B2B guest users, plus highlighting a perspective to simplify authentication processes and reduce administrative burdens.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Offering a closer look at the cross-tenant access settings and how these settings enable more granular control over cross-tenant collaborations. Real-world use cases illustrate the application of these policies in managing and restricting access to ensure security without hindering productivity and cooperation.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Insights into leveraging Microsoft Entra cross-tenant access policies for improved security and collaboration and to ensure a smooth user experience.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Trust MFA from business collaborators (B2B collaboration) by default&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In today's interconnected digital landscape, organizations are increasingly embracing B2B collaboration to streamline workflows and facilitate cooperation with external partners. As part of this collaborative approach, many businesses routinely create guest user accounts within their Microsoft Entra tenants and grant trusted partners access to their resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To enhance security, many have already extended the requirement for MFA to B2B guest users. This, however, requires external users in cross-tenant access scenarios to register an additional authentication method in the foreign tenant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The need for B2B guest users to register for an additional MFA method in the resource tenant basically increases the account security, but at the same time it adds layers of complexity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 User experience disruption in a B2B collaboration scenario&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>B2B guest users who have already implemented MFA in their home tenant and have become accustomed to the convenience of advanced MFA methods like Windows Hello for Business, encounter disruptions when attempting to access the resource tenant. Even if users have already provided strong authentication in their home tenant, they will still be prompted for authentication again in the resource tenant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: MFA prompt for B2B guest user who access protected resource in foreign tenant</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Administrative overhead for IT and users&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both the guest user and the resource tenant's IT team face additional administrative tasks. For the guest user, navigating a new MFA setup and maintaining an additional MFA registration can be annoying. For the tenant administrator and the support team, managing these additional MFA registrations can increase overhead significantly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In cases where a guest user loses access to their device or does not have a backup for a new device, regaining access to their account involves additional administrative tasks for both the guest user and the resource tenant's IT team. The guest user may need to perform a new MFA setup, while the tenant support team need to manage the additional MFA registrations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you wondering why guest users must register an additional authentication method per resource tenant when they already have one in their home tenant? Well, let's talk about the trust settings in cross-tenant access settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Simplifying the authentication process&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A more efficient approach to managing MFA in cross-tenant B2B collaborations is to trust the MFA from a guest's home tenant. Doing so eliminates the need for additional MFA registration and maintenance in the resource tenant. This means that the user can continue to use his usual strong authentication method that he uses in his home tenant and does not have to register another method in the resource tenant. This is a considerable relief for the user and the support team of the resource tenant no longer has to deal with the MFA registrations of the guests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The MFA default trust settings are configured in the Microsoft Entra admin center (<a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/">https://entra.microsoft.com</a>). In the default configuration, a Microsoft Entra ID tenant does not trust any incoming MFA from other tenants. To change the behavior, the inbound defaults must be edited. The following screenshots provide a walkthrough and show the desired configuration. The "Trust multifactor authentication from Microsoft Entra tenants" setting is disabled by default and must be enabled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: Cross-tenant access settings in Microsoft Entra admin center</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3: Cross-tenant access settings - Default Trust settings</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This simple configuration enables B2B guest users to use their existing MFA in their home tenant to satisfy existing MFA requirements in the resource tenant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once configured, B2B guest users can use additional authentication methods that have a higher authentication strength than MFA methods that are only available in a foreign resource tenant. This is a very important advantage because this configuration also enables the use of phishing-resistant authentication methods for B2B collaboration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 4: Comparison of the authentication methods available in the home tenant and a resource tenant</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information about available authentication methods, refer to the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-authentication-strength-external-users">Microsoft Entra documentation about authentication strengths for external users.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this configuration is designed to enhance the user experience and ease the administrative efforts, it can inadvertently create security risks. For instance, guest users might opt for simpler, less secure authentication methods in their home tenant compared to the authentication methods typically used in the resource tenant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To avoid these risks, the cross-tenant access trust settings work seamlessly with Conditional Access and authentication strengths. Plus, with MFA trust, guest users can use the same phishing-resistant authentication methods used in their home tenant like Windows Hello for Business, FIDO2 keys, and certificate-based authentication to get access to the resource tenant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This key advantage can be used to increase the login security of guest users. When the default trust settings are adjusted, the Conditional Access policies and authentication strengths should be reviewed at the same time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We explored the benefits of using MFA trust to leverage the same strong authentication methods used by guest users in their home tenant to improve security, usability and efficiency. In the next chapter, we will look at how tenant administrators can control outbound collaboration settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Outbound access restrictions&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Microsoft Entra cross-tenant access settings, organizations can manage their collaboration with other Microsoft Entra organizations. These settings provide more granular control over access, allowing you to manage how you collaborate with external organizations. In this section, we will take a closer look at the outbound settings feature and its capabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Tenant restrictions vs. inbound and outbound settings&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tenant restrictions and cross-tenant access settings are two powerful tools that can help you control access to your organization’s resources. While they are often configured together, it’s important to understand that they operate separately from one another.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per this <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/tenant-restrictions-v2#tenant-restrictions-vs-inbound-and-outbound-settings">Microsoft Learn</a> article:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Although tenant restrictions are configured along with your cross-tenant access settings, they operate separately from inbound and outbound access settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cross-tenant access settings give you control when users sign in with an account from your organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By contrast, tenant restrictions give you control when users are using an external account.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think of cross-tenant access settings this way:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Inbound settings control external account access to your internal apps.&nbsp; 
 Outbound settings control internal account access to external apps.&nbsp; 
 Tenant restrictions control external account access to external apps.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To summarize, tenant restrictions allow you to create a policy to control access to external apps when users sign in with an external account from your networks or devices while the inbound and outbound access settings focus on guests accounts in your tenant or guest accounts in resource tenants (what your users is accessing and where).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this all cleared up let’s focus on using an outbound access setting and a real-world application.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Real-world use case&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s have a look at a real-world use case to leverage the outbound settings control. The Contoso organization is used in the following use case:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contoso would like to implement more detailed controls with B2B business collaborators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Contoso would like to only collaborate with specific organizations. This includes the ability to securely add or remove partner organizations as the need arises.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 Additionally, Contoso would need the ability to restrict applications that can be accessed in any partner resource tenant along with the ability to restrict and control user access to partner resource tenants.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Setup and configuration&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To set up the outbound restriction for the needed use case, we will need to configure the outbound defaults. This essentially will block all outbound collaboration. Note that this can be scoped to either include all users, selected users or all or selected external applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>From within the Microsoft Entra Admin center, navigate to the External Identities menu and select the cross-tenant access setting feature. From here select the default settings config followed by edit outbound defaults.&nbsp; Select Block access followed by the applies to option. We can either select a subset of users or apply this to all users. In this example all users are blocked and all external applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 5: Outbound defaults</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 &nbsp; 
<p>Figure 6: Outbound block access</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attempting any access in a resource tenant will result in the below notification. This is expected since the tenant wide outbound access default setting is in place explicitly blocking any resource tenant level access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 7: Resource tenant blocked</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By looking at the user sign-in logs, we can establish the same conclusion via the failure reasoned and the resource tenant accessed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 8: Sign-in logs</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To enable collaboration when the outbound access default setting is applied, a tenant ID or domain name of a resource tenant or origin must be included in the cross-tenant access settings of Microsoft Entra. In the example below, the tenant of Contoso’s partner organization “Wingtip Toys” is added and the outbound access configuration setup to allow collaboration with selected Contoso users. In this case, the users with group membership to “External-TR-ContosoAccess” will be allowed access to selected application as per figure 9.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, a Privileged Access Group (PAG) can be used allowing no permeant standing access. Access must be requested via Privileged Identity Management (PIM). The PIM activation process can be set up to require an approver, MFA or additional authentication context via Conditional Access. E.g. step-up authentication or location-based policy restrictions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 9: Outbound access settings users and groups</p>
 &nbsp; 
 &nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 10: Outbound access settings external applications</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon configuring the needed outbound access settings any user that is part of the selected user or group outbound configuration setting will be allowed access to the selected external applications. In the below example we can see the demo user accessed a selected external application as per previous configuration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 11: sign-in log successful</p>
 &nbsp; 
 &nbsp; 
<p></p>
<p>With cross-tenant access and outbound access settings, customers can granularly restrict and control collaboration with external resource tenants. This enables more control over what your internal accounts can access externally and where.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A word of caution: Before enabling, it’s important to understand this is a tenant wide configuration and you will need to understand and evaluate your organizations collaboration needs and scope the outbound access setting and allowed organizations accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Summary&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this blog post, we explored how to use cross-tenant access and outbound access settings in Microsoft Entra to manage and secure external collaboration. Cross-tenant access allows you to share your resources with users from other tenants, while outbound access settings and tenant restrictions let you control which external tenants your users can access. You can configure both features at the tenant level and specify the allowed or blocked organizations according to your business needs. Additionally, we have discussed how to use Default MFA Trust to use existing, strong authentication methods from foreign tenants in cross-tenant access scenarios and improve your security posture.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the next blog, we will look more closely at tenant restrictions and authentication strengths and contexts. Keep following this blog series, post your feedback, and we hope you join us again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is the transcript to my first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vMmZNwOsIs">YouTube explainer video</a> on how tracking and authentication use the same mechanisms to meet their goals, and how browsers can’t tell the difference. Likes and subscriptions are always welcome!</p>



 Introduction 



<p>Welcome to The Digital Cow Network! My name is Heather Flanagan, principal at Spherical Cow Consulting. Let’s talk about how individuals are tracked as they surf the web.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve all know we are tracked as we surf the web. Sometimes, it’s to show us target advertisements to get us to spend more money. More nefariously, it influences our political leanings or generally sows societal chaos. Why isn’t there more control to prevent this from happening? Shouldn’t there be something that protects all web users, from the least tech-savvy to the most informed individuals? Yes, but it’s not that simple. The underlying mechanisms that trackers use are the same tools used to support third-party logging into a website, also known as federated authentication.</p>



<p>And you know what? Browsers can’t tell the difference when mechanisms used for tracking or when they are used for logging in. They are technically indistinguishable. This makes changing or removing those features more complicated than you’d think.</p>



 The Dilemma of Browser Tracking  



<p>What are these mysterious mechanisms, and why are they used when people log in to a website if they are also part of an invasion of privacy? Time for a quick history lesson!</p>



<p>The Internet came out of a research project. Everyone knew everyone else, or at least they knew the people online had to be a part of a very small community in order to use this new thing. The web came much later, but it still had that research and exploratory mindset, that nearly green field drive that suggested building little widgets that people could turn into anything they could imagine was the path towards innovation. The Internet, and therefore the web, was built on something that didn’t have robust, automatable trust mechanisms built in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of these innovations was the concept of a piece of data that would allow developers to keep information local to a browser so each web page didn’t have to ask for the same information over and over again, something called saving state. It also encouraged the use of IP addresses, once upon a time the unique address for each computer on the network, as a way to indicate whether an individual (the only one probably using that computer) to access something remotely. It encouraged a lot of things and people through of all sorts of ways to use these building blocks of the web to do new things, from supporting third-party accounts when logging in to targeting advertisements to individuals.</p>



<p>That’s enough history. Let’s dive into the mechanics. From third-party cookies to IP addresses and browser fingerprinting, these tools are essential for a smooth online experience but can also be used for tracking. Understanding these mechanisms is key to navigating the digital landscape.</p>



 Segment 3: Third-Party Cookies and Privacy  



<p>HTTP cookies (also called web cookies, Internet cookies, browser cookies, or simply cookies) are small blocks of information created by a website and placed on an individual’s computer or other device by their web browser. The idea behind doing this was to make it so people didn’t have to share information every time they went to a new page. Imagine if you had to log in Every. Single. Time. you went to a new web page owned by the same company. It’s crazy talk! Being able to “maintain state” from one page to the next is great for the user experience (UX).</p>



<p>Here’s where it gets murky. There is more than one kind of cookie, and for the sake of this explainer, we’re going to talk about first-party and third-party cookies. First-party cookies are a way for a single domain to maintain state across all the web pages in its domain. It’s definitely a desirable thing for a clean UX. These cookies are ONLY accessible by the domain that created them. No other domain can read what’s in that cookie.</p>



<p>Then there are third-party cookies. These cookies are accessible to any website at any domain. And sometimes that’s fine. Let’s look at CNN. The company CNN owns cnn.com, headlinenews.com, cnnradionet.com, money.com, and probably several others. The parent company wants visitors to have a consistent experience, which means leaving bits of data for their various domains to read. They want all their services to look and act like you (probably) want them to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Third-party cookies are also used so that when you tell a website you want to log out, it knows what to log you out of. That’s a big security feature right there and something that needs to be adapted when browsers no longer support third-party cookies. Though, to be honest, implementing this properly is really hard and many sites have already given up on the idea of a secure, global logout.</p>



 Segment 4: The Complexities of Browser Fingerprints and IP Addresses  



 IP Addresses 



<p>Most people don’t have to think about a computer’s numeric address. That said, computers communicate via numbers, and both your devices (your phone, tablet, and desktop) and the computers hosting the websites you’re visiting all have these addresses. They are called IP addresses and are a fundamental necessity to ensuring Internet traffic knows where to go.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once upon a time, these addresses were tightly tied to specific computers that didn’t move around. There were also enough of these addresses for all the computers on the Internet. And with that in mind, it made sense to say, “I know who is at this IP address. That address can access my computer.” While the basic assumptions about IP addresses are no longer always accurate, there’s still something to them. Some websites still create access policies based on what IP addresses are allowed. It’s a very smooth UX; the individual doesn’t have to do a thing. It just works.</p>



<p>When you go to a website, one of the things that happens is that the visit is recorded in a log. Logs are necessary to troubleshoot problems. They are also a way to understand who and what is visiting a website. And if that data is shared behind the scenes, a single IP address can be followed like you can follow footprints in the snow.</p>



 Browser Fingerprints 



<p>When you install a web browser, you probably add plug-ins, add-ons, your favorite fonts, your preferred settings, and so on. Here’s a fun fact: if you have done those things, you might have an impressively unique “fingerprint” that distinguishes your browser from all others.</p>



<p>There are a few websites that will let you check this out. For example, <a href="https://amiunique.org/">https://amiunique.org/</a> and <a href="https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/">https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/</a> will let you see just how unique your browser setup is when compared to others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you visit a website, it often asks your browser about all its settings to offer you the best UX. It might have a slightly different way of presenting information if you’re using Chrome or Firefox. It might pop up a sadness window if you’ve blocked ads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Browser fingerprinting isn’t usually used to let you log into a website. However, some enterprise software may be looking for a specific plug-in or configuration as part of its requirements to allow you access.</p>



 Link Decoration and Bounces  



 Link Decoration 



<p>But wait, there’s more! One of the more subtle and ubiquitous features of trackers and authentication services is link decoration. Also referred to as “navigation-based tracking,” this feature adds extra information to the URL. That information can be part of an authentication token. It can be part of a query so the website knows what to display after you’ve done a product search. When you click on the link in an email, it will add the method you used to the address so the website owners know what advertising works for them.</p>



<p>Browser vendors are cautious when changing what they’ll support in links. Of course, they also have to worry about being able to identify when links are being used for tracking or something else. So many features that the web experience is built on requires link decoration. And so many trackers love it. It’s complicated.</p>



 Bounces or Redirects 



<p>The last one we’ll review in this post is bounces, also known as redirects. Bounces and redirects are as fundamental to the web experience as link decoration. These are used extensively to support critical login features for protocols like OAuth and SAML, used by websites everywhere. Authentication is complicated, and there is almost always more than one computer behind the scenes making it happen. These computers, possibly from different domains, need to talk to each other to get you logged in. They bounce data back and forth before returning a “go” or “no go” to your login experience.</p>



<p>Bounces are also, unfortunately, used by trackers to get around the third-party limitations on cookies described in the section above.</p>



<p>Remember that browsers are trying to prevent websites from reading cookies they didn’t write. Cookies are for the first party; third parties need to find another website to bother. But what if there is an advertising agreement between these two parties? They really want to share that data! The easiest thing to do is to make that third party become a first party.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When an individual visits a website directly, that makes it a first-party experience. You visit Website A; Website A is now a first party. But what if Website A has an agreement with an advertiser at Website B and adds a single pixel to their web page? Then the individual loads that pixel, thus “visiting” Website B. Website B can now set or edit a first-party cookie. They can do that every time you visit a website they have an agreement with, thus building up a record of what sites you’ve visited, where you’ve made purchases, etc.</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>Browser vendors can’t just wave a magic keyboard and fix all tracking challenges. Turning off all the mechanisms that allow tracking will also break some of the most critical security features of the web. Work within the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is underway to find a way through this mess. Browser vendors have also been making their changes. Apple turned off third-party cookies years ago. Mozilla turned them off by default for all Firefox users in 2023. Google Chrome is still working on it, but they are much bigger than all other browser vendors combined and have much more business riding on these features.</p>



<p>In our next post, I’ll focus on the work around the deprecation of third-party cookies.&nbsp;</p>

KERI utilizes hash-chain verifiable data structures, called Key Event Logs (KELs), without a total-ordered globally distributed consensus mechanism.</blockquote><p>This blog is the second part of a three-part series, the Hitchhiker’s Guide to&nbsp;KERI:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/finema/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-keri-part-1-51371f655bba">Part 1: Why should you adopt&nbsp;KERI?</a>  Part 2: What exactly is&nbsp;KERI?  Part 3: How do you use KERI? (Coming&nbsp;soon)  <p>This part explains only essential components that constitute the KERI protocol while not going into deep technical details.</p> An Identity Overlay for the&nbsp;Internet  Fragmentation in the decentralized identity ecosystem <p>As outlined in a recent “<a href="https://blog.productintuition.com/p/wallet-strategy-pt-1-decentralized-identity-ssi">Wallet Strategy</a>” series by <a href="https://blog.productintuition.com/p/wallet-strategy-pt-1-decentralized-identity-ssi">Dan Robertson</a>, one of the biggest problems in the decentralized identity space is its presently fragmented ecosystems. This is an extremely complex issue that involves many business and technical aspects—including credential formats, credential exchange protocols, and many more. This blog limits the scope of the discussion to identifiers and key management, also known as the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID&nbsp;methods</a>.</p><p>As of March 2024, there are a total of 189 DID methods registered in the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-spec-registries/#did-methods">W3C DID Specification Registries</a>. This number has been increasing steadily since the registry was created in 2020, and there are likely a hundred more DID methods out there in the wild, which have not yet been registered.</p><p>Although a large proportion of these methods are experimental, some of which have no longer been maintained, this number has raised significant concern among many members of the digital identity ecosystems. In the past few years, this topic has also been the subject of heated debates. While some argue that the abundance of DID methods is a sign of a thriving ecosystem, many contend that the sheer diversity has spawned considerable interoperability challenges.</p><p>While this blog shall not take part in the debate, one cannot help but wonder “Could there possibly be a unifying DID method that covers the use cases of all others?” This is precisely what KERI attempts to&nbsp;be.</p> An elephant in the&nbsp;room <p>However, we have to address a big elephant in the room before we continue.</p>Ref: Xkcd comic, “<a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">How Standard Proliferate</a>”.<p>KERI is indeed a DID method that was designed to be the “one universal standard that covers everyone’s use case”. However, adding one more DID method to the ever-growing list does not necessarily mitigate the situation, and it remains uncertain if KERI will ever achieve widespread adoption.</p><p>Putting all that aside, KERI provides unique properties and benefits not found in other DID methods, as elaborated in <a href="https://medium.com/finema/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-keri-part-1-51371f655bba">Part 1</a> of this series. What makes KERI special is also the fact that it is not just another DID method. The KERI protocol has a grander vision of being the identity overlay for the internet.</p><blockquote>KERI is a decentralized identity protocol designed to be a secure identity overlay for the internet.</blockquote> An Identity Overlay for the&nbsp;Internet <p>The internet is arguably one of the most important inventions in human history, enabling instant connections between everyone across the globe. The success of the Internet is attributed to its hourglass model where the Internet Protocol (IP) is the one common protocol for all supporting protocols below it and all applying protocols above it, i.e., the IP protocol being the spanning layer of the Internet.</p>Ref: <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-11-17.pdf">Design Principles for the Trust over IP Stack</a>, Version 1.0, 17 November&nbsp;2021<p>Unfortunately, as the late Kim Cameron once wrote in <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=352">The Laws of Identity</a> in 2005, “The Internet was built without an identity layer.” Given the immense complexity and widespread usage of the Internet, attempting to reconstruct its infrastructure to integrate such a layer is simply unfeasible. Hence, the development of an identity solution must be overlaid on the existing Internet framework. To achieve global interoperability, such an identity overlay must also embody an hourglass shape, serving as a trust-spanning protocol that seamlessly links all Web2 and Web3 applications.</p>Ref: The <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">KERI Whitepaper</a><p>The <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Spanning+Protocol+Task+Force">Trust Spanning Protocol Task Force (TSPTF)</a> under the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP (ToIP)</a> Foundation is currently developing the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2023/08/31/mid-year-progress-report-on-the-toip-trust-spanning-protocol/">trust spanning protocol</a> where KERI is used as one of its candidate protocols for Verifiable Identifiers (VIDs).</p> Foundational Components of&nbsp;KERI <p>The previous section explains what KERI is at the conceptual level where it is designed to be the identity overlay for the internet and is also a variant of DPKI. To get deeper into the technical details,</p><blockquote>KERI is a decentralized management protocol for persistent self-certifying identifiers, called Autonomic Identifiers (AIDs), using novel key pre-rotation mechanisms. KERI utilizes hash-chain verifiable data structures, called Key Event Logs (KELs), without a total-ordered globally distributed consensus mechanism.</blockquote><p>There are four foundational components for the KERI protocol as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Autonomic Identifier (AID)  Pre-rotation  Key Event  Key Event&nbsp;Receipt   1. Autonomic Identifier (AID) <p>The KERI protocol is dedicated to the long-term management of a special class of identifiers that are both self-certifying and persistent. These identifiers are called autonomic identifiers (AIDs) in the KERI protocol.</p><blockquote>Note: The word “autonomic” is an adjective that means self-ruling, self-governing, or self-regulating.</blockquote> Self-Certifying Identifier (SCID) <p>A Self-Certifying Identifier (SCID) is an identifier that is uniquely and cryptographically derived from one or more key pairs. It is self-certifying—i.e., self-authenticating—since the controller of the SCID who holds the private could cryptographically verify their control by digitally signing a message, e.g., via a challenge-response protocol. The mapping between an identifier and its controlling key(s) is self-contained in the identifier itself. Hence, a SCID is considered a decentralized identifier as it does not rely on any trusted third party to generate or&nbsp;manage.</p><blockquote>Note: An entity that holds an authoritative set of private keys is called a controller of an&nbsp;AID.</blockquote> Basic SCID <p>A basic SCID is a variant of SCIDs that is cryptographically generated and bound to a single key pair. A basic SCID is ephemeral/non-transferable since it does not support the rotation of its key pair and therefore must be abandoned once the controlling private key becomes weakened or compromised from exposure. Hence, a basic is not persistent and is not suitable for long-term use.</p><p>The figure below demonstrates a process for creating a SCID, the controller captures sufficient entropy—e.g., using random noise from electronic equipment— to generate a key pair. A common basic SCID could be generated by using a hash digest of the public&nbsp;key.</p> AIDs are Persistent SCIDs <p>An AID is a variant of a SCID is that persistent as it may persist despite the evolution of its key state. In other words, the controller of an AID is capable of rotating their key pair while retaining the same AID. The mechanism for evolving the AID’s key state is called pre-rotation.</p>Difference between a basic SCID and an&nbsp;AID An AID is a primary root of trust in&nbsp;KERI <p>A root of trust is defined as a component or process of the system upon which other components rely. An AID is also a primary root of trust in the KERI protocol, which is purely cryptographic and decentralized, not relying on any centralized entity or even any blockchain network.</p><blockquote>An AID is used as a primary root of trust in the KERI protocol that is purely cryptographic. As a consequence, the security of KERI-based identity systems only relies on cryptography, requiring no trust in external entities or even any blockchain network.</blockquote> 2. Pre-rotation <p>In the KERI protocol, the mechanism used to evolve a key state of an AID is known as pre-rotation. Except for a few special cases, an AID is cryptographically bound to at least two sets of key pairs, each of which holds different control authorities over the&nbsp;AID:</p>  The first set is called the current key(s), which holds the signing authority. The current key(s) of an AID can be used to, for instance, sign arbitrary messages such as verifiable credentials, authenticate the AID’s controller, and anchor external data to KERI’s ledgers, called key event&nbsp;logs.  The second set is called the next key(s), which holds the rotation authority. The next key(s) of an AID can be used to change the key state of the AID, including changing the current keys, that is, transferring the signing authority to another set of&nbsp;key(s).  <blockquote>Here, the “s” refers to the case where a multi-signature scheme is employed, where multiple key pairs are required to establish signing and rotation authorities.</blockquote> Pre-commitment <p>When an AID is created (i.e., incepted), the controller of the AID makes a pre-commitment to the next key(s) that hold rotation authority over the AID. The next key(s) are hidden using a cryptographic hash function, and they are only revealed at the moment the key state of the AID is&nbsp;rotated.</p><p>The next key pair — both private and public keys — must be kept secure and hidden until a key rotation is required. The rotation event revokes the current key pairs that hold signing authority as well as replacing the next key pairs that hold rotation authority.</p><p>This process is called pre-rotation since the next key pair is pre-committed for rotation while the actual rotation event may occur at a later&nbsp;time.</p><blockquote>Formally, pre-rotation is a cryptographic pre-commitment of an AID to the next key pair(s) for key rotation.</blockquote> Recovery from Quantum&nbsp;Attack <p>As pre-rotated next key(s) are hidden by a cryptographic hash function, the next key(s) are thus resistant to quantum attack. This is because hash functions are not vulnerable to the Quantum <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm">Shor’s Algorithm</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, the current key of an AID could still be broken by a quantum attack, allowing a threat actor with access to a quantum computer to gain the signing authority over the AID. However, the legitimate controller of the AID could still regain control over the AID by using the next key(s) to rotate the AID’s key state, perhaps using a quantum-safe algorithm for the new set of current&nbsp;keys.</p><p>Hence, the use of pre-rotation in the KERI protocol makes it quantum-recoverable.</p> 3. Key&nbsp;Event <p>The key state of an AID is determined by a data structure called a key event that consists of the current key(s) and pre-rotated next key(s) as well as other configurations for the&nbsp;AID.</p><blockquote>Note: The key state of an AID is defined as a set of currently authoritative key pairs for the AID and any other information necessary to secure or establish control authority over an&nbsp;AID.</blockquote> Key Inception Event <p>The AID is itself cryptographically derived from its very first key event, called an inception event, thus giving the AID its self-certifying property. The inception event must also be cryptographically signed by the current&nbsp;keys.</p><p>The example below demonstrates a scenario where an AID has single key pairs for its current and next keys. An AID is derived and bound to the key inception event, which includes:</p>  the first public key, which is used as the current&nbsp;key,  the digest of the second public key, which is used as the pre-rotated next&nbsp;key.  <p>The first public key could be revealed to other entities while the pre-rotated second public key must be kept&nbsp;hidden.</p>An AID is derived from an inception event that consists of two sets of keys, namely the current key and (pre-rotated) next key. The current key is used to sign the key inception event. The AID is pre-committed to future rotation by the second&nbsp;key. Key Rotation&nbsp;Event <p>The pre-rotated next key(s) of an AID may be used to create a subsequent key event, called a rotation event, that changes the AID’s key state. The rotation event must be signed by the next key(s), revealing the next key(s). Hence, the next key(s) can be used for rotation only once, after which the next keys must be either discarded or repurposed as members of the new set of subsequent current key(s). The controller of the AID must also assign a new set of pre-rotated next key(s) in the rotation&nbsp;event.</p><p>Following the example above, the AID could be rotated to revoke the signing authority of the first key pair by using the private key of the pre-rotated second public key to sign a rotation event. In the rotation&nbsp;event,</p>  the second public key is now repurposed to be the new current&nbsp;key,  a new key pair, the third public key, is pre-committing to the future rotation of the&nbsp;AID.  The key state of the AID is evolved by revealing the second (pre-rotated) key and using it to sign a key rotation event. The rotation event includes a new next key that pre-commits the AID to future rotation. Key Event Log&nbsp;(KEL) <p>As the key state of an AID evolves, the key events are cryptographically linked in a hash chain that provides a key history for the AID. Such a data structure is called a Key Event Log&nbsp;(KEL).</p><p>Formally, a KEL is a hash-chain verifiable data structure used to verify the key state of an AID as it evolves through its lifecycle. A KEL could be compared to a transaction ledger in a traditional blockchain, where key events are transactions in the KERI protocol.</p><p>Following the example above, the KEL of the example AID starts with the inception event with the first public key and the hash digest of the second key. The inception event is chained to subsequent rotation events via the pre-rotation mechanism.</p>A key event log of the AID that contains a hash chain of its key&nbsp;events.<p>Hence, the control authorities — both signing and rotation — of the AID at any point in the KEL can be validated in a self-contained manner by verifying the signatures and recalculating the hashes that connect the key events in the KEL, all the way back to the inception event.</p><blockquote>Note: A KEL is technically a type of “blockchain” in the traditional sense of an ordered list of records that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes.</blockquote> 4. Key Event&nbsp;Receipt <p>At its core, the KERI protocol establishes an infrastructure facilitating the exchange of key events as well as key event receipts. This highlights the protocol’s designation as the “Key Event Receipt Infrastructure.”</p><p>The exchange of key events and key event receipts could carried either directly between controllers of AIDs or indirectly through supporting infrastructures.</p> Key Event&nbsp;Receipt <p>In the KERI protocol, communications and transactions revolve around the exchange of key events among controllers of AIDs. When a controller receives a key event, they can sign it using the key associated with their AID. This signed key event is called a key event receipt, which provides a non-repudiable proof that the recipient has received—i.e., witnessed—the key&nbsp;event.</p> Key Event Receipt Log&nbsp;(KERL) <p>Key event receipts of an AID could be recorded in a verifiable data structure called a key event receipt log (KERL). A KERL contains the signed key event history of an AID. A verifier of an AID may verify the AID’s key state by using a&nbsp;KERL.</p> Direct mode <p>Key events and key event receipts can be exchanged directly between two controllers. This is known as the direct mode in the KERI protocol.</p><p>In the direct mode, a controller of an AID may send its KEL to another controller, called a validator of the AID. Upon reception of a key event, the validator signs the received key events to generate a key event receipt and subsequently returns it to the controller as an acknowledgment. The controller now has a signed receipt that attests that the validator received and verified the key event message. This provides a trust basis for transactions between the controller and the validator. The validator may not later repudiate its signed receipts nor refer to a different key event history in interactions with the controller without detection by the controller.</p><p>Each party would thereby in turn be the controller for their AID and the validator for the other’s AID. Each could maintain a KEL of their own AID as well as a KERL of the other’s AID. This allows each party to be trusted with respect to this pairwise interaction.</p> Indirect mode <p>Since a controller of an AID may not always be online. The controller may designate witnesses that store and forward key events to any requestor. This is known as the indirect mode in the KERI protocol.</p><p>The purpose of the indirect mode is to provide a highly available trustworthy service for discovering the KEL of an AID. The witnesses also sign the key events to create witnessed key event receipts.</p><p>An example of the indirect replay mode with a set of witnesses that are designated by the controller is shown&nbsp;below.</p> Additional Infrastructures <p>Since the witnesses are designated by the controller of the AID, they may not be entirely trusted by validators of the AID. For example, the AID and its witnesses could be compromised or behave maliciously such that the witnesses provide inconsistent key event histories, called duplicity.</p><p>Consequently, a validator of the AID could designate additional infrastructure to detect duplicity of the AID’s key event history. These additional infrastructures include watchers, jurors, and judges. The infrastructures may be designated a validator or a group of validators to “watch” the witnesses to detect any duplicity in the AID’s key event history as well as make decisions on the validity of the AID’s&nbsp;KEL.</p> Blockchain as KERI witnesses and&nbsp;watchers <p>As discussed in <a href="https://medium.com/finema/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-keri-part-1-51371f655bba">Part 1</a>, while the KERI protocol does not necessarily rely on a blockchain, KERI may leverage blockchain for the discovery and verification of KELs. In other words, blockchains could be utilized in a KERI-based identity system practically taking the roles of KERI witnesses and watchers. Hence, you could have the best of both worlds, obtaining the advantages that traditional blockchains offer. Since the root of trust in the KERI protocol is within the AIDs themselves, the AIDs could be migrated from one blockchain network to another, avoiding the ledger-locked problem that plagues most blockchain-based DID&nbsp;methods.</p> KERI in a&nbsp;Nutshell <p>Conceptually, the Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) protocol is a decentralized identity protocol designed to be an identity overlay for the Internet. Each word in KERI has the following meanings:</p>  Key refers to asymmetric key cryptography that is used to control persistent self-certifying identifiers, called Autonomic Identifiers (AIDs).  Event refers to a series of Key Events in a hash-chain verifiable data structure called Key Event Logs (KELs) that record the key-state evolution of AIDs via the Pre-Rotation mechanism.  Receipt refers to signed receipts of key events, called Key Event Receipts that provide non-repudiable proof while exchanging key events between&nbsp;AIDs.  Infrastructure refers to the protocol for exchanging non-repudiable key event receipts, including the designation of Witnesses, Watchers, Jurors, and&nbsp;Judges.  <p>The next part of the series discusses “How do you use KERI?” which includes references to other introductory materials and a collection of open-source implementations, standards, and whitepapers.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-keri-part-2-what-exactly-is-keri-e46a649ac54c">The Hitchhiker’s Guide to KERI.

<p>With the acceleration of digital transformation and hybrid work, the number of devices and machines accessing critical data and resources has increased exponentially. The growing number of devices accessing sensitive data gives rise to an expanded attack surface that leaves organizations vulnerable to cyberattacks that can cause financial and reputational damage.</p>
<p>The traditional network perimeter is no more. Identities – whether human or machine – have become the new line of defense when it comes to protecting against cyberattacks. To effectively manage your devices, you need complete visibility over all devices and machines in your organization. While digital certificates are an effective way to create and manage machine identities and device authentication to secure data and communication between a device and an organization’s critical resources (whether in the cloud or on-premises), managing the lifecycle of these digital certificates across disparate environments and a multitude of different devices is proving to be a challenge for many enterprise IT teams.</p>
<p>Managing Digital Certificates Across Devices and Operating Systems</p>
<p>Having a complete certificate lifecycle management (CLM) solution that enables automation is key to having control and ensuring compliance across your digital certificate estate. In addition, an effective PKI solution should support multiple protocols to support certificate enrollment across a number of devices (mobile, laptops, IoT, etc.) and operating systems to provide end-to-end CLM across a global enterprise.</p>
<p>Much like the remote/hybrid work option allows people to be flexible, a PKI solution must integrate with mobile device management (MDM) solutions to allow organizations to do the same, in turn supporting advanced identification, authentication, and authorization schemes, enabling organizations to deploy and manage MDM solutions effectively with strong machine identities. Microsoft Windows devices that account for a large number of workforce devices use the WS-Trust X.509v3 Token Enrollment Extensions Protocol (WSTEP), which allows for secure certificate enrollment and revocation capabilities.</p>
<p>Automation is a key requirement for CLM to ensure seamless certificate enrollment and revocation processes. Having a cloud-based PKI as a service that integrates with MDM solutions eliminates the costly overhead with on-premises infrastructure and ensures your organization is being actively managed and secured.</p>
<p>As digital transformation continues to accelerate, it’s up to you and your organization to continue to grow and evolve with the trends and reduce complexity for enterprise IT departments worldwide. Learn how <a href="https://www.entrust.com/products/pki/managed-services/pki-as-a-service">Entrust PKI as a Service (PKIaaS)</a> enables seamless <a href="https://www.entrust.com/use-case/mobile-device-management-byod">integration with leading MDM vendors</a> like Microsoft Intune, VMware Workspace ONE, Google Enterprise MDM via Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP), Ivanti, and Jamf Pro, so customers can deploy and provision digital certificates with ease.</p>

  <p>Today <a href="https://aka.ms/CopilotforSecurityGA">we announced</a> that Microsoft Copilot for Security will be generally available worldwide on April 1. The following new Microsoft Entra skills will be available in the standalone Copilot for Security experience: User Details, Group Details, Sign-in Logs, Audit Logs, and Diagnostic Logs. User Risk Investigation, a skill embedded in Microsoft Entra, will also be available in public preview.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>These skills help identity admins protect against identity compromise through providing identity context and insights for security incidents and helping to resolve identity-related risks and sign-in issues. We’re excited to bring new identity capabilities to Copilot for Security and help identity and security operators <a href="http://aka.ms/copilotforsecurity">protect at machine speed.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Identity skills in Copilot for Security&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's take a closer look at what each of these new Entra Skills in Copilot for Security do to help identity professionals secure access, while easily integrating into any admin's daily workflow via natural language prompts:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>User details can quickly surface context on any user managed in Entra, such as username, location, job title, contact information, authentication methods, the account creation date, and account status. Admins can prompt Copilot with phrases like "tell me more about this user”, “list the active users created in the last 5 days”, “what authentication methods does this user have”, and “is this user’s account enabled” to pull up this kind of information in a matter of seconds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Group details can summarize details on any group managed in Entra.&nbsp; Admins can ask Copilot questions like “who is the owner of group X?”, “tell me about the group that starts with XYZ”, and “how many members are in this group?” for immediate context.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sign-in logs can highlight information about sign-in logs and conditional access policies applied to your tenant to assist with identity investigations and troubleshooting. Admins must simply instruct their Copilot to “show me recent sign-ins for this user”, “show me the sign-ins from this IP address”, or “show me the failed sign-ins for this user.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Audit logs can help isolate anomalies associated with audit logs, including changes to roles and access privileges. Admins just have to ask Copilot to “show me audit logs for actions initiated by this user” or “show me the audit logs for this kind of event”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An identity admin, who has identified a risky user under the username ‘rashok’, asks Copilot for the March 5th audit logs for ‘rashok’ to discover what actions that user took while at a heightened risk of compromise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diagnostic logs can help assess the health and completeness of your tenant's policy configurations. This helps ensure sign-in and audit logs are correctly set up, and that there are no gaps in the log collection process. Admins can ask “what logs are being collected in my tenant” or “are audit logs enabled” to quickly remediate any gaps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Using Copilot in Entra for risk investigation&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get a better picture of how Copilot for Security can increase the speed at which you respond to identity risks, let’s imagine a scenario in which a user is flagged for having a high-risk level due to several abnormal sign-in attempts. With the User Risk Investigation skill in Microsoft Entra, available in public preview with Copilot for Security, admins can get an analysis of the user risk level coupled with recommendations on how to mitigate an incident and resolve the situation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An identity admin notices that a user has been flagged as high risk due to a series of abnormal sign-ins. With Copilot for Security, the admin can quickly investigate and resolve the risk by clicking on the user in question to receive an immediate summary of risk and instructions for remediation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Copilot summarizes in natural language why the user risk level was elevated. Then, Copilot provides an actionable list of steps to help nullify the risk and close the alert. Finally, Copilot provides a series of recommendations an identity admin can take to automate the response to identity threats, minimizing exposure to a compromised identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How to use Copilot for Security&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are introducing a provisioned pay-as-you-go licensing model&nbsp;that makes Copilot for Security accessible to a wider range of organizations than any other solution on the market. With this flexible, consumption-based pricing model, you can get started quickly, then scale your usage and costs according to your needs and budget. Copilot for Security will be available for purchase April 1, 2024. Connect with your account representative now so your organization can be among the first to realize the incredible benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Copilot for Security helps security and IT teams transition into the age of AI and strengthen their skillsets. This is a huge milestone towards empowering organizations with generative AI tools, and we are so proud to work alongside our customers and partners to bring you a better way to secure identities and access for everyone, to everything.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Paul Fisher</a></p><p>Among these emerging technologies, identity wallets have sparked considerable debate and optimism—not to mention quite&nbsp; a number of working groups. While they promise a future of seamless and secure digital identity management, their proliferation may be premature, serving more as a distraction than a solution, until we achieve truly ironclad identity authentication.</p>
 The Allure of Identity Wallets 
<p>Identity wallets propose an enticing vision: a user-centric model where individuals have full control over their identity credentials, sharing them effortlessly and securely across services and organizations. This concept aligns with the broader trend towards empowering users and enhancing privacy. By consolidating identity verification in a single, secure location, identity wallets seem to offer a panacea for the fragmented, insecure, and cumbersome processes plaguing current online interactions.</p>
 The Core Issue: Authentication Integrity 
<p>However, the rush towards adopting identity wallets overlooks a fundamental flaw in our current cybersecurity infrastructure—the integrity of identity authentication itself and the endless number of protocols. The foundation of any IAM system is its ability to accurately and securely authenticate the identity of users. No matter how sophisticated or user-friendly an identity wallet may be, its effectiveness is inherently limited by the reliability of the initial authentication process.</p>
<p>Outside these working groups, &nbsp;reality we face is stark. Phishing attacks, identity theft, and account takeovers are rampant, exploiting weaknesses in password-based systems, biometrics, and even two-factor authentication methods. The security community has long acknowledged these vulnerabilities, yet a truly ironclad solution remains elusive.</p>
 Distraction from the Real Challenge 
<p>The fervor surrounding identity wallets risks diverting attention and resources from addressing the root problem—developing authentication mechanisms that are both impervious to existing threats and adaptable to future challenges. While identity wallets can streamline identity management once a user is authenticated, they do little to enhance the security of the authentication process itself.</p>
<p>This is not to dismiss the potential benefits of identity wallets outright. They represent a significant step forward in managing digital identities. The path forward requires a collective reevaluation of our priorities. The cybersecurity and identity communities must channel iefforts into research and development of authentication technologies that can withstand the sophisticated threats of today and tomorrow. Innovations such as cryptographic proofs, advanced biometrics, and behavioral analytics hold promise, but require significant investment to realize their potential.</p>
<p>Moreover, fostering an ecosystem that supports interoperability and open standards will be crucial. This approach will not only enhance the security and usability of authentication methods but also ensure that emerging solutions like identity wallets can integrate seamlessly into the broader IAM framework.</p>
<p>What do you think? Digital wallets and all aspects of IAM will be high on the agenda at KuppingerCole’s European Identity &amp; Cloud EIC2024 conference. There will be opportunities to learn about Safeguarding Digital Identities in Today's World, to get insights into How AI Can Help IAM Deliver Better and Stronger Authorization, to get answers the question: Can you trust AI in IAM? And much more!</p>

  <p>Join identity experts from KuppingerCole Analysts and Ping Identity as they unpack the role of decentralized identity in reusable identity verification and credentialing. This session will look at two specific business cases where decentralized identity is reducing fraud while improving user experiences and providing monetization opportunities for issuers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anne Bailey, Senior Analyst at KuppingerCole Analysts, will explain the trajectory of decentralized identity, how it supports reusability, and how that unlocks efficiencies for organizations in both customer journeys and verifying its workforce.</p>
<p>Darrell Geusz, Product Lead for PingOneNeo at Ping Identity, will share use cases of real-world customers who leverage identity verification and digital credentialing. He will dive into how they achieve safer, more secure, more affordable, and privacy-enhancing processes for customers and the workforce, through utilizing a trusted first party experience for every transaction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Join this webinar to learn about:</p>
 
 The transformational impact of decentralized identity for workforce and consumer verification.&nbsp; 
 Establishing identity and trust quickly with employees, contractors, and supply chain.&nbsp; 
 Understanding the value of a Trusted First Party user experience.&nbsp; 
 Issuing a strong, portable identity and empowering customers to re-use it.&nbsp; 
 Decentralized identity in action with two use cases that demonstrate increased security, privacy, and smoother user experience.&nbsp;

 … Everyone, Everything, Everywhere. image:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Recognition_and_Enforcement_of_Foreign_Arbitral_Awards"> Wikipedia</a><p>In the<a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/permanent-summer-the-new-matr-token-and-why-the-rwa-bull-market-goes-on-forever-0d4fb0f7c3e9"> launch paper</a> for the Mattereum Group’s <a href="https://mattereum.de/get-tokens?utm_source=Medium&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=MATR-launch-2024-02-29">MATR token</a>, which recently went on sale* I talked about how Mattereum’s groundbreaking innovations create an enforceable legal connection between the token representing an asset and the tokenized asset itself, and how this has the power to completely transform business for the future, making Mattereum bigger than Visa. We do this with a combination of legaltech solutions that connect the <a href="https://www.newyorkconvention.org/">1958 New York Convention (NYC) on Arbitration</a> and the UK Judiciary Taskforce (UKJT) <a href="https://share-eu1.hsforms.com/1ZYEqf0C5RyKJ-hw8HuIDLwg7g8s?__hstc=210657930.bd681f8e55dc4f22c4da469838e87c56.1708433139509.1708433139509.1708433139509.1&amp;__hssc=210657930.1.1708433139509&amp;__hsfp=3782222774">Digital Dispute Resolution Rules</a> using the blockchain, which is going to enable a once in a century transformation, like when music went&nbsp;digital.</p><p>Now, I want to unpick exactly what this means for the future of&nbsp;trade.</p><p>I see the global scope of the blockchain as fundamental to all this, which is not quite the same thing as globalisation, but close. Anybody can run Free Software, anybody can generate keys, so the blockchain is universal in that sense. The best fit for that global scope in legal / trade systems is the New York Convention on Arbitration. That’s 170 countries. So wiring up blockchain transactions to the NY Convention is close to global scope (it skips North Korea - but then everything does - and a few other places). This is supercharged by the UK Jurisdiction Taskforce Digital Dispute Resolution Rules which make a ton of blockchain-specific provisions which can be invoked from any of the New York Convention counties. <a href="https://arbitrationblog.kluwerarbitration.com/2022/04/27/arbitration-tech-toolbox-arbitrating-digital-asset-disputes/">This gives some analysis of the&nbsp;rules</a></p><p>Some of the “Mattereum magic” has been in figuring out how to use the NYC / UKJT system to carry things like legal definitions of assets on chain in a way that can be seen in those 170 counties. The <a href="https://mattereum.com/how-it-works/">Mattereum Asset Passport (MAP)</a> does some very sophisticated things by using suites of contracts to define asset value and risks. This makes the blockchain vital - if you try to make something like the NFT/MAP system work, only on paper, the complexity goes through the roof because you don’t have atomic swaps and various other blockchain capabilities on hand. It’s a neat system: the solution to trade on the blockchain requires the blockchain to&nbsp;work!</p><p>I am personally pretty pro globalisation because trade is always a good alternative to war, and rival trade blocs often wind up at war, but I do think 1990s American-led globalism is dead. What’s&nbsp;next?</p><p>There is a very clear difficult path forwards: we could very easily wind up with a world which runs on three incompatible global trade technology platforms: the American VISA-SWIFT etc. regime, the EU Digital Product Passports etc. regime, and the Chinese Belt and Road etc. regime. In this instance trade between these blocs will slow down over time as the technical and legal friction of trading across borders is reduced within the systems, but trade between these systems is more costly and difficult. I lay out this case in some detail <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/why-global-trade-needs-the-blockchain-e1a380f5df2">here</a> (which contrasts the blockchain with high frequency trading systems). You can even find threads of this model in my 2015 “<a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/by-the-end-of-this-article-youre-going-to-understand-blockchains-in-general-and-ethereum-a-next-e11df6a1d7cf">Programmable Blockchains in Context</a>” piece written for the Ethereum launch day. The problems database systems have interconnecting using APIs are even more severe when we start looking at things like automated customs clearing&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Is there a more peaceful, positive path we could take? Maybe this: internet-led globalism: Wikipedia style global shared resources, and Alibaba-style free trade. “One ERC721 NFT per item” assets work pretty much anywhere. “Many ERC20 fractional ownership tokens per asset” is likely to work best in the EU under <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/esmas-activities/digital-finance-and-innovation/markets-crypto-assets-regulation-mica">MICA</a>, at least at first. So the goal state is “world trade moves to the internet” — a “back of the envelope” calculation would be <a href="https://lawcom.gov.uk/project/electronic-trade-documents/">$250bn of savings a year</a>, estimated – and “real estate moves to the blockchain” — $150bn a year of savings, estimated.</p><p>This is a different “theory of value” of the blockchain to the bitcoiner’s “governments can’t stop printing money so eventually all fiat goes to zero and only Bitcoin remains” model. In practice governments don’t die easy. They’ve got moves: they’ll use them. So the hardcore “internet maximalist” view is centred around trade not money-like tokens, we don’t care what tokens are used to pay for real estate: ether, dollar coins, wBTC, digitised gold bars, CBDCs, SDRs, Doge, what we care about is the transactions happen basically paperlessly, AND we get a cut of the transactions for securing them. That’s our business model: get as much of $trillions of transactions on chain as possible, and take our cut from every one. Currently it’s all still 30-day invoicing and bank transfers once you start routinely dealing with assets over about $10k, never mind the arcane mess that is real estate transactions. Some of the regulations governing that are still written on goat skin, and you breathe a sigh of relief if a transaction only takes three months, because that is currently what passes for fast and&nbsp;smooth.</p><p>We aim to change this, once and for&nbsp;all.</p><p>If this takes off, it’ll do for real estate and&nbsp;trade:</p>  what Big Bang in the 1980s did for trading stocks and shares (electronic exchanges replaced human face to face exchange in trading&nbsp;pits!!!)  what Spotify did for&nbsp;music  what Amazon did for physical goods purchases  what Netflix / YouTube / TikTok did for&nbsp;video  <p>Digitisation of entire industries is routine at this point. Each one needs new technology. Amazon needed HTTPS cryptography and certificate authorities. Spotify and Netflix needed The Cloud, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>Our bet is that real estate and global trade need Ethereum to move them&nbsp;online.</p><p>If we are right, your transformation will be much larger than just tokenizing stocks and bonds and revenue streams from rental homes, the current “RWA” leaders. Stocks and bonds etc. are already massively digital and traded on the internet, tokenizing them is an additional improvement but an eToro-type training app isn’t so much worse than real&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>The improvement is incremental.</p><p>But enabling internet trading for assets that are currently ENTIRELY manually traded is an absolute game changer. Half a trillion dollars a year of savings by the time cars and a few other things are added to the mix. That’s a lot of potential.</p><p>Just to quantify it a&nbsp;little.</p><p>Half a trillion in savings, cut five ways: buyers, sellers, exchanges, technology providers, traders/market makers/lawyers and other middle men niches that are created - three out of five are maybe new companies. $300bn a year at a 10x multiplier suggests $3 trillion in market cap for the companies living off that revenue stream, kind of about the size of the<a href="https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/industry/internet-retail/"> entire internet retail industry</a> that currently exists. Now you can argue this 50 different ways: 10x multiplier? How long will it take to get to this scale? <a href="https://www.failory.com/startups/shoes-unicorns">Why did Tradelens fail etc</a>, but there are four billion dollar companies just trading sneakers right&nbsp;now.</p><p>What do you think tokenized real estate is going to&nbsp;do?</p><p>And we are playing for the position of “the company everybody uses to lift their assets up to the blockchain”.</p><p>All the global legal stuff and the risk management and dispute resolution and so on — build your own or use the same stuff everybody else uses. A parallel there is the ISDA template contract which carries most of $600 trillion of <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/otc_hy2211.htm">derivatives</a>. Standardisation pays! That’s one paper contract template that defines what a derivative is, broadly speaking. (I should say the $600 trillion of derivatives mostly cancels out — it’s about $20 trillion of actual money so about 10x the size of the crypto&nbsp;market.)</p><p>These macro trends are huge beyond all imaging, they’re just staggering in scope, and yet we see people getting wildly excited about relatively small local transformations - remember that fashion for “decentralised Uber” for a while? It’s potentially a really good business, but the city itself is up for grabs, not just the&nbsp;taxis!!</p><p>It’s all a question of scale in the&nbsp;end.</p><p>So with a story that large, where do you&nbsp;start?</p><p>“There is only one world and trade can and should work the same way everywhere” and the rest just&nbsp;follows.</p><p>Ethereum needs a new narrative. Ethereum needs a new&nbsp;plan.</p><p>THIS IS&nbsp;IT.</p><p>And all this comes down to enabling legislation in the&nbsp;end:</p>  UKJT <a href="https://share-eu1.hsforms.com/1ZYEqf0C5RyKJ-hw8HuIDLwg7g8s?__hstc=210657930.bd681f8e55dc4f22c4da469838e87c56.1708433139509.1708433139509.1708433139509.1&amp;__hssc=210657930.1.1708433139509&amp;__hsfp=3782222774">digital dispute resolution rules</a> (tertiary legislation?)  <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/esmas-activities/digital-finance-and-innovation/markets-crypto-assets-regulation-mica">MICA</a> in the EU (coming into force by degrees, starting later this&nbsp;year)  <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/38/contents/enacted">Electronic Trade Documents</a> legislation in the UK (brand new late last&nbsp;year)  <p>Getting things up and running to fully utilise the global opportunities created by the new legislation is key. That’s what opens up their new&nbsp;vistas.</p><p>That’s what we’re&nbsp;doing.</p><p>Those are the vistas that Mattereum is opening&nbsp;up.</p><p>Just One World with Mattereum.</p><p><a href="https://mattereum.de/get-tokens?utm_source=Medium&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=MATR-launch-2024-02-29">Find out more about Mattereum GmbH’s token&nbsp;sale*.</a></p><p>*The Mattereum Discount Token (MATR) is available for purchase through Mattereum GmbH’s fully regulated German crypto exchange partner, Swarm.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Small</a></p>Cloud IaaS is used extensively to develop, deliver new applications, and reengineer existing ones. This is often because cloud services provide an environment for accelerated development without the need for capital expenditure and avoids lengthy procurement delays to obtain hardware. However, this also creates challenges, in particular security as a shared responsibility, and this increases complexity since each cloud service provides security capabilities in diverse ways. While the Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) must take steps to secure the service they provide, it is up to the customer to secure the way they use the service. Cloud-Native Application Protection Platforms (CNAPP) are intended to reduce complexity by helping organizations using multiple cloud services to identify and manage the risks for which they have responsibility.

In DF, you can earn OCEAN rewards by locking OCEAN, curating data, and making predictions via Predictoor.</p><blockquote>As of this DF round (DF81), <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-main-2-is-here-3d46506a141e">DF Main 2 is here</a>. OCEAN rewards double to 300,000 OCEAN/week. This breaks down as follows. Passive DF &amp; Active DF each get 150K OCEAN/week. Within Active DF, Volume DF gets 112.5K OCEAN/week and Predictoor DF gets 37.5K OCEAN/week. ROSE rewards continue at 20K ROSE/week.</blockquote><p>Data Farming Round 80 (DF80) has completed. 150K OCEAN + 20K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am March 7, 2024 and ended 12:01 am March 14. You can claim rewards at the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF81 is live today, March 14. It concludes on March 21. 300K OCEAN and 20K ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF81   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: Passive DF, Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF, and Predictoor DF.</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF81 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;2.</p><p>Budget. This round has 300,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 150K OCEAN (50% of&nbsp;rewards)  Active DF: 150K OCEAN (50% of rewards). To each substream:<br>– Volume DF: 112.5K OCEAN<br>– Predictoor DF: 37.5K OCEAN + 20K&nbsp;ROSE  <p>Networks. Passive DF applies to OCEAN locked on Ethereum mainnet. Predictoor DF applies to activity on Oasis Sapphire. Volume DF applies to data assets published on Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/discover/networks">Here</a> is more information about Ocean deployments to networks.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by asset’s DCV * (% stake in asset) *DCV_multiplier.

 Rewards double to 300,000 OCEAN per week. Expected APY &gt;&nbsp;20%  Summary <p>On March 14, 2024, Data Farming Main, Phase 2 starts (round DF81). Weekly rewards will double to 300,000 OCEAN/week. We can expect APY to jump&nbsp;too.</p> Contents<br>1. <a>Overview</a><br>2. <a>Reward Budgets &amp; APYs</a> <br>3. <a>How to Data Farm</a><br>4. <a>Conclusion</a><br>(Plus Appendices)  1. Overview <p>Data Farming is Ocean Protocol’s incentives program. Participants earn OCEAN rewards for locking OCEAN, curating data, and making predictions (in <a href="https://www.predictoor.ai/">Predictoor</a>).</p><p>DF’s first round (DF1) launched on June 16, 2022 with 10,000 OCEAN/week rewards. DF went through alpha and beta to the final “DF Main” phase. DF Main has sub-phases 1-4:</p>  DF Main 1 had 150,000 OCEAN/week rewards.  ⭐ DF Main 2 has 300,000 OCEAN/week rewards. It starts today, March 14, 2024, in DF round 81 (DF81).⭐ Bonus: 20,000 ROSE/week thanks to Oasis&nbsp;🙏  DF Main 3 starts six months later, with 2x more rewards. DF Main 4 is six months after that, with another 2x. The <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/reward-schedule">Reward Schedule docs</a> have&nbsp;details.  <p>DF is evolving. At first, DF exclusively rewarded data curation. Now, it also rewards locking OCEAN and making predictions. We can expect further evolution.</p><p>The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 describes DF reward budgets and expected APYs. Section 3 describes how to data farm, via <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">the webapp</a>. Section 4 concludes.</p> 2. Reward Budgets &amp;&nbsp;APYs  2.1 Budgets per&nbsp;Stream <p>The “Passive DF” stream rewards people for locking OCEAN. The “Active DF” stream rewards doing more work to add value to ecosystem; it has two sub-streams “Volume DF” and “Predictoor DF”.</p><p>Here is reward allocation &amp; some detail per each stream, as of DF Main&nbsp;2.</p>  <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/passive-df">Passive DF</a>. 150K OCEAN / week. Lock OCEAN for <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-veocean-c5f416c1f9a0">veOCEAN</a>. The longer you lock for, the more veOCEAN (details below). Rewards are pro-rata to veOCEAN holdings.  Active DF. 150K OCEAN / week. It has these substreams:<br>i. <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/volume-df">Volume DF</a>: 112.5K OCEAN / week. Allocate veOCEAN towards data assets with high DCV, to earn more. Rewards are a function of DCV and veOCEAN stake.<br>ii. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf">Predictoor DF</a>: 37.5K OCEAN / week + 20K ROSE / week. Predict future price movement, continuously (as a predictoor).  <p>For further details on each stream, please consult the <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">DF&nbsp;docs</a>.</p> 2.1 APY Estimates <p>As of DF Main 2, how can we expect APY to change? Here’s a quick estimate.</p><p>Today’s rewards increase includes a doubling of Passive DF rewards from 75,000 OCEAN/week to 150,000 OCEAN/week. So APY for Passive DF will jump by 2x (all else being equal). If you’ve locked for 4 years to hit max APY, expect APY to rise from ≈10.1% to&nbsp;≈20.2%.</p><p>APY of Active DF is currently ≈3.13%. It’s capped by data consume volume, so we shouldn’t expect it to increase by&nbsp;2x.</p><p>Overall APY is currently ≈12.75% (for max lock time). Given that Passive DF will increase things by (20.2–10.1) = 10.1%, then overall APY will jump to about 22.75% (all else being&nbsp;equal).</p><p>To max your APY, it makes sense to lock OCEAN for long; to curate with all your locked OCEAN; and to run a predictoor bot with aggressive staking.</p> 4. How to Data&nbsp;Farm  4.1 DF Webapp tasks&nbsp;overview <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: Passive DF, Volume DF, and Predictoor DF. The DF webapp facilitates most of these; the rest are via Predictoor.</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the <a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean">DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards">DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim”&nbsp;button.  Volume DF. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards">DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at&nbsp;once).  Predictoor DF. To earn: become a predictoor by running a bot that makes regular predictions. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf">Here’s how</a>. To claim: predictoors get paid via sales of the prediction feeds to traders. Predictoor DF is treated as extra&nbsp;sales.  <p>The subsections that follow elaborate on key&nbsp;steps.</p> 4.2 Navigating to DF&nbsp;webapp <p>You can get to the DF webapp from the main Ocean Protocol site <a href="http://www.oceanprotocol.com,">oceanprotocol.com,</a> and clicking on “STAKE&nbsp;OCEAN”.</p><p>Or, you can go directly to its url at <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">df.oceandao.org</a>.</p>Getting to Data Farming page from main Ocean site (<a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">oceanprotocol.com</a>) 4.3 DF Webapp&nbsp;homepage <p>Here’s the DF webapp homepage.</p><a href="https://df.oceandao.org">DF webapp&nbsp;homepage</a> 4.4 DF Webapp for Passive DF /&nbsp;veOCEAN <p>If you’re inside the webapp, click on “Passive-DF” tab. Or go directly to its url at <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/passive-df">df.oceandao.org/passive-df</a>.</p><p>This page’s main role is to let you lock OCEAN to get veOCEAN. It allows you to explore “what-if” scenarios: you can lock for different durations, with different OCEAN amounts, and different # compounds; and it will tell you the expected OCEAN rewards and APY (including accounting for gas&nbsp;fees).</p><p>This page also lets you track your veOCEAN balance, lock more OCEAN, and lock for&nbsp;longer.</p><a href="https://df.oceandao.org/passive-df">Passive DF&nbsp;page</a> 4.5 DF Webapp for Volume&nbsp;DF <p>If you’re inside the webapp, click on “Volume-DF” tab. Or go directly to its url at <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/volume-df">df.oceandao.org/volume-df</a>. To participate in Volume DF, you need to allocate your veOCEAN to data assets. The higher the volume the asset, the more you earn: this is curation.</p><a href="https://df.oceandao.org/volume-df">Volume DF&nbsp;page</a> 4.6 DF Webapp for Claiming&nbsp;Rewards <p>Click the pink “Claim All” buttons on the homepage to claim OCEAN rewards. The image below illustrates.</p><p>Where to claim? All earnings for data farmers are claimable in Ethereum mainnet. This is the case even though data assets for DF may published in any <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/core-concepts/networks">network where Ocean’s deployed in production</a>: Eth mainnet, Polygon, etc. All rewards come through Eth&nbsp;mainnet.</p><p>When to claim? There are fresh passive rewards available every Thursday. If you wish, you can wait for many weeks to accumulate before claiming. (It’s all on-chain.) Predictoor rewards can be claimed at any&nbsp;time.</p><p>When to do a first claim? From the time you lock OCEAN, you must wait at least a week, and up to two weeks, to be able to claim rewards. The nerdy version: if you lock OCEAN on day x, you’ll be able to claim rewards on the first weekly ve “epoch” that begins after day x+7. This behavior is inherited from <a href="https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-fees.html">veCRV</a>; <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts/blob/main/contracts/ve/veFeeDistributor.vy#L240-L256">here’s the&nbsp;code.</a></p> 5. Conclusion <p>On March 14, 2024, Data Farming Main, Phase 2 starts. Weekly rewards will double to 300,000 OCEAN/week. We can expect APY to jump&nbsp;too.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean, DF and Predictoor <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>Aergo is excited to announce Booost’s expansion as an Aergo sub-brand specializing in consumer NFT. <a href="https://medium.com/aergo/digital-assets-as-a-gateway-expanding-enterprise-led-nft-initiative-cb770dcf44ec">As stated in the previous article</a>, Aergo will focus on enterprise-led NFTs, while Booost will specialize in web3 functionalities and NFTs tailored for consumer engagement, particularly leveraging location-based models. This strategic division allows us to tap into distinct markets and cater to diverse needs from both B2B and B2C&nbsp;sectors.</p><p>Firstly, Aergo will add dynamic NFT (dNFT) functionality for enterprise customers to utilize with various services. Aergo has already established blockchain infrastructure for numerous companies. By introducing dNFTs and leveraging accumulated network data, Aergo will be pioneering NFTs tailored for specific enterprise environments, extending beyond mere blockchain recording and authentication.</p><p>This innovation stands to revolutionize markets like STO (Security Token Offering) and RWA (Real World Asset). Unlike static NFTs, dNFTs feature continuously updatable metadata, consolidating changes like mortgages and titles without individual raw data storage. This shift offers superior data management and security for enterprises and government agencies, particularly those favoring private networks.</p><p>Take the automotive market for example, where dNFTs are issued when a vehicle is sold. The NFTs record the vehicle’s maintenance and fueling records, which are essential for value conversion which now can be easily performed by simply looking up the dNFT without accessing the blockchain where the raw data is stored. This can be utilized for more accurate valuations, simplifying trades and collateralization. dNFTs can also streamline pre-owned sales for automakers by calculating vehicle purchase values and associated maintenance costs. Luxury car brands also can leverage dNFTs to enhance loyalty programs, offering tailored rewards like event-based incentives and consumer participation rewards to their clientele.</p><p>Meanwhile, Booost will increase its user base by expanding various web3 functions and consumer-focused NFT features. Beyond the event information and location-sharing services successfully tested at the previous Korea Blockchain Week, Booost plans to test and upgrade advertising services linked to NFTs at various domestic and international web3 and crypto&nbsp;events.</p><p>Booost’s primary focus is on location-based advertising (LBA), inspired by Niantic’s groundbreaking integration of gaming with real-world elements. Our innovative LBA model will incorporate features such as event check-ins, admission tickets, raffles, airdrop events, and more, offering a compelling and immersive experience for users and more targeted marketing for retail, enhancing customer engagement</p><p>These dynamic and consumer NFT technologies will be implemented in enterprises and across various industries. Aergo will support companies in various fields including manufacturing companies, governments, and retail to easily utilize dNFTs. The BOOOST app will be a gateway to the web3/consumer NFT markets, expanding the Aergo-based NFT issuance and ecosystem while Aergo taps into the enterprise NFT&nbsp;markets.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/booosting-the-dynamic-nft-and-consumer-nft-markets-bee8ca91635e">‘BOOOST’ing the Dynamic NFT and Consumer NFT Markets</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  There is no minimum transaction threshold for the FATF Travel Rule in&nbsp;Estonia.  The definition of VASPs in Estonia now covers a wider array of crypto services, expanding AML compliance requirements.  Licensing fees and capital requirements for crypto businesses have been increased in&nbsp;Estonia.  <p>In 2017, Estonia became the first country to set the European legal framework for virtual currencies. The country then enacted amendments to its anti-money laundering (AML) legislation that define cryptocurrencies as value represented in digital form that is digitally transferable and acceptable as a payment instrument but not a legal&nbsp;tender.</p><p>In the following year, the European Union (EU) <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-block-perspective-march-2023">adopted the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5)</a>, which introduced AML and know-your-client (KYC) obligations for cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet providers. To comply with the EU directive, Estonia made changes to its Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Act, which were implemented in March&nbsp;2020.</p><p>Since then, Estonia has started treating virtual currency service providers as “financial institutions,” subjecting them to the same reporting regulations and requirements as other financial institutions within the&nbsp;country.</p><p>In March 2022, Estonia further tightened its regulations with <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/112032022002">amendments to its Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Act</a>. These amendments enforced the FATF Travel Rule, set more stringent licensing conditions for crypto service providers, and broadened the AML Act’s reach to include new virtual currency services.</p> Key Features of the Travel Rule in&nbsp;Estonia <p>By introducing <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule">the FATF Travel Rule</a>, Estonia expanded the definition of “virtual currency service” to include virtual currency transfer services and services related to the issuance of virtual currency.</p><p>Based on the changes, intermediaries between buyers and sellers and services that bring buyers and sellers together, decentralized platforms, services that delegate transactions to third parties, ICO platforms, and other similar services all fall under the VASP category. Hence, they must comply with AML and licensing requirements.</p><p>Meanwhile, regulators raised the cost of obtaining a VASP (Virtual Asset Service Provider) license to €10,000. They also set a minimum share capital requirement of €100,000 for licensees and introduced a new administrative fee for changes in crypto-related activities.</p><p>Businesses also had to submit extra documents, such as a two-year business plan, financial details, descriptions of the information technology systems for identifying and monitoring transactions, information about customers and their beneficial owners, and details required for fulfilling the Travel Rule obligation.</p><p>Moreover, regulators updated the management board requirements and introduced additional grounds for refusing or revoking a VASP&nbsp;license.</p> Compliance Requirements <p>Having implemented the FATF Travel Rule in March 2022, the Estonian Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) gave crypto businesses only three months, up until June 15, 2022, to enforce the rules. However, there is no minimum transaction threshold for reporting transactions.</p><p>Under the Estonia Crypto Travel Rule, VASPs must collect data on a transaction’s originator and share it with the service provider of the transaction’s recipient when completing a virtual currency exchange or transfer. For legal persons, the information to be gathered and shared includes:</p><p>- Full Name &amp; Place of&nbsp;business</p><p>- Unique transaction identifier</p><p>- Crypto wallet identifier or payment account identifier</p><p>- Registry code or residence country identifier</p><p>Meanwhile, the information to be collected for natural persons includes:</p><p>- Full&nbsp;Name</p><p>- Unique transaction identifier</p><p>- Crypto wallet identifier or payment account identifier</p><p>- Identity number and personal identification code</p><p>- Date of birth, place of birth, and residential address</p><p>To comply with the Travel Rule and avoid license revocation, VASPs must maintain accurate records. While transactions involving private wallets are not directly covered by the rule, VASPs initiating such transactions are obligated to perform risk assessments.</p><p>Additionally, the revised AML Act imposes stringent penalties for non-compliance. Fines can reach up to €400,000, with additional penalties of up to 300 fine units (€4 per unit) for violations, including failing to meet capital requirements, neglecting VASP duties, and creating anonymous wallets or accounts.</p> Impact on Cryptocurrency Exchanges and&nbsp;Wallets <p>In Estonia, the Crypto Travel Rule applies to all VASPs operating within its borders, including foreign VASPs, which must register locally to offer their services. VASPs here means crypto exchanges, crypto transfer providers, and any services related to virtual currency issuance.</p><p>Initially, Estonia offered two different licenses to crypto exchanges depending on their functions: the Exchange Service License and the Wallet Service License. However, it has now changed to just one license: the Estonian Cryptocurrency Exchange&nbsp;License.</p><p>To apply for the Estonian Cryptocurrency Exchange license, VASPs must meet stringent requirements that cover but are not limited to the following:</p><p>- The virtual currency company should be registered in&nbsp;Estonia.</p><p>- The company’s business plan must include its intended business activities as well as operational procedures and expected spending.</p><p>- A description of the information technological system and other systems to be used to operate the business.</p><p>- The company’s intended security measures to protect customer&nbsp;assets.</p><p>- Information about the company’s assigned audit firm, including their name, personal identity code, or personally identifiable information (PII).</p><p>- A share capital of at least EUR 100,000 for exchange services and EUR 250,000 for transfer services.</p><p>In transactions involving unhosted (non-custodial or self-hosted) wallets, Estonian VASPs are not obliged to transmit detailed personally identifiable information (PII). However, they must assess the transaction’s risk, retain essential information about both the transaction’s originator and beneficiary, and provide this data to regulatory or supervisory bodies when requested.</p><p>While PII from the beneficiary is not always mandatory in transactions from self-hosted wallets, the originator must supply PII when transferring to a VASP. Additionally, transactions of high value or those conducted frequently may require the beneficiary’s PII as&nbsp;well.</p> Global Context and Comparison <p>The FATF guidance and various global regulators further stipulate that VASPs must apply the Travel Rule to transactions above the $1,000 threshold. This minimum requirement varies based on jurisdictions. For instance, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-united-states">in the US</a>, this limit is higher at $3,000, while some jurisdictions, like Estonia, do not have one at&nbsp;all.</p><p>Moreover, contrary to the guidance of FATF, Estonia doesn’t need VASPs to gather and share any personal information about the Beneficiary customer. Most jurisdictions require the beneficiary’s name to be obtained and transmitted. This may cause issues when an Estonia exchange exchange interacts with a foreign exchange, as they may reject the transaction that has no information about the beneficiary.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>By enforcing the FATF Travel Rule and revising its AML laws, Estonia has set a framework that necessitates a detailed approach to transactions and service provider operations. These regulations aim to ensure transaction transparency and combat financial crimes, posing challenges for both regulators and industry participants to navigate this evolving landscape. In this evolving regulatory landscape, any actions taken must be carefully considered for their impact, with a focus on maintaining both security and a positive user experience.</p> Frequently Asked Questions <p>Q1: What is the FATF Travel Rule, and how does it apply in&nbsp;Estonia?</p><p>The FATF Travel Rule requires virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to share transaction data between senders and receivers for transparency. In Estonia, this rule applies to all transactions regardless of their&nbsp;value.</p><p>Q2: Who is considered a VASP under Estonian regulations?</p><p>In Estonia, the definition of a VASP is broad, including crypto exchanges, wallet providers, and any service related to the transfer, exchange, or issuance of virtual currencies.</p><p>Q3: What are the licensing requirements for crypto businesses in&nbsp;Estonia?</p><p>Crypto businesses must obtain a VASP license, meet criteria such as a minimum capital requirement (which varies by service type), and pay a licensing fee, which has been increased to ensure only compliant entities&nbsp;operate.</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust. It is a public protocol designed to drive data discoverability and compliance into blockchain while preserving privacy and sovereignty.

<p>Suppose you’re a growing company. Then you’ve got a growing Identity &amp; Access Management (IAM) problem–because that happens when you grow. You’ve probably been using a combination of spreadsheets, emails, checklists, and half-remembered procedures to handle onboarding, offboarding, and compliance audits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then along comes an IAM vendor who pitches their shiny identity provider service: a vision of IAM nirvana with automated provisioning, de-provisioning, and access requests. All you have to do is sign up and push a couple of buttons. (After you pay them, of course.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s what the IAM vision looks like:</p>
 
 One Platform, Seamless Control: Manage all your SaaS applications’ identities and access in a single, centralized IAM platform. No more jumping between different tools or spreadsheets. 
 Automated Efficiency: Streamline user access with automated provisioning and de-provisioning across all connected applications. Forget manual tasks and ensure instant access when needed. 
 Cost-Effective Security: Secure your SaaS environment without breaking the bank. Expect transparent pricing for essential IAM features like SCIM/SAML support. 
 
<p>Great vision. But according to the customers we’ve talked to, it’s a mirage.</p>
<p>Here’s what IAM reality looked like once they encountered it:</p>
 
 Fragmented Landscape: Many IAM tools only manage a limited subset of SaaS applications, leaving you with a patchwork of tools and manual processes for the rest. 
 Paywalled Integrations: Access to crucial features like SCIM/SAML often requires upgrading to more expensive tiers with your SaaS providers. 
 Inconsistent Implementation: Even when available, SCIM/SAML implementations can vary significantly between SaaS providers, causing compatibility issues and integration headaches. 
 Manual Mayhem: Unsupported applications force admins to resort to manual workarounds, relying on static documentation and informal communication (emails, Slack, spreadsheets) to manage access, leading to inefficiency and security risks. 
 
<p>So they experience IAMBM – an acronym I just made up for Identity and Access Management Buyer’s Remorse. Automating a chaotic, uncontrolled, disorderly process does not make it harmonious, controlled, or orderly. You replace a messy manual mess with a messy automated mess.</p>
<p>Bill Gates said it right: “The first rule of any technology used in a business is that automation applied to an efficient operation will magnify the efficiency. The second is that automation applied to an inefficient operation will magnify the inefficiency.”&nbsp;</p>
 Shifting the Paradigm 
<p>Consider orchestration before automation. YeshID’s orchestration lets you capture and organize your tasks in playbooks. As you organize your activities–in one place, with a single source of truth–you can automate when it’s cost-effective, convenient, and technically feasible. You can integrate manual processes, partly automated processes, and completely automated processes using a single interface. Orchestration lets you delegate tasks, follow up, and distribute work without losing visibility and control.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Orchestration will make your IAM activities transparent, orderly, distributed, and more secure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>IAM is about people, not just technology. Don’t fall into the automation trap. By empowering your team and focusing on clear, trackable processes, you can achieve secure and efficient access management without the “buyer’s remorse” hangover.</p>

<p>How do we prove who we are in an increasingly digital world?&nbsp;</p><p>The concept of identity has evolved from social constructs to centralized digital profiles defined more by technology companies than individuals themselves. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) aims to put personal ownership back into the equation through emerging solutions centered around distributed ledger technology and cryptography.&nbsp;</p><p>In a conversation that ranged from philosophy to blockchain technology, Lohan Spies discusses how SSI and related innovations might empower youth in developing nations, enable marginalized populations’ participation in regulated economies, and help regenerate land while fighting climate change.&nbsp;</p><p>Along the way, complexities around public/private key management, unintended consequences of new systems, and the excitement of driving real global change through collaboration come clearly into focus.</p> Defining Digital Identity <p>The concept of identity has shifted greatly in the digital age. As Spies explains, "The traditional way for identity was very much a social construct." People associated names and faces and built interpersonal trust through repeated interactions.&nbsp;</p><p>The internet lacked an innate understanding of identity, however; online systems resorted to centralized user profiles attached to email addresses, unique IDs controlled more by service providers than individuals.</p><p>This approach enabled security risks, data breaches, and unilateral account shutdowns without recourse. Spies contrasts these realities with self-sovereign identity "where you have full control and ownership of your identity, meaning nobody can take it away from you." Control and ownership sit right at the crux of the philosophical and practical divide.</p> Realizing the Potential of Self-Sovereign Systems <p>For digital identity solutions to reach their full potential, Spies believes several essential ingredients need to coalesce. "The first thing that's extremely important is that we do have standards and video specifications," he explains, "because that is the one thing that aligns us or not."</p><p>However, Spies cautions against rigid standardization stifling innovation, noting that "some people might have a different view...but ultimately, I think we're going to get to a point where we will diverge into a common understanding of what's acceptable and what's not acceptable."</p><p>This balanced approach allows for experimentation on the fringes by "people that are willing to go through those extremely complicated use cases" while still working towards interoperable frameworks.</p><p>“The hope is...it aligns us,” Spies notes of identity standards while allowing for “people that are willing to go through those extremely complicated use cases” on the fringes.</p><p>Second, spreading access to cryptography and related capabilities helps empower individuals rather than leaving specialized knowledge in the hands of a small subset of people.&nbsp;</p><p></p><blockquote>“We kind of call it democratizing in a way, the concept of cryptography,” Spies explains regarding this drive to distribute understanding and control, “really giving it to everyone to leverage and utilize to their own benefit.”</blockquote><p></p><p>Finally, governance structures need to evolve in tandem with technological ones. From local contexts to national digital identity initiatives spanning public and private entities, multipronged coordination paves the road to real-world adoption.</p><p>The payoff of this coordination could prove immense in daily life for everyone. Imagine crossing borders digitally rather than waiting in queues. Consider accessing regulated financial systems regardless of formal government identification documents. Or think about connecting payments directly, not just to account numbers.&nbsp;</p><p>In the realm of payments, self-sovereign identity could enable direct transactions without relying on intermediary institutions. "I think there's just a natural progression to bring identity and payments closer together," Spies explains.</p><p>Rather than sending money to an account number and routing through banks or payment apps, funds could move directly between verified individuals. The secure digital identities of self-sovereign systems would serve in place of centralized platforms that currently mediate transactions.</p> Use Cases, Obstacles, and Promise <p>If coordinated properly, self-sovereign systems could greatly benefit populations in need across the globe. Spies points to the <a href="https://www.generationunlimited.org/yoma?ref=blog.holochain.org">YOMA project from UNICEF</a>, which empowers youth in developing countries, where he is working to help integrate digital identity technology to increase access to education and employment credentials.</p><p>Other models help shift marginalized groups away from all-cash economies into greater digital inclusion. Environmentally, distributed identity solutions offer promise by securely tracking and verifying sustainability data. Spies details one such application in regenerative agriculture:</p><p></p><blockquote>"From the ground, it's verifiable data...we can make sure that a human or IoT device can be identified and how we can make sure that that data feeds up into the chain of various layers. But we know we can trust the data that originated from the ground."</blockquote><p></p><p>This trusted provenance allows for the creation of what Spies calls "nature certificates," which go beyond traditional carbon credits:</p><p>Of course, obstacles remain in these early days. Complexities of public/private key management persist, though various startups work toward solutions. Mainstream understanding and education around the relevance of self-sovereign systems currently fall short as well. As the internet’s unintended impact shows, we must take care to avoid exclusion where promises of inclusion abound.</p><p>However, with expanding real-world deployment comes cause for optimism. Spies expresses excitement “to see this technology really being adopted, really solving real-world problems.”&nbsp;</p><p>New collaborations between digital identity projects are driving tangible progress in addressing real-world challenges. If holistic human needs and ethical considerations guide developers and adopters alike, efforts like YOMA and Holochain could portend more equitable and empowered societies ahead.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>SAP recently announced the end-of-life of their SAP Identity Management solution in 2027, with an extended maintenance period until 2030. With already being in 2024, this leaves three to at maximum six years for migrating SAP Identity Management to another solution. Three years, if avoiding the extended maintenance period and associated cost (even while the premium is only slightly above the regular maintenance fee), is not long enough for the transition of an IGA (Identity Governance &amp; Administration) solution. In other words: It is time to start planning.</p>
 IAM solutions provided by SAP and the SAP solution approach 
<p>SAP recently <a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/preparing-for-sap-identity-management-s-end-of-maintenance-in-2027/ba-p/13596101">proposed a solution approach</a> based on <a href="https://pages.community.sap.com/topics/cloud-identity-services">SAP Cloud Identity Services</a>. This article has been frequently misinterpreted in saying “SAP endorses a combined solution based on SAP Cloud Identity Services and Microsoft Entra ID”. In fact, it says that SAP will continue its investment in both SAP Cloud Identity Services and <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/financial-management/cloud-iam.html">SAP Cloud Identity Access Governance</a> (Cloud IAG) and “that these enhancements are designed to facilitate integration with other partner identity management solutions, like Microsoft Entra ID, that provide a comprehensive approach to enterprise-wide identity and access scenarios.”</p>
<p>SAP unveils its strategy for the own IAM-related solutions as well as their focus on a flexible integration strategy for scenarios that require IAM capabilities beyond what SAP Cloud Identity Services and SAP Cloud IAG provide.</p>
<p>SAP Cloud Identity Services are a SaaS solution supporting a good set of IAM capabilities, ranging from Access Management features for authentication and identity federation to SCIM-based provisioning, integrated directory services, and authorization management for Policy-Based Access Management (PBAM). SAP focuses on utilizing open standards, but also on integration to other IAM solutions in the organization. Access Governance features are provided by SAP Cloud IAG, which is primarily focused on the SAP ecosystem and neatly integrates with the SAP Cloud Identity Services.</p>
 Challenges and limitations 
<p>With SAP itself supporting an integration approach with other identity management solutions “that provide a comprehensive approach”, the question is where such expansion and integration is needed. There are two dimensions to look at. One is the breadth and depth of capabilities that are needed versus what is provided by SAP’s own solutions, which needs a thorough requirements analysis. To keep in mind here: Access Governance capabilities are delivered by the “companion product” SAP Cloud IAG, not by SAP Cloud Identity Services.</p>
<p>The other is the breadth and depth of integration to target systems. The focus on SCIM-based provisioning is one important area here. While SCIM is increasingly supported by SaaS (Software as a Service) solutions, SCIM interfaces are very rarely found in legacy on-premises applications.</p>
<p>A simple rule is: The more non-SAP solutions, the more legacy and on-premises integration, and the larger and more complex the organization is, the more likely such integration approach is needed.</p>
<p>Plus: There are several IAM solutions out there that can cover what SAP Cloud Identity Services and SAP Cloud IAG provide in capabilities. There are options. And some of them provide very powerful, in-depth support even for complex SAP environments.</p>
 Taking a structured approach 
<p>Don’t oversimplify a decision that will impact your IT for the next 10-15 years at least, when taking common lifetimes of IGA solutions. Analyze the options you have thoroughly.</p>
 
 Start with your overall IAM strategy: How will your Identity Fabric of the future look like? 
 Analyze what you have and what (SAP Identity Manager, due to end-of-life) must change 
 Understand what you will need 
 Go into the detailed analysis of requirements 
 Run a thorough tools choice process to find the right solution 
 
<p>For that tools choice process, best practice for an organization that has SAP Identity Manager in place is to have SAP Cloud Identity Services and Cloud IAG as one of the shortlisted options, amongst other IAM solutions. Such process also will allow you to assess combinations such as SAP Cloud Identity Services in combination with Microsoft Entra ID or other enterprise IAM solutions.</p>
<p>In any case: Don’t take it easy. Spend the time for planning and assessing the options you have, to find the right solution for your enterprise. Impacting factors include aspects such as</p>
 
 The current and future SAP landscape versus a multi-vendor strategy for Line-of-Business applications 
 The complexity of the non-SAP application and system landscape in scope of IAM 
 The state of IAM solutions beyond SAP Identity Manager 
 The overall IAM strategy towards a modern Identity Fabric 
 The organizational structure, specifically regarding responsibilities for SAP environments vs. IAM 
 
<p>There is no simple answer to the right approach for replacing SAP Identity Manager. Don’t oversimplify.</p>

<p>Today’s healthcare organizations must address a multitude of high-priority challenges. With competition at an all-time high, healthcare organizations are under pressure to meet patient and member demands for easy, personalized digital experiences. Healthcare providers, workers, and partners are also insisting on seamless digital experiences that streamline their work for greater operational efficiency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the healthcare industry is facing unrelenting cyberattacks that wreak havoc upon patient care, budgets, and business operations. According to the 2024 ForgeRock Breach Report (ForgeRock is now a part of Ping Identity), healthcare systems have remained the number one breach target for over five years.&nbsp; Electronic health records containing personal identifiable information (PII) and personal health information (PHI), such as medical records and patient data, are highly sought after by cybercriminals. Unauthorized access is the root cause of most breaches – emphasizing the dire need for modern digital identity cybersecurity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most healthcare organizations are using <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/solutions/business-priority/iam-modernization.html">legacy systems</a> that weren’t built to deliver personalized experiences and secure access for millions of diverse identity types to on-premises, cloud, and SaaS apps from any device, at any time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Implementing a modern, HIPAA compliant <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/identity-fundamentals/identity-and-access-management.html">identity and access management (IAM)</a> platform should be on every healthcare leader’s radar. Modern IAM is proven to protect sensitive information and data by drastically reducing cyberattacks. It also improves user experience and engagement, such as removing friction from the authentication process, all while protecting sensitive data against ransomware, fraud, and other cyberattacks. HIPAA-compliant IAM platforms also enable healthcare organizations to meet compliance requirements for regulations such as HIPAA, TEFCA, HITECH, the 21st Century Cures Act, and many more.</p>

				  Learn how some educators are taking advantage of new technologies to provide faster student and employee verification and eliminate redundant paperwork and manual processes.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>The Problem</p>
<p>In the US <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023/highest-school-enrollment-count.html#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20college%20enrollment%20remained,percentage%20point%20increase%20from%202020">17.3 million students were enrolled in college</a> in 2022, and <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/184010/school-enrollment-in-public-and-private-institutions-2008/#statisticContainer">17.16 million were enrolled in high school.</a> Each student generates data — such as transcripts of courses taken and grades achieved — all of which will need to be shared and verified over the course of the school year and beyond.</p>
<p>With the growing interest in higher education, colleges in the US received roughly <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltnietzel/2023/03/30/college-applications-are-up-dramatically-in-2023/?sh=6b7324349c4d">seven million applications in 2023,</a> each of which requiring a short list of supporting documents.</p>
<p>Student athletes will need documents for sports they participated in, as well as medical paperwork, such as physicals or injury reports, to be on file.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://gitnux.org/college-housing-statistics/#:~:text=50%25%20of%20college%20students%20in,colleges%20have%20on-campus%20housing">50% of college students who live on campus </a>need an identity and access management system to access dorms, dining halls, labs and libraries.</p>
<p>Each of the <a href="https://educationdata.org/number-of-college-graduates#:~:text=The%20total%20number%20of%20graduates,college%20students%20graduated%20in%202021">4.16 million students who received some level of degree in 2021</a> will need to prove that achievement when they apply for a job and will need to keep supplying that data for many jobs to come.</p>
<p>Employers will want to verify that the degree is real, a <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/how-employers-verify-college-degrees#:~:text=This%20type%20of%20check%20is,which%20usually%20incurs%20a%20fee">manual process most often handled by the school records office</a>. This process can take up to <a href="https://clarifacts.com/faqs/education-verification-turnaround-time/#:~:text=Education%20Verification%20Turnaround%20Time&amp;text=The%20normal%20turnaround%20time%20for,or%20state%20and%20federal%20holiday">72 hours</a> unless subject to additional delays such as school holidays, resulting in a lot of work for the school.</p>
<p>Verifying these degrees is not just a “nice to have,” fraudulent degrees and transcripts are estimated to be a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawhitford/2023/02/21/how-thousands-of-nurses-got-licensed-with-fake-degrees/?sh=4de695cb5c6d">seven billion-dollar-a-year industry</a> worldwide, with real impact. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawhitford/2023/02/21/how-thousands-of-nurses-got-licensed-with-fake-degrees/?sh=4de695cb5c6d">Thousands of nurses</a> have recently been caught practicing using fake or purchased credentials.</p>
<p>What if there was a really simple way of managing all this, so that all this data was portable, held by the student, and instantly and reliably authenticatable?</p>
<p>How decentralized identity can help</p>
<p>Decentralized identity technology is a way to digitize data so that its original source can be cryptographically proven and any attempt to alter it will be caught. It is designed so that a person can hold their own data, locally, on their mobile devices in the form of a verifiable credential. This makes data easy to share directly with other parties, each of whom can verify the authenticity of the data with simple, mobile software. Critically, this system of holding one’s own data, sharing it directly, and verifying it easily means that direct integrations can be avoided (saving money) and third parties are no longer needed as data brokers (simplifying data privacy), — a revolution in data management.</p>
<p>To put this in perspective for an educational institution, paperwork such as grades, transcripts, and diplomas can now be issued to students directly with a verifiable credential. The student or graduate holds their records and shares them with whoever needs the information, such as when signing up for more classes or applying for college or a job.</p>
<p>Similarly, a student’s identity card can be issued as a verifiable credential, meaning educators have a way to verify a student’s identity for access to accounts, buildings, research collections, laboratories, and more. Verifiable credentials can easily be configured with rules to grant and revoke this access and expire upon graduation.</p>
<p>By issuing verifiable credentials for identity and data, an educational institution can remove the need for passwords, locks, key fobs, or access cards, manual checks in the records office, digging through servers, paper documents and more. By issuing degrees through a verifiable credential, any business with the proper verifier agent can immediately know that the information presented to them is trustworthy, removing the need to go back to the school at all.</p>
<p>How Open Badges fit in</p>
<p>Currently, if you want to verify a person’s transcript, diploma, or certificate, you will need to contact whomever issued the transcript or diploma or certificate. This often means contacting them directly.</p>
<p>But what if that issuing party no longer exists? Schools close, businesses go under or become absorbed. Even if the original data exists, it can be time-consuming to track it down.</p>
<p>This is where Open Badges 3.0 comes in. As a type of verifiable credential for storing data about academic achievements, or certifications, an Open Badge credential can be verified without having to directly check in with the institution that issued them, meaning it can essentially “live forever.”</p>
<p>In contrast to earlier versions of the Open Badges format, the badge can be held by its owner and shared directly. Previously, the badge was hosted by a website (with the risk that it, too, could go bust and disappear, taking the credential record with it).</p>
<p>Open badges 3.0 offer a new smart, decentralized way to store transcripts, grades, and diplomas. Even if a school closes, merges with another, or loses the records, the student has a record and can prove what they have accomplished.</p>

 Digital identity pilot implementation to start in Q1 2024: Kick-off with 2,700 citizens from Austria, Romania and Spain to test wallet solution 



<p>Rennes/Munich, March 12, 2024 – IDnow, a leading identity verification platform provider in Europe, is pleased to announce the start of the pilot implementation phase for the EU-wide SOTERIA research project which aims to develop a user-centric, citizen-driven tool to help European citizens manage their personal data.</p>



<p>The ultimate goal of the project is to combine the creation of a digital identity to access online services with a user-friendly platform that allows for secure and easy data management, while increasing citizens’ awareness of their personal data. “SOTERIA is a large scale demonstrator that shows how a digital identity wallet can enable citizens to protect and control their personal data while making access to online services easier than ever before,” says Montaser Awal, Director of Research at IDnow and coordinator of the SOTERIA project.</p>



 E-voting, e-exam, and e-health field tests in three EU countries 



<p>Launched in October 2021, the SOTERIA project is nearing the final pilot implementation and testing phase of the identity wallet solution, which was developed by IDnow and the other SOTERIA partners as part of the project. The wallet will be integrated into the platforms of <a href="https://scytl.com/">SCYTL</a>, <a href="https://ipcenter.international/">IPCenter</a> and <a href="https://www.science.eus/en/institutions/biobizkaia">Biobizkaia Health Research Institute</a> (with the support of <a href="https://infocons.org/">INFOCONS</a> association) in Romania, Austria and Spain, respectively, for use cases in e-voting, e-exam, and e-health.</p>



<p>This month, the three pilot use cases will kick off with field tests consisting of 900 citizens each from Austria, Romania and Spain. For the e-voting and e-exam use cases, participants will authenticate themselves through the SOTERIA app and test the onboarding, which IDnow provides via proven identity verification methods. These include several new security checks developed within the project, reinforcing the fraud detection capability of the solution further. Then the citizens will go through the voting or exam process, and at the end, have the choice to add their voting receipt or their exam results to their wallet. For the e-health trial, citizens will have the possibility to add their health data to their wallet, while choosing the type of data and documents they want to store. This will allow them to have all important health information about themselves in their pockets.</p>



<p>The benefits of this testing phase are twofold: The 2,700 citizens will test the authentication process and the access to an online service with the help of a stored digital identity; while the wallet’s capability to store documents and attributes (e.g., e-voting receipt, e-exam results, e-health data) in the form of verifiable credentials will also be tested. Afterwards, the citizens’ feedback will be analyzed and evaluated by <a href="https://www.audencia.com/en">AUDENCIA</a> and will be used to improve the platform. These findings can then inform the further development of digital identity wallets under the upcoming <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas-2-0/">eIDAS2 (electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services) regulation</a>.</p>



<p>Awal adds: “Thanks to the findings in the use cases with citizens, SOTERIA will help strengthen security, privacy, and personal data protection across all layers of the digital economy, and will help pave the way for a trustworthy EU digital environment. We are very proud that the R&amp;D team at IDnow gets to lead this ambitious consortium of 13 European partners. It is testament to our innovative spirit and curiosity that forms part of our DNA at IDnow.”</p>



 



<p>About SOTERIA</p>



<p>The SOTERIA consortium consists of 13 partners from eight EU countries, composed of small medium enterprises (ERDYN), large enterprises (IDnow, SCYTL, IPCenter.at), universities and research centers (Audencia, KU Leuven, CVC, IDIAP, Inria, Biocruces Bizkaia) and non-for-profit organizations (INFOCONS, STELAR, NORIA Onlus). The project was written and submitted to the European Union in August 2020, following a call for projects by the European Commission on the topics of digital security and privacy for citizens. The SOTERIA project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No 101018342. More information on the project can be found at <a href="https://www.soteria-h2020.eu/">https://www.soteria-h2020.eu/</a>.<a>[1]</a></p>

<p>Bluesky was created to put <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/02-22-2024-open-social-web">users and communities in control</a> of their social spaces online. The first generation of social media platforms connected the world, but ended up consolidating power in the hands of a few corporations and their leaders. Our online experience doesn’t have to depend on billionaires unilaterally making decisions over what we see. On an open social network like Bluesky, you can shape your experience for yourself.</p>
<p>Today, we’re excited to announce that we’re <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/ozone">open-sourcing Ozone</a>, our collaborative moderation tool. With Ozone, individuals and teams can work together to review and label content across the network. Later this week, we’re opening up the ability for you to run your own independent moderation services, seamlessly integrated into the Bluesky app. This means that you'll be able to create and subscribe to additional moderation services on top of what Bluesky requires, giving you unprecedented control over your social media experience.</p>
<p>At Bluesky, we’re investing in safety from two angles. First, we've built our own moderation team dedicated to providing around-the-clock coverage to uphold our <a href="https://bsky.social/about/support/community-guidelines">community guidelines</a>. Additionally, we recognize that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to moderation — no single company can get online safety right for every country, culture, and community in the world. So we’ve also been building something bigger — an ecosystem of moderation and open-source safety tools that gives communities power to create their own spaces, with their own norms and preferences. Still, using Bluesky feels familiar and intuitive. It's a straightforward app on the surface, but under the hood, we have enabled real innovation and competition in social media by building a new kind of open network.</p>
<p>In designing these moderation services, Bluesky operated by three principles:</p>
 
 Simple and Powerful: Give users a pleasant default experience, with customization options under the hood 
 User Choice: Empower users and communities to develop their own moderation systems 
 Openness: Create an open system that increases trust in the governance of our digital spaces 
 
<p>We first shared our vision for <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/4-13-2023-moderation">composable moderation</a> before Bluesky even had 20,000 users last year. Now, we serve over 5 million users. In this blog post, we’ll dive into how moderation works on the network, where you can choose and customize all the pieces that make up your social media experience.</p>
 Sensible Defaults with User Choice 
<p>In everything we build, we aim to provide a polished user experience with further customization options for those you who want them. When you sign up for Bluesky, you will be subscribed to Bluesky’s built-in moderation service by default. This is similar to how custom feeds work on Bluesky — we’ll show you a couple feeds by default, but you can also create and subscribe to more. Bluesky’s moderation service combines around-the-clock coverage by our team to resolve user reports according to our <a href="https://bsky.social/about/support/community-guidelines">community guidelines</a> with several automated moderation systems. This provides a strong foundation for moderation on the app. You can read our <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/01-16-2024-moderation-2023">2023 Moderation Report</a> for more details.</p>
<p>Bluesky’s vision for moderation is a stackable ecosystem of services. Starting this week, you'll have the power to install filters from independent moderation services, layering them like building blocks on top of the Bluesky app's foundation. This allows you to create a customized experience tailored to your preferences (see example below).</p>

  
  An example moderation service that users can subscribe to.

<p>In the first stage of this week’s rollout, these independent moderation services filters will be available on the desktop version of the app. Soon, they’ll also be available on mobile, so you can shape your social media experience across all platforms.</p>
<p>This hybrid approach is intended to provide a cohesive experience, where our in-house moderation works in conjunction with additional layers customized to each community. The Bluesky app, as an online space that we created and maintain, will always have the foundation of the moderation we provide. Independent moderation services will let you and community builders further customize your own spaces, and open APIs will let developers evolve and innovate on these systems.</p>

  
  Configurable options per label from an example moderation service. 


  
  Example of a post that the moderation service The Chiller has labeled as “rude.”

<p>One team will never be perfect at moderation and curation for the entire world, with its wide variety of contexts, cultures, and preferences. So we’re excited about opening the ecosystem to empower experts, developers, and users with local context to provide their own input that you can additionally subscribe to, on top of Bluesky’s moderation service.</p>
<p>For additional information, read our technical explainer for moderation architecture across the AT Protocol <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/blueskys-moderation-architecture">here</a>.</p>
 How will this all work? 
<p>Here’s what users, moderators, and developers can expect to see this week:</p>
 From a user perspective: 
<p>First and foremost, we want Bluesky to be a great and intuitive experience as soon as you install the app. But if you want to customize your experience, you can easily browse and select from other independent moderation services and subscribe to them in the Bluesky app — as easily as you’d follow another account.</p>
<p>For example, someone could make a moderation service that blocks photos of spiders from Bluesky — let’s call it the Spider Shield. If you get a jump scare from seeing spiders in your otherwise peaceful nature feed, you could install this moderation service and immediately any labeled spider pictures would disappear from your experience.</p>
<p>Moderation services can also accept reports, so if you came across an unlabeled picture of a spider, you could report it to the Spider Shield for review.</p>
 From a moderator perspective: 
<p>If you want to offer a moderation layer on top of what the Bluesky app provides, you can do this without running a lot of infrastructure or building your own client app. We’ve built open source software to simplify the process of running a moderation service. While you need some technical know-how for now, we expect this process to get simpler over time.</p>

  
  Screenshot of the Ozone interface, which a team can use to inspect and label content on the network.

<p>Today, you can already run a mute list or block list that other users can subscribe to. But it often gets tied to your account in a way that makes it hard to delegate responsibility to others. Once you’re running a popular blocklist, that list becomes associated with your account, and users may start directly tagging you in the app. This can get overwhelming at scale.</p>
<p>Ozone, the open source moderation labeling system we’re releasing today, lets you set up a service like a blocklist, but more nuanced — instead of just adding accounts, you can label specific posts too. You will have access to a reporting queue, and users will be able to send reports via the in-app reporting flow. You will be able to set custom labels, and specify what those labels should do. Moderation services will not be tied to individual users, and multiple people can manage them. Tooling designed for teams and communities can help take the burden off individuals and make it possible to run a sustainable moderation service.</p>
<p>To make this more concrete, let’s say you’re the creator of the previously mentioned Spider Shield labeler that labels photos of spiders. You can set up an Ozone dashboard that provides a queue of spider pictures that have been reported, reducing the need for people to tag you directly every time they find a new spider picture online. It’s customizable — you could create one kind of label that blocks pictures of real spiders, and one kind of label that blurs out illustrations of spiders. You could recruit others who don’t like spiders to help you manage the reports, and even hand the project off to someone else altogether without disrupting the people who are using it.</p>
 From a developer perspective: 
<p>As a developer, you've got options when it comes to labeling content. You can use our software, like Ozone, or you can apply labels directly through the API. Ozone is built to help humans review moderation reports, but you can also use automated labeling to power your moderation services. Check out Ozone's open-source repo <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/ozone">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to set up Spider Shield as a fully automated service that uses machine learning to find and label spider pictures, you can do that without even touching Ozone, our moderation tool. And if you want to customize Ozone for your own purposes, you can <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/ozone">submit a PR</a> or fork the project. Our goal in building this open source moderation tooling is to help apps in the AT Protocol ecosystem handle trust &amp; safety challenges without having to start from scratch.</p>
<p>The generic, customizable nature of labels allows you to get creative with them — it would be possible to use labels to “verify” nature accounts that don’t post pictures of spiders, for example. Although the initial functionality of labelers is intended to hide, block, or blur content, it could eventually be used for curation or verification too. We think that the atproto developer ecosystem will find even more ways to use labels and independent moderation services, and will drive innovation in how moderation works on social networks.</p>
<p>Moderation services can work across the entire atproto network, not just the Bluesky app. Imagine if someone creates a new photo-sharing app called Skygram. The Spider Shield moderation service built for Bluesky could easily be used on Skygram too. That's the power of "composable moderation" — all the pieces can be mixed and matched in tons of different ways, even across completely separate apps.</p>
<p>We think it's important for Bluesky to lay the groundwork for a great experience in the app, which is why our moderation service is the default for all Bluesky app users. But we also believe in giving users the freedom to choose and the right to leave. So if Bluesky's moderation doesn’t meet your needs and you want an altogether different experience, you can make that happen. You'll need to build or use a different client app with your own moderation service, but this option gives you full flexibility to implement your own moderation system from the ground up. However, all content shown in the Bluesky app must adhere to Bluesky’s community guidelines.</p>
 FAQ 
<p>Where can I find the open-sourced Ozone tool?</p>
<p>You can find the GitHub repository
<a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/ozone">here</a>.</p>
<p>Why are you open-sourcing Ozone?</p>
<p>By making Ozone open-source and providing it as a ready-to-use tool for independent moderators on the AT Protocol, we're creating a system that encourages collaboration and transparency. Unlike most social media companies that develop their safety tools in private, Ozone's development will be out in the open. This means that new social apps built on the AT Protocol can benefit from all the improvements made by Bluesky and other organizations. By working together and sharing knowledge, we can create better tools faster and build a social media ecosystem that works for everyone.</p>
<p>How is this different from community moderation on Mastodon?</p>
<p>Moderation on Bluesky is not tied to your server, like it is on Mastodon. Defederation, a way of addressing moderation issues in Mastodon by disconnecting servers, is not as relevant on Bluesky because there are other layers to the system. Server operators can set rules for what content they will host, but tools like blocklists and moderation services are what help communities self-organize around moderation preferences. Our <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/02-22-2024-open-social-web">post on federation</a> goes into more detail on how Bluesky differs from Mastodon.</p>
<p>What do I need to do to moderate my own community on Bluesky?</p>
<p>All users of Bluesky’s client app are subscribed by default to Bluesky’s moderation. If you would like to run a moderation service that layers on top of these defaults, you can create a new account for that new service and get it up and running with Ozone.</p>
<p>However, if you want to opt out of our defaults, this is still possible — we believe it’s important to give users the right to leave and not lock you in. You would need to use or develop a separate client app that connects to the AT Protocol, but this option gives you full flexibility to implement your own moderation system from the ground up.</p>
<p>How will running a moderation service be sustainable?</p>
<p>Moderation services, much like feed generators, will likely start off as community-run projects. Just like the 40,000+ custom feeds on Bluesky, or the many Mastodon instances that exist, they may continue to operate as independent projects of individuals or organizations.

Instead of traditional usernames, authentication methods like biometrics, tokens, or SMS are used to authenticate users, which are not susceptible to the same kinds of attacks as passwords.<br>
In a passwordless environment, malicious actors are deprived of the opportunity to get login credentials, exploit weak passwords to gain access, or use stolen passwords for unauthorized access. This fundamentally enhances an organization’s security posture by bypassing the typical risks associated with password-based systems and data breaches.</p>
 Reducing Threats and Enhancing User Experience 
<p>Passwordless IAM augments security and significantly enhances the user’s mobile device and experience. Users no longer need to remember and manage multiple passwords, simplifying the login process. It also alleviates the common issues related to password resets, lockouts, and password management, streamlining user access to systems and applications.<br>
An improved user experience, combined with more secure authentication factors with advanced authentication methods, strengthens the user’s overall security. Users are less likely to adopt insecure practices such as using weak passwords or reusing passwords across multiple services, contributing to the user’s identity in a more secure environment.</p>
 Success Stories and Learnings from Implementations

These reports, consisting of letters and numbers, are issued every 30 or 60 minutes by airports and airfields.</p>METAR, Miami International Airport (KMIA) on March 9, 2024, at 15:00&nbsp;UTC<p>In the recently concluded data challenge hosted on <a href="https://desights.ai/challenge/list">Desights.ai</a>, participants used exploratory data analysis (EDA) and advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to enhance aviation weather forecasting accuracy. Focusing on Miami International Airport (KMIA), participants analyzed historical METAR reports spanning an entire&nbsp;decade.</p>Image showing the decoded METAR for KMIA on March 9, 2024, at 15:00 UTC, as provided by <a href="http://metar-taf.com">metar-taf.com</a><p>The challenge began with an in-depth exploration of EDA, where participants meticulously examined trends, patterns, and anomalies within the METAR data. Through this process, they gained valuable insights into Miami’s meteorological landscape, including seasonal variations and significant weather events impacting KMIA operations.</p><p>Transitioning to AI and machine learning (ML), participants developed models for precise weather prediction at KMIA. They addressed critical questions about prediction accuracy and model performance across weather phenomena. Additionally, they explored the influence of geographical and seasonal factors on prediction outcomes, aiming to enhance the applicability of their models in real-world aviation scenarios.</p> Winners Podium <p>The podium submissions exemplified ingenuity and precision in aviation weather forecasting. Participants showcased their expertise through innovative approaches, leveraging advanced machine-learning techniques to deliver accurate predictions. Let’s explore the top three submissions that stood out for their excellence and creativity in tackling this complex data challenge.</p> Andrey Bessalov — 1st&nbsp;Place <p>Andrey demonstrated a meticulous and methodologically sound approach to weather forecasting, using three critical&nbsp;stages:</p><p>1. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering: Andrey undertook an extensive data preprocessing exercise to clean and prepare the METAR data for analysis. It involved handling missing values, encoding categorical data, normalizing measurements, and converting various data types. He also applied feature engineering to extract additional information from the data, including time-based features and rolling averages.</p><p>2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Model Development: He performed an exploratory analysis to understand the characteristics of the data, such as the distribution of various weather parameters and their correlations. Patterns and anomalies in the data, like seasonal variations, were identified. Andrey developed a machine-learning model and trained it to predict METAR data for the next hour, comparing different models ( linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks) and choosing the best based on performance. He analyzed which features were most influential in predicting weather conditions and evaluated the model based on its accuracy.</p><p>3. Individual Weather Component Analysis and Final Algorithm: The project involved detailed analysis and modeling of various weather components, such as air temperature, dew point, air pressure, wind speed and direction, visibility, rain, fog, thunderstorms, and clouds. Andrey built separate Xgboost models for each component to predict future values one hour ahead. He validated the models using data from 2023, with training data from 2014 to 2022. The final step was the creation of an algorithm to process the data, create features, make predictions for individual components, and then convert these predictions into METAR format for practical use.</p> Dominikus Brian — 2nd&nbsp;Place <p>Dominikus’ primary objectives were to explore the relationships between different meteorological data, uncover statistical patterns influencing weather, and demonstrate the use of historical METAR report data in building a predictive machine-learning model.</p><p>His submission outlined essential findings from the exploratory data analysis and machine learning model development. It employed a Long-Short Term Memory Neural Network to predict next-hour weather conditions around Miami International Airport, revealing that models with shorter memory spans are generally more effective. The study faced challenges in accurately predicting wind direction and cloud types while achieving high accuracy in predicting temperature, dew point, air pressure, and visibility. Additionally, it observed yearly weather trends, such as an increase in mean temperatures and seasonal variations like stronger winds in the latter half of the year. The study also included correlation analyses showing various relationships between different weather&nbsp;factors.</p><p>His report comprehensively explored employing machine learning in weather forecasting, focusing on Miami International Airport. It highlighted the effectiveness of models with shorter memory spans and the interconnectedness of various weather factors. The insights gained are valuable for understanding meteorological dynamics specific to the airport and developing a machine-learning pipeline for weather prediction. Plans include refining the model’s efficiency and exploring its applicability to other airports, broadening the scope of the study’s utility in aviation and related&nbsp;fields.</p> Anamaria Loznianu — 3rd&nbsp;Place <p>Anamaria presented a structured approach to predicting weather conditions using METAR data. She applied predictive models, including MultiOutputRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), to forecast weather values like wind direction, speed, gusts, visibility, temperature, dew point, and pressure. The report mentioned significant discrepancies in some predictions, such as temperature, while acknowledging the better accuracy of models like RandomForestRegressor and&nbsp;LSTM.</p><p>In addition to historical data, Anamaria explored using real-time data from airports surrounding Miami to improve weather predictions. This included a novel approach of using real-time data from nearby airports to refine weather predictions for Miami. She analyzed weather patterns from eight nearby airports and examined how these patterns influenced Miami’s conditions, then aggregated the latest METAR data from nearby airports and analyzed whether weather patterns at these locations influenced Miami’s conditions.</p><p>Her report concluded that while historical data is vital for recognizing patterns, forecasting weather in the short term is most effective when combining current data with the overall direction of weather systems. While the MultiOutputRegressor showed significant discrepancies, especially in temperature predictions, the RandomForestRegressor and LSTM models delivered more accurate results with significantly lower error&nbsp;rates.</p> Interesting Facts  Data Preprocessing and&nbsp;Parsing <p>The challenge required processing approximately 90,000 METAR lines from the Miami International Airport (KMIA) spanning over ten&nbsp;years.</p> General Weather&nbsp;Trends <p>The study observed seasonal temperature variations, with Miami experiencing warm, humid summers and mild, dry winters due to its tropical monsoon climate. Rainfall is significant during the summer, while winters are the peak tourist season due to comfortable weather. The city is also susceptible to hurricanes and tropical&nbsp;storms.</p> Yearly Weather&nbsp;Trends <p>The report noted an increase in mean temperatures from an average of 25.01°C in 2014 to 26.24°C by 2023. It also highlighted seasonal variations, such as stronger winds in the second half of the year, poorer visibility in fall and winter, decreased air pressure, and more predominantly eastward wind directions towards the year-end.</p> Seasonal Analysis <p>The data showed clear seasonal patterns. The highest temperatures occurred in summer (July-August) and during late afternoons (16:00 to 18:00), while the lowest temperatures were in winter (December-January) and early mornings (6:00 to&nbsp;9:00).</p> Challenges in Predicting Certain Weather&nbsp;Features <p>Among the primary features analyzed (wind direction, wind speed, visibility, cloud types, cloud heights, temperature, dew point, and air pressure), wind direction and cloud types were the most challenging to predict accurately. In contrast, temperature, dew point, air pressure, and visibility were predicted with high accuracy.</p> 2024 Championship <p>Did you know that our reward structure has changed? The prize pool is now $10,000 for every challenge, and it pays the top 10 participants.</p><p>In addition to the monetary rewards, we’ve also revamped our points system to better recognize our top performers’ achievements.

<p>The health sector faces a staggering array of challenges and consequences in the relentless battle against cyberthreats. Surprisingly, it’s not just a battle against malicious outsiders — within healthcare organizations internal users represent 39% of all threat actors.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Human error in the forms of data loss and misuse are the most common ways internal actors pose a threat to the healthcare organizations they work for. With the average cost of a breach at $10.93 million2, it is essential to ensure that healthcare providers, employees, contractors, and partners only have access to the internal apps and systems that they need to do their jobs — and nothing more — to keep the risk of internal threats at bay.</p>

<p>Quick overview: Conventional KYC methods are becoming obsolete. These outdated approaches demand time-consuming, manual processes that are inefficient for banks and tedious for customers. But the new era of KYC is here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reusable credentials: Reusable credentials are a revolutionary verification solution where the customer only has to verify themselves once. This cutting-edge technology removes friction from operations and fortifies every touchpoint (in the branch, app, contact center, etc.), ensuring heightened security. With reusable credentials, banks can:</p>



 
 Stop fraud by reducing weak security points 



 Take the pressure off your employee&nbsp; and prevent human error 



 Create a better customer experience with seamless processes at every touch point. 
 



<p>Why this matters: This is the next step in identity verification. There is now a way to have less friction without having to sacrifice security through reusable credentials.<br></p>



<p><a href="http://chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://go.sudoplatform.com/rs/971-PEA-288/images/KYC%20eBook%202b.pdf?version=0">👀 See how reusable credentials are reshaping bank operations in our new eBook, “Identity Revolution in Banking: Combating Fraud, Enhancing Security.”</a>&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The big picture: Humans are human, which means we can make mistakes or be taken advantage of by social engineering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, the <a href="https://www.social-engineer.com/state-of-vishing-report/#:~:text=Social%2DEngineer%27s%202023%20State%20of,%2C%20network%2C%20or%20financial%20breach.">State of Vishing Report</a> found a 10% increase in compromises when the fraudulent caller was a female as opposed to a male caller. Reusable credentials instantly take care of this problem. Your customer will have a hyper-secure, encrypted credential that your employee will request.&nbsp;</p>



<p>No guesswork is involved. Your customers and employees know that the account is secure.</p>



 Dive Deeper 



 Why the Traditional KYC Methods Are Not Working 



<p></p>



<p></p>



 The Achilles’ heel of current KYC processes is its temporary nature. 



<p>Once the initial identity verification occurs during account opening, it becomes a one-time, non-reusable process. This leaves day-to-day interactions vulnerable, forcing employees to repeatedly verify customer information through methods susceptible to exploitation, such as:</p>



 
 Security questions 



 Teller judgments on IDs 



 SMS verifications 



 Over-the-phone verification. 
 



<p>Using reusable credentials allows customers to be seamlessly verified at every touch point. No reverification. No room for fraud. Only a seamless customer experience.</p>



<p></p>



 Stop Fraud with Reusable Credentials 



<p>In the continual battle against fraud, where every weak link in security can lead to losses, reusable credentials fortify FIs. Traditional KYC methods are vulnerable to social engineering and create an environment where fraud can thrive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A FI employee <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourBank/comments/19at82r/call_center_loses_1500_in_provisional_credit_to_a/">shared their story</a> showcasing that humans are unfortunately susceptible to social engineering: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“[A] member is claiming he attempted a deposit of $2,900 over the long weekend that was not processed … I thought it was a no-brainer. [The] account was [less than] 45 days old, and aside from the initial $10 deposit to open the account there was no other activity. There’s no way a supervisor would agree to PRCR. And yet, when the ticket came in, there was a comment that the Call Center’s director approved a PRCR of $1,500 “so the member can pay his bills.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sure enough, within an hour, the member pulled $800 out at another ATM. A few hours later, another $200. The next day, about a dozen or so $10 withdrawals from Cash App, and finally another ATM [withdrawal] of $330. [The] account now has less than $15.</p>



<p>Any odds on us seeing this $1,500 coming back to us? [The] call center rep feels bad because she is “normally a really good judge of character.”</p>



<p></p>



<p>The problem: Weak points of traditional security measures. Security questions, often easy targets for social engineering, can be guessed or manipulated. Bank tellers, despite their expertise, may struggle to differentiate between authentic and forged IDs. SMS-based verifications, a common practice, can expose customers to phishing attacks.</p>



<p></p>



<p>The solution: Embracing reusable credentials that close vulnerabilities for identity verification. By adopting an approach similar to the success of TSA Precheck in travel, banks can usher in a new era of fraud resistance. They provide a one-time, thorough verification during onboarding, making fraud attempts nearly impossible.</p>



<p>Fraud prevention is not just a reactive measure; it’s a company-wide initiative. Reusable credentials significantly reduce the workload associated with fraud-related projects, allowing financial institutions to reallocate resources.</p>

 Take the Pressure Off Your Employees 



<p>“Tellers are the first line of defense. It’s our job to protect your account. But we aren’t perfect. Just like any sort of defense, we make mistakes or miss things. We are human and are subject to human error.” – A teller talking about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourBank/comments/ag2aiv/bank_tellers_of_reddit_what_security_do_you_guys/">their experience.</a></p>



<p>The heartbeat of any financial institution is its dedicated workforce, tirelessly navigating the delicate balance between service and security. Traditional KYC and identity verification require manual processes and diverse verification methods that put immense pressure on employees to stop fraud while providing a great customer experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reusable credentials revolutionize this situation by offering a streamlined solution that alleviates the pressure on bank employees. Employees are freed from repeatedly needing to validate customer information with a one-time, thorough verification during onboarding. This shift enhances operations and empowers employees to focus on delivering excellent customer experience.</p>

 FAQ: Reusable Credentials and Decentralized Identity&nbsp; 



What is the reusable credentials process?




 
 The First Identity Verification A decentralized identity (DI) system verifies a customer’s identity during account creation using robust authentication methods. 
 







 
 Creation of Reusable Credentials: Once the identity is verified, the DI system generates a reusable credential. These credentials are encrypted, making them tamper-proof and incredibly secure. 
 







 
 Customer-Controlled Data: Unlike conventional identity systems where the FIs oversee and store user data, decentralized identity transfers this to the customer. For banks, this translates to customers possessing their credentials securely stored on their devices, offering the convenience of storing and presenting credentials directly within your banking app and interfaces. 
 







 
 Persistent Verification: Reusable credentials stop the need for repetitive verification processes. Whether logging into an app, contacting the call center, or visiting a branch, customers simply present their reusable credentials as irrefutable proof of identity. 
 




What are the benefits for banks to use reusable credentials?
 
 Enhanced Security: Reusable credentials reduce reliance on traditional methods prone to fraud, replacing security questions susceptible to social engineering or SMS-based verifications vulnerable to phishing. 
 



 
 Frictionless Customer Experience: Reusable credentials ensure a seamless and frictionless experience for bank customers to enjoy continuous and secure interactions across various touchpoints. 
 




How can banks use reusable credentials to prevent fraud?
 
 The Highest Level of Security: Reusable credentials use advanced cryptographic techniques to make information tamper-proof and nearly eliminate the risk of fraud. 
 



 
 Absolute Proof of Identity: Once a customer’s identity is verified and turned into a reusable credential, it becomes irrefutable proof of their identity, minimizing the risk of social engineering or phishing. 
 



 
 Strengthen Security Points: Reusable credentials limit places where fraudulent activities can occur, minimizing potential attack points found in traditional verification methods. 
 




Are reusable credentials being used in other industries?
<p>Reusable credentials are gaining traction and being explored in various industries beyond finance, including:</p>



 
 Healthcare 



 Government services 



 Education 



 Farming 



 Mining 



 Travel and hospitality 



 Retail and e-commerce 



 Human resources and employment 
 




<p></p>



<p>Although widespread adoption is still evolving, various pilot programs and collaborations are underway to explore the potential of decentralized identity and reusable credentials in solving challenges and improving user experiences across industries.</p>

				  Together, Indicio and SITA are changing how we travel —&nbsp;and in doing so, how we can share and trust data to make the world a better place.&nbsp;  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Heather Dahl</p>
<p>I’m proud to announce that Indicio’s partnership with SITA is deepening with a <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/sita-takes-the-lead-in-indicio-series-a-funding-round-cementing-a-partnership-delivering-trusted-digital-identity-for-travel/">new and important investment</a> in our company.</p>
<p>Both companies have been on an transformative journey for the past four years: making seamless travel a reality. We have developed new solutions to the challenge of digitizing identity documents; we have set new standards for biometrics, data privacy and protection; we have won some of the most prestigious awards in the digital identity space; and, most of all, we solved one of the most challenging trust problems in the world: how to pre-clear passengers for immigration ahead of their arrival and get them across borders in seconds.</p>
<p>In delivering the world’s first implementation of a Digital Travel Credential (DTC) following ICAO standards, in Aruba in March 2023, we drew a map of the future. It’s a seamless world, where verifiable identity and data makes interacting with each other smoother, faster, and more secure — because we now have genuine confidence that identity and data can be trusted.</p>
<p>For airports and airlines and governments, that future is here, it’s happening right now; we’re implementing it. That is why our partnership with SITA is so exciting. It means global reach at the start of a new era. For travelers, it’s the end of rushing to wait. We’re freeing data to do what it can do when it’s trusted: Speed everything up, make everything simple.</p>
<p>But the technology we developed for the DTC is transformational for every industry, business operation, and service where identity and data need to be authenticated and trusted and where paper-based processes and traditional digital approaches are getting in the way of making things simple, efficient, and fast.</p>
<p>Because we’ve created the most powerful form of digital identity, that power can be used in so many innovative ways, big and small, to create better processes, products, and customer experiences. And because our solutions work on any system, we have an organic way to integrate identity and data across all sectors, creating spectacular new opportunities for innovation.</p>
<p>Travel is leading the way —&nbsp;but we are delivering exciting use cases from agriculture to AI, education to finance that are not far behind. Innovation in one use case feeds innovation in another. Suddenly, a landscape of borders — not just geographic and national — but sector and vertical, can be easily crossed. The digital world created by the internet is open when you can authenticate and trust. This is what we’re doing. And we’re tremendously excited about this investment because it helps to accelerate our development roadmap to deliver these benefits to all.</p>
<p>Indicio has distinguished itself by making our customers’ ideas become a reality. Our team members are world-class visioneers. So watch this space as we accelerate — and drop us a line if you’d like us to make your vision for a smarter, smoother, safer world real too.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Heather Dahl</p>

To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF80 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 20k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Passive DF applies to OCEAN locked on Ethereum mainnet. Predictoor DF applies to activity on Oasis Sapphire. Volume DF applies to data assets published on Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/discover/networks">Here</a> is more information about Ocean deployments to networks.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by asset’s DCV * (% stake in asset) *DCV_multiplier.

The value DCV_multiplier is 20.1% for Predictoor feeds, and 0.1% otherwise.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean, DF and Predictoor <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>In partnership with Mastercard Open Banking, with services provided by Finicity, a Mastercard company, Fannie Mae continues to work toward improving access to affordable housing with secure banking-powered technologies, speeding up the application process for lenders and reducing the need for manual document preparation.</p>



<p>In addition to helping lenders validate assets and assess a borrower’s rent payment history and cash flow, <a href="https://singlefamily.fanniemae.com/applications-technology/desktop-underwriter-desktop-originator/asset-reports?utm_campaign=pte-sf-duenh-202403&amp;utm_source=vanity&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=awa-van-noa-len-o-n&amp;utm_term=len">Fannie Mae’s Desktop Underwriter® (DU®) validation service</a> gives lenders the power to verify a borrowers’ income and employment information using a single 12-month asset report. This digital enhancement is saving lenders time while enhancing the borrower experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Demand for a better mortgage process&nbsp; 



<p>Traditionally, borrowers have been asked to manually collect and share stacks of sensitive income documents with mortgage loan officers, a time-consuming and less secure process that creates inefficiency for both the borrower and the lender.&nbsp;</p>



 A complete digital verification solution for mortgage lenders&nbsp; 



<p>DU provides a digital option that simplifies and removes friction from the application process. When applying for a mortgage, borrowers can access Finicity’s user-friendly <a href="https://www.finicity.com/connect/">Connect</a> consent flow to link their bank accounts, enabling their data to be easily shared with the lender.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With one report from Finicity, DU can help lenders validate a borrower’s asset, income and employment information while simultaneously analyzing cash flow and rent payment history to help approve more potential homeowners.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>All the verifications needed to process a mortgage application can be conducted on the spot, without paperwork.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fannie Mae’s latest innovation leverages <a href="https://www.finicity.com/mortgage/">Mortgage Verification Service</a> (MVS) from Finicity as a leading report supplier to power the verifications needed to process a mortgage application. &nbsp;</p>



 
 Fannie Mae’s Digital Verification Solution requires an asset report of 12 months or more to run 



 Lenders must request that this feature be <a href="https://singlefamily.fanniemae.com/form/single-source-activation">turned on</a> 
 



<blockquote><p>“With Desktop Underwriter® (DU®), lenders can now get even more benefits from using a single 12-month asset report. We continue to look for ways to help lenders streamline their validation processes and improve the borrower experience, and this latest enhancement helps them do just that.”&nbsp;</p>Peter Skarnulis, Fannie Mae Vice President, Business Account Management Solutions</blockquote>

When we inspire others to understand and value women's inclusion, we forge a better world.” Needless to say, Ping Identity is both thrilled and honored to inspire inclusivity among our coworkers, peers, and greater network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get a better understanding of what inclusivity means to people at Ping, I spoke with several female team members to get their perspectives on contemporary gender issues. I’m grateful to these women for sharing their hard-won insights learned from working in the tech space.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>In this episode of the SSI Orbit Podcast, host Mathieu Glaude, alongside Hakan Yildiz from <a href="https://www.accenture.com/">Accenture</a> and Vladimir Simjanoski from <a href="https://www.blokverse.com/">Blokverse</a>, engage in an insightful examination of the intricate world of digital credential protocols, including Aries, OpenID4VC, ISO, and KERI. This episode is a treasure trove of insights on the future of digital identities, focusing on interoperability, privacy, and combating challenges like deepfakes.</p>
<p>The discussion begins by comparing digital credential exchange protocols and their applicability in varying contexts, from government-issued digital identities to private-sector applications. A highlight is the exploration of the architectural models—server-client vs. peer-to-peer—and their impact on the scalability and privacy of digital credentials.</p>
<p>Privacy considerations take center stage, especially concerning surveillance and data-sharing autonomy. The episode also tackles the critical issue of deepfakes, proposing enhanced content authenticity through digital credentials as a solution.</p>
<p>Interoperability emerges as a central theme, with a vision of wallets supporting multiple protocols to facilitate diverse interactions between issuers, holders, and verifiers. This flexibility is seen as key to the widespread adoption of digital credentials.</p>
<p>Mathieu invites listeners to actively participate in shaping the future of digital credential protocols by joining the Trust over IP Foundation’s Credential Exchange Protocol Task Force.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This episode of the SSI Orbit Podcast is a must-listen for anyone interested in the future of digital identities and the role of technology in securing and verifying digital credentials.</p>

<p>Startups build ad-hoc IAM systems, a tangled mess of spreadsheets, emails, and memory traces in the brains of the team members. As organizations grow, the tangles grow. Think about it:</p>
 
 When a new hire joins, how easy is it to get them productive? How long does it take until they’ve been given access to everything they need?&nbsp; 
 When it’s time for a compliance audit, do you need to sweat over spreadsheets, check multiple app interfaces, and comb through email chains, hoping you don’t miss something?&nbsp; 
 Is “Shadow IT” growing? When well-meaning employees start using convenient new apps, are they bypassing IT? Or does IT maintain visibility and control without bureaucracy?&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Is offboarding easy? When someone leaves, can you quickly cut access to all the apps they used while retaining access to the data they created?&nbsp; 
 
<p>Cheer up! Things will get worse.</p>
<p>As your company grows and your tech stack gets more complex, whatever chaos you had will get worse. Why?</p>
 
 You’re juggling multiple playbooks. One spreadsheet for onboarding, a checklist for audits, a half-remembered process for software requests. 
 Time becomes essential. Onboarding tasks, regular access reviews, or even handling forgotten password resets shouldn’t rely on your memory. 
 Your processes aren’t static. New apps get adopted, rules change, one-off issues reveal cracks in your workflows. Updating your playbooks becomes a time-consuming chore. 
 Your organization changes. New groups appear. Old groups merge. Consultants, temps, and suppliers need access 
 Collaboration is a nightmare. Chasing down other teams to get tasks done, sending reminders, consolidating responses, and hoping they update the results in the right place… it turns your attempted efficiency into another massive time suck. 
 
<p>The YeshID Difference: One Playbook, Total Control</p>
<p>Now imagine this:</p>
 
 Effortless orchestration: A new employee begins, and your centralized YeshID playbook spins into action. Accounts are created, exploiting the best available integrations. For anything without an integration, YeshID creates tasks with clear owners and deadlines. Task reminders? Automatically sent to the right department. You get progress reports, not a growing sense of dread. 
 Compliance is no sweat: Audit looming? YeshID pulls who has access to what and current settings across every supported app, then surveys users and managers to verify who truly needs what access. Reports become accurate and stress-free. 
 Offboarding without the panic: Employee departs, and your playbook cuts off access to integrated apps instantly. It also generates tasks with clear owners for everything else, ensuring no security holes slip through the cracks. 
 A playbook that evolves with you: YeshID is your adaptable IT brain. It leverages your IAM, automates manual steps, sends timely reminders, and handles approvals across teams. Change a process? Update the playbook, and everyone instantly follows the latest version. 
 
<p>Sound too good to be true? Let YeshID be your partner in keeping your identity and access management realm simple, effective, and secure. <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">Get YeshID Onboard for free</a> and start today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Anonyome Labs team has headed to Washington, D.C., for the biggest credit union advocacy event of the year—the Governmental Affairs Conference, March 3–7, 2024!</p>



<p>If you’re attending the conference in D.C., we invite you to meet with us to learn how to streamline your operations, boost member satisfaction, and stop fraud with the revolutionary verification solution, reusable credentials.</p>



<p>Our sales team will be on hand to explain how reusable credentials are replacing inefficient and risky conventional Know Your Customer (KYC) methods with a frictionless system in which customers only have to verify themselves once.</p>



<p>Reusable credentials leverage ground-breaking decentralized identity and blockchain technology to create a cryptographically protected&nbsp;digital ID that is persistent, irrefutable, and customer-controlled. The same credential ecosystem creates proof of identity for any customer interaction with the credit union.</p>



<p>While planning your visit to D.C. and all of the key sessions and events, why not schedule a one-on-one meeting with the team from Anonyome Labs, where we’ll show you exactly how reusable credentials can work for your institution and, as a bonus, give you access to our new eBook, “Identity Revolution in Banking: Combating Fraud, Enhancing Security.” This valuable tool will be a great resource to take back home to your credit union team for review.</p>



<p>We are excited to also share that on Day 4 of the conference (March 6), you can catch our team during an exclusive interview with Anonyome Labs’ VP of Sales, Matt Ure, on CU Broadcast Hosted by Mike Lawson.</p>



<p>Anonyome Labs is proud to be a sponsor of the first America’s Credit Unions GAC, the massive in-person and online event highlighting the meaningful work credit unions do to improve the financial well-being of their members and communities. This year’s program includes keynotes by former U.K. Prime Minister, The Rt Hon Theresa May MP, and renowned actor-humanitarian Gary Sinise.</p>



<p>Don’t miss this important opportunity to advance the credit union industry with the latest innovations and offerings. &nbsp;</p>



<p>You’ll find the team from Anonyome Labs in the industry hall of the Walter E. Washington Convention Center every day of the conference, March 3 to 7. Come say hi!</p>



<p><a href="https://promo.sudoplatform.com/americas-credit-unions-gac/">Follow this link to book a meeting on site in D.C.!</a><br><br></p>



<p><a href="https://anonyome.com/">Anonyome Labs</a> is the leader in proactive identity protection technologies. From verifiable credentials to VPNs and encrypted communications, we leverage our cryptography and blockchain technology expertise to take data privacy and security to the next level. Check out our podcast, <a href="https://privacyfiles.com/">Privacy Files</a>, to hear what your peers and experts are saying about the state of member and consumer privacy in real time.</p>

 Bot detection is essential for identifying nonhuman traffic on websites, mobile apps, and APIs, protecting against threats like account takeovers, transaction abuse, and denial of service attacks. With the bot detection market expected to grow from $667 million in 2023 to $3.6 billion by 2033, at an 18.3% CAGR, according to <a href="https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/bot-security-market">Future Market Insights</a>, the demand for such technologies is rapidly increasing. This growth is driven by the anticipated rise in beneficial bots, such as AI agents and search engine crawlers, and harmful bots, which can cause significant disruptions and fraud. To address these challenges, leading providers are developing advanced solutions beyond traditional firewalls, incorporating behavioral analysis and device risk signals to identify and block malicious bots more effectively. 



 







 Evolving Threats and Modern Defenses Against Bots 



<p>The bot detection solutions market is evolving rapidly to address the growing sophistication of bots and the expansion of threat vectors. Vendors leveraging behavioral signals are well-positioned to dominate a market facing complex challenges from advanced bot activities and diverse threats. As fraudsters employ artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to launch sophisticated bot attacks, solution providers are countering with passive detection methods that emphasize user experience while effectively identifying bots. According to the <a href="https://www.imperva.com/resources/resource-library/reports/bad-bot-report/">Imperva Bad Bot Report</a>, about two-thirds of bots in 2022 were highly sophisticated malicious bots, the highest level ever recorded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Modern defenses include behavioral biometrics and device signals, moving from traditional firewalls and CAPTCHAs to more subtle, low-friction detection techniques like analyzing mouse movements and keystroke dynamics. The scope of bot detection has broadened from focusing mainly on account takeovers and transaction abuse to addressing emerging threats like programmatic ad fraud, social media fraud, and asset theft in gaming. With the rise of beneficial AI agents, distinguishing between helpful and harmful bots has become paramount, highlighting the importance of sophisticated bot detection solutions that can navigate the nuanced landscape of modern cyber threats.</p>



 The Importance of Bot Detection Across Use Cases 



<p>Bot detection serves multiple use cases, including thwarting and identifying account takeovers, web scraping, transaction abuse, programmatic ad fraud, and denial of service (DoS) attacks, such as:</p>



 
 Account Takeover Protection 



 Web Scraping Detection 



 Transaction Abuse Prevention

 The Urgent Need for Bot Detection 



<p>Businesses across various sectors, particularly the advertising industry, are becoming acutely aware of the financial losses attributed to malicious bot activities. Advertisers’ growing concerns over the legitimacy of website impressions have driven publishers towards adopting bot detection technologies, highlighting a pivotal shift towards ensuring the integrity of digital advertising practices. This awareness has led to an escalated demand for sophisticated bot detection solutions to safeguard against escalating financial threats. The evolution of bots, marked by their sophistication and the diversification of threat vectors beyond traditional attacks like denial of service (DoS) and account takeovers (ATO), has made them a tool for exploitation in more complex fraud schemes. Consequently, the necessity for accurate and authentic web traffic metrics has never been more critical.&nbsp;</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.kasada.io/2023-state-of-bot-mitigation/">96% of Organizations Faced Financial Losses Due to Bots</a>: Leading to company-wide mandates to reduce the risk of bot attacks such as account takeovers and transaction abuse.&nbsp; 



 $84 Billion in Digital Advertising Fraud: In 2023, <a href="https://www.ana.net/miccontent/show/id/er-tv-may19-whiteops">digital advertising fraud amounted to $84 billion</a> and is projected to escalate to $172 billion by 2028 due to rising bot activity. 



 69% Increase in CTV Bot Fraud: In 2022, bot fraud in Connected TV (CTV) surged, <a href="https://doubleverify.com/newsroom/ctv-ad-fraud-surges-with-a-69-increase-in-bot-fraud-in-2022-and-significant-growth-in-ctv-fraud-schemes">leading to inflated video ad impressions</a>. This rise is part of broader trends in emerging fraud vectors, including programmatic ad fraud and AI-generated fraud on social media. 



 <a href="https://artsci.wustl.edu/ampersand/are-bots-winning-war-control-social-media">Estimated 68% of Twitter Users are Bots</a>: This highlights concerns over first-party fraud risk and misinformation spread, urging social media companies to implement robust bot mitigation strategies. 



 <a href="https://cmosurvey.org/">57% of Marketing Campaign Spending on Digital Channels in 2022</a>: With rapid growth expected, advertisers are emphasizing the need for bot detection to ensure traffic legitimacy. 



 Publishers Moving to First-Party Ad Strategies: Due to Chrome’s cookie deprecation, there’s a heightened demand from publishers for accurate user metrics. 
 



 How Bot Detection Works 



<p>Upon the arrival of website traffic, a web application firewall serves as the first line of defense as traffic progresses through the login flow – detection analysis is informed by passive signals such as mouse and keystroke dynamics.&nbsp;</p>

 Empowering Korea’s Central and Local Governments: Driving Blockchain Innovation in Government Infrastructure <p>Cities worldwide are competing to become hubs for blockchain innovation, and the City of Daegu, South Korea, is among those taking proactive steps to position itself as a leading blockchain city.</p><p>Daegu is spearheading efforts to advance the ABB (Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Big Data) sector, recognized as the key driver of future growth. With a focus on bolstering blockchain technology, Daegu has established a Blockchain Technology Innovation Support Center. The center, launched in December 2023 through a public initiative by the Ministry of Science and ICT, is dedicated to nurturing projects.</p><p>Daegu Embarks on Aergo Blockchain Mainnet</p><p>Venturing into blockchain technology, <a href="https://plus.hankyung.com/apps/newsinside.view?aid=2023112750785&amp;category=&amp;sns=y">Daegu has established public blockchain networks based on Aergo and Avalanche</a>. The goal is to integrate diverse blockchain services onto a single city-level infrastructure, paving the way for the city’s evolution into a comprehensive blockchain city. Setting itself apart from other municipalities, Daegu is prioritizing the creation of blockchain-powered services including:<br>- Non-Fungible Tokens(NFTs), <br>- Security Token Offerings(STOs), and <br>- Decentralized Identity Verification(DID)</p><p>In line with this initiative, Aergo Foundation and the City of Daegu are actively fostering the development of Proof-of-Concept cases including intelligent mobility supply chains, electronic prescriptions, and herbal product authenticity certification.</p><p>Rising Trend of Central and Local Governments Embracing Blockchain</p><p>Daegu leads the charge as an increasing number of local governments explore integrating blockchain technology into public services. Municipal authorities are actively exploring blockchain’s potential for administrative tasks like document authentication, public records maintenance, and voting systems. By embracing blockchain, local governments aim to enhance transparency, streamline bureaucratic processes, and elevate the effectiveness of governmental functions.</p><p>Leveraging the experiences from past cases, the Aergo Foundation and its key partners, including Blocko and CCCV, are spearheading efforts to develop more comprehensive and competitive use cases based on the Aergo mainnet. Furthermore, the Aergo Foundation has been actively participating in Korea’s government-led Blockchain Trust Framework(K-BTF). This case further reinforces Aergo’s commitment to establishing a presence in the public blockchain service sector. More details regarding K-BTF will be released&nbsp;soon.</p><p>Previous Aergo and Blocko Cases with the Korean Central and Local Governments</p>  Blockchain Voting: Gyeonggi-do, one of the largest provinces of Korea, implemented a blockchain-based voting system to collect resident input on community projects, resulting in a successful vote with 9,000 participants casting their votes through both online and offline channels. With the increasing interest in blockchain-based voting, we anticipate witnessing the development of more cases in this&nbsp;area.  Blockchain-based real estate administration system(land registry): Blocko implemented a blockchain solution for land registry in South Korea. The system enabled financial bodies to use government data by sharing it on a ledger across Jeju Province. Major Korean banks including Shinhan Financial Group, Korea Exchange Bank, and Korea Development Bank participated in the initiative. The banks conducted all real estate transactions based on the blockchain.  Blockchain-based micropayment: Korea’s central bank, the Bank of Korea, explored blockchain-based micropayment settlement infrastructure. Blocko provided a blockchain system for transaction validation, participant authentication, and wallet management by creating transaction processes and mobile implementations centered around the micropayment solution. The project aimed to assess the efficiency of microtransaction settlements on distributed networks in expediting transaction outputs and reducing&nbsp;costs.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/empowering-koreas-central-and-local-governments-driving-blockchain-innovation-in-government-91730fd4cd7b">Empowering Korea’s Central and Local Governments: Driving Blockchain Innovation in Government…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Hundreds of keynotes and sessions in six tracks are awaiting you. While the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/agenda">agenda</a> is already far developed, there still will be some additions. Anyway, time to have a look at the agenda. I did and selected ten favorite sessions from that long list.</p>
<p>In the morning of June 4th, one of the pre-conference sessions is the EIC2024 Decentralized ID Deployment Bootcamp. The first part of it is about <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5479/1">Decentralized ID Basics, Trends &amp; Adoption: Strategic Insights Sprint for Executives</a>. Run by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3037">Dominik Beron</a>, CEO of walt.id, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/1568">Drs. Jacoba C. Sieders</a>, independent consultant, and me, we will look at where decentralized identity stands and how we expect this to evolve. The session will provide you with the understanding about everything you need to know about decentralized identity for the many other conference sessions around this topic, including eIDAS 2.0 and the EUDI wallet. A great start to the conference and a good reason for travelling in early.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of June 4th, you must not miss the keynote of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3419">Dr. Moritz Heuberger</a>, Advisor to the German Federal Ministry of the Interior and Community, on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5490">eIDAS 2.0 in Germany: Progress, Impact, Challenges</a>. With the European Parliament just recently voting for eIDAS 2.0, it is now about making it a reality.</p>
<p>Another highlight session on this subject is the panel on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5510/1">Latest on eIDAS Legislation and What it Means for People, Business and Government</a>. Here, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3462">Dr. Rob Brand</a> from the Netherlands Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy, Dr. Moritz Heuberger, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3453">Vedran Lalic</a>, Head of Office at European Parliament, and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3243">Viky Manaila</a>, Trust Services Director at Intesi Group, will look at the eIDAS regulations and its impact.</p>
<p>Another important theme at EIC is what I have named “AIdentity”, the intersection of AI and Identity. One of the sessions you should attend is <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5686/1">Redefining Human Identity in the AI Era: From Digital Evolution to AI Integration</a>. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/775">Dr. Scott David</a> will lead a panel including <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/368">Joe Andrieu</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/709">Joni Brennan</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3447">Wenjing Chu</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3515">Lynn Parker Dupree</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3507">Anil John</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/2786">Nick Mothershaw</a>, and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/626">Drummond Reed</a>. AIdentity is one of the big challenges to address, with digital doubles (or twins) acting on our behalf.</p>
<p>One more session around Decentralized Identity you must not miss is <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5590/1">The Wallets we Want</a>. There will be wallets. But will this be the wallets we (the consumers) want? Listen to <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/2874">Daniel Goldscheider</a> from the OpenWallet Foundation, Anil John, Technical Director of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3241">Paolo de Rosa</a>, Policy Officer at the European Commission, and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3556">Dr. Pramod Varma</a>, CTO of the EkStep Foundation and former Chief Architect of Aadhaar.</p>
<p>The intersection of traditional CIAM and future decentralized identity will be the topic of the panel Panel: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5602/3">Decentralized Identity for Onboarding and CIAM</a>. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/1582">Daniel Buchner</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3513">Nick Lambert</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3129">Rob Otto,</a> and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3554">Nick Price</a> will look at how CIAM can benefit from decentralized identity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/1005">Martin Sandren</a>, IAM Product Lead at IKEA, will talk on June 6th about <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5608/2">Passkeys in the Enterprise</a>. This is a talk from practice about passkeys, a means for authenticating to services that is becoming increasingly popular.</p>
<p>Another brilliant speaker is <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3401">Emilie van der Lande</a>. She will talk about <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5614/1">AI's Shadow Realm: Navigating the Ethical Abyss</a>. Her talk is about the multifaceted ethical, social and technical challenges that emerge as AI systems become increasingly integral to our daily lives.</p>
<p>As many know, I’m an advocate of policy-based access control (PBAC), authorization, and just-in-time access. In the panel <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5615/2">Why Authorization Standardization is Imperative</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/924">Allan Foster</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/675">David Brossard</a>, and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/589">Gerry Gebel</a> will talk about standardization for authorization and how to finally deliver on the promise that XACML once held.</p>
<p>While EIC 2024 is at the forefront of the global Identity Management evolution, you will also find a lot of down-to-earth topics on the agenda. One I want to highlight is <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5699/2">Best Practices for Resynchronizing AD and Entra ID After Forest Recovery</a>. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3542">Jorge de Almeida Pinto</a> will talk about this. In an age of ever-increasing cyberattacks, we must prepare for disaster. Thus, we must improve our recovery skills.</p>
<p>EIC 2024, as always, stands for both though leadership and best practices. Have a look at the agenda and don’t miss the prime discount – book latest on March 8th to benefit from the special price. EIC, as always, will be a fully hybrid event. If you ever can’t join in Berlin or not for the full four days, you still can join EIC and enjoy the great sessions and speakers.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Small</a></p> There is no such thing as Privacy 
<p>In 1999, the then CEO of Sun Microsystem Scott McNealy famously said, "<a href="https://www.wired.com/1999/01/sun-on-privacy-get-over-it/">You have zero privacy anyway. Get over it</a>."&nbsp; In 2008, the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7174760.stm">TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson published his bank account details</a> after rubbishing the furore over the loss of 25 million people's personal details on two computer discs and subsequently lost money.&nbsp; Now we have reams of data protection regulations and laws, but was Scott McNealy right?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1:&nbsp;An image generated by AI - Is this the future of privacy on the internet?</p>
 What is Privacy? 
<p>Different groups of people and societies consider different aspects of their life to be private. For example, while there has been concern that teenagers don’t appreciate the privacy implications of what they post on social media, a <a href="https://www.dhi.ac.uk/san/waysofbeing/data/communities-murphy-marwick-2014.pdf">UK study</a> found “…[they] are less disturbed by abstract invasions of privacy by government agencies and corporations than the very real and ever-present experience of trying to negotiate privacy in light of nosy parents.”</p>
<p>In Europe, the notion of privacy developed to counter the way governments had used personal data to identify and oppress individuals during the first half of the twentieth century. This led to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights - “<a href="https://fra.europa.eu/en/law-reference/european-convention-human-rights-article-8-0#:~:text=1%20Everyone%20has%20the%20right,his%20home%20and%20his%20correspondence.">Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence</a>.”</p>
<p>This legislation was conceived when only governments had the resources to collect and process data about large numbers of people and punched cards were state-of-the-art data processing technology.</p>
 GDPR, Schrems II and EU-US Data Privacy Framework 
<p>EU data protection has evolved over time. In 1995 <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A31995L0046">EU Directive (EC/95/46)</a> was enacted to enable the free flow of personal information between member states. In 2018 this was superseded by the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679">EU General Data Protection Regulation</a>.&nbsp; In 2020 a law student, Maximilian Schrems, brought a case against Facebook objecting to Facebook transferring his personal data to the US. The so called <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2020/652073/EPRS_ATA(2020)652073_EN.pdf">Schrems II judgement</a> invalidated the the EU-US Data Protection Shield and led to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework which was <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/eu-us-data-transfers_en">approved by the European Commission on 10th July 2023</a>.</p>
<p>This long running saga revolved around access by the US Government to personal data of EU residents and whether the safeguards around the use of this data were equivalent in the US to those in the EU.&nbsp; So, it was really all about government access.</p>
<p>These regulations have obliged organizations and cloud service providers to adopt complex technical and legal measures to protect the personal data that they hold.</p>
<p>Properly protecting this data is a good thing but does it ensure privacy?&nbsp; Is it any more effective than the toilet brush in Figure 1?</p>
 Data is the New Capital 
<p>The last twenty years have seen a massive explosion in the amount of data that can be collected, stored, and processed.&nbsp; Digital technology and the internet have made this possible and cloud services have made this affordable.&nbsp; Data analytics, Machine Learning and AI, in turn, have made this data extremely valuable.&nbsp; Data is the new capital.</p>
<p>Data has always been a valuable asset. The Rothschild’s family fortune was initially made by arranging to be the first to know the outcome of the battle of Waterloo.&nbsp; Analysis of deaths and disease in the 18th and 19th centuries underpinned financial services such as life insurance and annuities.</p>
<p>Although social media is often cited as the cause of the data explosion, its roots can be traced earlier.</p>
<p>In 1989 a husband-and-wife team set up a <a href="https://www.dunnhumby.com/united-kingdom/">data analytics company</a> in their home in Chiswick in London. Their approach involved understanding how to retain customers by analyzing their shopping behavior—what they referred to as being&nbsp;“voyeurs of the shopping basket.” &nbsp;&nbsp;This led to the development of customer loyalty cards.</p>
<p>The data collected by these cards provide the retailer with a deep insight into the buying habits of their customers. This data helps them to optimize the products stocked in individual stores, to identify premium customers, and, <a href="https://www.predictiveanalyticsworld.com/machinelearningtimes/target-really-predict-teens-pregnancy-inside-story/3566/">it is claimed</a>, even work out when a customer is pregnant.</p>
<p>At the start of the COVID pandemic, UK supermarkets used this data to identify and offer support to vulnerable customers before the government.</p>
<p>The person using these cards agrees to provide intimate details of their lives in return for some loyalty benefits. For retail customers, these details include dietary habits, indicators of their health problems through the purchase of off-the-shelf medication and their sexual activity.&nbsp; For hospitality cards, the data provides insights into the card holder’s travel, location, preferences, and companions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, people can choose to reveal their personal information in return for some rewards and data protection laws obliging the organizations that collect this data to protect it and limit how it is used.</p>
 Anonymity 
<p>While people knowingly disclose some personal data there is also a large amount of data about them that they may not be aware of. &nbsp;For example, the internet contains millions of images of peoples’ faces uploaded to social media, published on news websites, and other open sources.&nbsp; This includes people who may not have been the main subject of a photo but who were in the background.&nbsp; This data can be used by AI facial recognition technology to identify individuals from data that they did not even know existed.&nbsp; Is this fair and if so, how should we use this data?</p>
<p>The firm <a href="https://www.clearview.ai/">Clearview AI</a> has developed a facial recognition system that they claim can help law enforcement to identify suspects, witnesses, and victims.&nbsp; They also claim this technology has helped find child predators, rescue victims, and track down the suspects involved in the Capitol Riots.</p>
<p>These are laudable aims but not every country’s data privacy laws support this approach. In 2022, the UK Information Commissioners Office (ICO) fined Clearview AI £7.5M for allegedly unlawfully storing facial images.&nbsp; In November 2023, this fine was overturned in a <a href="https://assets.caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukftt/grc/2023/819/ukftt_grc_2023_819.pdf">judgement by the First Tier Tribunal</a>.&nbsp; The ICO is now <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2023/11/information-commissioner-seeks-permission-to-appeal-clearview-ai-inc-ruling/">seeking permission to appeal</a> this judgement.&nbsp; There are <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/news/national-news/2023/decision-austrian-sa-against-clearview-ai-infringements-articles-5-6-9-27_en">similar disputes within the EU</a>.</p>
<p>The Light of Other Days, a&nbsp;2000 science fiction novel&nbsp;written by&nbsp;Stephen Baxter, based on a synopsis by&nbsp;Arthur C. Clarke examines the impact on society of a quantum-based technology that allowed anyone to see and hear what was happening anywhere and at any time. This shattered all normal concepts of privacy. When people realized that they can be observed and can observe others without their knowledge it profoundly changed their behavior. While this allowed the perpetrators of crimes to be correctly identified and politicians’ plots to be uncovered, it altered society in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>Today, the internet contains a vast amount of publicly available data about everyone as well as a history of everything they wrote and liked on social media – how will this change us?</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — February 21st to March&nbsp;4th <p>Welcome to the latest Veriscope Regulatory Recap. In this edition, we dive into Taiwan’s upcoming digital asset regulations, Russia’s FATF assessment, the US’s legislative push on crypto reporting, and the UK’s steps towards regulating stablecoins and staking services. Join us as we navigate these global shifts in the crypto regulatory landscape.</p> Global Crypto Regulatory Shifts <p>Around the globe, countries are revisiting their regulatory stances on cryptocurrencies, marking a period of significant adaptation in response to the digital asset market’s expansion.</p><p>In Taiwan, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) is preparing to present new digital asset regulations by September 2024, focusing on investor protection and market integrity. This move is part of Taiwan’s broader effort to address the challenges and opportunities presented by the integration of digital assets into the traditional financial ecosystem.</p><p>Another major development over the last two weeks came from Russia, as its standing with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has shifted due to perceived gaps in crypto oversight. Reportedly, the FATF’s assessment points to the need for clearer guidelines and definitions within Russia’s regulatory framework to monitor and control digital financial transactions effectively.</p><p>In North America, the United States is witnessing legislative efforts aimed at refining the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and related services. Recent proposals challenge existing guidance on financial institutions’ reporting of crypto assets and seek to bolster the Secret Service’s capabilities in investigating crypto-related cybercrimes.</p><p>Meanwhile, the UK is advancing towards implementing cryptocurrency regulations, with a focus on stablecoins and staking services.</p>(<a href="https://x.com/shyftnetwork/status/1761086134405255416?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>These developments highlight a global trend towards recalibrating regulatory frameworks to better accommodate the unique aspects of digital assets. As countries grapple with the complexities of crypto regulation, the outcomes of these efforts will likely shape the future of digital&nbsp;finance.</p> Taiwan Sets September Deadline for Comprehensive Crypto Regulation <p>Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission is gearing up to introduce a draft of new digital asset regulations in September 2024, marking a significant step towards regulating the burgeoning digital asset market. The draft, as outlined by FSC Chairman Huang Tien-mu, aims to bolster market regulation and investor safety amidst concerns over the potential for fraud within the digital currency&nbsp;space.</p><p>The proposed legislation, including the Virtual Asset Management Bill introduced in October, seeks to enhance customer protection and industry oversight, imposing stiff penalties for non-compliance.</p><p>Speaking of its possible impact on Taiwan’s crypto ecosystem, clearer regulations may attract more institutional investors, fostering a safer and more stable investment environment. On the downside, stringent measures and the potential for heavy fines could dampen innovation, especially among startups and smaller entities struggling with compliance costs.</p> US House Committee Challenges SEC&nbsp;Guidance <p>The US House Financial Services Committee has shown majority support to repeal the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121), which mandates financial institutions to list customers’ crypto assets on their balance sheets. This guidance, criticized for potentially inflating balance sheets and hindering banks from engaging in digital asset custody, faces opposition for its implications on the sector’s operational dynamics.</p><p>Critics argue that SAB 121 limits traditional financial institutions’ participation in the burgeoning crypto market, especially in the context of the SEC’s approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs, predominantly custodied by non-bank entities. On the flip side, proponents of the guidance advocate for its role in clarifying custody responsibilities amid the volatile crypto landscape.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-crypto-travel-rule-compliance-in-japan">A Guide to Crypto Travel Rule Compliance in&nbsp;Japan</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-philippines">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in the Philippines</a></p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>In the vast expanse of the digital world, we’re drawn back to a place that feels familiar yet has evolved beyond recognition. ‘The Dawn of the DID’ explores the essence of digital identity, akin to survivors returning to a mall not for nostalgia but driven by instinct. Memory of what these spaces used to represent in their lives — safety, identity, community — now demands a new form of navigation. This series delves into decentralized identities (DIDs), a beacon of autonomy and security in the digital age, much like the important places of our past. It’s more than a return; it’s a reinvention of how we define and protect who we are in the interconnected world.</p> <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/basics-and-importance-of-decentralized-identity-56098fd64fe5">Basics and Importance of Decentralized Identity</a> <p>Decentralized identity heralds a significant shift in online personal identity management by prioritizing individual control, thereby enhancing privacy and reducing susceptibility to fraud. By deviating from centralized control models prone to security breaches, it employs blockchain technology to distribute identity data across a secure network, eliminating single points of failure. This not only strengthens privacy through selective information sharing but also streamlines online transactions and interactions by simplifying verification processes. In essence, decentralized identity embodies a transformative approach to digital autonomy, promising a future where individuals can fully manage their digital footprints, marking a crucial step towards realizing a more secure, private, and user-centric digital ecosystem.</p> Blockchain’s Role in Digital&nbsp;Identity <p>Blockchain technology is indispensable to decentralized identity systems, acting as a secure and immutable ledger that enhances the integrity and trustworthiness of digital identities. Its distributed nature ensures that identity data is stored across a network, making it resistant to tampering and fraud, thus eliminating reliance on a central authority for verification. This setup not only guarantees the authenticity of each digital identity but also offers users unprecedented control and privacy over their personal information. By facilitating secure, transparent transactions and interactions without compromising user privacy, blockchain is redefining the landscape of digital identity, making it more secure, user-centric, and adaptable to the needs of the digital&nbsp;age.</p> Overview of Ontology’s Ecosystem <p>Ontology’s ecosystem is meticulously crafted to redefine the management and exchange of digital identities and data across the web through a sophisticated multi-chain structure. This innovative platform ensures scalability and robust security for a wide array of applications and services, promoting seamless interoperability across diverse blockchain networks. Central to its design is the emphasis on privacy, user sovereignty, and trust, enabling individuals and organizations to effortlessly create, manage, and leverage digital identities. Ontology’s approach not only champions a decentralized, user-driven internet but also establishes a transparent, secure framework for digital interactions, ushering in a new era for blockchain technology’s role in digital identity and data exchange.</p> Cross-Chain Capabilities <p>Cross-chain capabilities represent a transformative leap in blockchain technology, enabling distinct blockchain networks to communicate and exchange data and value seamlessly. This interoperability is pivotal for developing a comprehensive digital identity framework that is both unified and efficient. By facilitating the transfer of information and assets across various blockchains, cross-chain functionality ensures that digital identities and their associated credentials can be recognized and utilized in a wider array of applications and services. This not only enhances the utility and accessibility of digital identities across different platforms but also significantly contributes to the creation of a more interconnected and interoperable blockchain ecosystem. Through cross-chain capabilities, the vision of a truly decentralized web, where digital identities are portable, secure, and universally accepted, becomes increasingly attainable, marking a crucial step towards achieving a cohesive digital&nbsp;world.</p> Verifiable Credentials Explained <p>Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are a cornerstone innovation in the realm of digital identity, enabling the secure and privacy-preserving verification of personal credentials. This technology uses cryptographic techniques to provide a tamper-proof layer of security, ensuring that credentials such as academic degrees, professional certifications, and KYC (Know Your Customer) information are authentic and have not been altered. VCs empower individuals by allowing them to prove their qualifications and identity attributes digitally, without the need to reveal excessive personal information. This streamlines various verification processes, making them more efficient and less invasive. For organizations, VCs reduce the risk of fraud, as the credentials can be directly verified against the blockchain, where they are immutably recorded. The adoption of VCs is a significant step forward in creating a more trustworthy and user-friendly digital world, where transactions and interactions are facilitated with ease and confidence.</p> NFTs in Digital&nbsp;Identity <p>Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are revolutionizing the concept of digital identity by offering a unique and secure method to represent and verify online identities and assets. Unlike traditional digital assets, NFTs are unique, with each token having distinct characteristics and ownership records on the blockchain, making them irreplaceable and invaluable for asserting the authenticity and ownership of digital identities and assets. This unique property of NFTs can be harnessed to create digital passports, certificates, or any form of identity verification that requires indisputable proof of authenticity. Furthermore, NFTs can encapsulate user attributes and preferences, enabling personalized and secure interactions in the digital space. By expanding the utility of blockchain technology beyond its conventional applications, NFTs pave the way for innovative approaches to managing digital identities, ensuring a higher level of security, privacy, and control for users in the digital&nbsp;realm.</p> DeFi and Digital Identity Integration <p>The integration of decentralized finance (DeFi) with digital identity systems heralds a significant evolution in how financial transactions and services are conducted. By leveraging verified identity information within DeFi platforms, this integration ensures that financial operations are not only secure but also inherently transparent. It allows for a streamlined approach to accessing financial services, where individuals can utilize their digital identities to prove their credentials, manage assets, and engage in transactions without the traditional barriers imposed by centralized financial institutions. This fusion of DeFi with digital identity not only amplifies the trust and efficiency in financial ecosystems but also opens the door to innovative services tailored to individual needs and histories. Furthermore, it addresses significant concerns such as fraud, identity theft, and privacy, ensuring that individuals have full control over their financial and personal data. As such, the integration of DeFi and digital identity is set to redefine the landscape of financial services, making them more accessible, inclusive, and aligned with the ethos of a decentralized, user-centric digital&nbsp;world.</p> DID and AI: Harnessing Intelligent Identity Management <p>In the emerging AI era, the significance of authenticating human identity becomes paramount. The convergence of Decentralized Identity (DID) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) introduces a future where intelligent identity management systems are essential. This integration not only streamlines identity verification through AI-driven fraud detection and privacy management but also personalizes user interactions via predictive analytics. Such advancements ensure that digital identities are managed with enhanced security and efficiency, marking a pivotal evolution towards safeguarding human identity in the digital domain against sophisticated threats.</p> DID and Real-World Assets: Bridging the Digital-Physical Divide <p>Decentralized Identity (DID) systems are revolutionizing the way we interact with real-world assets through blockchain technology, bridging the gap between digital and physical realms. By enabling the digital representation of physical assets through NFTs or tokenization, DID systems facilitate proof of ownership, provenance tracking, and secure and transparent asset transfers. This digital-physical linkage empowers users with immutable proof of ownership and the ability to seamlessly trade or verify the authenticity of assets ranging from real estate to artwork. As a result, DID systems are not only enhancing the security and efficiency of asset management but also opening up new avenues for investment, trading, and ownership in the digital&nbsp;age.</p> Future Directions in Decentralized Identity <p>The future of decentralized identity (DID) is poised for broad industry adoption, driven by advancements in privacy and cross-chain interoperability, fostering a user-centric and secure ecosystem. This evolution predicts a digital space where users have unparalleled control over their identities, facilitated by seamless, secure data and asset exchanges across blockchain platforms. Ontology’s leadership in providing privacy-focused solutions amplifies DID’s potential to enhance and personalize digital interactions significantly. This shift towards a more inclusive, interconnected, and empowered digital world is indicative of the transformative impact of technological innovation and widespread adoption in the DID landscape.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/the-dawn-of-the-did-e806e02f56a2">The Dawn of the DID</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In our digital era, presentation, and injection biometric attacks pose an unprecedented threat to the sanctity of identity verification. As we navigate a landscape increasingly dependent on digital transactions, the looming menace of AI-generated deepfakes demands innovative strategies to combat identity fraud. Gartner Analysts Akif Khan and Swati Rakeja affirm this urgency, stating, “Identity verification leaders must understand this emerging threat and take a proactive approach to secure their solutions*.”</p>
<p>*Emerging Tech: The Impact of AI and Deepfakes on Identity Verification – Akif Khan and Swati Rakeja</p>
<p>Presentation attacks, also known as spoofing or imitation attacks, involve attempts to deceive biometric authentication systems using fake biometric samples, such as photos, videos, or other replicas of the genuine user. With the advent of deepfakes, the methods used to detect presentation attacks have become outdated as many deepfake videos are very well created to be presented as a live video, with great rendering of an attacker superimposing their image on a live video.</p>
<p>One way to identify genuine users and prevent presentation attacks, like deepfakes, is through “liveness detection.” Liveness detection helps distinguish between genuine, live individuals and manipulated synthetic representations. Here’s how liveness detection helps identify users:</p>
 
 Dynamic Movement Recognition: Liveness detection systems analyze the dynamic aspects of facial expressions, eye movements, and other micro-expressions that occur naturally in live subjects. 
 Response to Stimuli: Liveness detection may involve prompting the user to perform specific actions or respond to stimuli during verification. 
 3D Depth Analysis: Liveness detection often utilizes advanced techniques like 3D depth analysis. By assessing the three-dimensional aspects of facial features, the system can verify the spatial relationships between different facial elements, making it harder for static images or videos to pass as authentic. 
 Texture and Reflection Analysis: Liveness detection examines surface characteristics such as texture and reflections on the face. Natural skin has unique textures and reflects light in specific ways that may be hard to emulate. 
 
<p>All these technology components have been embedded across various liveness detection engines and have effectively prevented a “Presentation Attack” often used to game the system. Most deepfake attacks happen when an attacker injects a fraudulent video to game the liveness detection engine. There are usually three types of injection attacks that occur:</p>
 
 Virtual H/W Camera Injections: Utilizing a virtual camera instead of a real camera to submit a photo or video. Software like Manycams is used to do this. 
 JavaScript Injections: Utilizing browser console to inject spooﬁng JavaScript code to be run instead of existing one on the webpage 
 Client Server Protocol Injections: A fraudster breaks the data channel between the browser and server or Classic IT infrastructure “Man in the Middle” type of attack. 
 
 Defeating Presentation Attacks with 1Kosmos 
<p>1Kosmos responds to this challenge with LiveID and LiveID+. LiveID leverages the front-facing camera on the mobile device (selfie camera) and records a video of the user. Once LiveID has determined the user is genuine, through a liveness check, LiveID will capture a “selfie” of the user and use it as a biometric reference for authentication. LiveID+ is an advanced SDK client-side solution. By actively identifying and thwarting injection attacks in real time, LiveID+ sets a new standard for security, offering robust protection against the deceptive tactics of deepfakes.</p>
<p>Adding additional capabilities to LiveID with LiveID+ allows organizations to prevent this growing attack vector. The new client-side SDK will catch injection attacks and not permit any identity proofing or authentication attempt if an injection attack is detected.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The advent of deepfake technology poses a formidable challenge to identity verification processes. As our digital transactions surge and passwordless biometrics become mainstream, the threat from AI-generated deepfakes will become more pronounced. Liveness detection is a good way of combating presentation attacks. However, the evolution of more sophisticated injection attacks, especially those utilizing injection techniques, necessitates innovative security measures like LiveID and LiveID+.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p> Setting the stage 
<p>On February 29, 2024, the European Union (EU) Parliament <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20240223IPR18095/meps-back-plans-for-an-eu-wide-digital-wallet">voted </a>in favor of amendments to the eIDAS regulation, marking a significant milestone on the road to a unified standard for European digital identity services. The regulation, which is expected to enter into force by the end of March upon publication in the Official Journal of the EU, will trigger a series of implementation steps. The countdown begins with a six-month period to finalize the technical specifications of the EU Digital ID Wallet, followed by adjustments based on legal file and experiences in large scale pilots. By 2026, all EU member states are mandated to provide digital wallets to every resident, accessible at no cost for acquisition and usage.</p>
<p>Under the new regulation, citizens and businesses could potentially leverage digital wallets to link various personal attributes securely, including driving licenses, diplomas, and national ID cards. Section 5 of the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-digital-identity-wallet-architecture-and-reference-framework">Architecture Reference Framework</a> lists the current mandatory, optional, and possible additional attributes that are included in the eIDAS framework.</p>
<p>The implementation of eIDAS promises a secure, privacy-friendly means for individuals to prove their identity and electronically sign documents, fostering access to public and private services across the EU. The removal of virtual borders facilitated by eIDAS is anticipated to deepen the Digital Single Market and foster further integration within the EU. However, the true measure of success lies in ensuring that these principles extend beyond the borders of the EU.</p>
 Bridging boundaries 
<p>Achieving interoperability at various levels is essential, including integration with internal organizational systems and compatibility with other verified identity solutions. To gain widespread adoption, the wallet must provide user-friendliness and work seamlessly across international boundaries. Embracing interoperability as a guiding principle is not merely a matter of compliance but a strategic imperative for organizations aiming to thrive in an increasingly interconnected digital world.</p>
<p>Moreover, digital identity issuance and applicability should not be limited to a single organization or use case. If a user possesses a verified digital identity, they should have the ability to utilize it across various purposes, with diverse service providers spanning different industries, and even with public institutions. Consequently, solutions need to be adaptable and scalable, offering flexibility to accommodate varying levels of assurance for each use case or process, while also being scalable to meet the evolving demands of interoperability and security.</p>
<p>At EIC 2023, several presentations focused on digital identity in the context of eIDAS and the EU Digital Identity Wallet. These included presentations that considered how digital wallets can be used in the private sector in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eudi-wallet-eic-2023">EUDI Wallet - Critical Success factors for Digital Single Market and Private Sector Use</a>; how organizations can take advantage of the latest developments in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/digital-identity-wallets-eic2023">eIDAS 2.0 &amp; Digital Identity Wallet Readiness: What Your Organization Needs to Know About Digital Identity Wallets</a>; and the potential challenges and use cases in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/digital-identity-wallets-eic2023">eIDAS 2.0 &amp; EU Digital Identity Wallet</a>.</p>
 Maximizing business potential 
<p>In my previous blog post, I delved into some of the challenges posed by the eIDAS regulation and the EU Digital ID Wallet. However, in this post, we will shift our focus to explore the potential business advantages. Moving beyond the regulatory landscape, the business implications of digital identities extend far beyond traditional Identity and Access Management (IAM) frameworks. These digital identities serve as enablers for cross-organizational use, offering <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80803/reusable-verified-identity">reusable</a>, decentralized approaches that improve and expand business processes. In addition, as discussed in this <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an80858/how-enterprises-will-learn-to-love-decentralized-ids-the-roles-of-distributed-and-sovereign-identiti#heading4">Advisory Note</a>, enterprises have already reached a point where centralized identity management is neither desirable nor possible because existing centralized approaches to identity, authentication, interoperability, and security don't fit and won't scale with emerging technologies.</p>
<p>To ensure adoption and integration within enterprises, the following areas will be addressed by the EU Digital Identity Wallet:</p>
 
 Identity Verification (KYC):&nbsp;The EU Wallet will offer robust identity verification capabilities to streamline Know Your Customer (KYC) processes for organizations. By leveraging secure and efficient verification methods, enterprises can enhance the security and reliability of customer identity verification. 
 Strong User Authentication: Enterprises mandated to implement strong user authentication measures will benefit from the EU Wallet's advanced authentication features. 
 Integration with Major Platforms: The EU Wallet will support authentication on major online platforms, including social networks, search engines, and e-commerce marketplaces. By enabling interoperability with these gatekeeper platforms, enterprises can ensure widespread acceptance of the EU Wallet among users. 
 
<p>Therefore, as organizations navigate the implications of eIDAS and the EU Digital Identity Wallet, it's imperative to recognize not only the challenges but also the vast array of business opportunities presented. The wallet serves as a central repository for proof of identity and other attributes, streamlining numerous business use cases and offering users unparalleled convenience. In addition, integrating digital wallets with existing IAM systems can streamline onboarding processes for remote workers, saving time and money while increasing security. For partner collaboration, digital identity wallets provide secure access to shared resources and data, promoting trust while ensuring privacy and compliance.</p>
<p>Regardless of their size or industry, enterprises can benefit significantly from adopting digital identity wallet solutions. By embracing these technologies and tailoring their implementation strategies to their specific needs and challenges, businesses can unlock new opportunities for growth, innovation, and user satisfaction in today's digital economy.</p>
<p>Find out what identity, cloud, and security industry experts, thought leaders, practitioners, and peers are thinking and doing by joining us at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">EIC 2024</a> taking place in Berlin and online from 4-7 June.  We will be discussing the latest developments and the role that digital identities play in the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/mtracks/169">enterprise </a>space.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Global Impact: How will the EU Digital Identity Wallet affect non-EU residents or businesses operating outside the EU?</p>
<br>The European Digital Identity Wallet should apply to the EU's nearly 450 million residents, but experts say its impact could be felt far beyond that because of the EU's leadership role in creating regulations and policies that serve as a global standard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Security Concerns: What are the key security challenges, and how does the regulation address them to ensure the protection of user data?</p>
<br>Given that the EU Digital Identity Wallet requires the storage of documents, cryptographic keys, and other sensitive information on mobile platforms, it is vulnerable to various risks, including loss, hardware malfunction, and unauthorized access by hackers and thieves. Protecting the integrity and confidentiality of digital wallet data is critical and requires robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and ensure controlled access for authorized users. Nevertheless, its legal backing and the EU's commitment to neutrality, security and user privacy sets the EU Digital Identity Wallet apart from corporate digital wallets.</blockquote>

<p>The Australian parliament is working on the government’s <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_LEGislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=s1404&amp;utm_source=stilgherrian&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the-weekly-cybers-7">Digital ID Bill 2023</a>. After passing the lower house, the Bill has been considered by a senate committee <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Economics/DigitalIDBills2023?utm_source=stilgherrian&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the-weekly-cybers-7">inquiry</a>, which included hearing a day’s worth of expert testimony.&nbsp; The committee’s report has now been <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Economics/DigitalIDBills2023/Report?utm_source=stilgherrian&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the-weekly-cybers-7">tabled</a>.</p>
<p>The committee recommended that the senate approve the Bill, but as usual, a number of opposition politicians wrote dissenting reports.</p>
<p>Two sorts of objections are worth correcting because they reflect serious misunderstandings of the Digital ID Bill and of the whole field of digital identity.</p>
 The Digital ID Bill has no new ID 
<p>The Coalition Senators’ Dissenting Report at paragraph 1.16 alleges:</p>
<p>“It seems that [the government] has decided on a more syndicated model that centralises Digital ID in government hands, disregarding the Murray Review’s warnings. By departing from a truly federated approach to Digital ID, Labor is risking the integrity of the entire premise of such a framework.”</p>
<p>I will come back to the Murray Review shortly. For now, I only want to stress that the Digital ID Bill is not a “syndicated” model of digital identities. It is not any sort of model of digital identity.</p>
<p>The Digital ID Bill introduces no new IDs whatsoever. The whole point of the legislation is to conserve existing IDs and make them more reliable in digital form.</p>
 Federated identity has been tried and tried 
<p>The Coalition Senators are much attached to federated identity. They call out the 2014 <a href="https://treasury.gov.au/publication/c2014-fsi-final-report">Murray Inquiry into the Financial System</a> which recommended a public-private federation of trusted digital identities. And they’re obviously proud of the public sector Trusted Digital Identity Framework (TDIF) launched in 2018.</p>
<p>Yet the dissenting report doesn’t mention the private sector trust framework effort.</p>
<p>Following Murray, the government worked on TDIF while the Australian Payments Council took on a parallel financial services trust framework called TrustID. After many years work, the TrustID working group was unable to reach consensus on use cases for banking digital identities, and the framework was quietly dropped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my view, more attention should be given to the impasse on TrustID use cases when digital identity is thought to be so urgent. That’s quite a paradox!&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact is that federated identity has been tried over and over in Australia, and in comparable economies, and it has <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/what-will-we-learn-from-the-market-failure-of-digital-identity/">proven to be a market failure</a>. Many commercial Identity Providers have launched in Australia but not one has built a sustainable business. As for TDIF, it’s solitary measure of success is the rush of identity service providers seeking accreditation in anticipation of business expected to come.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We should listen to the market. The idea of free market federated identity provision, reusable across banking and government, has proven plainly not to be viable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems to me the government has heeded 15 years of experience of a stagnant digital identity market. With its fresh new Bill, the Australian&nbsp;government has progressed beyond the past idealism of reusable “digital identity”. The <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/digital-id-and-digital-identity/">Digital ID Bill doesn’t use the term anymore</a>, and instead focuses on digitising the many trusted IDs we already have, so they are more reliable online.</p>

   Multi-factor authentication (MFA) has evolved since the 1980s and now requires two out of three options: something you have, are, or know. However, phishing poses a significant threat to MFA's security, emphasizing the need for better options. Biometrics, app-based authenticators, and FIDO-based authenticators offer more secure alternatives. FIDO2 stands out as it includes phishing resistance in i

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) has been used by computer administrators since at least the 1980s. Regular people started using it in the mid-1990s when banking systems began to roll this out. It was pretty clunky; those key fobs were not small! And since I mentioned MFA as one road to greater security in my <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/02/25/navigating-the-passwordless-future-enhancing-digital-security/">recent post</a> on passwordless technologies, I thought a quick refresher might be in order.</p>



 Today’s MFA 



<p>MFA looks much different than it did thirty years ago. MFA requires at least two out of these three options:</p>



 
 something you have 



 something you are 



 something you know 
 



<p>In practice, that has taken the form of everything from an SMS message to an iris scanner and more. As it turns out, not all MFA options have stood the test of time when it comes to better security. Depending on what you’re protecting, you might need to get more discerning when it comes to what techniques you use for MFA.</p>



 The Phishing Threat to MFA 



<p>Phishing is the biggest threat to MFA’s ability to solve all the world’s authentication problems. One definition of phishing is:</p>



<p>A technique for attempting to acquire sensitive data, such as bank account numbers, through a fraudulent solicitation in email or on a website, in which the perpetrator masquerades as a legitimate business or reputable person. (<a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/phishing#">U.S. NIST Glossary</a>)</p>



<p>Phishing is when someone tricks you into clicking on a link that either takes you to or is part of a website that looks a LOT like a legit thing. It will likely pass your username and password on to the actual site and put up a page to collect the code received via SMS or email. At that point, the hacker (or, more to the point, their program) usually has 10-15 minutes to use the username, password, and code to get into the site and do things. Most likely, they’ll change your settings so the account has a different recovery email, a new phone number, and a new password.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jerks.</p>



 Better Options 



<p>So, what else is there if there are better ideas than an SMS message or, heavens forbid, an email? The answers fall into three categories: biometrics, app-based authenticators, and FIDO-based authenticators. Which one you choose depends on the criticality assigned to what’s being protected.&nbsp;</p>



 Biometrics 



<p>Biometrics cover the “something you are” option of MFA. These can be anything from fingerprints, facial recognition, iris recognition, and voice recognition. This was a relatively reliable option, though <a href="https://ovic.vic.gov.au/privacy/resources-for-organisations/biometrics-and-privacy-issues-and-challenges/">accessibility issues</a> are a problem. However, with the age of AI and deep fakes dawning, not all biometric options are equally secure. According to <a href="https://cybersecurity-magazine.com/can-deepfakes-beat-biometric-security/">Cybersecurity Magazine</a>, facial recognition is at the most risk, though voice recognition is not far behind. Fingerprints are better off, but not without their own challenges.</p>



<p>There are ways to make biometric recognition more robust. The evolution of attack and response, however, means attack mitigation is always a moving target.</p>



 App-based Authenticators 



<p>Another option that will fill the “something you have” option is an app-based authenticator. There are several out there, like <a href="https://authy.com/">Authy</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&amp;pcampaignid=web_share">Google Authenticator</a>. Many of these apps use something called TOTP. This Time-based One Time Password functionality generates a number that changes, as you might guess from the name, over some (short) period of time. Several password managers (you <a href="https://security.georgetown.edu/csam-2020/benefits-of-password-managers/">use a password manager</a>, right?), like <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>, include a TOTP code, too. (I admit, I’m not sure about storing my password with my second factor, but that’s just me.)</p>



<p>If you are using a TOTP-based authenticator, then you need to be on top of getting that code out of the app and into the authentication screen. I often delay responding to the MFA challenge if it looks like my authenticator app only has under 10 seconds left for that number.</p>



 FIDO2-based MFA 



<p>Now for the <a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/gold%20standard">gold standard</a> of authenticators: FIDO2! This MFA option puts <a href="https://www.sans.org/blog/what-is-phishing-resistant-mfa/">phishing resistance</a> as part of its core design. Go, team!</p>



<p>The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specifications-overview/">FIDO Alliance</a> is the source of the FIDO2 family of specifications, including WebAuthn. FIDO2-compliant authenticators can use dedicated hardware tokens or mobile devices (like your phone). To use that token or the key stored on your mobile device, though, you need a biometric or a PIN. Combined with a traditional password step, this takes us from two-factor authentication (2FA) to multi-factor authentication.</p>



 Passkeys 



<p>If you read my <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/02/25/navigating-the-passwordless-future-enhancing-digital-security/">last post</a> about passwordless authentication, you may be thinking that FIDO2-based MFA and passkeys sound similar. And, in fact, you would not be wrong! In many cases, you can just use a passkey and have 2FA, which is enough for many situations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Passkeys are not perfect; there are <a href="https://youtu.be/mxGczv1-XlE?si=YBrrRvPRcb-bVXM6">new threat models</a> that implementors need to consider before they roll out support for passkeys willy-nilly. However, they are still arguably better than passwords.</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>I believe some form of MFA is better than none. That said, I also worry that it lulls people into a false sense of security. How risky is it for you personally if your account is hacked? How risky is it for your organization if your systems are compromised? What data will be exposed? If you don’t have time to understand those gory details, the only real option is to require a stronger form of MFA so you don’t have to worry about that. There are always plenty of other things to worry about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And if you are an end-user, you may not have a choice of the quality of the MFA you get to use. In that case, something is better than nothing! If you work for a company with an IT department and the need for people to log in remotely (including your customers), then you really need to make MFA a priority. And when you do, make sure you do it properly with a phishing-resistant option.</p>

 Breaking Down Barriers: Integrated Wallets for Tokenized Securities 
 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in February 2024.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>Navigating the complexities of blockchain wallets has been a significant hurdle for traditional investors. The wallet barrier not only discourages investors from embracing digital securities but also presents compliance constraints, in some jurisdictions, for issuers who provide custodian wallet options.</p>
<p>To achieve critical mass, we must simplify the experience for end users by hiding these complexities. Integrated wallets are specifically designed to do that, especially the non-custodial ones.</p>
<p>What are integrated wallets?</p>
<p>Integrated wallets are digital wallets that are seamlessly embedded into a tokenization platform. It provides multiple benefits as listed below:</p>
 
 Hassle-free experience:&nbsp;Automatic creation of wallets, providing a seamless experience for non-blockchain investors. 
 Easy for traditional investors:&nbsp;Web banking-like transaction confirmation processes using passwords or biometric authentication. 
 All-in-one platform:&nbsp;No external navigation is needed, everything is integrated within the platform. 
 Flexible wallet support:&nbsp;Issuers can seamlessly support integrated custodial or non-custodial wallets, as we expand our integration with all wallet providers. 
 
<p>How does an integrated wallet work?</p>
<p>Onboarded investors effortlessly claim their automatically issued integrated wallet by creating a security key (e.g., biometric authentication) following simple instructions. Confirming operations and transactions becomes seamless through their security key (e.g., Touch ID).</p>
<p>(Example of an investor making a secure transfer, try it&nbsp;<a href="https://app.supademo.com/demo/2OTSYiuc60cQyiVm1kF6_?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8RSM935qbQPDjmO7XFVYj2feCu5DLoyNtOaft0EbQH1iMEymobRVTevBmWCPwvcWI2TOrH">here)</a></p>

 The Future of Personal AI<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/future-of-personal-ai#the-future-of-personal-ai" title="Direct link to The Future of Personal AI">​</a> 
<p>For many years, artificial intelligence primarily piqued the interest of academic researchers and enthusiasts within niche technological sectors such as robotics. Although respected, AI presented little practical application for the average person. That changed in June 2020 with the debut of a Large Language Model (LLM) called GPT-3. GPT-3 inspired organizations and individuals to use AI to accelerate their workflows, from coding and blogging to planning itineraries. Today, the potential of AI is so immense that Simon Westh Henriksen, the CTO of Kin, believes personal AI will be one of the most valuable digital assets we own in the future. Simon and his team built Kin. They describe it as "your personal AI assistant for your private life." The intended persona for Kin is a mix between a life coach and a close friend.</p>
 My First Impressions of Kin<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/future-of-personal-ai#my-first-impressions-of-kin" title="Direct link to My First Impressions of Kin">​</a> 
<p>For the last three years, I've deemed ChatGPT my bestie, so when I heard about Kin, I immediately downloaded the beta on my phone. My initial impression was that there was a sense of familiarity because the user interface and interaction were reminiscent of other LLM-powered chatbots such as ChatGPT and Gemini. However, there were some key differences between Kin and traditional chatbots – it focuses on privacy and personalization.</p>
 Privacy-First Artificial Intelligence<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/future-of-personal-ai#privacy-first-artificial-intelligence" title="Direct link to Privacy-First Artificial Intelligence">​</a> 
<p>With traditional Generative AI Chatbots, your data lives on the company's servers for telemetry purposes (and more). In contrast, Simon explained that Kin doesn't have backend servers, and users' data stays exclusively with the user. This is possible because of Web5's <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-web-nodes">Decentralized Web Nodes (DWN)</a>. DWNs provide users with a local and personal data store. Now, you can ask an AI personal questions without worrying if someone else can also read it.</p>
 Personalized for You<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/future-of-personal-ai#personalized-for-you" title="Direct link to Personalized for You">​</a> 
<p>Unlike traditional Generative AI Chatbots, Kin retains the context of your conversations to provide personalized and relevant responses. As users engage with Kin, the platform analyzes these interactions to extract facts about the user, constructing a semantic memory. This process involves graphing and mapping details such as your name, relationships, interests, etc.</p>
<p>Simon explained the technological process behind this functionality: "It takes in this new knowledge that we have recognized from the chat, or what we think is new knowledge. And then we query this graph that already exists, and we kind of take a subgraph, the relevant subgraph, that might be related to that thing. Then we give it to the LLM, to the model, and it outputs graph operations. So that's something like add node, add edge, remove node, remove edge, and then we apply those to the graph. And in that way, the memory evolves as you speak and interact with Kin."</p>
 The Future of Kin<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/future-of-personal-ai#the-future-of-kin" title="Direct link to The Future of Kin">​</a> 
<p>The team at Kin is working on enhancing the platform's memory beyond facts of the user by introducing episodic memory. Episodic memory tracks events in users' lives and anchors them to a timeline to give AI an idea of how a user's life evolves.</p>
<p>They also plan to implement natural voice interfaces and personalized reminders.</p>
 The True Value of Data Ownership<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/future-of-personal-ai#the-true-value-of-data-ownership" title="Direct link to The True Value of Data Ownership">​</a> 
<p>Simon envisions a future where Kin takes full advantage of Web5's data ownership and cryptographic verification capabilities. He provided a futuristic example: After a year of personalized interaction, Kin could use <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/verifiable-credentials">Verifiable Credentials</a> to serve as a digital assistant with verified authority on the user's behalf. Kin could share preferences with third parties like e-commerce websites with the user's permission.</p>
<p>"This is where owning and controlling your data suddenly becomes extremely valuable," Simon proclaims. Data ownership is not just about keeping your data private but having control over who you share your data with.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Deepfake cyberattacks, phishing, and social engineering have all received a turbo boost in recent months due to the proliferation of easily accessed AI tools. Cybercriminals are some of the most creative individuals in the world. They spend their days conjuring up different ways to bypass security systems, not filling out spreadsheets and reports.&nbsp;</p>  
<p>In this article, we discuss how hackers are leveraging AI tools to bypass traditional identity security controls at an unprecedented pace, and just why generative AI attacks are so successful. We also look at how these attacks can be defeated using identity assurance controls that take a deterministic approach to securing identities, rather than relying on probabilistic methods that contain inherent levels of uncertainty. By implementing these modern controls, organizations can significantly reduce their risk of identity fraud for both their workforce as well as customers.&nbsp;</p> 
 Common Generative AI Attacks  
<p>Hackers use out of the box as well as specifically trained large language models (LLMs), often created by nation state hackers (China, Russia, North Korea), to execute cyberattacks with frightening accuracy. Here are some of the attacks that get a significant boost from AI.</p> 
 Phishing  
<p>Prior to AI, we used to frequently delineate between “phishing” and “spear phishing,” where attacks were tailored to a specific individual. By using LLMs, hackers are now able to tailor just about every single phishing message to a specific target to get a much higher success rate. For decades now the industry has trained employees to spot telltale signs of phishing by looking for grammatical and spelling errors. Today, phishing messages created by LLMs are in the local language, contain local context, and are largely indistinguishable from the legitimate messages users get every single day. A <a href="https://slashnext.com/state-of-phishing-2023/">recent study</a> found a 1,265% rise in phishing, largely due to the usage of AI tools.&nbsp;</p> 
 Impersonation (Deepfake Cyberattacks)  
<p>Identity theft is at an all time high due to the ability of AI to impersonate an individual across all communication channels including voice, text and video. In recent weeks, a scammer used a series of<a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2024/02/05/deepfake-video-conference-call/"> video deepfakes to extract more than $25M from an organization</a>. Hackers can create personas based on individuals in minutes, merely by looking at samples of their writing, publicly available videos, and social media posts. Just a few years ago, creating a deepfake video required significant resources. Today, freely available apps can do the job fairly well, with accuracy improving by leaps and bounds daily.&nbsp;</p> 
 Social Engineering&nbsp;  
<p>Before AI, social engineering attacks were highly manual in nature and oftentimes had low success rates. We’ve all received scam calls and many of us can easily spot them when the caller has no knowledge of our details and speaks with an unfamiliar accent. By using AI, hackers are able to create chatbots and voice conversation systems that mimic the tone, cadence, and contextual nuances of a specific target audience. LLMs also are able to use reinforcement learning so that they get better with every single conversation that occurs. These improved algorithms can then be used to target large numbers of users simultaneously, rather than being bottlenecked by human interactions.&nbsp;</p> 
 Why Generative AI Attacks Are Successful  
<p>Hackers love AI tools because they make them more efficient than ever. There are a few key reasons why AI-assisted attacks are seeing so much success today:&nbsp;</p> 
 Speed and Scalability  
<p>AI can process and analyze data and conversations at speeds that outpace any human by orders of magnitude. This ability enables these tools to launch widespread attacks in a very short amount of time.&nbsp;</p> 
 Adaptability  
<p>AI systems can adapt their strategies based on the responses from the target’s defenses. If users have been trained to look for specific red flags, these tools can adapt and respond accordingly within seconds. As a result, defense systems that rely on blocking known attack patterns are trivial for an AI attack to bypass quickly.&nbsp;</p> 
 Efficiency in Targeting  
<p>AI can analyze data from various sources to identify the most valuable targets to maximize its success. When AI identifies a series of patterns or signals, it can quickly train itself to focus on targets with the most likelihood for success. Most importantly, it can correlate with other AI systems who “soften the target,” to then outflank victim organizations' security controls. For example, one AI tool can target an organization with a DDOS attack and, when the victim is busy responding, another AI tool can execute a highly contextualized phishing campaign that references the DDOS attack to maximize its success rate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 Leveraging Big Data  
<p>AI systems are able to integrate with countless data sources both public and private in order to maximize their impact. Attackers leveraging AI can refine strategies within seconds based on real-time events in ways never possible before. Social media, previous breach data available on the dark web, and leaked credentials can all be processed instantaneously to create new and more sophisticated attacks with a high likelihood of success.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 Why Probabilistic Identity Security Controls Fail Against an AI Attack  
<p>The vast majority of identity security controls are failing today. To understand why this is the case, we have to understand the probabilistic nature of their implementations.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Probabilistic security controls operate on the basis of likelihood. They use various criteria to determine the probability that something is safe or a potential security threat. By contrast, deterministic security controls identify an outcome with a binary level of precision. They can determine with a high degree of certainty if something is true or false, safe or a threat.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With this in mind, let’s look at some of the primary methods the industry uses today to prove that someone is who they say they are.&nbsp;</p> 
 Phishable Authentication Factors  
<p>Passwords, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/why-you-need-to-reconsider-otp-authentication">one time passwords (OTP) </a>delivered via SMS or app, and push notifications are the primary methods organizations use to verify users today into their systems. AI creates significant accuracy in brute force password spraying attacks by being able to predict passwords. It also strengthens phishing and social engineering to trick users into providing OTP codes or accepting push notifications at a high rate. These controls are probabilistic as they cannot determine with certainty that the entity seeking access is the legitimate credential holder, and can be intercepted, replayed and phished.&nbsp;</p> 
 KBA-Based Identity Verification  
<p>AI systems’ ability to ingest massive amounts of data extremely quickly and in real time enables them to learn about their targets and easily answer questions such as their mother's maiden name and the street they grew up on. By combining this with phishing and social engineering capabilities, these AI-assisted hackers can quickly execute identity theft and gain access to employee and customer accounts. Knowledge-based security methods are also probabilistic by nature and can be easily intercepted, replayed, and phished from users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 Human-Verified Documents  
<p>Many businesses have moved from KBA to online or in-person document verification in order to reduce identity fraud. However, attackers can use widely available AI tools to create fake documents such as passports and driver licenses that are able to trick most systems. The image below is a fake passport generated by AI that was able to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-generated-fake-ids-pass-crypto-exchange-kyc-onlyfake">bypass the identity verification system of a cryptocurrency exchange</a>.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Image Source: <a href="https://www.404media.co/inside-the-underground-site-where-ai-neural-networks-churns-out-fake-ids-onlyfake/">404 Media</a></p> 
<p>Both human and machine-based verification controls of documents are probabilistic in nature because they have to account for differences in documents with regard to image quality and the sheer number of variations of the documents themselves. They can only determine the likelihood that a document is legitimate.</p> 
 Five Identity Controls to Defend Against AI Attacks  
 1. Focus on Deterministic Controls  
<p>In recent years, deterministic controls to secure identities have started to enter the market by way of open standards and innovative technology companies. Unlike most probabilistic controls, deterministic identity technology plays a crucial role in countering AI-assisted cyber attacks because they can provide a binary certainty; a definitive yes or no that eliminates the gaps exploited by AI-assisted attacks.</p> 
 2. Strong Authentication Protocols  
<p>Cryptographic Techniques: FIDO and similar protocols, such as the traditional smartcard, use public-key cryptography for authentication. During the registration process, the user’s device creates a new public-private key pair. The private key is kept secret on the device, while the public key is registered with the online service. Authentication involves proving possession of the private key without it ever leaving the user's device, making it extremely difficult for attackers (AI-assisted or not) to steal or replicate.</p> 
<p>Biometric Verification: FIDO, for example, supports local <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-biometric-authentication">biometric verification</a> (like fingerprint sensors, facial recognition, etc.), which are difficult for AI to fake because the biometric data is not transmitted over the network. Instead, the device confirms the match and then uses cryptographic keys to authenticate the user to the service.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-phishing-resistant-mfa">Phishing Resistance</a>: FIDO authentication is bound to the original website's URL, making it resistant to phishing attacks. Even if AI is used to create highly convincing phishing sites, the authentication process checks the URL to ensure it matches the registered service’s URL, preventing the credentials from being used to authenticate a fraudulent site.</p> 
<p>Local Storage of Credentials: Since the cryptographic credentials in FIDO are stored locally on the user's device and never shared with the server or across the network, AI-assisted attacks that rely on intercepting or deducing credentials remotely are rendered ineffective.</p> 
 3. Layered IDV to Prevent Deepfake Cyber Attacks  
<p>Deepfakes are getting more sophisticated on a daily basis. While liveness detection is a positive step forward, it’s only a matter of time before it’s defeated by the rapid pace of innovation in AI. Multi-layered identity verification offers a deterministic way to prove people’s identities to defend against deepfake cyber attacks. Instead of relying purely on voice or video feeds, you combine a series of factors such as location, behavior, document verification and face recognition so that you can be certain that an identity is genuine.</p> 
 4. AI-Assisted Identity Risk Mitigation  
<p>While deterministic security controls are essential, they cannot fully protect against unknown and emerging threats. Modern probabilistic identity security controls take advantage of the same AI assistance as attackers. Real-time risk assessment and adaptive security controls are a critical tool for organizations to manage evolving identity risks. By ingesting risk signals from a wide variety of sources, you can bring high fidelity to probabilistic controls.</p> 
 5. A Collaborative Identity Security Stack&nbsp;  
<p>It’s no secret that many identity security solutions tackle very specific challenges, operating in isolated spheres. Generative AI attacks find and exploit the gaps between these fragmented identity security processes. Open standards like FIDO and Open Policy Agent (OPA), were developed, in part, to ensure compatibility between security tools and processes. A more unified identity security approach, with solutions that communicate and collaborate across the identity lifecycle, greatly decreases the success rates of generative AI attacks.</p> 
 HYPR’s Anti-AI Strategy  
<p>HYPR was founded to put in place a deterministic way of proving that people are who they say they are. As a result, we were one of the first commercially successful implementations of the FIDO standards. Since then, our platform has expanded to prevent automation and scaling of identity-related attacks.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The HYPR Identity Assurance platform combines strong passwordless authentication, continuous risk mitigation and comprehensive identity verification so that you can be certain that a person is who they claim to be throughout the identity lifecycle.</p> 
<p>HYPR Authenticate is our category-leading <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-authenticate-passwordless-mfa">passwordless MFA</a> solution, which is built on top of the FIDO standards and fully eliminates breachable credentials from your authentication and verification processes.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-adapt">HYPR Adapt</a> is an identity fabric, which integrates&nbsp;real-time risk assessment and mitigation, leveraging high-fidelity risk signals from numerous sources, including external environments, endpoints and other cybersecurity products.</p> 
<p>HYPR Affirm, our comprehensive product for <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-affirm-identity-verification">identity verification</a>, provides a deterministic way to prove that an identity is legitimate and belongs to the person asserting it. HYPR Affirm combines a series of factors such as location, behavior, document verification, AI-powered chat, video, facial recognition and other cutting-edge technologies.</p>

 Stakers can claim DF78 rewards. DF79 runs Feb 29 — Mar 7,&nbsp;2024  1. Overview <p>Ocean Data Farming (DF) is Ocean’s incentives program. In DF, you can earn OCEAN rewards by locking OCEAN, curating data, and making predictions (in Predictoor). <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">Here are DF&nbsp;docs</a>.</p><p>Data Farming Round 78 (DF78) has completed. 150K OCEAN + 20K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am February 22, 2024 and ended 12:01 am February 29. You can claim rewards at the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF79 is live today, February 29. It concludes on March 7. 150K OCEAN and 20K ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><blockquote>Heads up: for DF81 (starts Mar 14), OCEAN rewards will double to 300,000 OCEAN/week. This breaks down as follows. Passive DF &amp; Active DF each get 150K OCEAN/week. Within Active DF, Volume DF gets 112.5K OCEAN/week and Predictoor DF gets 37.5K OCEAN/week. ROSE rewards continue at 20K ROSE/week.</blockquote><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF79   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: Passive DF, Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF, and Predictoor DF.</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF79 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 20k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Passive DF applies to OCEAN locked on Ethereum mainnet. Predictoor DF applies to activity on Oasis Sapphire. Volume DF applies to data assets published on Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/discover/networks">Here</a> is more information about Ocean deployments to networks.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by asset’s DCV * (% stake in asset) *DCV_multiplier. This <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6">prevents wash consume</a>. The value DCV_multiplier is 20.1% for Predictoor feeds, and 0.1% otherwise.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean, DF and Predictoor <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>Fission has been working with the IPFS ecosystem since we started. Content addressing is a fundamentally useful innovation that opens new use cases and approaches that are difficult or impossible without.</p><p>This year, the community and the organizations involved are changing in significant ways. Protocol Labs is nucleating a number of the engineering, open source, and operational teams into separate startups, engineering collectives, and foundations.</p><p>For IPFS projects and tooling, we must re-evaluate how we work together from code to commons.</p> What is IPFS Mainnet? <p>Mainnet is a term used to describe the default or "main" network that default settings connect to. This has mostly been "assumed" for the IPFS network, and not really highlighted for anyone other than protocol experts. The technical name for Mainnet is Amino, and there's a <a href="https://blog.ipfs.tech/2023-09-amino-refactoring/">blog post from September 2023</a> that goes into some more details and changes happening.</p><p>Diving deeper into Mainnet, there are a variety of <a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/public-utilities/">public utilities that are described in more detail in the IPFS docs</a>. One of the most notable is the IPFS.io public gateway, that serve up content-addressed data through an HTTP gateway that every browser can access.</p><p>This was run by Protocol Labs, and will now be a responsibility of the emerging IPFS Foundation, who in turn are relying on the new <a href="https://ipshipyard.com/">IP Shipyard organization</a> to do the technical work to host and maintain the gateway.</p><p>There are a number of other <a href="https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/">public IPFS Mainnet gateways</a>, including the gateway we've been running at Fission for many years:</p>While Fission's gateway is listed, we only serve up content that is synched to our servers by published apps and WNFS file systems<p>You'll note from the list that there are a number of commercial providers of IPFS services, like Cloudflare, Pinata, and Web3 Storage. As well as their "public" gateways, many of these organizations also sell services hosting dedicated gateways.</p><p>The way that IPFS works, all the nodes / gateways / desktops etc connect together and store pieces of data, "addressed" by the data itself. Unlike with a single web server being down and no one else having the "authority" to have the data at a location like <code>example.com/somedata.pdf</code>, IPFS nodes ask each other for all of the blocks that make up a content address, and the receiver can then verify that the data is correct.</p><p>IPFS Mainnet is the giant global network that uses the default bootstrap list, the default Distributed Hash Table (DHT) that helps locate content on the network, and all of the public and dedicated gateways that connect to it.</p> Alternate Networks <p>Using a different list of bootstrap nodes and other configuration settings, you can choose to not connect to IPFS Mainnet. Here are two examples of projects that made this choice:</p><p><a href="https://source.network/">Source Network</a> uses IPFS to synch and serve data across their ecosystem – we had them on for a <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/fission-tech-talks-sourcery-with-decentralized-databases/">Fission Tech Talk</a> a while back – but doesn't connect to Mainnet by default.</p><p><a href="https://tryquiet.org/">Quiet</a> is a chat app that uses IPFS to synch and connect devices, but on a network that is private to the connected devices.</p><p>Performance, privacy, or other considerations are all reasons that you might not want to use Mainnet, while still relying on the same codebases and technology stack.</p> Everywhere Computer and IPFS <p>Fission's primary product is the <a href="https://everywhere.computer/">Everywhere Computer</a>. This is the platform we're building on top of the open protocol InterPlanetary Virtual Machine (IPVM) that we developed alongside a number of collaborators in the UCAN and IPVM working groups.</p><p>The Everywhere Computer lets you run compute everywhere. This is accomplished by supporting WebAssembly functions that are published to IPFS, and by fetching and storing data that needs to be computed to and from IPFS. Separately, we use libp2p, the peer-to-peer networking layer that IPFS also runs on, to connect all of the compute providers, and to share receipts of results and other data across the network.</p><p>Simplistically, you could say IPVM and the Everywhere Computer add compute to IPFS.</p><p>Note that we didn't say "IPFS Mainnet" there. We heavily use content addressing in the design of the system, so that we can do things like cache functions on compute nodes, cache results across the network to skip computation all together, and many of the other optimizations you can do from edge devices to servers when you're using content addressing rather than location addressing.</p><p>The design of the Everywhere Computer will introduce the concept of Subnets. These will be default settings, permissions, optimized functions, and other configuration options that let anyone compose groups of computers to support different ecosystems and applications.</p><p>However, our default public beta subnet (cool name and logo forthcoming!) will connect to IPFS Mainnet. The public commons that the IPFS Mainnet represents is something that we've always been excited about and supported, and we're excited to add content-addressed compute with the Everywhere Computer.</p>You can watch a demo and overview of the Everywhere Computer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6n2dhjmYes&amp;t=10s">from our late Feb 2024 presentation</a><p>Across both public gateways and commercial providers, developers will be able to fetch data, run it through an IPVM compatible function, and then store the results back on IPFS Mainnet.</p><p><a href="https://everywhere.computer/">Sign up for the Everywhere Computer beta</a> if you'd like to be involved.</p> Gathering the Commons <p>Along with IP Shipyard, we're hosting an event today in Denver to share the news about IPFS Mainnet support, and start gathering the commons of people and organizations that are interested in supporting and improving this public global network.</p><p>Here are some questions to think about IPFS as Commons:</p><p>As an ecosystem, app or project that relies on the IPFS technology stack (whether it connects to Mainnet or you run a private network), what do you need and how do you want to provide support in return?</p><p>As a commercial provider, let's talk about inter-connecting our nodes and jointly running a more efficient network. If you rely on Kubo, go-libp2p, js-libp2p that are maintained by the IP Shipyard team, or other open source code bases, how do you plan on supporting them?

<p>According to the most recent PYMNTS Intelligence report, more than 40% of financial institutions (FIs) are seeing increasing volumes of fraud and financial crime. This puts credit unions between a rock and a hard place: friction vs security.</p>



<p>Quick catch-up: Traditional KYC methods often lead to tedious, friction-filled processes such as:</p>



 
 Manual processing 



 Relying on third parties 



 Physical branch visits 



 Delays in account access 



 The list can go on and on. 
 



<p>But this process is now obsolete thanks to reusable credentials.</p>



<p>Why it matters: With reusable credentials, credit unions only need to verify a member once. By applying cutting-edge technology, reusable credentials not only take friction out of your operations, but makes every touch point more secure than ever before.</p>



<p><a href="https://go.sudoplatform.com/rs/971-PEA-288/images/KYC%20eBook%202b.pdf?version=0">See how reusable credentials can revolutionize credit union operations in our new eBook, “KYC: A New Age of Less Fraud and Friction”.</a></p>



<p>The big picture: Say goodbye to “What is your mother’s maiden name?” With reusable credentials, credit unions will revolutionize their operations and create an incredible member experience with seamless interactions in every channel.</p>



 Dive deeper 







<p>Beyond credit union KYC: the ongoing friction struggle</p>



<p>Friction is an ongoing challenge for credit unions at every touch point. There can be different login or verification experiences at every channel.</p>



<p>The core issue that causes most of the friction in your operations is the temporary nature of current credit union KYC and identity verification. While the initial KYC process validates a member’s identity for account opening, this verification is a one-time use and cannot be reused. For members to have day-to-day interactions with their credit union they’ll have to repeatedly verify their identity. Not to mention that the current methods can be reproduced by bad actors.</p>



<p>Security questions can be easily guessed through social engineering, tellers may struggle to differentiate between fake and real IDs, and SMS-based verifications are often indistinguishable from phishing.</p>



<p>The current credit union KYC process not only causes delays in member service and satisfaction but also burdens employees in the fight against fraud, potentially leading to financial losses.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Give your members the experience of “pre-check”</p>



<p>Drawing inspiration from the success of TSA Pre-check&nbsp; in travel, Anonyome Labs’ solution introduces credentials that are persistent, irrefutable, and customer-controlled. By applying this concept to credit unions, the result is an elevated member experience where KYC becomes a persistent validation process.</p>



<p>&nbsp;With reusable credentials, credit unions only need to verify a member once, ensuring seamless and secure interactions from account sign-up to every subsequent touchpoint. This innovative technology eliminates the need for repetitive verifications, reducing friction in member interactions, and enhancing overall security. (All without disrupting existing solutions, processes, or member experiences.)</p>



<p></p>



<p>Tellers can focus on member experience instead of fake IDs</p>



<p>Only <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/PYMNTS-FIs-Revamping-Technologies-to-Fight-Financial-Crimes-December-2023.pdf">30% of financial institutions</a> plan on taking feedback from their employees or their customers’ needs when selecting solutions partners.</p>



<p>Reusable credentials will transform your member and employee experience. Employees, especially those in critical roles such as call centers and tellers, will be empowered to be more effective&nbsp;for the overall security and satisfaction of credit union members.</p>



<p>Tellers and employees often&nbsp; bear the responsibility of verifying member identities, a task full of pressure and potential security risks. With reusable credentials, the burden is significantly lifted, as the need for repetitive verifications.</p>



<p>Call center employees can shift their focus from identity validation to enhancing the member experience, fostering quicker response times and more efficient interactions. Similarly, tellers are no longer in high-stress situations like having to distinguish between genuine and forged IDs.</p>



<p>Providing usable credentials cultivates a positive atmosphere for both employees and credit union members.</p>







<p>Credit union KYC innovation is easy</p>



<p>Credit unions are losing members due to a lack of innovation. A <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/study/credit-union-innovation-real-time-payments-fintechs/">PYMNTS Intelligence</a> research study found:</p>



 
 27% of credit union members say they would consider changing financial institutions (FIs) to access new products or more innovative solutions. 



 This willingness to switch has increased to 27%, up from 17% since 2018. 



 The share of CU members willing to switch to more innovative solutions is very close to the number of non-CU members willing to do the same, 29%. 
 



<p>Between member’s preferences and the continual increase in fraud, it is vital for credit unions to implement new technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Partnering with a technology provider, like Anonyome Labs, makes adding cutting-edge technology to your existing operations not only doable, but seamless. <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Our technology</a> includes everything you need to build reusable credentials into your existing apps and systems. No need to rip and replace what’s been working for years.</p>



<p></p>



 FAQ: Reusable credentials and decentralized identity&nbsp; 



How do reusable credentials work?&nbsp;




<p>1. Initial identity verification: When a member joins a credit union or starts an account, a decentralized identity (DI) system verifies their identity using robust authentication methods.<br></p>







<p>2. Creation of reusable credentials: Once the member’s identity is verified, the DI system generates reusable credentials. These credentials are encrypted – making them tamper-proof and secure.<br></p>







<p>3. Ownership and control: Unlike traditional identity systems where organizations manage and store user data, decentralized identity gives ownership and control to the individual. For credit unions, this means the member owns their credentials and they are stored securely on their device, including the ability to store and present credentials from within your app and interfaces.<br></p>







<p>4. Verification at touchpoints: For every interaction with the credit union, whether it’s logging into an app, contacting the call center, or visiting a branch, the member can present their reusable credentials. These credentials serve as irrefutable proof of their identity without the need for repetitive verification processes.</p>



 




How can reusable credentials help credit unions?




 
 Enhanced security: Reusable credentials enhance security by reducing the reliance on traditional methods prone to fraud. For example, traditional security measures, such as security questions that can be exploited through social engineering or SMS-based verifications that are susceptible to phishing, are replaced by reusable credentials.<br> 
 







 
 Frictionless member experience: Reusable credentials ensure a seamless and frictionless experience for credit union members. Once verified, members enjoy a continuous and secure interaction across various touchpoints without the need for repeated identity checks.<br> 
 







 
 Privacy protection: Since members control their reusable credentials, they have the flexibility to share only the necessary information at each interaction. This is a privacy-centered approach that gives individuals greater control over their personal data.  
 



<p>Reusable credentials redefine the way identity is managed, placing control in the hands of members and ensuring a secure, convenient, and privacy-focused experience across various credit union touchpoints.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p><a href="https://go.sudoplatform.com/rs/971-PEA-288/images/KYC%20eBook%202b.pdf?version=0">See how reusable credentials can affect credit union operations here.</a></p>



 




What is decentralized identity?




<p>Decentralized identity (DI) is a shift in the way identity is managed. It is moving away from centralized systems controlled by organizations to a model where individuals have greater control over their own identity information.</p>



<p>A decentralized identity looks like this:</p>



 
 Reusable credentials: Identity credentials, once verified, can become reusable and portable across various services and applications. Users can present their credentials without the need for repeated identity verification, streamlining interactions and reducing friction.<br> 



 Tamper-proof technology: Decentralized identity uses technology, such as blockchain, to record and verify identity information. This technology ensures that the data is secure, tamper-proof, and resistant to single points of failure.<br> 



 Secure communication: By its very nature, decentralized identity provides perpetual, irrefutable, and secure communication across all channels, with built-in, ultra-secure and immediate authentication and identity validation. <br> 



 Reduced identity fraud: By giving individuals control over their identity and leveraging advanced security technology, DI can drastically reduce the risk of identity fraud.<br> 



 Privacy by design: Privacy is a fundamental principle of DI. Users have control over what information they share. This approach contrasts with centralized systems where users often give over control of their data.<br> 



 User control: Individuals own and control their identity information. Unlike traditional systems where large organizations store and manage user data, decentralized identity empowers individuals to own and manage their digital identities. Protecting both individuals and organizations. 
 



<p>Decentralized identity has the power to reshape how individuals interact with digital services, ensuring greater privacy, security, and user control over their identity. As the technology continues to evolve, DI solutions are becoming increasingly relevant across various industries, including finance, healthcare, and beyond.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drpaulashley/">Dr. Paul Ashley,</a> who’s spent over 25 years in the privacy and security space, says this about DI: “There’s been a decade of work before the projects the world is looking at now. I have rarely ever seen a technology that has been so thoughtfully designed as this from a security and privacy point of view.”</p>



<p></p>



<p><a href="https://privacyfiles.com/?p=447">Listen to the Privacy Files podcast episode where Dr. Paul Ashley explains decentralized identity to get the full picture</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 




How can reusable credentials prevent fraud?
 
 Cryptographic security: Reusable credentials use advanced tech (cryptography) to secure information. This makes credentials tamper-proof which reduces the risk of fraudsters attempting to manipulate or replicate identity information.<br> 



 Irrefutable proof of identity: Once a user’s identity is verified and made into a reusable credential, it is irrefutable proof of their identity. Traditional methods, such as security questions or SMS verifications, are more susceptible to social engineering or phishing.&nbsp;<br> 



 Reduced weak security points: Traditional KYC methods often include the exchange of sensitive information, creating potential attack points for fraudsters. Reusable credentials limit the places where fraudulent activities can occur.<br> 



 Decentralized ownership: With decentralized identity, users own and control their reusable credentials. This decentralization minimizes the risk of large-scale data breaches, as there’s no single data center storing a vast amount of sensitive user information. 
 



 




How can reusable credentials decrease friction?
 
 Seamless interactions: Reusable credentials streamline user interactions across various touchpoints, eliminating the need for repetitive identity verification. Once a user’s identity is verified and a reusable credential is established, subsequent interactions, whether online, in-app, or in-person, become seamless. This reduces friction and enhances the overall member experience.<br> 



 Single verification point: With reusable credentials, the need for repeated identity checks is gone. Users can verify their identity once, and the credentials can be used at different touchpoints without the necessity for additional verifications.<br> 



 Privacy and consent control: Users have control over what information is shared with service providers. They can selectively disclose only the necessary information for a particular interaction. This privacy-centric approach minimizes the amount of data exchanged, contributing to a smoother, more privacy-respecting user experience. 
 



 




Are reusable credentials being used in other industries?
<p>Reusable credentials are gaining traction and being explored in various industries beyond finance. Here are some examples:</p>



 
 Healthcare: In the healthcare sector, reusable credentials can play a vital role in securely managing patient identities, medical records, and access permissions. Patients could have portable credentials for verifying their identity during medical visits, and healthcare providers can access relevant information securely.<br> 



 Government services: Governments are exploring DI and reusable credentials for services such as issuing digital IDs, driver’s licenses, and other official documents. This approach can enhance security, reduce identity fraud, and provide citizens with more control over their personal information.<br> 



 Education: In the education sector, reusable credentials can be used for academic certifications and transcripts. Students could have a secure and portable credential that verifies their education, which they can present to employers or other educational institutions.<br> 



 Farming and mining: Regulated industries, such as farming and mining, require members to comply with established regulations and to perform compliance reporting to government agencies. Reusable credentials can be used in these two industries when submitting reports to government agencies or receiving certifications – even across wildly disparate certifying bodies and reporting organizations.<br> 



 Supply chain and logistics: Reusable credentials can be applied in supply chain and logistics for secure tracking of products and verifying the authenticity of goods. This can help prevent counterfeiting and ensuring the integrity of the supply chain.<br> 



 Travel and hospitality: The travel industry is exploring the use of reusable credentials for seamless and secure identity verification at airports, hotels, car rentals, and other travel-related services. This could simplify the check-in process and enhance the overall travel experience.<br> 



 Retail and e-commerce: Reusable credentials can enhance the security of online transactions in retail and e-commerce by providing users with a secure and portable identity for authentication. This can help reduce fraud in online purchases.<br> 



 Human resources and employment: For employment-related processes, reusable credentials can be used for verifiable employment history, certifications, and qualifications and even background checks. This can streamline the hiring process and provide employers with confidence in the candidate’s credentials. 
 




<p></p>



<p>Reusable credential technology is promising; widespread adoption across industries is still evolving. Various pilot programs, initiatives, and collaborations are underway to explore the potential of decentralized identity and reusable credentials in solving identity-related challenges, improving security, and better user experiences across industries.</p>

This token gives significant discounts to users of the Mattereum system when onboarding assets. Nine years ago I was part of the Ethereum team that wrote the rulebook for the future of finance and many other things, now Mattereum is delivering on this by enabling Real World Assets (RWA) to be put on chain safely and effectively. The landscape has been changed by TradFi deciding the future is tokenized assets. Mattereum’s system is the only one that can make this work. It provides an enforceable legal connection between the token representing an asset and the tokenized asset&nbsp;itself.</p><p>This has the power to completely transform finance for the future and make Mattereum bigger than&nbsp;Visa.</p><p>This is a once in a century transformation, like when music went&nbsp;digital</p><p>Please note that the Mattereum Discount Token (MATR) is available for purchase through <a href="https://mattereum.de/?utm_source=Medium&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=MATR-launch-2024-02-29">Mattereum GmbH</a>’s fully regulated German crypto exchange partner, <a href="http://swarm.com">Swarm</a>. Buying MATR is subject to terms and conditions in eligible jurisdictions — in particular, residents of the United Kingdom and the United States of America are excluded from the public sale of MATR. Sorry about that,&nbsp;folks.</p><p>==============================================================</p><p>At the end of January, Mattereum GmbH launched its token MATR* on Swarm, a German exchange regulated to the same level as a bank. As I write, prior to our big marketing push, it has already sold something in the region of $650k of tokens. This is the culmination of a long path that began, for Mattereum, back in 2017, but for me, much&nbsp;earlier.</p><p>Nine years ago (almost to the day!) I started as launch coordinator for Ethereum, and I set out the big vision for it in Ethereum’s launch document <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/by-the-end-of-this-article-youre-going-to-understand-blockchains-in-general-and-ethereum-a-next-e11df6a1d7cf">Programmable Blockchains In Context</a>. It was nothing less than a new vision for the blockchain, a vision based around smart contracts. Bitcoin’s launch in 2009 is conventionally seen as the inflection point, the moment when everything changed, the moment when the blockchain became the future. I am not so sure, we’d definitely never seen anything like that before, but Bitcoin was weird money, and decided to stay as weird money, even though the prospect of the blockchain being able to do everything could be seen by the far-sighted from the start — Satoshi got it, it’s there in the original <a href="https://bitcoinwhitepaper.co/">Bitcoin whitepaper</a> — “Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect&nbsp;buyers”.</p><p>So, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j23HnORQXvs">Ethereum</a> happened. The key thing that you could do with Ethereum that you could not do with Bitcoin was smart contracts; you could use the blockchain as a computer to execute digital contracts that would allow it to do almost anything. This loosed the true potential of the blockchain on the world — the ability to create new kinds of property, beyond money itself. It is perhaps this that was the true inflection point. In a <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/what-does-ether-100-mean-bb58522f781e">piece I wrote</a> when ETH hit $100 I described its origins as “a bunch of funny-looking villains pull together this remarkable piece of technology which, at the time, we thought was going to change the world”, and well, it kind of did, but maybe not how we envisaged it.</p><p>As I write this ETH has just hit $3500, the NFT craze, which needed Ethereum to function, has come and gone making a whole lot of people a bunch of money, then, just as quickly, losing it for them again. There have been scandals, frauds and rug pulls, and the entire reputation of the blockchain, particularly Ethereum, <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/be-realistic-demand-the-incorruptible-fa15d6401b0e">stank like a month-old kipper</a> for a while. But those of us with the long view know about the <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/at-the-turning-point-how-crypto-interacts-with-real-world-assets-b4bf3c4b217c">Perez Cycle</a>. This describes how world-changing innovations undergo a steep innovation curve, create unsustainable bubbles, which burst, ruin a lot of people, become radioactively untouchable for a while, then have the sound, workable elements picked up by mature actors and built into solid, useful and profitable long term businesses. We saw it in the dotcom boom, we saw it in 1929 with the stock market, and even with the railway boom way back in the mid-19th century. Out of these came web 2.0, the modern financial system, and most countries’ transport infrastructure. And so it is with Ethereum. What we have seen so far may not have embodied the vision we had for Ethereum, but that vision was not&nbsp;lost.</p><p>I have kept that vision in sight and sat tight. Mostly, the Mattereum team are old, at least compared to other blockchain people, and have seen the Perez Cycle before; one of our team ran a top level domain in the early 2000s and I lived through the dotcom crunch. While bull markets turn to bear markets and back, and crypto winters come and go, we have had our eyes on long-term mature use cases. We have spent the time doing the hard, complicated, slow work that builds the machinery to make Ethereum everything it was supposed to be so that it has a long-term future.</p><p>If you wonder why the blockchain has not got greater traction, why it has just been the locus of fads, fancies and scams, it is because it hasn’t had a mechanism to connect it to the real world. It’s been like an engine revving in isolation, it needs the gearbox to connect it to the wheels so that it has grip on the road and the traction to actually get somewhere. Mattereum has been building that gearbox, the thing that gives the Ethereum blockchain a way of grasping the physical world by firmly and legally connecting it to RWA. That way it can achieve what it was always meant to do. The reason I left the Ethereum Foundation was that I saw that this is what was needing to be done and it was becoming increasingly clear that they were not going to do it, so I needed to. Now I have, through Mattereum.</p><p>But what is it exactly that I have done? What was it that took six years and millions of dollars of investment? Mattereum has built the digital and legal infrastructure that enables the sale and lease of physical property and other assets through smart contracts using Ethereum. To do this we have created the Mattereum Asset Passport (MAP), which is a detailed product description of physical assets backed by legal warranties bundled together using smart contracts on the blockchain. With our partners at Swarm, we can now tokenize any asset a lawyer can recognise and fractionalize it too, and any asset or fraction of an asset comes with the Mattereum protections. This means that when you buy a real world asset token that has a MAP on Ethereum, you have unambiguous legal ownership of the linked physical asset. If you buy a token representing a gold bar, it enables you to turn up at the vault where the gold bar is stored and say “that specific gold bar there is mine” and have your claim accepted.</p><p>This is major — it is a potentially world-changing innovation.</p><p>Moreover, a MAP provides guarantees that the real world asset it describes is as claimed. If you buy a piece of real estate with a MAP that has been guaranteed to be in a certain condition and you turn up to find the roof leaks and the drains are blocked, you have the right to make a claim and be compensated. It is not just Mattereum that makes these promises, it is independent guarantors, and legal claims against them can be made in 172 jurisdictions worldwide — Mattereum’s legal infrastructure is built on UK common law provisions for digital commerce and is enforceable in 172 jurisdictions under international law. We help create a doubt-free environment for trade. We’ve started with gold, real estate, luxury goods, art, antiques, and other items where authenticity is particularly important, but ultimately our system could be used for everything. There are huge implications for this that I’ve explored in more depth <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">elsewhere</a>.</p><p>It’s easy to claim to put physical, real world stuff on chain, but it’s hard to prove that the stuff is real to a buyer on the other side of the world, and it’s even harder if that buyer is an AI (the Mattereum system also has important implications for enabling AI to connect to the physical world). Without the ability to prove that stuff is real, there’s no way to keep scammers out, and RWA scams will make the old NFT scams look trivial. Allow the scams to thrive and the long term viability of Ethereum as a global platform for trade will be doomed. Mattereum’s system squashes scammers like&nbsp;bugs.</p><p>If you buy things like stock in major companies, say Facebook or Tesla, due diligence is built in, but for most other things, like real estate, you have to do that work for yourself before you buy, and it’s expensive. Diligence is the hard problem in almost all financial transactions.</p><p>Mattereum solves this; it is essentially a diligence facilitation company for Ethereum. Any transaction done on Ethereum for an asset with a MAP has the diligence done automatically.</p><p>We can do this for Mattereum customers, but we can also do it for other companies in the RWA space. Making it work took time and money (a lot of both); other companies putting RWAs on the blockchain don’t have to repeat that work, we can provide our system to them as a service, giving them a shortcut to secure and reliable tokenization and fractionalization.</p><p>Mattereum has built upon successive waves of innovation on the blockchain that have peaked and then crashed, building as more and more people get involved. At each step there are ten times the number of people involved than were in the previous wave, and each time that happens the story changes radically. Eventually the innovation reaches escape velocity and goes stratospheric, and, I believe, this is where we are&nbsp;now.</p><p>Our system has the potential to be the rails on which the future of commerce runs. Serious TradFi people are getting it; <a href="https://x.com/radarhits/status/1746155031265489197?s=46&amp;t=kMmiWeWpV1U1zyPrnuPkAA">Larry Fink from BlackRock Capital </a>has come out in favour of a tokenized future, saying that their great new horizon is tokenization of every real world financial asset, and Mark Yusko, founder of Morgan Creek Capital Management, has followed him, <a href="https://twitter.com/EstateProtocol/status/1751673693141361095">saying</a> “everything of value in the world will eventually be a token”. The City of London, too, gets it, the world’s leading financial centre. The Lord Mayor, who heads the City, has set up his <a href="https://www.mainelli.org/?page_id=3704">Smart Economy Networks</a> project, which has tokenized assets as a major plank and actually names Mattereum as a key company in the network. Before all this, Sir Geoffrey Vos, the Master of the Rolls, head of the UK’s civil justice system, involved Mattereum in the development of the UK’s <a href="https://share-eu1.hsforms.com/1ZYEqf0C5RyKJ-hw8HuIDLwg7g8s?__hstc=210657930.bd681f8e55dc4f22c4da469838e87c56.1708433139509.1708433139509.1708433139509.1&amp;__hssc=210657930.1.1708433139509&amp;__hsfp=3782222774">Digital Dispute Resolution Rules</a> (DDRR) as he <a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Speech-MR-to-Smarter-Contracts-Report-Launch-Lawtech-UK-UKJT-Blockchain-Smart-Contracts.pdf">is a firm believer in the blockchain</a> as the future of commerce, and sees the opportunities offered by Mattereum’s innovations. Mattereum has gone on to be the first company to use the DDRR in their&nbsp;work.</p><p>Over the past ten years we’ve gone from a single lone hero talking about building smart contracts into Bitcoin (Vitalik’s <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/mastercoin-a-second-generation-protocol-on-the-bitcoin-blockchain-1383603310">MasterCoin</a>) to the leaders of TradFi insisting that blockchains, tokenization and similar are the future of&nbsp;finance.</p><p>We nailed this. Too early to know if we won or not, but back in 2015, the Ethereum team wrote the rulebook for the future of finance and many other things. Now Mattereum is delivering on&nbsp;it.</p><p>In the end it’s about the&nbsp;money.</p><p>How much&nbsp;money?</p><p>All of it: how much information is left offline these days in unscanned paper books and undigitized music? A few percent. What we are doing is like that, but with money and assets. We have the potential to be bigger than Visa; I had long conversations about Mattereum with Dee Hock, Visa’s founder, and he did not think this was ridiculous.</p><p>Ethereum is now hitting Early Adopters where institutions with real use cases stop trying to fit the technology into their existing technology stack, and start moving their assets on to Ethereum’s technology stack, Mattereum is here to guarantee that this works. This is the beginning of “TradFi” and “DeFi” merging into, well, just&nbsp;“Fi”.</p><p>This is a once in a century transformation, like when music went digital. That doesn’t happen&nbsp;twice.</p><p>We held back on issuing a token until now, until we were sure we were being lifted by an unstoppable rising tide, and the legal, licensing and regulatory environment were ready. We could have leapt onboard with one during the ICO goldrush with everyone else, but our strategic mindset said “wait”, and we were not wrong. With the mature use case for the blockchain that we were planning for now being understood by the serious players, now is the time, so the decision was taken to launch MATR, a token offering discounts on Mattereum’s products and services.</p><p>Mattereum’s purpose is to provide a legal structure for RWA operations on the blockchain so that when users buy a tokenized asset such as real estate or gold, the purchaser of the token unambiguously owns the connected physical asset, or a fraction of the physical asset if it has been fractionalized as well. As a result, it was particularly important for any token associated with the Mattereum Group to be constructed in a legally sound way that provides the protections for purchasers that many other tokens fail to do. Without such protections other token buyers are vulnerable to rug-pulls and other sharp (and illegal) practices. To do this, Mattereum’s chosen path was to incorporate a subsidiary in Germany (Mattereum GmbH) which could mint and sell the MATR token through Swarm, a fully regulated and licensed German exchange operating under the same regulations and to the same standards as TradFi banking institutions in Germany and so providing customers with equivalent protections.</p><p>This was not, perhaps, the simplest route, but it was the one that gave MATR the absolutely best protection. We believe we are the first group to issue a token through an exchange regulated under the same rules as banks, but we hope this paves the way for more people to do things the same way. It involved more lawyers and negotiation than other routes, but it works, and now we’ve done it we can help others do it too, adding assistance with token issue processes to Mattereum’s portfolio.</p><p>The <a href="https://mattereum.de/token-whitepaper/?utm_source=Medium&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=MATR-launch-2024-02-29">Mattereum Discount Token White Paper</a> gives the exact formal details of how the MATR token works, but essentially it offers a discount on Mattereum fees for transactions with real world assets on chain, such as Onboarding Fees and Certifier Fees. Each token used reduces the fee by 1% and given that, in turn, onboarding fees are 1% of the assets’ selling price, for the kind of assets we’ll be onboarding, the discount received for using a token could be substantial. Let’s just have a look at how that would play out in a real transaction:</p><p>If a client wishes to onboard a $1m asset, the onboarding fee would be $10,000. If they use MATR tokens to reduce this fee, each token reduces the onboarding fee by 1% (subject to a maximum discount of USD $10,000), and a user can burn up to 50 tokens per asset. So for that $1m asset this means that burning the maximum of 50 tokens would result in a 50% reduction in the onboarding fee, or $5000. For that transaction each token would represent a cost saving of $100, and they are currently on sale* at $0.65 per token (going up in increments to $2.00 until the sale ends on 4 July — details are in the white&nbsp;paper).</p> We think this will be&nbsp;popular.  VINAY GUPTA Mattereum Founder and&nbsp;CEO <p><a href="https://mattereum.de/get-tokens?utm_source=Medium&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=MATR-launch-2024-02-29">Find out more about Mattereum GmbH’s token&nbsp;sale*.</a></p><p>*The Mattereum Discount Token (MATR) is available for purchase through Mattereum GmbH’s fully regulated German crypto exchange partner, Swarm. Buying MATR is subject to terms and conditions in eligible jurisdictions — in particular, residents of the United Kingdom and the United States of America are excluded from the public sale of&nbsp;MATR.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/permanent-summer-the-new-matr-token-and-why-the-rwa-bull-market-goes-on-forever-0d4fb0f7c3e9">PERMANENT SUMMER: THE NEW MATR TOKEN…And Why The RWA Bull Market Goes On Forever*</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, have sparked a revolution in the ownership and exchange of unique digital assets. This innovation has birthed a burgeoning market where creators and collectors can engage in buying, selling, and trading. However, traditional NFTs, often referred to as “collectible NFTs,” are heavily influenced by market conditions, leading to volatility in values and, more importantly, volatility in interest.</p><p>In response, we propose the concept of “utility NFTs,” which offer a more practical and versatile approach. Unlike collectible NFTs, utility NFTs are issued and managed by enterprises or organizations for their customers and users, serving as a means of interaction. In this article, the first of a series showcasing Aergo’s future strategies and initiatives, we’ll unveil our roadmap for the rest of the year, packed with some significant updates.</p><p>Collectible vs Functional</p><p>Initially, many collectible NFTs primarily revolved around speculative trading. Although they can be widely accepted and utilized in dynamic sectors including gaming, the liquidity dynamics within NFT marketplaces tend to align with market conditions, posing challenges for enterprises seeking to integrate them directly into their services or products. Moreover, collectible NFTs are commonly associated with artistic and creative endeavors such as visual art, music, theater, and literature, further complicating efforts to sustain long-term value.</p><p>In contrast, utility NFTs position themselves with a real-world business component. The most distinguishable use case is probably in identification, where uniquely issued tokens offer a secure and reliable means of verifying individuals’ identities. They serve as a digital representation of one’s identity for premium membership and a gateway for accessing exclusive content, including the metaverse and other Web3 platforms.</p><p>Why Aergo Focuses on the&nbsp;Segment?</p><p>It is important to lure individual users through a user-friendly environment and B2C marketing for the organic growth of a platform. However, we have shifted our focus more towards the enterprise side of the&nbsp;market.</p><p>Enterprise-led NFT segment offers a unique opportunity as it automatically brings in loyal users and fosters a strong foundation for long-term collaboration and mutual growth. Additionally, enterprise involvement often lends credibility and stability to the NFT ecosystem.</p>Enterprise-led NFT Growth Trajectories<p>One example of Aergo’s enterprise-led NFT initiative is <a href="https://www.samsung.com/sg/members//samsung-members-nft/">Samsung Members regional NFT in Southeast Asia &amp; Oceania</a>. Samsung Members NFT serves as a key enabling holders to unlock exclusive experiences and rewards with Samsung. Samsung leverages NFTs as a gateway to its imaginary universe, <a href="https://www.samsung.com/ph/members/whats-new/new-drop-the-epic-club-nft-collection/">the Kaleidoscope</a>.</p><p>The number total count of unique digital assets(NFTs) created is gradually increasing. The recent transaction spike on Feb 21st is also linked to this initiative. While specifics are under NDAs and cannot be disclosed yet, it’s evident that more enterprises, as well as government affiliates and agencies, are venturing into the NFT market. We will reveal more details for various projects as they progress, sharing insights into our ongoing initiatives and the exciting developments ahead</p><p>Despite challenging market conditions, Aergo has made significant strides in establishing itself within the enterprise blockchain market. With a focus on efficiency and enterprise-friendliness, Aergo, Blocko, and CCCV are expanding to establish more use cases in the enterprise-led NFT initiative through strategic partnerships driven by the increasing demand for innovation within this&nbsp;segment.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/digital-assets-as-a-gateway-expanding-enterprise-led-nft-initiative-cb770dcf44ec">Digital Assets as a Gateway: Expanding Enterprise-led NFT Initiative</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Happy Birthday, dear Chameleons! 🎂🎉</p><p>A year ago, on February 28, 2023, we launched the Shyft DAO Ambassador Program, and what a journey it has been! To celebrate this milestone, we’re taking a moment to look back at the incredible path we’ve traveled together this first year, filled with achievements, challenges, and&nbsp;growth.</p> Early Beginnings <p>From the get-go, our Ambassador Program was joined by more than 9o active Apprentices, all eager to support our mission. Your energy and commitment, dear Chameleons, were infectious, and quickly led to 16 of the most outstanding performers stepping up as Ambassadors by March. This number grew to 21 by April, showing just how vibrant and dedicated our community is.</p><p>In June, the Ambassadors took the lead with the #DiscoverShyft campaign, spreading the word far and wide and bringing our message to over 241,465 people across social media. That’s a real&nbsp;feat!</p><p>We also celebrated the top contributors who had the most tweets in the #DiscoverShyft campaign — a real testament to hard work and passion. @Lauriano, @October, @September, @Manusan, and @Lucas — your efforts have been nothing short of inspiring!✨</p><p>And by the end of June, we also introduced the WotNot Made of Fire Collection, the first edition of Shyft DAO NFT series for all our members. Inspired by our iconic mascot, WotNot — the legendary detective known for its magical ability to change colors — this collection represents the spirit and adventure of our community.</p> Together Forward <p>As with everything grand, it wasn’t all smooth sailing. In October last year, we faced a spooky challenge when our Discord link got compromised. Yet, our quick response and the community’s resilience showed just how strong and secure we are together.</p><p>We listened and learned throughout the year, evolving our tasks to focus more on quality than speed, ensuring that everyone, regardless of their time zone, could contribute meaningfully. Our qualitative tasks, like creative videos and insightful tweets, have brought out the best in our ambassadors, highlighting the importance of thoughtful participation.</p><p>In the first month of 2024, our spirited Festive Campaign came to a close, overwhelming us with gratitude for our community’s incredible participation.</p><p>Our latest campaign on the successful rollout of User Signing in February also proved to be a resounding success, demonstrating the power of community engagement and the sharing of knowledge.</p><p>A total of 19 dedicated participants consistently contributed to the campaign with a total of 115 insightful tweets. These tweets not only sparked lively discussions but also shared valuable insights on the importance and intricacies of user signing within our ecosystem.</p><p>This shows that the creativity and insights our community shared through tweets, videos, and memes brightened our campaigns and deepened the understanding of Shyft Network, Veriscope, and User&nbsp;Signing.</p> Birthday Gifts &amp;&nbsp;Thoughts <p>As we mark a year of incredible progress and collaboration, we’re also kicking off celebrations in&nbsp;style.</p><p>For a limited time, we will be opening up the opportunity for everyone in our community to mint special WotNot Made of Fire NFTs without needing to be on a whitelist. This is our way of saying thank you and letting everyone share in the success of the past&nbsp;year.</p><p>❤️To mint, go to: <a href="https://launchpad.heymint.xyz/mint/wotnot-made-of-fire">https://launchpad.heymint.xyz/mint/wotnot-made-of-fire</a></p><p>For our dedicated Ambassadors, we have something extra special: the exclusive chance to mint WottNot Made of Water NFTs starting today. These unique NFTs are a token of our appreciation for the relentless support and commitment our Ambassadors have shown throughout the&nbsp;year.</p><p>💚To mint, go to: <a href="https://launchpad.heymint.xyz/mint/wotnot-made-of-water">https://launchpad.heymint.xyz/mint/wotnot-made-of-water</a></p><p>🔍 But that’s not all — we’re also introducing an exciting opportunity for our community members. Anyone who mints an NFT featuring a magnifying glass between February 27 and March 3 will automatically be entered into a lottery. Three lucky winners will be chosen at random to receive SHFT tokens worth 50 USDC&nbsp;each.</p><p>This journey has been made possible by every Apprentice, Ambassador, and community member who believed in the Shyft DAO mission and contributed their time, creativity, and passion to its expansion and success. Here’s to another year of growth, innovation, and community. 🎊</p><p>The <a href="https://shyftdao.org/">Shyft DAO </a>community is committed to building a decentralized, trustless ecosystem that empowers its members to collaborate and make decisions in a transparent and democratic manner.

<p>This month Google and Yahoo introduced crucial changes to their email delivery requirements. For senders targeting individual Gmail accounts, particularly those exceeding 5,000 emails daily, Google mandates authentication measures. While Yahoo does not state a minimum sending requirement, it will align with Google’s criteria.</p>
<p>Requirements that are to be enforced:</p>
 
 Implementation of both SPF + DKIM 
 Sending with an aligned “From” domain in either the SPF or DKIM domains 
 Sending from a domain with a DMARC policy of at least p=none 
 Using a TLS connection for transmitting email 
 Valid forward and reverse DNS (FCrDNS) 
 One-click unsubscribe (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8058">RFC 8058</a>) 
 Low spam reported rate 
 
<p>Full requirements can be found in <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/81126">Google’s help article</a>.</p>
<p>What are the implications of non-compliance with Google and Yahoo’s email standards?</p>
<p>Failure to adhere to the new email standards set by Google and Yahoo could mean non-delivery to Gmail and Yahoo inboxes, affecting businesses relying on email communication.</p>
<p>These new requirements aim to fortify email security globally, emphasizing industry-acknowledged best practices. Safeguarding business reputation from phishing attacks is one of the top benefits of these changes. DMARC, now a <a href="https://blog.google/products/gmail/gmail-security-authentication-spam-protection/">steadfast requirement</a>, blocks domain impersonation, providing control over email identity. Google emphasizes the validation of sender authenticity for enhanced email security.</p>
<p>Take action now: Reduce email phishing and ensure deliverability</p>
<p>Strong authentication with DMARC and <a href="https://www.entrust.com/vmc">Verified Mark Certificates (VMCs)</a> is an important milestone for email users.</p>
<p>Entrust has been working with mailbox providers since June 2017 to create Brand Indicators for Message Identification (<a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/faq/what-is-bimi">BIMI</a>) with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.entrust.com/vmc">Verified Mark Certificates (VMCs)</a>, digital certificates that enable organizations to display their registered trademark logo in the avatar slot alongside outgoing emails in many mailboxes today. BIMI standards aim to make the email ecosystem more secure and engaging with DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance) and VMCs.</p>
<p>VMCs help an organization’s emails stand out and get noticed in a crowded inbox while protecting them against fraud through DMARC’s anti-spoofing technology. Entrust also offers DMARC implementation services to help customers in their BIMI journey. Check if your domain is BIMI ready using this free <a href="https://redsift.com/tools/bimi">online tool</a> from our partner Red Sift.</p>
<p>As Google and Yahoo make email authentication mandatory, industry-wide adoption of these practices is crucial. Businesses can ensure compliance for improved email deliverability and overall security.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Over the past few years, digital transformation has been relentless. Businesses of all sizes are at the forefront, continuously adapting to an ever-evolving digital landscape. One of the biggest challenges is managing the surge in cyberattacks, where the number and sophistication of phishing attacks have reached unprecedented levels, especially since the adoption of <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/09/generative-ai-security-challenges-fighting-fire-with-fire/">generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)</a> has led to cybercriminals being able to launch more accurate and effective phishing campaigns.</p>
<p>The need to protect your organization from threats has never been greater. The introduction of regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) has also spotlighted the necessity for data security and compliance. On top of it all, with the omnipresence of smart devices and the IoT, we’re living in an era where everything is connected. This interconnectedness, along with the growing reliance on <a href="https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/25362/card-not-present-transactions--friend-or-foe--transaction-volumes-are-soaring-but-so-is-fraud">card-not-present (CNP) transactions</a> facilitated by digital wallets such as Apple Pay and Google Pay, accentuates the need for secure digital payment mechanisms.</p>
<p>Customers demand secure, seamless digital experiences</p>
<p>Along with these challenges, today’s customers have become well-informed, and their demands have never been clearer. They want a <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/">mobile-first experience</a>, where their digital journey is seamless on their preferred device. Beyond just accessibility, they expect robust protection against fraud and the looming threats of advanced cyberattacks.</p>
<p>Speed and ease are paramount, with customers seeking frictionless access that doesn’t compromise their security and allows them to switch seamlessly from one device to another to continue their journey. Furthermore, the modern customer isn’t content with a one-size-fits-all approach. They want <a href="https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/17380/601818?utm_source=brighttalk-portal&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=topic&amp;utm_content=upcoming">personalized digital interactions</a>, tailor-made to resonate with their unique preferences.</p>
<p>Customer identity and access management (CIAM)</p>
<p>An effective customer identity and access management (CIAM) solution streamlines the digital onboarding process, making sign-ups both user-friendly and secure. It should support various login methods, including single sign-on (SSO), and integrate with popular social media platforms to streamline registration and login through social login. More than just managing identities, a CIAM solution enhances decision-making through intelligent access and detailed risk assessments, ensuring identity data remains consistent and unified across all platforms.</p>
<p>A CIAM solution’s impact on today’s business landscape is profound. It improves the user experience, which leads to increased sign-ups. This paves the way for building trust, as businesses can cultivate customer confidence with rigorous privacy measures and create personalized interactions. By delivering tailored services and products, the CIAM solution can boost sales and customer loyalty, while prioritizing safety through proactive fraud prevention.</p>
<p>The Entrust difference</p>
<p>At Entrust, our vision of the CIAM lifecycle is holistic. Starting with seamless digital onboarding, our system is designed to efficiently capture and manage customer identity. Robust authentication protocols are then employed to verify user access, ensuring that only genuine and verified users gain entry. Proactive identity management provides comprehensive oversight throughout the entire customer journey, from sign-up to eventual offboarding.</p>
<p>Administration is equally paramount, with policy enforcement mechanisms and measures to ensure continuous compliance. Lastly, in line with modern demands, our CIAM system is equipped to provide tailored engagements, crafting custom experiences that build deeper customer bonds.</p>
<p>Our identity verification (IDV) and digital signing capabilities, together with the ease of social logins, make remote customer onboarding customers easy. This trio of technologies is pivotal in transforming user experiences across a broad spectrum of industries:</p>
 
 In the financial sector, it enables banks and fintech companies to rapidly verify and onboard new customers, streamlining account openings and loan applications 
 Healthcare organizations leverage this technology for secure patient registration and to ensure compliance with privacy regulations 
 Government bodies utilize these tools for efficient citizen onboarding, offering access to services with enhanced security and convenience 
 In the retail e-commerce space, these solutions simplify the shopping experience, making it easier for consumers to authenticate their identities, sign up for services, and complete transactions securely – all from the comfort of their homes or on the go

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Warwick Ashford</a></p><p>We undoubtedly live in interesting times, at least in terms of technological innovation. And like most things in life, this can either be a blessing or a curse, depending on how we respond to it. Technology certainly provides new opportunities, but these are typically accompanied by a set of challenges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A good example of this is the proliferation of internet-connected devices that have quickly become part of everyday life. These range from smartphones, smartwatches, and fitness trackers in the home that make up the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/wp80423/enabling-the-digital-business-with-identity-for-the-internet-of-things">internet of things</a> (IoT); to automatic and remote climate control, occupancy monitoring, and smart access controls in the office; to sensors and trackers for temperature, pressure, air quality, and noise levels on the factory floor that make up the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/identity_securing_iiot">industrial internet of things</a> (IIoT); to patient, blood glucose, heart rate, hygiene, and mood monitors that make of the internet of medical things (IoMT).&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Challenges associated with internet-connected devices&nbsp; 
<p>While all these devices are aimed at improving efficiency, productivity, and quality of life, they all come with challenges. The rapid adoption of these devices is increasing the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc81218/attack-surface-management">attack surface</a>, making it challenging to manage and secure every device; the lack of standardized security protocols and frameworks across these devices leads to inconsistencies in security implementations; the lack of focus on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/csls2020_2020_11_11_fernandez-cuesta">security by design</a> leads to vulnerabilities; these devices often collect and transmit sensitive data, raising privacy concerns; and weak <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/risk-based-case-for-zero-trust-authentication-eic2023">authentication</a> and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/mc71144/dynamic-authorization-management">authorization</a> mechanisms can lead to unauthorized access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the challenges do not end there. Inadequate network security measures may expose devices to cyberattacks; vulnerabilities introduced during the manufacturing and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc81221/software-supply-chain-security">supply chain</a> process may be exploited by attacker; devices can be tampered with; managing the entire lifecycle of devices, including updates and patches; and decentralized data processing in edge computing introduces additional security vulnerabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Identity key to addressing IoT challenges&nbsp; 
<p>Identity plays a crucial role in addressing challenges associated with IoT, IIoT, and IoMT devices. Establishing identities for devices and users can ensure that only authorized entities have access to specific resources and functionality, while identity-based access policies enable organizations to define and enforce fine-grained authorization rules to improve security.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assigning unique identities to devices enables secure authentication, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized devices can connect to a network, while implementing mutual authentication between devices and the network enhances overall security.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations can help prevent unauthorized access to internet-connected devices by managing the identity lifecycle proactively by implementing secure provisioning processes and ensuring that devices are decommissioned when no longer in use.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Establishing identities for devices (<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/standards-framework-non-human-identities-eic2023">non-human identities</a>) and users enables organizations to analyze and monitor behavioral patterns. Anomalies indicating potential security threats can be detected and addressed promptly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations can improve privacy protection in consumer-facing applications by associating user identities with devices to enable personalized services, while respecting consumer privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use of standardized identity protocols such as <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/3083/2">OAuth</a> and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5077">OpenID Connect</a> ensures consistent and security identity management practices for internet-connected devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tracking device and user identities helps with regulatory compliance because it enables organizations to demonstrate adherence to regulatory requirements and industry standards through identity-based audit logs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 It is all in the approach&nbsp; 
<p>And implementing a <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/insights/zero-trust">zero trust</a> approach, where devices are not automatically trusted and must authenticate before accessing resources, will improve security but requires robust identity management during the onboarding process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identity-centric approaches, therefore, can contribute significantly to a more controlled, accountable, and secure environment, addressing many of the challenges introduced by the rapid adoption of internet-connected devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Join the international identity community at KuppingerCole’s <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">European Identity &amp; Cloud conference</a> #EIC2024&nbsp; in June to discuss every aspect of identity across the wider IT landscape.

<p>Those who have been following Holochain for a while have heard of <a href="https://www.ioen.tech/?ref=blog.holochain.org">The Internet of Energy Network (IOEN)</a>. In short, IOEN’s goal is to support a sustainable energy transition by enabling microgrids of local renewables to collectively account for the energy they produce and to engage in the global financial market.&nbsp;</p><p>To do this, they need a way for the individuals and communities that make up these microgrids to document their energy generation in a verifiable manner.</p><p>Holochain, <a href="https://rainlang.xyz/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Rainlang</a>, <a href="https://gildlab.xyz/?ref=blog.holochain.org">GildLab</a>, and IOEN have teamed up to bring a working demonstration of verifiable energy to ETHDenver 2024. This will show how you can build a verifiable data system on Holochain and connect that system to an EVM, accessing financial opportunities like semi-fungible tokens and renewable energy certificates.</p> The Demo <p>To demonstrate the possibilities of verifiable energy generation at ETHDenver we are scaling down to the human level. With an <a href="https://www.getoffthegrid.ca/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Off the Grid</a> exercise bike set up as a human powered generator, we’re asking event participants to join in and create some energy with us.&nbsp;</p><p>As the bike produces a charge it will be measured with a sensor on its way to charge a battery. This data is then fed into a raspberry pi running a Holochain app that will transmit this data to an auditable <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DHT</a>. To tie that particular instance of energy generation to the person riding the bike, we’ll have them scan a QR code to connect the <a href="https://tokenproof.xyz/?ref=blog.holochain.org">tokenproof app</a> (which they used for their ETHDenver tickets). Along with the profile from their tickets and the measurement of energy generated, an observer will post photographic evidence of the particular person riding the bike at the particular time that energy was generated.</p><p>Then, human power credits (developed for this demo) are minted and sent to the wallet the rider connected. These are then placed into the IOEN marketplace, where they will be aggregated into IOEN renewable energy certificates (IOEN RECs), and bought and retired using IOEN tokens — showing end-to-end value, tracking and transparency of data through the Holochain app, and showcasing opportunities for liquidity in decentralized energy generation and finance.</p> Demonstrating Verifiable Data <p>The exact data fields collected are particular to this demonstration. What is important are the ways we can layer data sources, building up context so that we can verify an event that occurred in the real world.&nbsp;</p><p>Having multiple sources of data which authenticate the same event allows for outside observers to verify the generation of that energy, compensating the individuals who generated the energy.&nbsp; Holochain provides a self-validating system where this data can be stored and managed. Because you can audit not just storage but also actions within Holochain it allows data to be updated over time. And because Holochain uses distributed peer-to-peer networks, there aren’t the data limits or transaction costs of blockchains. Plus now with Rainlang, we can <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-a-new-link-in-web3/">connect the data in Holochain to EVM transactions</a>, securely linking the financials with the data.</p><p>This system has been developed to prototype verifiable data, and these same principles can be customized to any particular use case. Different regulators need different types of information depending on the industry. The goal is to show how multiple data sources can be layered in a self-validating environment and used to connect the digital environment to real world assets. From there, systems for automated witnessing and the validation of outputs can be developed.</p> The Use Case <p>So, what is the use case at scale?</p><p>Renewable energy certificates (RECs) offer businesses a way to offset their use of non-renewable energy by supporting renewables. Currently these certificates are measured in MWh (megawatt hours) and often require extensive reporting and expensive auditors in order to be validated. This makes them often inaccessible to small or distributed producers, as only larger generating sources (like windfarms or larger solar arrays) can bear the cost to validate their energy production and receive the right to sell their certificates.</p><p>IOEN has partnered with PV BLOX which is supporting new markets and installations for small scale solar and renewable microgrids in South East Asia. These producers are households as well as companies with solar panels on their roofs. In order to provide proof of the renewable energy that they generate, they need to gather multiple sources of data together that can then be presented to third party auditors to validate before passing that on to government agencies who issue the RECs.</p><p>For this particular use case, the data collected is mimicked in our demo with the bike. First, they need to show how much energy they are producing; this is measured by a reading off their meter. To corroborate that the energy is being generated from a renewable source, they also take a photo of their new panels. Now, all of that data collection is happening locally and is self-reported. To add an additional layer from a third party source, they also include satellite photos of before and after the solar installation. Together, all of this data from PV BLOX is then held in IOEN’s Holochain app, allowing the local producers to directly hold their data, while also having it held by the network and accessible to auditors and others as needed. Because every action within Holochain is validated, the data can’t be replaced or altered without a trail of those changes attached to the original entry. This makes it easy for auditors to verify the data collected from these multiple sources, checking the claim of energy generated against the approximate capacity to generate. This creates a ‘direct line of sight’ from auditors, regulators, and purchasers to the underlying data (amount of energy generated) supporting the asset (the REC, now on-chain).</p><p>IOEN helps PV BLOX aggregate the data from the producers so that the energy they generate can be accounted for collectively. This is then presented to auditors and the relevant agencies, and RECs are granted and then sold either bilaterally or through the IOEN/PV BLOX marketplace. The funds from that sale are then fractionalized and sent across the value chain to reward participants, including the producers based on their individual energy generation.</p><p>With integrations for tokenizing the assets almost finished, the ETHDenver demo is the prototype that shows how this will function embedded with Holochain when complete.&nbsp;</p> The Finances <p>So, what does any of this have to do with blockchains?</p><p>By connecting the sale and consumption of RECs to the financial markets of blockchains, we can open up a few new DeFi-driven opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>For one, global liquidity and investment. For small producers, ease of fractionalization is important to scale up opportunities for finance. When a REC is sold, those profits are automatically dispersed to the producers, without the money being held up, captured opaquely, or lost in bureaucratic channels. And because the transactions are in a secure, public space, producers can check them to ensure fairness — creating upfront, open, and transparent business relations for those in the chain, and a fairer distribution of the profits.</p><p>Secondly, to increase future liquidity and financing options, IOEN is working with the new financial tool of semi-fungible tokens. In their implementation, they have fungible tokens representing units of energy which can be traded on the open market and NFTs representing RECs which can be pre-bought or held as a single MWh to offset carbon emissions. This NFT points to the data held in Holochain, showing all of the details of that particular REC, where and how the energy was produced, who audited it, etc. If that REC is to be retired or sold, the owner must balance the underlying energy value of the REC with the fungible tokens. The uniqueness of each REC will allow for a differentiation between their values, depending on the practices of their production, their level of verifiability, etc. Thus, by keeping a public account of all the relevant details, these financial tools will help encourage investment in more just and sustainable energy.&nbsp;</p> What It Means <p>IOEN is opening access to global financial opportunities and creating an economy of scale by aggregating small producers. This is part of a strategy for transition. By leveraging DeFi to finance a sustainable energy transition, the goal is to eventually move to a truly decentralized physical infrastructure for renewable energy generation. At some point, renewable energy certificates won’t matter because every factory, store, transportation service, and everything else we now see as polluters will be powered by locally produced renewables. Microgrids, with mutual credit currencies to manage and account for the local production and consumption of energy, auditable at the global level, will be the DePIN future for energy. IOEN is developing the tools that will help us make that transition and build the foundations of that future. </p>

  <p>Howdy folks!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I'm thrilled to announce support for additional capabilities now available for&nbsp;Conditional Access reauthentication policy scenarios. Reauthentication policy lets you require users to interactively provide their credentials again - typically before accessing critical applications and taking sensitive actions. Combined with Conditional Access session control of Sign-in frequency, you can require reauthentication for users and sign-ins with risk, or for Intune enrollment. With today's public preview, now you can require reauthentication for any resource protected by Conditional Access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To tell you more about this capability, I’ve invited Inbar Cizer Kobrinsky, Principal Product Manager at Microsoft Entra, to talk about the scenarios and configuration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, and please let us know your thoughts!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alex Weinert&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>--&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi everyone!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m excited to tell you more about the public preview capabilities that we’re adding to the “Sign-in frequency – every time” session control in Conditional Access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Single sign-on (SSO) using modern authentication is like a secret sauce for productivity and security. It improves productivity because users can access applications smoothly without signing in to each one with their credentials. SSO also enhances security because it reduces the risks of credential reuse and gives you a common point for control and logging for your Zero Trust deployments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, there are situations where you may want the user's input, such as interactive authentication, before accessing a resource. One of these situations is token theft. A token theft attack occurs when threat actors compromise and replay tokens issued to a user, even if that user has satisfied multifactor authentication (MFA). Because authentication requirements are met, the threat actor is granted access to organizational resources by using the stolen token. Risk-based reauthentication policies can help lower the risk that results from a token theft, requiring threat actors to compromise a fresh token to regain system access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, let's look at some additional examples of these situations, where you may want to prompt the user for reauthentication:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Accessing high-risk resources, such as connecting to a VPN.&nbsp; 
 Activating a privileged role in Privileged Identity Management (PIM).&nbsp; 
 Performing an action within an application, such as changing personal information in an HR application.&nbsp; 
 Critical actions such as Intune enrollment or updating credentials.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Risky sign-ins, as called out above, help reduce and mitigate the risk of token theft.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>With the latest update, you now can create policies requiring interactive reauthentication for any application or authentication context protected by Conditional Access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the example below, we’ve created a reauthentication policy for super sensitive actions, such as wire transfer. We’re using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/developer-guide-conditional-access-authentication-context">authentication context</a>, which the developer has integrated into the application. Before a user can transfer any amount from the application, they must satisfy the Conditional Access policy that targets this authentication context.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Create a "sign-in frequency - every time" policy for super sensitive actions using authentication context</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Conditional Access policy for this authentication context requires phishing-resistant authentication (using authentication strength) and “Sign-in frequency – every time”. The next time a user attempts to make a wire transfer, they will be required to reauthenticate with a phishing-resistant MFA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 IDnow’s recently released UK Fraud Awareness Report explores the nation’s awareness of the latest fraud terms, the industries most susceptible to fraud, and how commonly Brits use risky channels. 



 



<p>2023 proved to be a monumental year for fraud in the UK. In fact, by the middle of the year, the losses attributed to fraud <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2023/oct/25/uk-consumer-lose-580m-fraudster-first-half-2023-romance-scam-id-theft-fastest-growing-categories">were already £580 million</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The year was also important for the steps that the UK government pledged to take to address fraud. Chief among these was the release of its fraud strategy, which, the government hopes, will reduce fraud by 10% by 2025. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-fraud-charter-2023">Online Fraud Charter</a> was also launched in 2023, which is a voluntary agreement between the government and technology sector to reduce fraud on their platforms and services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While these initiatives will hopefully go some way to encourage the public and private sector to tackle the scourge of fraud in the UK, they will not necessarily address perhaps the most important challenge: educating the public in a tangible, meaningful way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the aim of investigating the British public’s awareness of fraud and its attitudes toward fraud prevention technology, we created the inaugural IDnow UK Fraud Awareness Report.&nbsp;</p>



 
   
     
                     UK Fraud Awareness Report 2024 
                     Learn more about the British public’s awareness of fraud and their attitudes toward fraud-prevention technology. 
                    <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/2024-uk-fraud-awareness-report/">Read now</a>
           
           
         
          
         
       
       
 


<p>In the first of a three-part blog series, we explore the fraud education levels of the British population, the areas of life most susceptible to fraud, and users’ behavior around insecure digital communication channels.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Assessing the awareness of fraud. 



<p>If there was one term that appeared to be on everybody’s lips (from the fraud prevention community) last year, it was ‘deepfakes.’ However, despite some widely circulated deepfake videos of famous politicians making headlines in 2023, we discovered that almost half (47%) of Brits said that they do not know what deepfakes are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We define deepfakes as deceptively lifelike, manipulated images, audio or video recordings. The quality of deepfakes is constantly improving as computing power increases and AI advances, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish between authentic and artificially created or altered material.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Social engineering, unlike other forms of cyberattacks, appeals to human vulnerabilities and emotions. For example, in romance fraud, the fraudster uses social engineering to build up a rapport with the victim with the intention of tricking them into registering for a service or transferring funds. Worryingly, we discovered that more than half of Brits (54%) do not know what social engineering is.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, we did discover some positives regarding the British public’s awareness of fraud terms. A vast majority (83%) of respondents say they know what ‘phishing’ is (gathering a victim’s personal information, such as credentials or payment information, by getting them to click on a malicious link or attachment).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although many respondents were not aware of the definitions of the latest forms of fraud, an overwhelming number (93%) say they are concerned about fraud in one way or another.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Which industry is most susceptible to fraud? 



<p>Despite a majority (73%) of Brits believing their bank is effective in safeguarding their financial assets, three quarters (75%) of respondents said banking was the industry they were most concerned about when it comes to fraud. More than half (55%) of UK adults say they are also concerned about online shopping fraud, followed by a third of the population (37%) citing social media fraud as a worry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Respondents were also asked to assess the risk levels of different crimes: 32% think they are most at risk of someone having access to their bank account through identity fraud; another 21% of Brits think they are most at risk of someone hacking their social media profile.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Discover more about the different types of social media fraud, and how one man almost lost a million euros to a pig butchering scam in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/social-media-fraud-investment-romance-scam/">blog, ‘The rise of social media fraud: How one man almost lost it all.’</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other industries are also perceived as rife with fraud. Around 2 in 10 Brits are concerned about insurance fraud (19%); 14% worry about fraud in cryptocurrency, eGovernment (13%), online dating (13%), travel (12%) and telecoms (11%).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>[Discover the steps that one woman is taking to expose romance scams in our blog,<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/exposing-romance-scammers-becky-holmes/"> ‘What’s love got to do with it? Exposing the romance scammers, with Becky Holmes.’</a>]&nbsp;</p>



 Which channel is considered the riskiest? 



<p>Despite 97% of respondents knowing what identity theft means, and widespread concern about fraud in various areas of life, a third of Brits (33%) have admitted to sharing scans or photos of ID cards, driving licenses or passports via insecure and largely unencrypted channels, such as social media, email or messenger apps.&nbsp;Of these people, almost half (45%) said they were aware that these document scans or photos could land in the hands of fraudsters but&nbsp;proceeded to share these scans or photos anyway. This is a clear indicator that consumers are either unaware of an alternative way of verification (for example, via an identity verification solution) or the service they were trying to access did not offer a secure channel. It also highlights the importance for businesses to provide secure digital channels for customers to share personal information.&nbsp;</p>



 How IDnow helps prevent fraud. 



<p>IDnow offers comprehensive fraud prevention solutions to safeguard against various types of fraud, including social engineering, fake IDs, identity fraud, and much more. Our automated document verification and biometric checks, including selfie and face match, verify users’ identities with precision, while our passive liveness detection feature adds an extra layer of security, ensuring that genuine customers are verified seamlessly. &nbsp;</p>



<p>We also offer an expert-assisted video verification process, where trained professionals who verify users’ documents and ask security and fraud related questions looking for any signs of suspicious behavior or social engineering attempts. Through real-time intervention and questioning, our experts can detect and prevent fraudulent activities effectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow also regularly runs education and awareness sessions to help clients and their customers recognize and respond to social engineering threats. By combining advanced technology, expert insights, and proactive strategies, IDnow is committed to helping businesses mitigate the risks associated with rising fraud attempts and protect both their reputation and their customers’ trust.</p>

             February 2024   
	 
		 
			 Why Do Asset Managers, Like BlackRock, Embrace Tokenization? 
 
<p>I’m excited to share some exciting news from our side, as we proudly participated in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.citigroup.com/global/businesses/digital-assets?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4#tokenization">Citi’s tokenization use case to test the ERC-3643 token standard</a>&nbsp;for enforcing compliance on-chain. This showcased how tokenized securities can thrive in a decentralized infrastructure while maintaining compliance and control.</p>
<p>Another noteworthy development is BlackRock’s endorsement of tokenization, heralding it as the logical progression beyond cryptocurrency spot ETFs. In March 2023, just one month after our initial newsletter release, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/fed-meeting-fomc-interest-rate-decision-march-2024/card/blackrock-launches-first-tokenized-fund-on-ethereum-blockchain-nzDSJjH5mEijUzKO24T4">BlackRock made waves by debuting its tokenized asset fund named ‘BUIDL’ on the Ethereum network</a>. This marks a significant milestone for the industry, given BlackRock’s status as one of the world’s largest asset managers, embracing tokenization and a public blockchain. It sets a precedent likely to be emulated throughout the industry.</p>
<p>Now, let’s delve into why asset managers are eagerly embracing tokenization. According to PwC’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/financial-services/library/asset-wealth-management-trends.html?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">research</a>, the top priorities for asset managers in the next two years include&nbsp;accessing new segments and clients, increasing market share, and mitigating risks through product diversification. Below, I will explain how tokenization helps asset managers to achieve these strategic goals.</p>
 

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>Tokenization opens the door for asset managers to gain new capital sources from untapped segments&nbsp;– new regions, and new types of investors such as High Net Worth (HNW) investors and family offices, to meet market demand and gain market shares. Illuminating this potential, EY’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ey.com/en_us/financial-services/tokenization-in-asset-management?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">report</a>&nbsp;underscores a significant trend: 61% of HNW investors plan to invest in tokenized assets in 2024. Tokenization enables asset managers to tackle the historical challenges rooted in manual, time-consuming processes, and fragmented systems through programmability and shared infrastructure. It empowers them to acquire the capability to efficiently handle a large number of clients and unlock a potential&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bain.com/insights/how-tokenization-can-fuel-a-400-billion-opportunity-in-distributing-alternative-investments-to-individuals/?utm_medium=social_advocacy&amp;utm_source=LinkedIn-dysi&amp;utm_content=659945e8-bafb-4474-abae-0cdb8cd50411&amp;utm_term=147236&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">$400 billion revenue opportunity</a>, according to Bain &amp; Company.</p>
<p>Moreover,&nbsp;PwC’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/financial-services/asset-wealth-management/high-net-worth-investor.html?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">survey</a>&nbsp;shows that 66% of HNW investors desire increased personalization in their wealth management relationship. This trend towards personalized models is also highlighted in Oliver Wyman’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oliverwyman.com/our-expertise/insights/2024/jan/asset-management-trends-for-2024.html?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">report</a>&nbsp;“10 Asset Management Trends for 2024,” suggesting opportunities for asset managers to compete with wealth manager home offices. Tokenized securities embed asset data, enabling such customization.&nbsp;By offering tailored tokenized portfolios based on clients’ risk profiles, asset managers can attract and retain clients.&nbsp;Tokenization can even combine with AI to allow&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/the-new-financial-world-ai-meets-tokenization/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">AI to analyze, and blockchain to execute</a>, creating another level of personalized experience.</p>
<p>Regarding risk management, thanks to transparency, automation, and availability of asset data, asset managers can&nbsp;automatically rebalance portfolios to migrate risks&nbsp;based on predefined risk conditions. For instance, setting up a smart contract to trigger a sell-off when the risk rating level transitions from AAA to AA.</p>
<p>Lastly, as highlighted in Oliver Wyman’s report, a notable trend in the private market is the&nbsp;surge in Limited Partner (LP) secondaries and the emergence of net asset value (NAV-based) lending.&nbsp;These have gained momentum as the return on capital slows, and investors increasingly seek liquidity.&nbsp;Tokenization emerges as a powerful solution, offering diversified products and cultivating liquidity. Tokenized securities, carrying both compliance rules and asset data, enable instant compliant transferability, support peer-to-peer transactions, and integrate seamlessly with third-party trading applications. This enables global and flat distribution. Furthermore, lending smart contracts can be easily launched to allow LPs to pledge their tokenized securities for borrowing.</p>
<p>This emphasis on liquidity is also our primary focus as&nbsp;we build distribution rails to expand the DINO distribution network for tokenized securities, as discussed by Xavi Aznal, our Head of Product, in&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/tokenys-2024-products-building-the-distribution-rails-of-the-tokenized-economy/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">the last Product Focus newsletter</a>.</p>
<p>We anticipate witnessing the launch of tokenization projects by at least 5 out of 10 of the largest asset managers this year.</p>
<p>Let’s stay tuned for this exciting moment.</p>

<p>We’ve been <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/digital-id-and-digital-identity/">writing about the new Australian Government Digital ID System</a> (AGDIS) and <a href="https://www.makingdatabetter.com/2195663/14477065-a-big-little-step-australia-shifts-from-digital-identity-to-digital-id">talking about it the Making Data Better podcast</a>. We’re reading press reports, speaking to commentators, and finding some ambiguity about whether this thing is might be a new ID or attribute.</p>
<p>The Finance Minister Katy Gallagher, responsible for the Digital ID Bill, says she is not in the business of producing a new national ID. We believe her.</p>
<p>Yet many still believe AGDIS must be producing some sort of new attribute. It could provide a new way to do KYC checks when opening a bank account, or proving how old we are when we buy alcohol online.</p>
<p>A lot is left to the imagination: Does AGDIS really mean a new sort of attribute, a de facto ID? No, and the spectre of a singular ID distracts from the true potential of Digital ID to fix what’s broken.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.makingdatabetter.com/2195663/14578278-the-bigger-step-want-a-single-digital-id">In our latest short conversation</a>, <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/about/george-peabody/">George</a> and I try to clarify what AGDIS could be delivering.</p>
 How do we think about the prospect of new attributes? 
<p>We’ve been celebrating the fact that with the Digital ID Bill,<a href="https://lockstep.com.au/rip-trusted-digital-identity-but-whither-australias-tdif/"> the government is not talking about “digital identity” anymore</a>.</p>
<p>But the term Digital ID in the public mind could be construed as a new identifier or national ID, and many don’t like that idea.</p>
<p>The good people of Australia, the US, the UK, Canada and New Zealand — the Common Law system countries — are famously allergic to National ID. So, there are some optics to be concerned about.</p>
<p>But much more important is the question of how relying parties use any ID, be it old or new. It’s the relying parties that actually make use of IDs and take a risk on them. We’ve seen over and over around the world that the success of digital identification is in the hands of relying parties.</p>
<p>The critical problem with a new digital ID is that the relying parties’ existing systems don’t know how to consume it.</p>
<p>They will not have seen it before. They won’t know what to make of it.</p>
<p>Even if lawyers and risk officers gave it the all-clear, a new ID needs to be incorporated into subsystems and business processes that have operated for years around driver’s licenses, birth certificates and Medicare numbers. Subsystems include onboarding routines, user interfaces, databases, risk assessments, and call centre processes. They would all need updating for a new ID.</p>
 The need for flexibility in identification 
<p>KYC (Know Your Customer) has a bad reputation and it’s far from perfect, but it works in familiar ways, drawing on sets of well-established IDs which can be put together in different ways to onboard new customers.</p>
<p>Every bank actually does KYC differently. KYC conventions allow for variations. </p>
<p>This is critical. Think of the challenge of “low doc” customers — individuals without the affordances of passports or driver licences who still have the same right to participate in the finance system. To accommodate customers with diverse personal documents, banks can vary their KYC processes.</p>
<p>Banks know their own way business environments and rightly have the discretion to customise their identification processes. </p>
<p>When KYC draws on lists of established IDs, it allows for flexibility, and compensatory controls when identification pathways need to be varied.</p>
<p>But if we throw a new attribute into the ecosystem — especially one that is supposed to be better or preferred — then we force the banks back to square one to work out what to do with it.</p>
<p>We know perfectly well from the <a href="https://www.secureidnews.com/news-item/fractional-identity-an-alternative-to-nstic-federated-identity-models/">failure of grand Identity Federations</a> that trust isn’t transitive. That is, the work done by one party to manage its risks is not going to satisfy other parties.</p>
<p>Instead of any new IDs or bundles of attributes, we need to make better data available to established identification processes. The Australian Digital ID System can do that simply through verifiable credentials that make it impossible for ID data to be replayed by fraudsters.</p>
<p>Let’s move away from plaintext presentation of IDs and adopt device-bound presentation just like we have with our chip payment cards and digital wallets, where hardware and software work together to make each presentation unique and non-replayable.</p>
<p>The golden opportunity we have now comes from so many people having computers in their hands that can present and release data in a far more secure way than filling out a form.</p>
<p>So in conclusion, we understand why people can suspect that Digital ID going to be a new ID, but it’s not. No new ID is needed.&nbsp;To fix online identification, we can conserve all the IDs we know today and make the move from plaintext to device-bound smart presentation.</p>

   Moving towards a passwordless future is crucial for cybersecurity. So many high-profile breaches highlight the vulnerability of relying on passwords. Embracing passkeys, digital credentials tied to user accounts, and applications, offers a more secure and user-friendly alternative.

<p>Why isn’t the world moving more quickly towards passwordless tech?</p>



<p>Passwords have long been the bedrock of cybersecurity, but let’s face it, they aren’t a great solution, especially when personal and financial data is at risk. If you show me a news article about a high-profile breach, I’m probably going to point to reliance on passwords as one likely cause.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Examples:&nbsp;</p>



 
 In 2020, Ticketmaster <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/ticketmaster-pays-10-million-criminal-fine-intrusions-competitor-s-computer-systems-0">pleaded guilty</a> to a charge of repeatedly and illegally accessing competitors’ computers. How? They had an employee who used to work for a rival company. That employee was able to the login credentials for multiple corporate accounts at that rival company to steal information.&nbsp; 



 Also in 2021, the New York City Law Department ended up <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/cyberattack-on-nyc-law-department/">exposing the personal data</a> of thousands of city employees. This included evidence of police misconduct, medical records for plaintiffs, and more. All because of a single employee’s stolen email account password. 



 23andMe, in 2023, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/feb/15/23andme-hack-data-genetic-data-selling-response">exposed data</a> for millions of users, thanks to hackers using all the bad passwords they could find to run what’s called credential stuffing attack that got them into the systems where they could harvest data to their dirty little hearts’ content. 
 



<p>What’s so wildly frustrating about all this is that there are better ways to secure accounts! We just have to get companies to support them.</p>



<p>So, let’s look at a more secure alternative.</p>



 The Case for Going Passwordless&nbsp; 



<p>Older passwordless solutions, like hardware tokens and smart cards, definitely offer enhanced security. You have to physically have a thing in order to access a thing. Combine that with something like biometrics, and suddenly you have two-factor authentication: something you have and something you are. I’ll be the first to admit, though, that diving straight into requiring a physical … something … to log in is not going to be the solution for everyone. It’s an extra step, and it involves someone buying that physical thing. There is always cost associated with security that may outweigh the data you are trying to protect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The really good news here is that <a href="https://www.yubico.com/">cute little hardware tokens</a> that you are going to lose, or, if you’re like my friend Sarah, will need to put on a pair of earrings so you don’t lose them, are no longer your only option for going passwordless. Enter in, stage left, passkeys!</p>



 About Passkeys 



<p>Passkeys are a technology that feels almost too good to be true, because they can work with your mobile device OR with a hardware token. What you use to store your passkey depends a lot on what security model you’re following: super duper high levels of security, or a casual, please don’t access my New York Times subscription model. If you want the full gory details of how passkeys work, I suggest you go down the rabbit hole at the FIDO Alliance website. They’ve got a great primer at <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 No, really, what is a passkey? 



<p>So, what is a passkey? A passkey is a digital credential, like an electronic key in this case, tied to both a user account and a website or application. Users can authenticate without having to enter a username or password, or provide any additional authentication factor, because they have this key, which is entirely under their control and can’t be shared or stolen the way a password can. When a user is asked to sign-in to an app or website (basically unlocking access with the key), the user approves the sign-in with the same biometric or PIN that the user has to unlock the device the passkey is stored on (whether that device is a phone, computer, or hardware key).&nbsp; It’s really just that easy to use. If my cats had phones, they could totally do this.</p>



<p>One of my favorite things about passkeys, when they comply with the FIDO standards that define them, is that they can’t be phished. Anyone spoofing an email, phone call, or SMS asking for your password or the code you received in a text message is out of luck.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So now we have something that’s actually easier to use than a password because we don’t have to type anything in AND is more secure. So let’s talk about making the business case.&nbsp;</p>



 Crafting Your Business Case 



<p>I’m going to suggest that to advocate for passwordless systems, you need emphasize the benefits: enhanced security, potential cost savings, and a smoother user experience. What organization doesn’t find that attractive? I’m also going to go ahead and recognize that if you are working in a regulated industry like banking, a lot of this is already old news to you. Why? Because if you’re in the US, the Federal Trade Commission has required MFA since 2021 through its <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/12/09/2021-25736/standards-for-safeguarding-customer-information">Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information</a>. If you’re in the EU, you have similar requirements not to mention the recommendations in <a href="https://www.globalsign.com/en/blog/what-is-eIDAS-2-how-digital-identity-verification-plays-a-key-role">eIDAS 2.0</a> and the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis2-directive">NIS 2 directive</a>.</p>



<p>But, for the rest of us, yay, let’s emphasize the benefits! But who are you emphasizing the benefits to? If you’re in the IT security department, you probably don’t need to be convinced. But there are a variety of other stakeholders in an organization that you can get on your side. If you’re in a big company, your HR, Legal, PR, and Financial departments might have a thing or two to say about protecting the company’s reputation by avoiding being lit on fire in the news because of a cybersecurity breach. They might also be really fond of the idea of having an argument to lower the tech insurance costs. And if you’re in a regulated industry like banking, healthcare, or are handling government contracts, then this is an obvious requirement to pass those audits. So, yep, lots of positive reasons to make these changes.</p>



<p>Whether your company is in the business of IT or not, better security is critical. If you have an Internet presence, if your employees log in to something to do their work, and especially if you have consumers, there are a lot of business cases you can make for moving away from a pure password model into something a bit more technologically sexy and secure.</p>



 Embracing Multi-Factor Authentication 



<p>Jumping straight to a passwordless world might be a bit too much to expect, and look a little too much like arcane magic to your executives. There are still things you can do to make your reliance on passwords a little less fraught with peril! And that’s requiring multi-factor authentication. MFA, which also encompasses two-factor authentication, requires at least two out of the following three things:</p>



 
 something you know 



 something you have 



 something you are 
 



<p>So, like a password, a physical token, or your biometrics. In some cases, you may want to require all three! It depends on what you’re trying to protect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More systems are ready to support MFA than they are to support passkeys. One of your limiting factors in convincing your organization to support passkeys is that the software you use might not support it yet. OK, I get it, but if your software or services doesn’t support MFA yet, you really need to have some stern words with your vendors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is a lot of information out there about best practices when it comes to how to deploy MFA. I want to highlight two articles from the IDPro Body of Knowledge that should be required reading in this space:</p>



 
 <a href="https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/49/">Designing MFA for Humans</a> – Nishant Kaushik 



 <a href="https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/92/">Multi-factor Authentication</a> – Khaled Zaky and Dean H. Saxe 
 



<p>When your organization considers rolling out MFA or starts to evaluate MFA as part of their vendor evaluations, these articles will give you some really good things to think about when it comes to balancing what individuals need versus what’s the best shiny object for cybersecurity professionals, and what is best practice all around. Go read them.</p>



 Transition Strategies and Best Practices&nbsp; 



<p>You’ve made the case. You’re going to start with pushing MFA as a little less scary, a little more supported. But there are a few of your vendors or services ready to dive straight into the passwordless universe. That’s brilliant! However, as much as I love MFA and passkeys, and I want you to get there, I’m telling you right now, don’t just throw your user base into this brave new world and think that’s going to work for you.</p>



<p>Start with pilot programs, evaluate feedback, and scale up. You’re going to need to convince some people that the magic of passkeys is really more secure. You’re going to need to get them to understand that yes, their account even though they are just a junior staffer in the PR department, using MFA is important. You’ll need different arguments for different stakeholder groups, and that’s ok.</p>



<p>For your executives, cite successful case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness and compatibility of MFA or passkeys with existing systems. A basic Google search will net you several examples; if you’re using a vendor like Ping or Okta, they almost certainly have more. For your line managers, they might be more compelled if you pointed them to a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/advice/1/how-do-you-train-your-employees-use-multi-factor">thread on LinkedIn</a> about “How do you train your employees to use multi-factor authentication securely and effectively?“ where their peers talk about the benefits of MFA.</p>



<p>There are other organizations that are paving the way. <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/passkeys">Google Identity</a> has some great developer documentation about passkeys. Okta has some <a href="https://www.okta.com/resources/whitepaper/8-steps-for-effectively-deploying-mfa/">pretty good stuff</a> about MFA.</p>



 The Road Ahead 



<p>it’s going to take time for your organization to actually move, especially if you’re just starting to make the case for this change. This is good, because there is still one rather important kink to work out, and that’s account recovery. If, or more to the point, when, you lose your hardware token, phone, or whatever device you have your passkey on, you have a problem, and it’s not one a helpdesk can easily help you solve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At least at the moment, some of the best advice in high-security situations is to make sure you’re protected against losing your hardware tokens, have more than one hardware token. Not the best model ever, to be honest. There are other points to consider as well, and for all of those fine points about account recovery, I’m going to point you right over to the article on <a href="https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/64/">Account Recovery</a> by Dean Saxe over in the IDPro Body of Knowledge.</p>



<p>The journey to a passwordless future is ongoing. Stay informed about emerging technologies, educate your team, and be a proactive advocate for advanced security solutions in your organization.</p>



 Wrap Up&nbsp; 



<p>There you have it: my thoughts on how you can and should advance towards a passwordless future while bolstering security with multi-factor authentication. This post is purely a place for you to start; it should inspire you to encourage change both in how you handle your own accounts and how you take action for organizational change.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Actually, Holochain 0.2 has been with us for a long time — since last <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/moving-along-on-all-fronts/#holochain-02x-series-gossip-fix-in-the-works-dev-tooling-expected-for-021">May</a> — and developers have been actively building hApps on Holochain 0.3 for a while as well. But for developers who are new to Holochain, we’ve still been recommending 0.1 up until this point. That’s because 0.2’s new networking layer introduced a few <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/moving-along-on-all-fronts/#holochain-02x-series-gossip-fix-in-the-works-dev-tooling-expected-for-021">performance</a> <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-0-1-6-maintenance-release/#holochain-02-progress-building-comprehensive-diagnostic-capacities">regressions</a> and <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/moving-along-on-all-fronts/#holochain-02x-series-gossip-fix-in-the-works-dev-tooling-expected-for-021">peer discovery</a> issues, and we wanted to be confident that the user experience was reasonably smooth before recommending it.</p><p>Today is the day we're now recommending Holochain 0.2.6 for all existing and new projects.</p><p>You'll notice that this release has been out for a few weeks, and there have been a number of unannounced releases since 0.2.1. In recent months we’ve adopted a new process for public releases. Here’s how it looks:</p>  The core dev team cuts a release candidate (RC).  The release candidate is ‘smoke tested’ to make sure it works with a few mature apps that exercise a lot of its functionality, particularly <a href="https://github.com/holochain-apps/talking-stickies?ref=blog.holochain.org">Talking Stickies</a> and HoloFuel.  If the smoke test passes, the RC designation is removed and the commit is promoted to a proper release.  The dev tooling (client libs, scaffolding, etc) are updated to the new release.  A ‘soak test’ is performed, in which an app is run for a couple weeks in order to discover long-term performance and discoverability issues.  If the soak test passes with reasonable performance, the commit is promoted to the latest recommended release and we spread the news.  <p>It’s been a long time coming, but Holochain 0.2.6 is finally the first release in the 0.2 series to pass the above checks to our satisfaction. Let’s get into what’s new.</p> Holochain 0.2.6: Recommended for all developers <p>Release date: 6 February 2024<br>HDI compatibility: 0.3.x<br>HDK compatibility: 0.2.x</p><p>The changelog from Holochain 0.1.6 is too long to repeat here, but here are the highlights:</p>  New networking layer based on WebRTC, which lets us use off-the-shelf session negotiation and NAT hole-punching techniques. The QUIC protocol, which we built 0.1’s&nbsp; networking layer on, was great, but it forced us to build a lot of network tooling from scratch.  Many performance improvements and fixes for peer discovery, function calls, signals, and gossip; apps feel much faster (and we’re working on making it faster still).  A small number of breaking changes in the conductor APIs and the WASM host API.

				  Learn why building decentralized identity functionality into your existing solutions has never been simpler with the Indicio mobile SDK.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Indicio <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicios-new-software-developer-kit-sdk-makes-creating-and-customizing-digital-wallets-for-any-application-quick-and-easy/">recently announced</a> the new <a href="https://indicio.tech/mobile-software-development-kit/">Indicio Proven mobile SDK</a> which enables any organization to build digital wallet functionality right into their existing applications. This allows any existing mobile application to hold and share verifiable data and identity, which leads to faster, more secure information sharing and a better experience for the end user.</p>
<p>Recently I sat down with the developers behind the project, Patrick Kenyon (PK) and Kolby Kunz (KK), to learn more about their thought process and how this new piece of technology was created. You can watch the full interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuXNHa07izw">here.</a></p>
<p>The following are a few excerpts from that conversation that have been edited for comprehension:</p>
<p>TS: Could you please break down just what is an SDK quickly for us?</p>
<p>PK: An SDK stands for software development kit, to be more specific, oftentimes if you have a feature that someone wants to implement in an app, an SDK will just be a library or an aid focused on implementing that specific feature in other applications.</p>
<p>TS: So for the proven mobile SDK it implements features of proven and digital wallet functionality specifically correct?</p>
<p>PK and KK: Yes.</p>
<p>TS: What problem were you given to solve that led to the creation of the SDK?</p>
<p>KK: We had resources that were limited just to react native, and we really wanted to be able to target native applications and go from taking native applications and targeting other Frameworks like react native or flutter that can consume native code and get it all in one place and one solid API that everyone can work with.</p>
<p>PK: The alternative would be to use multiple other libraries across multiple different apps, like if they’re trying to use a different platform. So say they’re developing for Android native and iOS native they’ have to get two separate applications or libraries that don’t exactly always line up and so with ours it does line up across all of the platforms we support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TS: What was your approach and how did you get started&nbsp; with the actual build?</p>
<p>KK: That was a lot, and we sat down for a long time with team leads and had a lot of discussion multiple meetings of what are we going to do, and I think originally we set out and we’re like “hey we’re gonna have to develop this in Kotlin for Android and Swift for iOS and we’re going to have to try to make sure that they mirror each other” and we ended up finding a solution where we could develop just in one code base and cross compile to another and that really made it a lot simpler for us to be able to have like a unified API or application interface so that everything was the same whether you are on Android or iOS developing and using this SDK.</p>
<p>TS: Are there any features you’re particularly proud of?&nbsp;</p>
<p>PK: One of the features about the SDK that I’m happy about, that we’ve recently done, is the react native rapper, because we were able to take our SDK and prove that it works in both IOS and Android react native. We were also able to create the API so that the SDK stays the same between Android iOS and react native, and so if you’re building a different application or using a different platform you only have to learn the SDK once and it stays the same. It’s really sweet.</p>
<p>KK: I’m particularly proud of the proofs module, proofs as far as a decentralized identity concept is a very difficult concept to develop for, and there are a lot of pitfalls that can come with it, and I feel like our solution to get there is fairly robust. It’s a little verbose on the end consumption, but it gives the user a lot of power for being able to submit proofs and fulfill proof requests, so I was pretty proud of getting that one through the finish line.</p>

There is no minimum threshold in the Philippines for the Travel Rule to kick in, as originating and beneficiary VASPs must collect and share names and account numbers/unique reference numbers of their customers for all transactions.  The extent of information that VASPs are required to collect and share increases substantially when the value of crypto transactions exceeds ₱50,000 (about&nbsp;$893).  <p>In 2021, the Philippines joined the Asia-Pacific Group and became a member of FATF-Style Regional Bodies. The same year, Bangko Sentral NG Pilipinas (BSP), the country’s Central Bank, released <a href="https://www.bsp.gov.ph/Regulations/Issuances/2021/1108.pdf">Circular 1108</a> to provide guidelines for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), which included the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>With that, the FATF Travel Rule went into effect in February 2021 in the Philippines. As a result, crypto exchanges and service providers are now all required to follow the Philippines Crypto Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1742507280870822106">Image Source</a>)<p>This year, the Philippines has begun tightening Travel Rule requirements even further to strengthen the country’s AML and CFT measures against any illicit crypto transactions.</p> What is a VASP in the Philippines? <p>A VASP, according to BSP, is any entity that offers services facilitating the transfer or exchange of virtual assets and is involved in the following activities:</p>  Exchange between fiat currencies and virtual&nbsp;assets;  Exchange between different types of virtual&nbsp;assets;  Crypto transfer, and  Administration and/or safekeeping of crypto or instruments enabling control over&nbsp;crypto   Complying With the FATF Travel Rule in the Philippines <p>According to the country’s Central Bank, VASPs must share the following information with their corresponding VASPs for all crypto transactions, irrespective of the&nbsp;amount:</p>  Name  Account number or Unique reference number, if that is not available  <p>However, the extent of personally identifiable information that VASPs have to collect and share with their corresponding VASPs increases substantially when the amount of crypto transaction exceeds ₱50,000 (about&nbsp;$893).</p><p>In such cases, VASPs are required to collect and share the following information:</p>  Name  Physical address  Date &amp; place of&nbsp;birth.  Account number  <p>Additionally, originating and beneficiary VASPs must establish and actively adhere to strict sanction screening procedures. They must also screen all transacting parties against terrorist financing lists and adverse media&nbsp;reports.</p><p>Moreover, VASPs must perform necessary due diligence on the transfer of virtual assets to and from countries that haven’t implemented the FATF Travel Rule yet. They also have to exercise caution and perform enhanced due diligence when dealing with crypto transfers using unhosted&nbsp;wallets.</p> Global Context and Comparisons <p>The Travel Rule is part of a broader set of recommendations by the global anti-money laundering watchdog, the FATF, which included the Philippines in its ‘grey list.’ As a result of this, Southeast Asian countries like the Philippines have increased monitoring in order to maintain their trade relations and gain access to international finance.</p><p>Countries like the United Arab Emirates and Hong Kong, have already taken similar action and have tightened up regulations on the&nbsp;sector.</p><p>Meanwhile, several countries such as Singapore, Switzerland, Estonia, South Korea, Canada, Japan, the US, and the UK have also adopted the Crypto Travel Rule and require digital asset service providers to maintain customer information and establish procedures to ensure compliance with AML/CFT measures.</p><p>The Philippines’ Travel Rule threshold is in line with the FATF’s $1,000 limit and more or less in conformity with other countries. In Singapore, the threshold for collecting and recording sender and receiver information is SGD 1,500 (about $1,115), while in the United States, it’s $3,000. However, in Estonia and Malaysia, there’s no minimum amount requirement for gathering this information.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>While the Philippines has taken significant steps to align with international standards by implementing the FATF Travel Rule for cryptocurrency transactions, these regulations have sparked a debate about their&nbsp;impact.</p><p>By setting requirements for VASPs to collect and share detailed information on transactions, the country aims to combat money laundering and terrorism financing. However, the increasing regulatory measures, including the latest tightening of the Travel Rule, highlight the ongoing tension between ensuring financial security and maintaining the open, decentralized ethos of cryptocurrency.</p><p>This delicate balance continues to shape the landscape of crypto regulation both in the Philippines and around the world. Amid this, it’s crucial for both regulators and industry representatives to remember that user security and experience should always be a priority.</p> Frequently Asked Questions  Q1: What Are VASPs Required to Do Under the Travel&nbsp;Rule? <p>They must collect and exchange personal information for transactions exceeding ₱50,000 (about&nbsp;$893).</p> Q2: Who Qualifies as a VASP in the Philippines? <p>Entities that facilitate the transfer or exchange of virtual assets, including exchanges between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies.</p> Q3: What Happens if VASPs Fail to Follow the Travel&nbsp;Rule? <p>They may face regulatory penalties, including fines and revocation of their operating license, for non-compliance with the BSP’s guidelines.</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

  <p>Like any other service, Microsoft Entra ID is not immune to human errors, accidental deletions, or malicious attacks that could result in the loss of important data. Therefore, it is essential to have a Microsoft Entra ID recovery strategy, especially for the objects that are hard deleted when removed from the service. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hard deletion means the object is permanently erased and cannot be restored by any means. The good news is that many objects support soft deletion, which means the object is marked as deleted in the service and moved to the recycle bin but not actually removed. The advantage of soft deletion is that the object can be recovered with its original configuration and dependencies, such as membership, assignments, and permissions, within 30 days. Therefore, it’s important to monitor and manage the soft-deleted objects in Microsoft Entra ID and decide whether to restore or permanently delete them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep in mind:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Users, Microsoft 365 Groups, (not security or distribution groups), and application registrations support soft deletion and can be restored using both the Microsoft Entra admin center and Microsoft Graph API. &nbsp; 
 Service principals and administrative units can also be restored from the recycle bin but only via the Microsoft Graph API.  &nbsp; 
 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s important to note that while synchronized user objects also support soft deletion, they should be backed up and restored at the source (Active Directory). Re-synchronization will automatically trigger the restoration of soft-deleted objects from the recycle bin. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
 Tracking deletions using Entra ID audit logs &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Every object deletion will trigger an event depending on the deletion type. For example, a soft-deleted user will trigger an event with the activity “Delete user” and a hard deletion will generate a “Hard Delete user” for a group that would be “Delete group” and “Hard Delete group” and so on, as shown in figure one below. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Microsoft Entra ID audit logs view</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the table below, delete, hard delete, and restore activities are listed for objects that support soft deletion, as they are seen in the audit log.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>Deletion Activity &nbsp;</p>


<p>Hard deletion activity &nbsp;</p>


<p>Restore activity &nbsp;</p>




<p>Delete group &nbsp;</p>


<p>Hard Delete group &nbsp;</p>


<p>Restore Group &nbsp;</p>




<p>Delete user &nbsp;</p>


<p>Hard Delete user &nbsp;</p>


<p>Restore user  &nbsp;</p>




<p>Delete application &nbsp;</p>


<p>Hard Delete application &nbsp;</p>


<p>Restore application &nbsp;</p>




<p>Delete administrative unit &nbsp;</p>


<p>(hard delete not possible) &nbsp;</p>


<p>Restore Administrative Unit &nbsp;</p>




<p>Remove service principal &nbsp;</p>


<p>Hard delete service principal &nbsp;</p>


<p>Restore service principal &nbsp;</p>




<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Please also be mindful of the following when working with events in the audit log: &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Notice minor differences in activity naming, as Kusto Query Language (KQL) is case sensitive. You might have unexpected results when using strict “==” equality operators. &nbsp; 
 For any object type that does not support soft deletion, only "Delete objectType" events will be logged, meaning a hard deletion. For example, Delete conditional access policy. &nbsp; 
 For some object types, there’s an option to perform operations in bulk, providing a .csv file as input. For such bulk operations, there are additional events logged for start and finish, but there are still individual events for every object on the list. For example, (started (bulk) / Bulk restore deleted users - finished (bulk)). &nbsp; 
 When a synchronized object is moved out of sync or deleted in Active Directory, then it will be soft deleted in Microsoft Entra ID with a corresponding event.   &nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Examples of queries for monitoring deletions with Microsoft Sentinel &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra ID works well with Microsoft Sentinel, our cloud-native security information and event management (SIEM), platform that is built on cloud technology and offers extensive threat detection and response features. If you use Microsoft Sentinel or Log Analytics to collect and analyze Microsoft Entra ID logs, here are some KQL query examples that can help you with investigating and alerting object deletion events from Microsoft Entra ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users that were soft deleted more than 25 days ago, will automatically be hard deleted soon:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
AuditLogs  
| where OperationName in ("Delete group", "Delete user", "Delete application", "Delete administrative unit",  "Remove service principal")  
| where TimeGenerated between (ago(29d) .. ago(25d))  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More than 50 objects hard deleted in the past 10 minutes:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
AuditLogs  
| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(10m)  
| where OperationName in ("Hard Delete group", "Hard Delete user", "Hard Delete application", "Hard delete service principal")  
| summarize count()  
| where count_ &gt; 50  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>User deletion is followed by hard deletion:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
let queryfrequency = 1h;  
let queryperiod = 2h;  
AuditLogs  
| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(queryfrequency)  
| where OperationName =~ "Hard Delete user"  
| extend UserId = tostring(TargetResources[0].id)  
| project-rename HardDeletion_TimeGenerated = TimeGenerated  
| join kind=inner (  
    AuditLogs  
    | where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(1d)  
    | where OperationName =~ "Delete user"        
    | extend UserId = tostring(TargetResources[0].id)  
    | project-rename SoftDeletion_TimeGenerated = TimeGenerated  
) on UserId  
| extend TimeDelta = HardDeletion_TimeGenerated - SoftDeletion_TimeGenerated  
| where  TimeDelta between (time(0s) .. queryperiod)  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The queries above are provided as examples, and real detection logic and thresholds will be different for each organization. One approach could be building a Sentinel workbook to visualize data and establish deletion/restoration/hard deletion baselines that will eventually help with the creation of detections. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Reviewing deleted objects &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with monitoring, it’s recommended to perform reviews of deleted objects. Reviews can be done regularly or prompted by some of the detection events discussed above. This can be done using the Microsoft Entra admin center, audit log-based queries, or Microsoft Graph API.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra admin center / Azure Portal&nbsp;</p>
<p>The easiest way to examine “recycle bins” for deleted users, groups, or applications is by administering Microsoft Entra ID in the Microsoft Entra <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#home">admin center</a> or Azure portal. However, this method has limitations, as the interface varies slightly depending on the object type, and for administrative units and service principals, there is no graphical experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: Deleted objects experience for users, groups, and applications</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Audit logs</p>
<p>Audit logs can also be used to generate a soft deleted items report that shows all the deleted objects for the last 30 days, excluding those that have already been restored or hard deleted.  &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s a sample query for User objects:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
let Users = AuditLogs  
| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(30d)  
| where Category == "UserManagement";  
Users  
| where OperationName =~ "Delete user"        
| extend UserId = tostring(TargetResources[0].id)  
| join kind=anti (  
Users  
| where OperationName =~ "Hard Delete user"  
| extend UserId = tostring(TargetResources[0].id)  
) on UserId  
| join kind=anti (  
Users  
| where OperationName =~ "Restore user"  
| extend UserId = tostring(TargetResources[0].id)  
) on UserId  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While audit logs is not a completely reliable method, they might be useful while building workbooks or reports. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Graph API</p>
<p>By calling the Microsoft Graph API using PowerShell and the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/Microsoft.Graph.Beta.Identity.DirectoryManagement/?view=graph-powershell-beta">Microsoft.Graph module, </a>you can get a list of all the objects currently in the recycle bin. The sample code below will generate a single report for all the object types, and when needed, it can be easily adjusted to perform restores using the Restore-MgBetaDirectoryDeletedItem cmdlet. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph  
Connect-MgGraph   

$deletedUsers = Get-MgBetaDirectoryDeletedItemAsUser  
$deletedServicePrincipals = Get-MgBetaDirectoryDeletedItemAsServicePrincipal  
$deletedGroups = Get-MgBetaDirectoryDeletedItemAsGroup  
$deletedApplications = Get-MgBetaDirectoryDeletedItemAsApplication  
$deletedAUs = Get-MgBetaDirectoryDeletedItemAsAdministrativeUnit 

$deletedItems = @()  

$deletedItems += $deletedGroups  
$deletedItems += $deletedApplications  
$deletedItems += $deletedUsers  
$deletedItems += $deletedServicePrincipals  
$deletedItems += $deletedAUs  

if ($deletedItems.Count -eq 0) {  
    Write-Host "No soft deleted objects found." -ForegroundColor Green  
}  
else {  
    Write-Host "Soft deleted Users: $($deletedUsers.Count)" -ForegroundColor Green  
    Write-Host "Soft deleted Service Principals: $($deletedServicePrincipals.Count)" -ForegroundColor Green  
    Write-Host "Soft deleted M365 Groups: $($deletedGroups.Count)" -ForegroundColor Green  
    Write-Host "Soft deleted Applications: $($deletedApplications.Count)" -ForegroundColor Green  
    Write-Host "Soft deleted Administrative Units: $($deletedAUs.Count)" -ForegroundColor Green  

    $report = foreach ($item in $deletedItems) {  
        $deletedDate = Get-Date($item.DeletedDateTime)  
        $now = Get-Date  
        $hardDeletedInDays = 30 - ($now - $deletedDate).Days  

        [PSCustomObject]@{  
            Id                  = $item.Id  
            UserPrincipalName   = $item.UserPrincipalName  
            DisplayName         = $item.DisplayName  
            Deleted             = $deletedDate  
            HardDeletionIn      = $hardDeletedInDays  
        }  
    }  
    $report | Sort-Object 'Display Name' | Select-Object Id, DisplayName, Deleted, HardDeletionIn | Format-Table   
    $report | Export-Csv -Path "C:\temp\softDeletedObjects.csv" -Encoding UTF8 -NoTypeInformation  
}

 Conclusion &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Tracking deletions in Microsoft Entra ID can be useful for several reasons. These include identifying and recovering any objects that were accidentally or maliciously deleted, to monitoring and auditing changes in the directory and ensuring compliance with security policies and regulations, and to optimizing license usage by removing any unnecessary or obsolete objects. Make sure to enable monitoring of deletions using queries above as a starting point and perform regular reviews of deleted items to be able to catch any potentially unwanted deletions while objects are still available for restoration.</p>

 Further Testing &amp; Enhancement Underway in Collaboration with VRS Provider Community <p>NEWTOWN, PA — February 22, 2024 — <a href="https://ledgerdomain.com/">LedgerDomain</a> and Spherity, leading providers in digital credentialing services, today announced results from their latest performance testing, exceeding the current<a href="https://www.oc-i.org/"> Open Credentialing Initiative (OCI)</a> requirements for the U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA). Enacted in 2013, DSCSA requires end-to-end traceability for the vast majority of prescription drug products, preventing counterfeit or illegitimate products from reaching patients.</p><p>With OCI-compliant credentials, DSCSA stakeholders can digitally interact with each other, even if they have no prior business relationship and use different solution providers. These stakeholders include Authorized Trading Partners (ATPs) as defined by the statute (i.e. manufacturers, repackagers, wholesalers, 3PLs, and dispensers) alongside federal and state authorities and ATP Equivalents.</p><p>With 4.9 billion prescriptions filled in the U.S. each year, high performance is essential to ensuring supply chain resilience and security. In rigorous testing scenarios, both LedgerDomain and Spherity demonstrated performance speeds for their VP Generate and VP Verify API endpoints at least twice as fast as the baseline established by the OCI Digital Wallet Conformance Criteria. Under the OCI specification, both calls should average no more than 1500 milliseconds.</p><p>OCI-compliant credentials integrate with the Verification Router Service (VRS), a network designed to pass drug package verification requests between trading partners. As the recognized digital method for secure electronic message interoperability, OCI-compliant credentials also integrate with other channels, such as email and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for&nbsp;tracing.</p><p>Both LedgerDomain and Spherity continue to work closely with VRS partners to further enhance performance times to ensure real-time security and reliability. This broader effort in collaboration with VRS providers encompasses end-to-end performance.</p><p>“During the course of the current FDA Stabilization Period, solution providers are tuning up their systems to deliver the speed and reliability that the supply chain demands. We’re collaborating closely with our partners to resolve variations in end-to-end verification performance metrics as the VRS scales up through the spring.” — <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexcolgan?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAYPCFwBxAVNlVQWIPRuC5SrU4qYiYIRJEQ&amp;lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_all%3BWkzq0kbvQEeBllraqJpiyA%3D%3D">Alex Colgan</a>, head of marketing and partnerships, LedgerDomain</p><p>“Interoperable networks like the VRS are only possible when all stakeholders pull together. We’re working hard to further scale our infrastructure with minimal latency and maximum throughput.” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriswirrig/">Chris Wirrig</a>, customer success manager,&nbsp;Spherity</p><p>“Bringing enhanced drug distribution security under the DSCSA to life has been a decade-long effort, and the VRS is a cornerstone of this interoperable ‘system of systems.’ OCI-compliant credentialing adds a digital layer of secure authentication to the VRS, so that trading partners can exchange data with confidence.” — <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabethwaldorf?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAACVUfMBzqFzp5bfWQydohbDTd2khyK2kLs&amp;lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_all%3BhLO9w2ecSbCTnQPjw44S6w%3D%3D">Elizabeth Waldorf</a>, Director, Global Traceability and Standards, TraceLink</p><p>This progress comes ahead of the upcoming Healthcare Distribution Alliance (HDA) Distribution Management Conference (DMC) in March, where both LedgerDomain and Spherity will be present.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Today, we’re excited to announce that the Bluesky network is federating and opening up in a way that allows you to host your own data. What does this mean?</p>
<p>Your data, such as your posts, likes, and follows, needs to be stored somewhere. With traditional social media, your data is stored by the social media company whose services you've signed up for. If you ever want to stop using that company's services, you can do that—but you would have to leave that social network and lose your existing connections.</p>
<p>It doesn't have to be this way! An alternative model is how the internet itself works. Anyone can put up a website on the internet. You can choose from one of many companies to host your site (or even host it yourself), and you can always change your mind about this later. If you move to another hosting provider, your visitors won't even notice. No matter where your site's data is managed and stored, your visitors can find your site simply by typing the name of the website or by clicking a link.</p>
<p>We think social media should work the same way. When you register on Bluesky, by default we'll suggest that Bluesky will store your data. But if you'd like to let another company store it, or even store it yourself, you can do that. You'll also be able to change your mind at any point, moving your data to another provider without losing any of your existing posts, likes, or follows. From your followers' perspective, your profile is always available at your handle—no matter where your information is actually stored, or how many times it has been moved.</p>
<p>Federation lets services be interconnected, so there are a variety of apps and experiences that users can move between as fluidly as they do on the open web. The version of federation that we’re releasing today is intended for self-hosters. There are some guardrails in place to ensure we can keep the network running smoothly for everyone in the ecosystem. After this initial phase, we’ll open up federation to people looking to run larger servers with many users. For a more technical overview of what we’re releasing today and how to participate, check out the <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/self-host-federation">developer blog</a>.</p>
<p>Some of our existing features already follow the federated philosophy, including <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/3-6-2023-domain-names-as-handles-in-bluesky">usernames</a> and <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/7-27-2023-custom-feeds">feeds</a>. Today, we’re opening up federation for data hosting. Below, we wanted to answer some common questions about what federated hosting is, what it means for your experience using Bluesky, and why we’re so excited about it.</p>
 How does this affect my experience on Bluesky? 
<p>The short answer is: it doesn’t! If you don’t run your own server, Bluesky will stay the same. Even if you do run your own server, you may be surprised by how little things change. In fact, it should feel so similar that you might have to double check that you’ve logged into the right server.</p>
<p>This is all intentional: we've made self-hosting your own data both easy and affordable, so when you do so, you should be able to get just as good (or better) of an experience than letting Bluesky host your data.</p>
 If my experience doesn’t change, why federate? 
<p>We set out to build a protocol for the future of social media that returns control to users. From the apps you use, the feeds you browse, or the moderation preferences you prefer, your experience on Bluesky is yours to customize. But the abundance of choice and innovation here will be short-lived if it’s dependent on one company. We think that the future of social media needs to be a public good, mutually owned by the people and companies that participate in it. Social media should be as open and reliable as the internet itself.</p>
<p>The ability to host your own data, just as you might run your own website, provides the fundamental guarantee that social media will never again be controlled by only one company. Even if Bluesky were to disappear, if the data is hosted across different sites, the network can be rebuilt. The fact that it requires no permission to set up a new website is what has made the open web such a dynamic and creative force. Larger services, like search engines, have come and gone (anyone remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ask.com">Ask Jeeves</a>?). But the underlying foundation of independently hosted sites continues to let the web evolve. Making social open in the same way will create a foundation for better public conversations.</p>
<p>Today, we’re taking another step towards the vision of a self-sustaining social web — social media that isn’t controlled by any single company and is free to evolve on its own terms.</p>
 Does this mean Bluesky is going to be like Mastodon? 
<p>Mastodon is another federated social network built on a protocol called ActivityPub. While Bluesky — built on a protocol called the AT Protocol (atproto) — shares the term “federation” with other networks, the way it works is very different.</p>
<p>On Bluesky, server choice doesn’t affect what content you see. Servers are only one piece of the protocol — when you browse Bluesky, you see posts that are pulled together from many different servers. This is why you can change your server after signing up without losing your username, friends, or posts.</p>
<p>A summary of some ways Bluesky differs from Mastodon:</p>
 
 A focus on the global conversation: On Mastodon, your “instance”, or server, determines your community, so your experience depends on which server you join. An instance can send and receive posts from other instances, but it doesn’t try to offer a global view of the network. Your Mastodon server is part of your username, and becomes part of your identity. On Bluesky, your experience is based on what feeds and accounts you follow, and you can always participate in the global conversation (e.g. breaking news, viral posts, and algorithmic feeds). You can use your own domain name as your username, and continue participating from anywhere your account is hosted. 
 Composable moderation: Moderation on Bluesky is not tied to your server, like it is on Mastodon. Defederation, a way of addressing moderation issues in Mastodon by disconnecting servers, is not as relevant on Bluesky because there are other layers to the system. Server operators can set rules for what content they will host, but tools like blocklists and moderation services are what help communities self-organize around moderation preferences. We’ve already integrated block and mute lists, and the tooling for independent moderation services is coming soon. 
 Composable feeds: We designed your timeline on Bluesky so that it’s not tied to your server. Anyone can build a feed, and there are currently over 40,000 algorithmic feeds to choose from. Your Mastodon timeline is only made up of posts from accounts you follow, and does not pull together posts from the whole network like Bluesky’s custom feeds. 
 Account portability: We designed federated hosting on Bluesky so that you can move servers easily. Moving hosting services should be like changing your cell phone provider —&nbsp;you should be able to keep your identity and data. Changing servers on Bluesky doesn’t disrupt your username, friends, or posts. 
 
 So how can I self-host and join the network? 
<p>It will become easier to host your own server over time, but at the moment you’ll need a bit of technical know-how to get up and running. If you’re excited to jump in, checkout the <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/self-host-federation">developer blog</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/pds">PDS repo</a> on our Github, and the <a href="https://discord.gg/UWS6FFdhMe">PDS Administrators Discord</a>.</p>

<p>January was a whirlwind month for SpruceID, as we dove headfirst into a series of impactful events, each shedding light on the evolving landscape of digital identity and its implications for society.<br><br>Let's take a moment to recap the highlights from our events throughout January.</p> January 17th: Cyber &amp; Digital Identity Innovation Capitol Hill Day <p>The start of our year kicked off with Cyber &amp; Digital Identity Innovation Capitol Hill Day in DC, an event organized by Okta Ventures that explored the intersection of AI, cybersecurity, and government service delivery.<br><br>Our CEO, Wayne Chang, was at the forefront, participating in a CEO panel discussion about restoring citizen trust in government institutions. Alongside Karine Mellata of Intrinsic AI and Matt Chiodi of Cerby, Wayne articulated SpruceID's commitment to empowering users to control their data on the web, a mission deeply intertwined with rebuilding faith in governmental processes. <br><br>SpruceID also had a booth at the conference where we had the opportunity to engage one-on-one with staffers interested in learning more about verifiable digital credentials.<br><br>We were honored to have kicked off our year with this exciting event, where we were able to help educate congressional staffers on digital identity, the risks of AI related to identity, and network with others in the space.</p> January 19th: New York State Digital Identity Roundtable <p>Next on our agenda was the New York State Digital Identity Roundtable, a thought-provoking forum delving into the landscape of digital identity in New York. The event was organized by Assemblywoman Solages, who sponsored Bill A01018 which paves the way for mobile driver's licenses in New York.<br><br>SpruceID CEO Wayne Chang opened the event with an overview of digital credentials, the risks and privacy concerns that should be considered, and the importance of verifiable digital identity with the increased sophistication of AI impersonations.<br><br>Round table participants, including members of the New York government, leading tech companies, and multiple privacy-oriented and civil liberties organizations, posed crucial questions surrounding privacy, security, and inclusivity in the digital identity landscape.<br><br>From concerns about bias and exclusion to discussions about democratic oversight, the conversations during this roundtable underscored the need for robust, transparent frameworks to guide the deployment of digital identity solutions. We were honored to participate in this roundtable and look forward to continuing the conversation on many of these important issues.</p> January 25th: Milan Digital Identity Observatory Workshop <p>Rounding out our month was the Digital Identity Observatory Workshop, a collaborative event to help chart the course for the future of digital identity. CIOs and digital transformation executives from leading European multinational corporations converged in Milan to explore emerging trends, opportunities, and challenges with verifiable digital identity. Through discussions and interactive sessions, participants charted a path forward grounded in privacy, security, and user empowerment principles.<br><br>SpruceID joined virtually with a brief presentation from Wayne Chang, SpruceID CEO, recapping our digital identity tech, national and global trends, and emerging best practices and use cases for verifying digital credentials in business workflows.<br><br>As we look ahead, SpruceID remains committed to driving the conversation around digital identity, advocating for solutions that prioritize the rights and well-being of individuals in an increasingly digital world.</p> Stay Tuned for What’s Next! <p>January was a busy month of community engagement and thought leadership for SpruceID. As we reflect on the insights gained and connections made during last month’s events, we remain eager in our mission to build a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions. Stay tuned for more updates as we join in on more exciting events in the coming months.<br></p> <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p><p></p>

<p>We are thrilled to announce this partnership between Holochain and <a href="https://rainlang.xyz/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Rainlang</a>. While we have been interwoven efforts for some time, making it official before heading to <a href="http://ethdenver.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">ETHDenver 2024</a> feels like an important step forwards in our collaboration.</p><p>What is Rainlang? Rainlang is a framework that aims to simplify smart contracts and make them more accessible to a wider audience. The aim of making smart contracts accessible to everyone comes from the belief that accessibility is the difference between theoretical and practical decentralization.</p><p>By combining Holochain’s framework for building peer-to-peer apps with Rainlang’s easy to use smart contracts, new groundbreaking solutions in the Web3 space are possible, unleashing opportunities and possibilities for developers, enterprises, and users alike.</p> Fullstack DeFi <p>DeFi has exploded in recent years, but it is still a challenging space, accessible to the few, not the many. Rainlang’s work to make smart contracts more legible is an important step to democratizing this space. But there are still hurdles.&nbsp;</p><p>When we interact with smart contracts, we usually do so through a website. This is a point of centralization that introduces several risks, from phishing to DNS hacks. Plus, nothing stops a website from being taken down, either by the company running it or by a government, DDOS attack, or otherwise. The solution? Truly distributed applications, running on your device, interacting as a network of peers. This is what Holochain provides to DeFi, the opportunity for the infrastructure supporting the EVM to also be decentralized, secure, and verifiable.&nbsp;</p> Orderbook <p><a href="https://docs.rainlang.xyz/orderbook/introduction/?ref=blog.holochain.org">The Rain Orderbook</a> is an on-chain orderbook contract that enables users to deploy complex strategies for managing token trades. Using Holochain, the Rainlang team is building a decentralized platform where Orderbook users can share draft trading strategies, simulations, tests of strategies, and even raw financial data. This will make the trading tools of Orderbook more accessible as a community grows around them.&nbsp;</p><p>Building this platform on Holochain enables a collaborative platform that runs directly on user’s devices without data sitting on a third party server. This is a truly decentralized stack that maintains options for privacy where trading groups can make private spaces to share their trading strategies etc. With this user centric design that provides security from many common hacks in the crypto space, we can start to see new potential for Web3.</p> Holochain Apps Using Rainlang <p>For the last several months we have been experimenting with integrating Rainlang contracts into the stack of Holochain applications. <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/fractal-tribute-bridging-blockchains-and-holochain/">Fractal Tribute</a> demonstrated a Rainlang contract on the Polygon EVM, connected to a Holochain application where users played a collaborative art game. Holo was used to provide read-only access to the game, both for <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/fractal-tribute-nov-2?ref=blog.holochain.org">OpenSea</a> to access the art and for a website that allowed for public viewership of the game. </p><p>This is just one demonstration of how Rainlang can be used to connect Holochain apps to the blockchain. We are excited to see what others develop — pairing the financial markets and global consensus of EVMs with the agent-centric networks of Holochain. </p><p>We have more in the works. In the meantime, <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/augmenting-nfts-with-holochain/">read about more of the solutions we envision</a>, and maybe we’ll see you at <a href="http://ethdenver.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">ETHDenver 2024</a>?</p>

  <p>Over 800,000 organizations rely on Microsoft Entra to navigate the ever-changing threat landscape, ensuring their security while enhancing the productivity of their end users. Customers have frequently expressed their desire for greater transparency into their Entra usage, with licensing being a particularly popular request. Today, we’re excited to announce the public preview of Microsoft Entra license utilization portal, a new feature that enables customers to optimize their Entra ID Premium licenses by providing insights into the current usage of premium features.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this post, we’ll provide an overview of Entra ID license utilization, including what it is, how it works, and how you can optimize your license to get the most out of your Entra ID Premium Licenses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Entra ID License utilization portal allows you to see how many Entra ID P1 and P2 licenses you have and the usage of the key features corresponding to the license type. We're thrilled that Conditional Access and risk-based Conditional Access usage are available as part of the public preview, but this would be expanded to include usage of other SKUs and corresponding features at general availability. This perspective is an initial stride towards empowering you to comprehend your license count and the value you extract from your Entra license. It also aids in addressing any over-usage issues that might emerge in your tenants.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
 Try the public preview 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The license utilization &amp; insights portal is available under the “Usage &amp; Insights” blade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1. License utilization insights portal under Usage &amp; Insights blade</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This portal would provide you with insights into the top features you’re using that correspond with your Entra ID Premium P1 and P2 licenses (as applicable). You can leverage these insights to secure and govern your users along with ensuring you comply with the licensing terms and conditions. Here is a screenshot of feature usage view you can see in the Entra portal:</p>
<p>Figure 2. Entra ID Premium P1 feature usage on License utilization portal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3. Entra ID Premium P2 feature usage on License utilization portal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What’s next?&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll continue to extend this transparency into Entra usage and would love to hear your feedback on this new capability, as well as what would be most useful to you. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In this episode we talk with Phil Windley, Sr. Software Development Manager at AWS, Cofounder of IIW, former Chair of Sovrin Foundation. We talked about his experience building and leading the Sovrin Foundation, which at one point was almost synonymous with the term self-sovereign identity. It was set up to be an identity metasystem that would reinvent how identity was done online… and we talk about why it didn’t end up becoming that.</p><p>Phil shares lessons from identity systems that got adopted, like the social login metasystem, as well as from things that didn’t get a lot of adoption, like certain identity blockchains and information cards a decade prior. We hope this an interesting episode. We’re glad we got to tell a small part of the Sovrin story as we think a lot of today’s reusable ID projects have their roots in the movement Sovrin started—including Trinsic.&nbsp;</p><p>To learn more about Phil you can visit his personal website <a href="https://windley.com/">https://windley.com/</a> where you'll find ways to contact him, and buy his new book.</p><p>Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for more announcements related to the future of identity at <a href="http://trinsic.id/podcast">trinsic.id/podcast</a></p><p>Reach out to Riley (<a href="https://twitter.com/rileyphughes">@rileyphughes</a>) and Trinsic (<a href="https://twitter.com/trinsic_id">@trinsic_id</a>) on Twitter.

<p>Remember the wise words of Charles Darwin? "It's not the strongest of the species that survives," he declared, "nor the most intelligent [...] – it is the one that is most adaptable to change." This rings especially true in today's financial services landscape, where digital disruption is no longer a whisper on the wind, but a full-blown hurricane tearing through legacy systems and traditional business models. Digital-first providers, including challenger banks, neobanks, fintechs, insurtechs and most recently, techfins, have morphed into formidable competitors, delivering seamless, personalized experiences that leave many incumbents gasping for air. And it comes as no surprise that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/content-library/ebooks/3952-unlock-power-digital-identity-financial-services.html">digital identity in financial services</a> underpins this very paradigm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But as the rapid evolution of the financial services industry has shown throughout history, the most adaptable inherit the future. While the rise of digital-first providers across the industry presents undeniable challenges, so too it creates extensive opportunities for incumbent providers to raise their game, gain access to cutting-edge fintech/techfin innovation, and most importantly of all: deliver new streamlined, secure, and scalable experiences to their customers, while having them coming back for more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This explains why the most progressive (and successful) financial institutions continue to increase their investments in converged identity and access management (IAM) to drive hyper-personalization, adaptive security, and business model expansion at scale.</p>
