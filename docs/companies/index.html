- Learn about building applications on Urbit (it’s easy).
- Find out how to work and create on a platform that is fully owned by you.
- Meet with the growing ecosystem of communities and businesses built on Urbit.

If you’re simply into calm computing, well, there will be plenty of that too.

You’ll choose between two tracks:

- Assembly: Assemble software or work together on projects in small groups
- Workshop: A two day workshop taught by Neal Davis, Urbit for Developers

Come see a demo of the new Bridge front end, first migrating a star and spawning some planets, then activating a planet, all on L2.

This call will be a great opportunity for galaxy owners to get their questions answered for the upcoming vote on Layer 2 implementation. It will also be good for anyone in the community that wants a comprehensive look at how naive rollups will work to bring down planet activation costs. If you're technically inclined, be sure to check out [Philip's walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQdqCwYIBoU) of the naive rollup code ahead of time so you can ask questions.

  “We have set aggressive targets to grow our channel partnerships and footprint in the US, while dramatically reducing the total cost of ownership with edge computing which moves more of the processing power and data storage closer to the cameras themselves. The collective experience of these talented individuals will help us hit these targets.” – Avi Golan, CEO, AnyVision 



  



<p>Facial recognition specialist <a href="https://www.anyvision.co/">AnyVision</a> is further demonstrating its momentum with the announcement of two new executive hires.</p>



<p>One of them is Adi Nativ, who has been named the company’s new VP of Global Business Development and Strategic Partnerships. Nativ comes to the company from a 16-year term with wireless broadband company Radwin, where he served as VP of Marketing and Business Development and later as VP of Global Business Development. He has also held positions with Actelis Networks and Israel’s Ministry of Defense.</p>



<p>Paul Witt, meanwhile, is AnyVision’s new VP and GM of Sales for the Americas. He comes to the company from a similar role at IDEMIA, which he held from August of 2020 to July of this year. Witt has also held sales VP roles with Crossmatch and HID Global (after its acquisition of the former), Early Warning Services, and Authentify.</p>



<p>“I’m thrilled to welcome Adi and Paul to AnyVision’s executive team to help harness the transformative power of AI, biometrics, and edge computing to redefine physical security and personal safety,” said <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/anyvision-ethical-recommendations-uk-surveillance-commissioner-709081/">AnyVision CEO Avi Golan</a>. “We have set aggressive targets to grow our channel partnerships and footprint in the US, while dramatically reducing the total cost of ownership with edge computing which moves more of the processing power and data storage closer to the cameras themselves. The collective experience of these talented individuals will help us hit these targets.”</p>



<p>In addition to the new appointments, AnyVision has promoted its previous VP of Business Development &amp; OEM, Ido Amidi, to the role of VP of Product Management. In a statement announcing the changes, AnyVision indicated that Amidi’s new role will entail, among other things, efforts to improve user satisfaction and “expand into new markets”.</p>



<p>News of the changes comes soon after AnyVision closed a funding round that <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/anyvision-raises-235m-in-softbank-led-funding-round-707071/">brought in $235 million</a>, and was led by the prominent SoftBank Vision Fund 2 as well as Eldridge. At the time, AnyVision indicated that the funding would be used to accelerate R&amp;D innovation, though it now appears it may also help the company to finance the additions to its upper management – strategic moves that appear to signal the company’s ambitious growth plans in the global biometrics market.</p>

<p>Boston-based biometric wearables company WHOOP has announced that it raised $200 million in Series F funding led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2. Following this latest round of investments, WHOOP says its $3.6 billion valuation now makes it the most valuable standalone “human performance company” in the world.</p>



  



<p>“We are thrilled to deepen our partnership with SoftBank as we grow internationally,” said&nbsp;Will Ahmed, WHOOP Founder and CEO. “While we have experienced amazing growth in the past year, the potential of our technology and the vast market for health monitoring remains largely untapped.”</p>



<p>The WHOOP band — a biometric wearable — is able to use the host of biometric sensors found onboard to measure metrics such as heart rate, respiratory rate, and sweat levels, among others. Both its utility and popularity grew to new heights over the past several months thanks to its ability to monitor for signs of COVID-19 infections, <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/us-military-trial-fitbits-covid-detection-110406/">and even predict</a> the onset of the virus days before the wearer feels its symptoms.</p>



<p>This has led to a number of high-profile partnerships during this time with a range of private and public entities including the<a href="https://mobileidworld.com/us-military-trial-fitbits-covid-detection-110406/"> Professional Golf Association</a>, fitness platform CrossFit, Howard University, and even the United States Army.</p>



<p>“WHOOP continues to experience tremendous user growth as they transform human performance, adding new features and products that are focused on enabling their users to lead healthier lives,” said&nbsp;Kristin Bannon, Investment Director at SoftBank Investment Advisers. “We are excited to continue our support of Will and the WHOOP team as they aim to improve health in the U.S. and expand internationally.”</p>



<p>In a press release announcing the funding, WHOOP said it will use this new injection of capital in a variety of ways. These include new investment in R&amp;D to build the future of wearable technology; enhancements across its suite of products, software, and analytics; the acquisition of leading technology companies in order to evolve its membership offerings; and expanding its presence in the professional sports market by “taking fan and athlete engagement to a new level through biometric data visualization.”</p>



<p>The Series F round also saw participation from investors at IVP, Cavu Ventures, Thursday Ventures, GP Bullhound, Accomplice, NextView Ventures, and Animal Capital, and will see Ms. Bannon join the WHOOP Board of Directors.</p>

<p>PopID is gaining traction with its biometric payment and access control platform, and attributing much of the credit to college students in southern California.</p>



<p>The Pasadena-based startup says that more than a hundred restaurants and retail brands now support PopPay, a platform that enables end users to <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/california-robots-make-pizza-pay-with-your-face-803301/">make purchases with a face scan</a>. It’s the kind of ‘naked payments’ platform that allows transactions to be made without a payment card, cash, phone, or any other hardware token.</p>



<p>PopID adds that its overarching platform, which includes PopPay and its face-based access control system, PopEntry, now has about 70,000 registered users, and has performed more than four million authentications.</p>



<p>That success is thanks in large part to PopEntry’s use in student housing <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/popid-return-learn-biometric-access-control-academic-institutions-082708/">on college campuses</a>, according to PopID Chief Operating Officer Yale Goldberg.</p>



<p>“Students first enroll for the PopID service in order to get into their housing facilities without needing a key card,” he explained in a statement. “Once those students learn that they can use the same service to purchase food and other goods without having to pay on the day of the purchase, they get addicted to PopPay as a more convenient, fun and financially flexible way to pay.”</p>



<p>While PopID credits its growing user base to this student-driven trend, the latter was enabled in part by recent inflows of venture capital, with PopID having closed a $10 million Series B funding round earlier this summer that featured investments from SoftBank subsidiary Japan Computer Vision.</p>



<p>Now, PopID wants to keep the trend going. Whereas its network is currently <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/popid-builds-biometric-poppay-network-pasadena-081707/">concentrated in southern California</a>, PopID says it plans to bring its platform to college campuses nationwide over the next year and a half.</p>



<p>Japan Computer Vision CEO Andrew Schwabecher, meanwhile, sees even greater opportunities over the longer term. “We are excited about the future and the opportunity to expand the system internationally,” he said.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.equifax.com/personal/">Equifax</a> has unveiled a new Digital Identity Suite solution that was built to streamline the rental application process. In that regard, the solution will make it easier for property managers to verify the identities of their applicants, and thwart those who are <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometric-id-verification-fights-rental-housing-fraud-506032/">trying to rent a home with fraudulent information</a>.</p>



  



<p>To that end, the Digital Identity Suite comes with a slew of identity verification features, including a document verification tool that uses <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/okta-turns-onfido-biometric-onboarding-account-recovery-040208/">facial recognition</a> to match a selfie to the image on a photo ID. The feature utilizes the camera in a standard mobile device, thereby giving housing applicants the ability to submit proof of identity remotely.</p>



<p>The Suite will also check with other sources to make sure that the applicant’s email and phone number are legitimate, and to link that information to the mobile device and SIM card being used for the application. The platform’s auto-fill feature will help speed up that process, while the device verification feature guarantees that the device is in the hands of its true owner and provides property managers with another authentication factor.</p>



<p>Finally, the FraudIQ feature analyzes each profile to weed out synthetic identities. The goal is to spot those who are using a stolen name and social security number to fill out their application, which can lead to severe financial losses for landlords and victims if the identity fraud is not caught in time.</p>



<p>The Digital Identity Suite is geared toward those managing multi-family properties. Equifax noted that there are now 44 million rental households in the US, and it expects that number to rise as migration patterns shift in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>“Improving consumer experience, protecting against identity fraud, lowering application friction and streamlining the screening process can help property managers attract new tenants and maintain higher rental occupancy rates,” said&nbsp;Equifax Enterprise Mortgage and Housing SVP Tom Ciulla. “Our multi-family solutions offer a comprehensive and customizable way for property managers to help build trust with applicants starting at the very first touchpoint.”</p>



<p>Equifax also lets property managers use the Work Number&nbsp;database to verify an applicant’s employment and income status. The company has <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/equifax-illinois-govt-among-oktas-latest-customers-remote-work-wave-082802/">adopted Okta’s Identity Cloud&nbsp;and Customer Identity solutions</a> to improve its security posture after <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/equifax-forensic-investigation-410033/">suffering a high-profile breach in 2017</a>.</p>

<p>London’s Heathrow Airport is currently trialing a touchless bag drop system from <a href="https://amadeus.com/en">Amadeus</a>. The innovative new system is designed to mimic the utility and user experience of a standard touchscreen, without forcing users to make physical contact with the actual screen.</p>



  



<p>To that end, the Amadeus system comes with a built-in infrared proximity sensor that can track someone’s finger while it is close to the screen. It is robust enough to pick up someone’s finger at a distance of three centimeters, and sensitive enough to determine when the user is trying to select one of the options being displayed. As a result, passengers can navigate the bag drop system just as they would with a regular touchscreen, and can do so without any of the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/sita-mobile-tech-can-enable-safe-contactless-airport-experiences-061208/">risk associated with shared surfaces</a>.</p>



<p>The infrared technology has been deployed at six Auto Bag Drop (ABD) kiosks at Heathrow. However, the Airport could expand the system across its entire collection of 270+ ABD kiosks if the trial goes well. Heathrow indicated that the rollout could be completed in a few weeks.</p>



<p>The ABD units themselves come courtesy of ICM Airport Technics, which operates as an Amadeus subsidiary. Amadeus has also explored a ‘screen mirroring’ system that would let travelers control the bag drop system with their own mobile device, but ultimately opted to move forward with an infrared sensor located at the top of the bag drop screen.</p>



<p>“We’re working closely with our airport and airline partners to deliver solutions that help them adapt passenger services to the new environment,” said ICM CEO Richard Dinkelmann.</p>



<p>“We’re preparing to welcome back more travelers, by <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/frost-sullivan-reports-growing-demand-contactless-airport-management-solutions-022303/">looking for new and innovative technologies</a> that will help to ensure the passenger experience remains safe and efficient in a post-COVID world,” said London Heathrow Process Improvement Director Mark Burgess. “This is just one of many new measures that we’re implementing across our terminals, as part of Heathrow’s Fly Safe program.”</p>



<p>Amadeus has made its Traveler ID program compatible with the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/star-alliance-launches-biometric-screening-program-lufthansa-passengers-111902/">Star Alliance Biometrics</a> program to <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/new-partnership-brings-amadeus-star-alliance-biometrics-expansion-effort-121407/">promote contactless passenger experiences</a>. Heathrow started introducing <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometric-screening-heathrow-404102/">biometric passenger screening</a> back in 2017.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.idemia.com/">IDEMIA</a> has agreed to help NASA verify the identities of its partners. The company will be supplying the space agency with a new Remote Identity Proofing (RIP) solution that allows NASA collaborators to register with the organization on a mobile device.</p>



  



<p>In practice, the solution is comparable to more <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/merchantrade-turns-idemia-biometric-onboarding-060401/">public-facing onboarding tools</a>. The RIP will ask NASA contractors to use their smartphone to take a picture of their driver’s license or another ID, and the solution will use face and document recognition to confirm the authenticity of that document and match it to its owner. The solution has liveness detection to make sure that the person depicted on the ID and the person holding it are in fact one and the same.</p>



<p>The difference, of course, is that the federal government faces stricter security expectations than the general public. In that regard, the IDEMIA RIP tool is fully compliant with the NIST’s 800-63A Identity Assurance Level (IAL) 2 requirements, and it can be used to resolve I-9 forms from the US Citizens and Immigration Service.</p>



<p>“IDEMIA is honored to be supporting NASA in supplying advanced verification technology to meet the ever-changing work environment, especially with the substantial increase in flexible and remote work,” said IDEMIA North America Federal &amp; Commercial Sales VP Paul Aronhime.</p>



<p>IDEMIA has previously provided card-based identity and access credentials for the Department of Defense, and its identity technology has also been featured in the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/idemia-mlb-partner-precheck-biometric-screening-504234/">TSA PreCheck program</a>, where it has been used to <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/tsa-precheck-reaches-milestone-with-11-million-enrolled-070908/">register more than 11 million individuals since 2013</a>. More recently, the company has been focused on mobile driver’s licenses, and it has already delivered <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/interview-idemia-matt-thompson-mobile-id-identity-on-the-edge-705059/">mobile ID solutions</a> for <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/idemia-brings-mobile-ids-arizona-032608/">Arizona</a>, <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/idemia-provides-mobile-ids-state-delaware-031107/">Delaware</a>, and <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/idemia-upgrades-oklahoma-mobile-id-solution-801201/">Oklahoma</a>.</p>



<p>The RIP solution, meanwhile, is compatible with both iOS and Android devices. As a result, NASA partners will be able to use their system regardless of their preferred platform.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.cvent.com/event/25493319-e3ec-48c6-bc4b-61d4a7a17c3a/register?RefId=eml&amp;rp=713ab068-b719-48f0-b850-c16661b81030">Enterprise Biometrics Online Summit</a> is right around the corner, and FindBiometrics has now released an agenda for the event detailing a day packed with informative and insightful presentations and discussions.</p>



<p>The event, slated for September 22, will start off at 11:00 a.m. ET with opening remarks from FindBiometrics Editor in Chief Peter Counter, followed by a keynote from Jeremy Grant, the Coordinator of the Better Identity Alliance. That will be followed by a keynote presentation from an SVP from one of the biggest names in face biometrics – FaceTec’s Jay Meier.</p>



<p>Around noon will be the event’s first big panel discussion, and it’s going to tackle one of the most important issues facing virtually all industries in the COVID-19 age. “Reopening With Biometrics: Security and Access During a Pandemic” will feature Group337 CEO Lee Odess and ZKTeco CEO Manish Dalal.</p>



<p>Next up will be what is surely one of the most highly anticipated presentations of the day. Acuity Market Intelligence’s Principal Analyst, Maxine Most, galvanized the audience at the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/now-available-on-demand-the-findbiometrics-identity-summit/">FindBiometrics Identity Summit</a> in June with her keynote address, “Harnessing the Tornado”; at the Enterprise Biometrics Online Summit, Most will deliver Part 2 of her exploration of the whirlwind of activity in biometric tech.</p>



<p>That will be followed by insights from another expert observer from outside of the industry itself: the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Naomi Lefkovitz. From her position as the Senior Privacy Policy Advisor of NIST’s Information Technology Lab, Lefkovitz will speak with a FindBiometrics editor about privacy frameworks in the workplace.</p>



<p>The afternoon will also see commentary from Frost and Sullivan Security Industry Analyst Danielle VanZandt, who will discuss the practicalities of retiring password-based security in the workplace; and Lee Odess will return to discuss the major biometric trends in the security industry. But not before presentations from AnyVision and Thales, a fireside chat with IDEMIA’s Senior Director of Digital Identity for North America Tarvinder Sembhi, a ChannelPro session on access control and the IoT, and a stroll through the Summit’s virtual Expo Hall.</p>



<p>Finally, the day will conclude with a discussion on reusable identity credentials featuring representatives from two of the most important companies active in the digital authentication space: Onfido Director of Alliances &amp; Partnerships Ed Ackerman, and Microsoft Principal Program Manager Ankur Patel.</p>



<p>Clearly, the Enterprise Biometrics Online Summit will deliver a wealth of insight into how biometric technology can be used – and is being used – to transform all kinds of organizations for the better. Registration for the event is still <a href="https://web.cvent.com/event/25493319-e3ec-48c6-bc4b-61d4a7a17c3a/register?RefId=eml&amp;rp=713ab068-b719-48f0-b850-c16661b81030">open and free of charge</a>, so be sure to sign up today to give your organization a leg up in the ongoing digital transformation of business.</p>

				  Indicio Named Finalist in IDC’s Inaugural Best in Future of Digital Infrastructure North America Awards&nbsp;  
			  
				
				
				 <p>Seattle WA – September 14, 2021 – Indicio today announced it has been named a finalist in the inaugural <a href="https://www.idc.com/promo/future-of-x/digital-infrastructure/awards">IDC Future Enterprise, Best in Future of Digital Infrastructure North America Awards</a> in the Ubiquitous Deployment category.

<p>The Indicio Network is the world’s only professionally-managed, enterprise-grade Hyperledger Indy-based network for decentralized identity. Indicio facilitates a consortium of 23 diverse, forward-thinking companies on five continents that are driving the use of decentralized identity to improve privacy and security in fintech, healthcare, travel, and the Internet of Things (IOT). Node Operators include GlobalID, Liquid Avatar, IdRamp, Bonifii, BizSecure, Entrustient, Blockspaces, Lorica Identity, and Networks Synergy. Learn<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/21-industry-leaders-from-5-continents-join-indicio-network-consortium-to-drive-global-adoption-of-decentralized-identity-301325690.html"> more </a>about the Indicio Node Operator Consortium membership.</p>
<p>“Being named a finalist in the IDC Future of Enterprise awards recognizes not just the accomplishments of Indicio’s dedicated professionals who designed and built the network, but of everything our network’s Node Operator community has done to support its establishment and maturity in such a short period of time,” said Heather Dahl, CEO, and co-founder of Indicio.tech. “We created this network to enable businesses use the power of decentralized identity to create Trusted Data Networks. These transform the way we authenticate, share, and verify data in a secure, privacy-preserving way so that information from people and connected things can be trusted. We’re seeing our Node Operators apply this technology to an extraordinary range of use cases—and they’re able to do that because they have a professionally supported enterprise-grade decentralized network to build on.”</p>

<p>PYMNTS talked with Finicity CEO Steve Smith about open banking, open finance, data aggregation, where we’re headed with technologies and standards and how consumer-permissioned data is the future of lending.</p>
<p>Innovation is largely occurring differently in each fintech segment so the usefulness of a broad <a href="http://finicity.com/open-banking">open banking platform</a> to provide relevant, quality data across investing, budgeting and mortgage is becoming more and more important.</p>
<p>“We’re entering an age in which – through open banking – consumers are increasingly comfortable sharing their personal financial data with third parties. And amid that “gold rush,” a slew of companies have popped up (mostly fintechs), promising to upend financial services, though they tend to focus on segments of financial life – investing, let’s say, or mortgages, or high-yield savings accounts.”</p>

The SEC threatens to sue&nbsp;Coinbase Brian Armstrong, Photo: TechCrunch Disrupt<p>Rosalyn Layton over at Forbes has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/roslynlayton/2021/09/12/its-time-to-end-the-secs-clarity-charade-on-crypto/?sh=37e8e2dc25fa">a great overview of the SEC v. Coinbase situation</a>. The brief overview looks something like&nbsp;this:</p>  Regarding the sales of crypto as securities: “There’s actually a lot of clarity on that front,” Gary Gensler <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/gensler-aspen-security-forum-2021-08-03">said at Aspen in early&nbsp;August</a>.  A month later, Gensler <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fb126d79-2e60-4002-8aba-b08887fca609">told the FT</a>: “Talk to us, come in,” he said. “There are a lot of platforms that are in operation today that would do better engaging and instead there is a bit of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. begging for forgiveness rather than asking for permission.”  <p>And here’s what happened when Coinbase and Brian Armstrong took Gensler’s advice and actively engaged with the SEC on one of their upcoming products, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/roslynlayton/2021/09/12/its-time-to-end-the-secs-clarity-charade-on-crypto/?sh=37e8e2dc25fa">according to&nbsp;Layton</a>:</p><blockquote>They approached the SEC for guidance on their product. Armstrong says the SEC responded with subpoenas for records and depositions, demanded a list of all their clients who had expressed interest in the product, and finally issued Coinbase a Wells notice — a warning of impending enforcement action. Armstrong said that by May of this year, the SEC was the only office in Washington refusing to meet with him at&nbsp;all.</blockquote><blockquote>“They are refusing to offer any opinion in writing to the industry on what should be allowed and why, and instead are engaging in intimidation tactics behind closed doors,” Armstrong tweeted. “Meanwhile, plenty of other crypto companies continue to offer a lend feature, but Coinbase is somehow not allowed&nbsp;to.”</blockquote><p>Now, there are plenty of arguments that the product Coinbase is looking to offer might very well be classified as a security — <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-09-08/lending-bitcoins-is-tricky">check out Matt Levine’s solid overview</a>.</p><p>That might be the weakest link in Armstrong’s tweetstorm, but it’s also not the primary point here. The SEC’s strategy of regulation by enforcement stifles innovation, hurts investors, and perhaps most egregiously, picks winners and losers — all while further muddying the regulatory landscape. Here’s Layton&nbsp;again:</p><blockquote>Without Congressional oversight, a regulator can run roughshod over the law. Why was Ethereum blessed while its rival Ripple was sued? Why does Coinbase get a Wells notice while crypto lenders like Aave, built on the Ethereum platform, get a pass? Jesse Powell, CEO of Coinbase’s rival, Kraken, tweeted a response to Armstrong that “regulators are beating down good actors because it’s convenient” and asked: “Who is behind the effort to drive domestic businesses and consumers offshore?” Angry XRP holders point to Clayton and Hinman’s business ties to Ethereum before and after their SEC tenures. Powell implies that established financial actors welcome regulatory chaos to protect their revenue of transaction fees if it deters crypto’s disruption of traditional business&nbsp;models.</blockquote><p>One option for Coinbase? Fight&nbsp;back.</p><p>As GlobaliD co-founder and CEO Greg Kidd has <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-why-innovation-sometimes-requires-legal-action-92ba26eb2a81">argued in the past</a>, sometimes you have to litigate to innovate. (That happens to be the theme of his talk at <a href="https://us.money2020.com/speaker/greg-kidd-s103-58562">this year’s Money2020 conference in Vegas next&nbsp;month</a>.)</p><p>The SEC is incentivized not to overcommit and pick off easy targets to fill their coffers. (That’s their business model.) And they’ll want to grab as much land as possible. But Ripple and Coinbase have the resources and the will to fight back and find regulatory clarity through the legal&nbsp;process.</p><p>Eventually, it will be up to Congress to provide the country with regulatory clarity for crypto. Until then, get ready for more litigation.</p> 2. What people are&nbsp;saying <p><a href="https://twitter.com/davidortiz/status/1435642074284666891?s=12">Brian Armstrong</a>:</p><blockquote>Look….we’re committed to following the law. Sometimes the law is unclear. So if the SEC wants to publish guidance, we are also happy to follow that (it’s nice if you actually enforce it evenly across the industry equally&nbsp;btw).</blockquote><blockquote>But in this case they are refusing to offer any opinion in writing to the industry on what should be allowed and why, and instead are engaging in intimidation tactics behind closed doors. Whatever their theory is here, it feels like a reach/land grab vs other regulators.</blockquote><blockquote>Meanwhile, plenty of other crypto companies continue to offer a lend feature, but Coinbase is somehow not allowed&nbsp;to.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>If you don’t want this activity, then simply publish your position, in writing, and enforce it evenly across the industry.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-capital-2669d1b8-4017-4cad-a333-48fbc5df177f.html">Felix Salmon</a>:</p><blockquote>Why it matters: Coinbase, the first major crypto company to get SEC approval to go public on a U.S. stock exchange, is about as regulator-friendly as crypto companies get — it has positioned itself as being far more in compliance with U.S. regulatory strictures than overseas rivals like Binance or&nbsp;FTX.</blockquote><blockquote>This week’s news shows that the industry still has a long way to go before it truly comes to terms with the U.S. regulatory environment.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>The other side: “The SEC doesn’t have the obligation (or the resources) to issue guidance about things that should be obvious to a baby securities lawyer,” <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamLevitin/status/1435652290627653636">tweets</a> Georgetown Law professor Adam Levitin. “It’s really astounding that Coinbase thinks it’s entitled to anything&nbsp;more.”</blockquote><blockquote>The bottom line: Coinbase’s comparative advantage was supposed to be that it stands comfortably in America’s regulatory good graces. But now Armstrong seems to be jealous of other crypto companies that offer similar products without SEC approval, and is picking fights with regulators.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-09-08/lending-bitcoins-is-tricky">Matt Levine</a>:</p><blockquote>A Bitcoin lending program — in which (1) a bunch of people pool their Bitcoins, (2) some manager or smart contract lends those Bitcoins to borrowers who pay interest, and (3) some or all of the interest is paid back to the people in the pool — is pretty straightforwardly an investment contract and thus a security.</blockquote><blockquote>I have been saying this for months, though that’s only because the SEC has also been saying it for months. But I admit that the SEC hasn’t been saying it in a particularly clear way. There’s not an SEC press release saying “FYI crypto lending programs are obviously securities.” And I gather that there are a lot of crypto lending programs — they’re a staple feature of decentralized finance platforms — and roughly none of them are registered with the SEC. The SEC and state regulators have brought enforcement actions against a few of them — we’ve talked about BitConnect and BlockFi and Blockchain Credit Partners — but I suppose each of those is distinctive in its own way, and there are about a zillion others that haven’t been sued by the SEC. 1 So you could reasonably look around and be like “oh sure we can pool people’s Bitcoins and lend them and pass along the interest, that’s not a security that should involve the SEC.” You’d be wrong, but I get where you’re coming&nbsp;from.</blockquote><p>…</p><blockquote>Look, I get it. From the perspective of Coinbase, and of its customers, and frankly of most normal people interested in&nbsp;crypto:</blockquote>  People would like to lend their Bitcoins.  It doesn’t feel like a security.  It’s kind of annoying and archaic that a 1946 Supreme Court case says that it&nbsp;is?  <blockquote>But look at it from the SEC’s perspective:</blockquote>  The SEC really doesn’t like&nbsp;crypto.  The SEC is a regulatory agency that has a general tendency to want to do more regulating.  Popular tokens like Bitcoin and Ether are not securities and so not subject to SEC regulation, which leaves the SEC feeling&nbsp;antsy.  But crypto lending programs are pretty clearly securities subject to SEC regulation.  So for the SEC to say “crypto lending programs are securities and need to be regulated” serves the dual purposes of (1) expanding SEC jurisdiction over crypto and (2) stopping those programs.  Also it’s pretty clearly justified by a 1946 Supreme Court&nbsp;case.  None of that is at all satisfying, I suspect, but it is&nbsp;true.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/kuppinger">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>A paradigm for aligning Development, Delivery, Infrastructure Setup &amp; Management, and Operations in a seamless manner, with identity &amp; security always at the forefront. Policy-based, automated, and with well-segregated but aligned responsibilities.</p>
<p>DevOps, an integrated approach for development and operations of software and services, and DevSecOps, adding a security angle, have been around for close to a decade. While DevOps became an established principle, combining agile software development and the subsequent operations, DevSecOps – despite being intensively discussed – is seldom implemented and enforced in practice.</p>
<p>This leads to a variety of challenges, such as:</p>
 
 Security as an afterthought, leading to sub-optimal implementation of security and delaying the delivery of software 
 Identity as an afterthought, leading to islands of identities instead of integrated identity, and identity-related risks such as weak authentication, but also bearing the risk of inadequate customer experience on the onboarding and access journey 
 Violation of the requirements, such as in GDPR, to deliver privacy-by-design and security-by-design, as well as gaps in security-by-default, caused, e.g., by coding settings instead of relying on identity and security services 
 Lack of consistent, stable Security API layers and Identity API layers that consume standardized services from Security Fabrics and Identity Fabrics, leading to extensive effort for continuous redevelopment and re-coding of security and identity instead of just consumption of standardized services 
 Security-as-code as a misconception, meaning that developers are involved in coding security instead of utilizing APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to consume security and identity services 
 Infrastructure security is defined in code, which is error-prone, hard to manage and virtually impossible to incorporate in comprehensive Access Governance, and which requires developers to spend time on tasks that are not within their primary focus 
 Lack of segregation of duties between development, infrastructure, operations, security, and identity 
 
 &nbsp; 
 What Is SODAS 
<p>SODAS (Secure Operation &amp; Development of Agile Services) is a concept that addresses these shortcomings and can be used as a foundation to achieve the benefits of:</p>
 
 Fast, agile software development 
 Efficient, automated infrastructure setup and software/service deployment 
 Secure, efficient operations in multi-cloud, multi-hybrid environments 
 Delivering secure software on time 
 Consistently enforcing the principles of privacy-by-design, security-by-design, and security-by-default 
 
<p>A major principle within SODAS is to strengthen the skills of employees by focusing on these, instead of requiring, e.g., developers to deal with infrastructure specifics, or security experts coding security instead of just declaring policies. Segregation of skills and specialization help in evolving the workforce even in an age of a skills shortage. It also helps in having clearly-defined accountabilities and responsibilities, leading to a more efficient, but well integrated IT organization.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 1: The three pillars of the SODAS approach, spanning agile development, automated setup and management of infrastructure and operations, underpinned by consistent identity and security services.</p>
 &nbsp; 
 The 3 Pillars of SODAS 
<p>SODAS consists of three pillars and a foundation, which is Security and Identity. It extends the DevOps and DevSecOps paradigm by requiring a closer integration with Infrastructure Management, specifically by adding Security and Identity in a manner that is ubiquitous to the entire process from development to operations, but at the same time well-segregated and delivered as a service to developers. This reduces developers‘ workload and allows them to consume security and identity services, instead of continually recreating these.</p>
<p>For Development, there is little change. It must be business-driven, (following the overarching <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kuppinger/it-for-the-digital-age-introducing-basis-business-driven-agile-secure-it-as-a-service">BASIS model defined by KuppingerCole</a>), it must be agile, and it must follow modern design and architecture principles, such as building on microservices architectures.</p>
<p>For efficient DevOps and supporting complex multi-cloud, multi-hybrid environments that are the reality for most organizations today, infrastructure for running the services must be provisioned and configured. Infrastructure must also grow with the business needs, requiring elasticity and scalability, which – depending on the runtime environment – is a given or must be managed by the organization. Infrastructure is also not just compute and storage, but also network. Following the principles of BASIS, which also apply to SODAS, this is provided by policy-based automation, utilizing information gathered about both the infrastructure and the requirements of the new services that shall be deployed. This requires integration of information from development, infrastructure, and other areas into (virtual) repositories, building on a common semantic, so that policy-based automation – commonly supported by AI/ML – can be applied.</p>
 &nbsp; 
 Policy-Based Automation, Unified Across the Multi-Cloud, Multi-Hybrid Environments 
<p>Operations then also build on this approach of policy-based automation, unified across the multi-cloud, multi-hybrid environments. Clouds already differ vastly in the way they are managed. Additionally, between a public cloud and on-premises IT, the required level of management differs vastly due to the differences in provider responsibilities versus tenant responsibilities. However, a unified layer for policy-based automation enables organizations to abstract these differences and thus simplify operations.</p>
<p>This all is underpinned by the Security and Identity layer, building on modern Security Fabrics and Identity Fabrics, delivering a consistent and comprehensive set of security and identity services via consistent API layers that remain stable even when the underlying architecture changes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 2: Key technologies involved in SODAS, integrating development, operations, and security by policy-based automation.</p>
<p>This all builds on the set of technologies described in the BASIS concept. For Development and Operations, DevOps Tools, but also IT Operations Management for the operations part, are essential. IT Operations Management is another vital element for the infrastructure setup and operations. Allowing the flexible shift of workloads from one environment to the other in a complex multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT is essential, and supported by this approach. The inherent limitations found frequently in DevOps and being caused by the vast differences even in operating the major public clouds, focusing on a single defined target environment for operations are overcome by SODAS.</p>
 &nbsp; 
 The Role of Enterprise Service Management 
<p>Enterprise Service Management is another essential element, for allowing a business to express its demand, and for managing all the assets and services in a consistent and coherent manner. All these elements pay into the virtual repository that provides a unified perspective across services and the environment to execute these, making the formerly unknown and dynamic known. These repositories are accessed by policies and automation solutions primarily via APIs.</p>
<p>Last not least, cybersecurity and IAM (Identity &amp; Access Management), delivered via Identity Fabrics and Security Fabrics, are the foundation for delivering the identity and security services via a defined, comprehensive, and stable set of APIs. This all is well-integrated, last not least via the repository and the policy-based automation, backed by AI and ML.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 3: The key actions to take in delivering to the SODAS model.</p>
<p>To move from today’s DevOps towards an approach that delivers on the promise of DevSecOps and that is made to support the full range of a multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT environment, SODAS can be implemented in four stages, following the: plan – build – deliver – run approach.</p>
<p>Planning is about optimizing the organization, with a clear segregation of responsibilities, but also by defining interfaces and setting up cross-divisional processes. This is about focusing, not to be mixed up with building new silos. Silos are not connected; silos are not integrated. The concept of SODAS is about focus and about leveraging the skills and specialization of the workforce in an optimized manner, supported by integration at the organizational and technical layer, and powered by policy-based automation.</p>
 &nbsp; 
 Tooling Beyond the DevOps Tools Chain 
<p>To make this work, it requires the setup of the tooling, beyond the DevOps tools chain. It also requires modernizing the DevOps tools chain so that infrastructure and operations management are segregated via defined interfaces. This also allows for managing security and identity managed externally (and being consumed via APIs), controlling the DevOps tools chain. It requires working on the Identity Fabric and Security Fabric. It requires ESM and building the (very dynamic, always current) Asset Repository. And it requires policy-based automation. This is a journey, not a big bang. But every organization will already have several elements in place for building their SODAS model.</p>
<p>This then needs to be delivered by gathering data, by defining policies, by setting up automation, and by defining the identity and security services, the APIs, libraries, and widgets that make consumption of complex identity and security seamless to the developers.</p>
<p>Guiding principles for SODAS:</p>
 
 Business requests IT Services 
 Unified view on IT Services – one IT, across multi-hybrid, multi-cloud environments 
 Policy-based automation instead of manual administration or coding 
 Development is agile, consuming identity &amp; security APIs, delivering status/requirements back to DevOps tools as well as IT Operations Management 
 Automation of identity, security, and infrastructure setup &amp; management 
 
<p>Our recommendation is to revisit the DevOps and DevSecOps approaches in place in the organization according to SODAS to improve security and time-to-value in delivering Digital Services.</p>

 Part 2: Development Environment Tools and How to Use MetaMask to Manage&nbsp;Keys <p>Last Week, Ontology announced the official deployment of a TestNet supporting EVM and opened the EVM compatible public beta to developers around the world. At the same time, the “<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontologys-evm-testnet-officially-deployed-now-opening-evm-compatible-public-beta-to-developers-6dddc2bdd764">Ontology Security Vulnerability and Threat Intelligence Bounty Programme</a>” was officially launched in cooperation with SlowMist, a well-known code auditing agency. The top reward for reporting a vulnerability is $12,000 in&nbsp;ONG.</p><p>In order to encourage community developers to quickly and easily familiarize themselves with the Ontology EVM development environment, we specially prepared a “Handbook for Dummies”, which explains the essentials of Ontology EVM contract development.</p><p>In <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/everything-you-need-to-know-about-ontology-evm-contract-development-part-1-network-details-2095f6e141e5">Part 1</a>, we introduced the ChainID, RPC URL, browser address and other configuration information related to the Ontology EVM. Developers can configure MetaMask wallets to the Ontology network based on the above information. In this section, we introduce the tools for developing and deploying EVM contracts on Ontology, and how to use MetaMask plug-in wallets to manage Ethereum&nbsp;wallets.</p> 2. Introduction to Development Environment Tools <p>Since the EVM contract is developed in the <a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=false&amp;runs=200&amp;evmVersion=null&amp;version=soljson-v0.8.1+commit.df193b15.js">Solidity</a> language, we have detailed how to build the Remix, Truffle and Hardhat development environment, and enter a series of work such as contract development, compilation, deployment, and debugging. In addition, developers can also directly reuse the existing Ethereum contract framework to develop and deploy EVM contracts on Ontology.</p> 2.1 Remix Development Environment <p><a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=false&amp;runs=200&amp;evmVersion=null&amp;version=soljson-v0.8.1+commit.df193b15.js">Remix IDE</a> is an open source Solidity contract integrated development environment that supports users in contract development, compilation, deployment, and debugging. Please see this <a href="https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">link</a> for the official English version of Remix&nbsp;IDE.</p><p>Below we use a Hello World contract example to show how to use&nbsp;Remix.</p><p>2.1.1 Install Development Environment</p><p>To use Remix for the first time, you need to find and add the Solidity Compiler and Deploy and Run Transactions modules to the compiler in PLUGIN&nbsp;MANAGER.</p><p>Next, select the Solidity environment, create a new file and name it HelloWorld.sol. Then, copy the <a href="https://github.com/ontio/ontology/blob/master/docs/specifications/evm_refernce/contract-demo/helloworlddemo/helloworld.sol">Hello World contract code</a> that has been written to this&nbsp;file.</p><p>2.1.2 Compile&nbsp;Contract</p><p>Click the Solidity Compiler button, select the compiler version as 0.5.10, and start compiling HelloWorld.sol.</p><p>2.1.3 Deployment Contract</p><p>After compilation, the contract can be deployed to the Ontology network. The following will take the TestNet as an example. Before deploying the contract, you need to connect the MetaMask wallet to the Ontology network (refer to the technical viewpoint of the previous issue), and receive the test ONG as a handling fee on the Ontology <a href="https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Faucet&nbsp;address</a>.</p><p>Then, select “Injected Web3” in the Remix environment, and finally click “Deploy” to complete the contract deployment.</p><p>2.1.4 Call&nbsp;Contract</p><p>After the contract is deployed, the developer can call the methods in the contract. When deploying the Hello World contract in the example, the Hello string will be stored in the contract. We can call the message method of the contract to query this string, as shown&nbsp;below:</p> 2.2 Truffle Development Environment <p>Truffle is a framework used to assist in the development, testing and management of Ethereum smart contracts. For official documents, please refer to this&nbsp;<a href="https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">link</a>.</p><p>Below we use this <a href="https://github.com/ontio/ontology/tree/master/docs/specifications/evm_refernce/contract-demo/truffledemo">test code</a> as an example to introduce the use of&nbsp;Truffle.</p><p>2.2.1 Install Development Environment</p><p>To initialize the development environment, first install the configuration files required by the Truffle environment.</p>  <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js v8+ LTS and npm</a> (comes with&nbsp;Node)  <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>  <p>Then install Truffle with the following command.</p><blockquote>$ npm install -g&nbsp;truffle</blockquote><p>2.2.2 Configure Truffle-Config</p>  First create&nbsp;.secret to store the test mnemonic or private key (can be found in MetaMask)  Then modify the truffle-config file as&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ontio/ontology/tree/master/docs/specifications/evm_refernce/tutorial">follows</a>  <p>2.2.3 Deploy the contract to the Ontology&nbsp;network</p><p>Execute the following command to deploy the contract.</p><blockquote>$ truffle migrate — network&nbsp;ontology</blockquote><p>If the <a href="https://github.com/ontio/ontology/tree/master/docs/specifications/evm_refernce/tutorial">following</a> output is displayed, the deployment is successful.</p><p>Note: Try not to use Ethereum token units (such as wei, gwei, ether, etc.) when writing test&nbsp;scripts.</p> 2.3 Hardhat Development Environment <p>Hardhat is a development environment for compiling, deploying, testing and debugging Ethereum applications. Below we use this <a href="https://github.com/ontio/ontology/tree/master/docs/specifications/evm_refernce/contract-demo/hardhatdemo">test code</a> as an example to introduce the use of&nbsp;Hardhat.</p><p>2.3.1 Install Development Environment</p><p>Please refer to this <a href="https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">installation tutorial</a> for installation.</p><p>2.3.2 Configure Hardhat-Config</p>  Modify the hardhat.config.js file according to the <a href="https://github.com/ontio/ontology/tree/master/docs/specifications/evm_refernce/tutorial">following code</a>  <p>2.3.3 Deployment Contract</p><p>Execute the following command in the project root directory to deploy the contract to the Ontology&nbsp;testnet.</p><blockquote>$ npx hardhat run scripts/sample-script.js — network ontology_testnet</blockquote><p>Results of&nbsp;the</p><blockquote>$ npx hardhat run scripts/sample-script.js — network ontology_testnet</blockquote><p>Contract deployed to: 0xB105388ac7F019557132eD6eA90fB4BAaFde6E81</p> 3. Use MetaMask to Manage&nbsp;Keys <p>Ontology Network supports developers to use the MetaMask plug-in to manage Ethereum wallet private&nbsp;keys.</p><p>MetaMask is a non-custodial wallet. The user’s private key is encrypted with mnemonic words and stored in the local browser. Once the user loses the private key, the use of the wallet cannot be restored. MetaMask connects to Ethereum through Infura. For more detailed information, please click&nbsp;here.</p> 3.1 Install Web3 Environment <p>The first step is to install the Web3 environment in the&nbsp;dApp:</p><blockquote>$ npm install — save&nbsp;Web3</blockquote><p>Create a new file named web3.js and copy the <a href="https://github.com/ontio/ontology/tree/master/docs/specifications/evm_refernce/tutorial">following code</a> to the&nbsp;file:</p><p>In short, as long as the MetaMask plug-in is installed on the Chrome browser, the Ethereum global variable injected by the plug-in can be&nbsp;used.</p><p>In the second step, introduce the following code into your&nbsp;client,</p><blockquote>import getWeb3 from’/path/to/web3';</blockquote><p>Call the <a href="https://github.com/ontio/ontology/tree/master/docs/specifications/evm_refernce/tutorial">following</a> function:</p> 3.2 Setting Up An&nbsp;Account <p>We need to <a href="https://github.com/ontio/ontology/tree/master/docs/specifications/evm_refernce/tutorial">obtain</a> an account from the web3 instance created above to send transactions.</p><p>The getAccounts() function returns all accounts of the user in MetaMask. accounts[0] is the account currently selected by the&nbsp;user.</p> 3.3 Contract initialization <p>After completing the above steps, initialize your contract.</p> 3.4 Call&nbsp;Function <p>Now you can use the contract instance you just created to call any function you want. What needs special explanation is: the function call() is used to complete the pre-execution operation of the contract, <a href="https://github.com/ontio/ontology/tree/master/docs/specifications/evm_refernce/tutorial">for&nbsp;example</a>:</p><p>The function send() is used to call the contract to change the state of the contract, <a href="https://github.com/ontio/ontology/tree/master/docs/specifications/evm_refernce/tutorial">for&nbsp;example</a>:</p><p>Stay tuned for Part 3, for a demonstration of the Ontology EVM contract development process!</p><p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

				  Une nouvelle manière de voter à la fois simple – sécurisée – confidentielle et innovante  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Une entreprise peut souhaiter consulter ses collaborateurs, clients ou partenaires pour de multiples raisons, en les sollicitant lors de son assemblée générale, pour obtenir d’eux un retour sur un événement donné ou pour n’importe quel autre type de prise de décision collective.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Elle doit alors choisir un processus de vote efficace parmi le vote traditionnel ou des mécanismes de vote électronique existant.</p>
<p>Unikname propose un nouveau type de vote électronique décentralisé complètement sécurisé, 100% confidentiel et très facile d’utilisation. Grâce à la technologie de<a href="https://www.unikname.network"> la blockchain Unikname Network</a> et aux propriétés de vérifiabilité de ses service providers, Unikname Quorum permet d’atteindre un haut niveau de confiance.</p> 
			  
			   
				
				
				 
				
				
				
			 
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Introduction aux systèmes de vote  
			   
				
				
				  Le vote traditionnel  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Le vote traditionnel, sous forme de bulletin papier, est simple dans la théorie, mais compliqué et coûteux dans son organisation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pour mettre en place un tel processus, les participants doivent se déplacer, et pour qu’il y ait suffisamment de confiance dans ce scrutin, un certain nombre d’observateurs doivent surveiller le déroulement des différentes étapes. L’expérience de vote est alors fastidieuse pour les votants.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>De son côté, l’organisation doit mobiliser un nombre important de personnel afin d’assurer le bon déroulement du scrutin. Les bulletins doivent être préparés et distribués en amont et l’accès au scrutin doit être contrôlé. À la clôture du vote, l’organisation doit encore s’atteler aux étapes de dépouillement et de publication des résultats, le tout sous la surveillance d’observateurs, garants de la conformité du processus.</p>
<p>Le temps du dépouillement est proportionnel au nombre de votants et/ou au nombre de personnel participant au dépouillement. Il y a donc un délai non négligeable entre la clôture du scrutin et la publication des résultats.</p>
<p>Une telle organisation permet de garantir un haut niveau de transparence et de confidentialité mais elle est très coûteuse pour une entreprise.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Le vote électronique  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Depuis une vingtaine d’années, de nombreux algorithmes et protocoles de vote électronique ont fait leur apparition, promettant de réduire les coûts et les délais. Cependant, il existe des réticences à déployer ces solutions en raison de<a href="https://dl.gi.de/handle/20.500.12116/29131"> problèmes de confiance</a>. Depuis leur première mise en place <a href="https://www.scss.tcd.ie/publications/theses/diss/2013/TCD-SCSS-DISSERTATION-2013-045.pdf">au début des années 1990 en Belgique</a>, beaucoup de failles de sécurité ont été remontées, notamment sur le non-respect de la confidentialité des votes, ou de l’aspect invérifiable des résultats.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Si certains organismes ou même certains pays (<a href="https://www.scss.tcd.ie/publications/theses/diss/2013/TCD-SCSS-DISSERTATION-2013-045.pdf">comme l’Estonie</a>) utilisent fréquemment des systèmes de vote électronique, <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/pubs/PSNR20.pdf">ces processus ne font toujours pas consensus.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pour le cas du vote en entreprise, en plus de la problématique de la confiance et de la sécurité, les professionnels font face à un obstacle supplémentaire : la multiplicité de plateformes. Utiliser une plateforme dédiée au vote électronique oblige ses utilisateurs à prendre en main une énième application, à gérer un énième identifiant, à s’authentifier selon un processus spécifique… Finalement ce qui est gagné en temps est perdu en complexité.</p>
<p>L’idéal serait donc une solution pleinement intégrée dans le système d’informations de l’entreprise, fortement sécurisée et respectueuse de la vie privée de ses utilisateurs. Ne serait-ce pas là toutes les valeurs de la Plateforme SSI Unikname 😉 ?</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Le vote décentralisé avec Unikname Quorum  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>L’organisation d’un vote traditionnel repose sur quatre acteurs ou entités principales : le commissaire chargé de déclarer le scrutin et de constituer la liste électorale, les assesseurs responsables de l’administration du déroulement, l’urne permettant l’anonymisation des bulletins et les décompteurs organisant le dépouillement. Il y a également des observateurs invités à vérifier que chacun remplit bien son rôle.</p>
<p>Sur Unikname Network, ces différents rôles de commissaire, d’administrateur, de service d’anonymisation et de dépouilleur sont tenus par des service providers dédiés. Les Service Providers sont des petits programmes développés par la société Unikname ou ses partenaires s’exécutant sur le réseau Unikname Network. Ces programmes sont open-source, ce qui permet à n’importe qui de devenir observateur d’un vote en vérifiant que les service providers remplissent correctement leurs missions. Ils sont représentés sur le réseau par leur propre <a href="https://www.unikname.com/identifiant-decentralise-unikname/">UniknameID</a>, l’identifiant décentralisé Unikname, qui leur permet de signer des opérations, de s’authentifier ou encore d’enregistrer des transactions dans la blockchain.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				
			 
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Le commissaire, l’administrateur, le service d’anonymisation et de dépouilleur interviennent chacun leur tour dans les différentes étapes du vote pour garantir les exigences suivantes :</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 
					 = 
					 
						
						 <p>L’Exactitude – Un vote ne peut pas être modifié, supprimé, ni fabriqué artificiellement</p> 
					 
				  
			   
				
				
				 
					 = 
					 
						
						 <p>La Vérifiabilité – Les votants peuvent vérifier que leur vote est comptabilisé</p> 
					 
				  
			   
				
				
				 
					 = 
					 
						
						 <p>La Confidentialité – Personne qui ne peut pas connaître le vote d’un participant</p> 
					 
				  
			   
				
				
				 
					 = 
					 
						
						 <p>L’Exclusivité – Seuls les membres de la liste électorale peuvent voter et ils ne le peuvent qu’une seule fois</p> 
					 
				  
			   
				
				
				 
					 = 
					 
						
						 <p>La Non interférence – Aucun résultat ne peut être publié avant la fin du scrutin</p> 
					 
				  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Le déroulement du vote  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Le vote décentralisé avec Unikname Quorum s’organise en trois étapes : l’enregistrement, le processus de vote et le dépouillement. À chacune de ces étapes, des informations permettant la transparence du scrutin et la vérification des exigences ci-dessus sont écrites dans la blockchain par les Service Providers. Des SSI credits sont échangés entre les différentes parties pour permettre l’accès aux différents services de<a href="https://www.unikname.com/plateforme-unikname/"> la Plateforme SSI Unikname</a>, comme par exemple les services d’écritures.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  L’enregistrement  
			   
				
				
				 <p>L’organisateur du scrutin contacte le commissaire pour préparer avec lui la liste électorale et les conditions de vote en échange de SSI credits. L’ensemble des crédits sont envoyés au commissaire qui va se charger de les répartir parmi les Service Providers concernés. Ainsi les participants pourront interagir avec eux sans avoir à manipuler de SSI credits.</p>
<p>Les informations seront écrites anonymement dans la blockchain par le commissaire et sous le contrôle de l’organisateur. Ainsi, les règles ne pourront pas être modifiées par la suite.</p> 
			   
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				 L’organisateur prend ensuite contact avec les participants pour les inviter à participer au scrutin. 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Le processus de vote  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Pour voter, les participants vont d’abord s’authentifier auprès de l’administrateur pour que celui-ci vérifie qu’ils sont bien inscrits sur la liste électorale et qu’ils n’ont pas encore voté. Grâce à des mécanismes d’anonymisation, cette vérification peut se faire sans que les votants n’aient à partager leur UniknameID avec l’administrateur.</p> 
			   
				
				
				
			 
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Une fois les vérifications effectuées, l’administrateur signe une autorisation qui permet aux participants d’envoyer leur bulletin au service d’anonymisation. Ce dernier enregistre alors une transaction de vote, sous le contrôle du votant, pour prouver que ce dernier a bien participé au scrutin. Ensuite, le service d’anonymisation applique des algorithmes permettant de casser les liens entre un participant et son vote, puis conserve tous les bulletins jusqu’à la clôture du scrutin.</p> 
			   
				
				
				
			 
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Naturellement, le vote d’un participant est chiffré localement directement dans son appareil et les échanges entre les différentes parties se font sous un protocole de type end-to-end encryption. À partir du moment où le bulletin a quitté l’appareil du votant, aucune entité n’a la possibilité d’en connaître le contenu avant le dépouillement.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Le décompte des votes et la publication des résultats  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Lorsque le scrutin touche à sa fin, le dépouilleur reçoit l’ensemble des bulletins anonymisés. Il est le seul Service Provider capable de les déchiffrer, mais il n’est pas capable de faire de lien entre les votes et les votants.</p> 
			   
				
				
				
			 
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Il va alors construire <a href="https://forum.unikname.com/t/an-introduction-to-merkle-trees/747">un arbre de Merkle</a> dont les feuilles sont l’ensemble des votes, ce qui permet à chaque participant de vérifier que son vote est comptabilisé. Le résultat publié est incontestable. La racine de l’arbre est écrite par le dépouilleur dans la blockchain Unikname Network afin de garder une trace du résultat et pour que l’issue du vote ne puisse pas être modifiée par la suite.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Un système de vote intégré  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Comme pour les autres modules Unikname, Unikname Quorum est conçu pour s’intégrer facilement dans le système d’information d’une entreprise, via une application dédiée ou directement dans un processus déjà déployé.<br>Pour mettre en place un système de vote, organisateurs et participants n’ont besoin que de leur UniknameID, le même leur permettant aussi de <a href="https://www.unikname.com/unikname-connect/">s’authentifier</a> ou <a href="https://www.unikname.com/confidential-exchange-and-sensitive-data-sharing-a-major-issue-for-businesses/">d’échanger des données sensibles</a>.</p>
<p>Grâce à son architecture décentralisée, Unikname Quorum est une solution de vote avec une haute disponibilité, peu coûteuse et aussi facile à déployer qu’à utiliser. Les professionnels peuvent se re-concentrer sur le contenu de leurs assemblées générales ou l’organisation des événements à évaluer, l’organisation des scrutins devient une formalité.</p>

<p>Thanks to those that attended our Trust Registries Webinar and for the attendees and those folks that couldn’t make it, here are a few things for you:</p>

 <a href="https://youtu.be/b_xG2un5WaI">Link to the recording</a> 
 <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Registry+Task+Force">Trust Over IP Trust Registry Task Force</a> where we are developing the:<br>
 
 <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZGXUB0oODHO66PQkO66-fbAu6f7sVVToOz3Q8RNG0fs/edit?usp=sharing">Trust Registry Protocol Specification v1</a> (NOTE: This is the live Google Doc where we are making early edits).

 NOTE: The above links for the Specification and OpenAPI files will likely change. They will always be referenced from the Trust Registry Task Force though. 
 
 
 Be sure to reach out via our <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/contact-us/">Contact Us</a> page – we’re happy to jump on a call to see how we can help you examine where a Trust Registry may fit in your business ecosystem. We will also get you hooked up with our (semi-)monthly newsletter where we share a few key things that have been shifting in the industry. 
 <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a> – The Public Sector Profile drove a lot of the CIO Strategy Council standard <a href="https://ciostrategycouncil.com/standards/103_1_2020/">CAN/CIOSC 103-1:2020, Digital Trust and Identity – Part 1 Fundamentals</a>. The Public Sector Profile (not to be confused with the DIACC PCTF which shares the same name but has a different aim) is globally recognized.&nbsp; 
 
<p>QUESTIONS!</p>
 
 Questions started at about [46:30] &nbsp;– though some questions came earlier. We covered:
 
 “I don’t trust organizations and corporations” – where we point out the “decentralize the world” approach goes to far. 
 Phoning home – (hint: no it doesn’t need to phone home) 
 Where are Holders Authorized? (hint: <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/bubbas-wallet/">Knowing if you can trust Bubba’s Wallet</a> may be more important…) 
 Canadian Digitial Identities are emerging – can startups leverage this?&nbsp; 
 Explain the Role of Government in ecosystems.&nbsp; 
 “Can a third party discover who I trust from a trust registry?” 
 How will interoperability work between trust registries? 
 
 
 



<p>As to where we need to go, we covered that in the Trust Registries Webinar as well…&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/kuppinger">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>A paradigm for unified delivery of IT services to the business demand, based on automated, policy-based management, and supported by the unification of heterogeneous multi-cloud multi-hybrid IT environments following a services-based approach.</p>
<p>Businesses need to reinvent themselves continually in the Digital Age. Every business is a Digital Business today, that needs <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kuppinger/cio-advice-how-to-make-your-digital-business-fly">to deliver and improve Digital Services that differentiate it</a> from the competition. This requires an IT that is built to deliver to the business demand in an agile, yet secure and well-controlled manner.</p>
<p>This will work only when reducing the inherent complexity of today’s multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT, which is here to stay. Part of reducing that complexity is the gradual shift to the cloud, following “cloud-first” strategies. But the recent advent of Edge Computing has demonstrated that parts of IT never will run in the cloud. Beyond that, there is not a single cloud, but many clouds, resulting in a multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT.</p>
<p></p>
 Reduce Complexity by Unification and Automation 
<p>The complexity must be reduced by unification, wherever feasible, and by shifting to automated, policy-based management of IT across the “runtime” environments. The starting point is to focus on agile development, delivery, operations, and security of Digital Services, with a clear service focus. Services and the underlying resources are known, as are the users. Focusing on access of everyone (the users) and everything to these services and resources, is best achieved by treating everything as a service, and procuring, delivering, managing, and securing services in a consistent manner across all environments.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 1: The four main stages of the BASIS approach to plan, build, deliver and run Digital Services in an agile yet secure manner.</p>
<p>BASIS is a concept for delivering IT to meet the demand of the business in an agile, secure way, and with a unified perspective across all IT, be it on-premises, on the edge, or in some cloud. Services are treated in a unified manager, with policy-based automation being applied uniformly across the various environments, and across services.</p>
 &nbsp; 
 Plan, Build, Deliver, and Run – The Essence of BASIS 
<p>The starting point for BASIS is a plan – build – deliver –&nbsp; run approach. It starts with the business demand and a &nbsp;re-defined IT strategy focused on efficient and agile delivery of IT services to business demands on time, and the IT organization that supports this. For the IT organization, the most important change is that there is no distinction between cloud and on-premises, as it is found in many organizations today, and that the focus is on development, delivery, operations of services, and security.</p>
<p>Build covers both the procurement and development of services, to which deployment model suits best. Cloud first strategies are a recommendation, but the reality is that, e.g., in hospitals or manufacturing, many services will continue to run on-premises. Additionally, software development takes a central role, with software being essential for differentiation of businesses in the Digital Age.</p>
 &nbsp; 
 Application Delivery Necessitates Identity Management and Security Measures 
<p>These services need to be delivered, requiring the right setup of the infrastructure, e.g., Kubernetes instances in a public cloud or virtual machines in a private cloud environment, requiring delivery of the applications and services themselves, and the setup of adequate Identity Management and Security for all resources that come with these services and that are consumed by these services.</p>
<p>Once deployed, efficient execution of these services is required, from the cloud or the hybrid IT, thus still potentially involving Data Center operations, as Hybrid Cloud Operations from the edge to the public cloud. It requires Application Management and, last but not least, the IAM (Identity &amp; Access Management) and Cybersecurity to operate these Digital Services securely.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 2: Key technologies involved in BASIS, integrating development, operations, and security by policy-based automation.</p>
 &nbsp; 
 Building a BASIS Approach 
<p>It is apparent that not all parts of a multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT environment are alike. Not everything in a multi-cloud, multi-hybrid environment can or should be managed in the same manner, starting with different provider and tenant responsibilities. However, what always is under tenant control, can be treated in a uniform manner, especially when internal IT or MSPs also deliver according to the service paradigm known from the cloud, with clearly defined tenant and provider responsibilities.</p>
<p>The essential building blocks for the BASIS approach on agile, secure IT and Digital Service delivery are:</p>
 
 Enterprise Service Management for business service requests, managing services across the entire IT, and providing insight into the assets that must be managed and secured. 
 DevOps for delivering services following agile software development paradigms, including automated testing and delivery into the operations environment of choice. 
 These environments must be managed, across the entire multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT environment. The depth and breadth of management required differs. In a public cloud, less management is required, but even there, several services must be managed and monitored. 
 Policy Management &amp; Enforcement is a central component, as the foundation for automating the management of service delivery. 
 Identity &amp; Access Management as well as Cybersecurity are essential for delivering services securely and managing everyone and everything that has access to services and the underlying resources. 
 
<p>All this must be well-integrated, being backed by access to information about the current state of IT across the multi-cloud, multi-hybrid environment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 3: The key actions to take in delivering to the BASIS model.</p>
 &nbsp; 
 Guiding Principles for BASIS 
<p>IT leaders must take various actions in each area to implement the BASIS approach for the agile delivery of IT services in a secure manner:</p>
 
 Plan: The main focus is to shift IT consequently to a business service delivery organization, driven by business demand. This requires alignment of development, operations across the multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT environment, Identity &amp; Access Management for the Digital Identities of everything and everyone, and Cybersecurity. Responsibilities as well as interfaces between the various areas must be well-defined. 
 Build: These interfaces include, at a technical level, Identity &amp; Security API layers that allow developers to easily and efficiently consume identity and security services for the Digital Services they are creating. It also requires interfaces to all current IT states, across the entire multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT, as well as to service requests and the state of IT services. Only when the applications, services, identities, and other elements are known and their state is accessible, a unified management can be applied. 
 Deliver: Delivery starts with policies that form the foundation for automation. Policies are rather easy to describe. However, with a growing number of policies, support by technology, including AI/ML, will be required for proposing, analyzing and optimizing policies. Policies are best described at generic levels and then – by technology – translated into the concrete policies and measures for the various parts of the IT environment. 
 Run: This starts with the enforcement of a consistent service request &amp; delivery process and implementing and enforcing the policy-based automation approach. Last but not least, the identity and security models must be implemented and enforced, for consistent control of all the resources in today’s complex, heterogeneous IT environments. 
 
<p>Guiding principles for BASIS:</p>
 
 Business requests IT Services, business demanding new or modified IT services, or initiates change 
 Unified view on IT Services services as foundation – one IT, across the entire multi-hybrid, multi-cloud environments 
 Policy-based automation instead of manual administration or coding 
 Development is agile, consuming identity &amp; security services via APIs, returning status/requirements as feedback, and as input to operations 
 Automation of identity, security and infrastructure setup &amp; management 
 
<p>Our recommendation is to revisit the IT organization according to BASIS, for delivering Digital Services successfully and at the speed of the business.</p>

<p>Organisations perceive their users through data. In the world of fewer and fewer opportunities for physical contact, identity verification is going all remote. All online service providers need to model the risks related to user impersonation and user manipulation attacks.<br>In this talk, we will dig through the classical methods of Knowing Your User through the static data:<br>Authentication<br>Coupling the session with the device<br>Checking the network environment<br>Next, I will present manipulation methods related to data spoofing to express the business impact. Usual scenarios are primarily associated with rewards in the form of money for the attackers.<br>Time-series data analysis and the impact on the business and customer experience will be presented to show the way forward in the adaptive risk management context.<br>Finally, food for thought related to the standardisation of behavioural biometrics that is getting more and more attention as one of the defence methods will be shared to show that we need Zero Trust and a way to verify if and how the vendor products are working.</p>




<p>Static data can be easily spoofed. Dynamic data analysis (mainly in a time series manner) is the way to go.<br>Data resilience related to side-channel time series data analysis.<br>Zero Trust is also about not trusting your data sources and all the environment related to it.<br>Behavioural biometrics strives for standardisation.</p>

  <p>Many companies from diverse industries increasingly rely on AI for strengthening their efficiency by automating jobs. Many of these advanced automation tools, however, currently become standard applications. Consequently, an isolated use of these tools will not enable companies to gain a competitive advantage. This presentation builds on an intelligence-based view of firm performance and the ‘Integrated Intelligence’ approach, which highlights the need to integrate AI with specific human expertise to outperform competitors and to transform a firm’s intelligence architecture. It further discusses the leadership implications for general managers and offers a systematic framework for generating growth and innovation beyond automation and efficiency. The ‘I3 – Integrated Intelligence Incubator’ provides executives with a toolset for developing appropriate strategic initiatives for intelligence-based future competition.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2021-lichtenthaler-human-and-artificial-intelligence"></a>

<p>As more and more organizations go multi-cloud, the question arises how to integrate existing and compliance-proven enterprise IAM processes with the upcoming requirements of managing identity in the clouds.<br>In this talk we will present two different approaches on how an organization can manage multi-cloud identities and access. The models are based on real life examples we have found to work out for organizations we work with. What we learn with these examples is that there is a wide spectrum between agility and control. Each organization has to find their own balance in this playing field and design a solution that is valuable to them and their team.</p>

<p>In this session, we run through the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures used in recent breaches and highlight the commonality across them; identity compromise and privilege elevation. This analysis will highlight the importance of taking an assume breach mindset to defense and that Identity becomes central to this strategy. Further, we will then position recommendations on how to protect against Credential Theft, Lateral Movement, and Privileged Escalation across hybrid and cloud environments</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2021-moss-zero-trust-identity-centric-security"></a>

  <p>Research from 2020 has shown a phonemonal growth in the access management market.</p>
<p>The pandemic, for all its impact, has enabled organisations to re-evaluate their working strategies and practices. But at what cost? Cybercrime on corporate applications has risen exponentially from the dispersed workforce and rapid cloud adoption has left organisations vulnerable to ransomware, malicious activity and internal subterfuge.</p>
<p>Danna Bethlehem, Director Product Marketing Authentication at Thales discusses how organisations can accelerate their business with the right approach to their IAM strategy. For 2021 and beyond, enterprises need to leave survival mode behind and adopt a drive to thrive.</p>
<p>Drawing on recently released research into the EMEA IAM market, she will highlight:</p>
 
 How demands of the corporate workforce for dispersed working is bringing IAM security concerns to the fore 
 How the next generational approach to IAM can enable forward thinking organisations to thrive 
 How enterprises can build an effective IAM strategy to drive their growth

<p>I considered myself quite an experienced programmer and having some expertise in Identity management when I was hired by Swedbank to work as full time Identity engineer. Besides projects, I had assignment to describe an architecture of the IAM as a service from my manager. Honestly, I had no clue about how to envision it. I tried to assemble standards and squeeze something out from practices and papers. But these were not really all my ideas and I did not feel much confident. But something started to happen in few last years when we had a very hard time implementing our IAM project (believe or not, it was successful). We had to answer hundred times to questions "why", "what" and "how". And finally the blueprint of the architecture of IAM as a service appeared from the mist. It is not one and only, because same size does not fit for all. Still, I do not agree that there are indefinite number of possible solutions. I think similar enterprises and engineers may find this presentation useful to draw their own blueprints.</p>




<p>IAM projects start usually from implementing baseline IAM processes - joiners, leavers, movers. Because this is what is usually most needed. But then you will get asked for more - identity data, events, other services. This is what makes up IAM as a service.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bankid.no/bedrift/">BankID</a> is upgrading its app security through a new partnership with <a href="https://www.onespan.com/">OneSpan</a>. The latter will be supplying BankID with its Mobile Security Suite, which monitors financial transactions to help spot potentially fraudulent activity.</p>



  



<p>The <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/norway-aims-for-mobile-first-digital-id/">BankID mobile app is a digital ID</a> that is widely used throughout Norway. The platform has the backing of the Norwegian government and all of the country’s major banks, which means that the digital ID can be used as proof of identity when gaining access to government services, and to authorize financial transactions in a range of different settings. It can also be used to access financial apps, and to generate legally binding e-signatures on official documents.</p>



<p>OneSpan’s Security Suite will analyze those transactions to make sure that the business being conducted is legitimate. The Suite comes with OneSpan’s Application Shielding tech, and will be supplemented with the company’s Cloud Authentication solution, which offers additional support for face and fingerprint biometrics. BankID is hoping that the features will enable a better user experience as it looks to expand into other regions.</p>



<p>“Innovation, flexibility and user convenience are part of Norway’s DNA as one of the most digitized countries in the world,” said BankID Business Development Manager Jan Bjerved. “OneSpan’s strong expertise in the financial sector and its extensive mobile security capabilities have been important in this large modernization project.”</p>



<p>“We support their vision and execution of a secure digital identity,” added OneSpan Interim President and CEO Steven Worth. “OneSpan’s digital identity and anti-fraud solutions enable financial services providers to deliver secure and trusted experiences while minimizing friction, mitigating fraud, and reducing operational costs.”</p>



<p>The news comes shortly after Entersekt announced that it would be <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/entersekt-offers-support-norways-bankid-digital-ids-090201/">offering support for the BankID platform</a> to allow people to use their IDs to verify their identities in web browsers and mobile apps. OneSpan, meanwhile, has previously delivered its Mobile Security Suite to multiple financial institutions. <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/onespan-provides-biometric-authentication-belfius-bank-052808/">Belfius Bank</a>, <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/onespan-provides-mobile-security-suite-sony-bank-040205/">Sony Bank</a>, and <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/onespan-teams-avaloq-make-banking-more-secure-071902/">Avaloq</a> are some of the customers that the company has signed in the past few years.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bio-key.com/">BIO-key</a> is continuing to build up its Channel Alliance Partner (CAP) program. The company <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-launches-distribution-partner-program-609242/">launched the program</a> back in 2019 to create a distribution network for its various biometric products, and then <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-highlights-portalguard-with-expanded-channel-alliance-partner-program-021804/">expanded it earlier this year</a> to highlight its Identity and Access Management (IAM) portfolio, and its <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-announces-official-launch-portalguard-idaas-113008/">PortalGuard Identity-as-a-Service platform</a> in particular.</p>



  



<p>Now BIO-key has added <a href="https://intelisys.com/">Intelisys</a> to its roster of Channel Partners. Intelisys is a ScanSource subsidiary that provides its own customers with a range of different technology services and solutions. The new arrangement will make PortalGuard one of the solutions that Intelisys offers to those clients, and help BIO-key find new customers for its identity offerings.</p>



<p>PortalGuard itself was designed to be a comprehensive identity and access management solution that streamlines the login experience for end users. The platform has <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-extends-portalguard-coverage-with-new-sso-concierge-062306/">Single Sign-on capabilities</a> and supports a number of authentication options, <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-upgrades-portalguard-with-new-palm-authentication-feature-051003/">including</a><a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-upgrades-portalguard-with-new-palm-authentication-feature-051003/"> </a><a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-upgrades-portalguard-with-new-palm-authentication-feature-051003/">biometrics</a>.</p>



<p>Together, Intelisys and BIO-key will spearhead a new Master Agent Referral Partner Program. BIO-key is hoping that the referral program will boost revenues and generate new business opportunities all over the world.</p>



<p>“This is a great milestone for BIO-key as we continue to grow our channel program and ensure that we have geographic coverage in the top markets,” said BIO-key CRO Fred Corsentino. “We look forward to working together with Intelisys to help solve security and identity and access management challenges for the enterprise as we look to a safer future.”</p>



<p>BIO-key has provided PortalGuard security for dozens of organizations in the past two years. The solution has been especially popular in the public sector, with several <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-deploys-portalguard-rio-hondo-college-060309/">academic institutions</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/doj-agency-opts-for-portalguard-iam-security-701063/">government agencies</a> signing on to use the service. The <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/orange-county-elections-office-supplements-bio-key-fingerprint-scanners-with-portalguard-iam-solution-082706/">Orange County Elections Office</a> in Florida is one of BIO-key’s most recent PortalGuard customers, and the company also showcased PortalGuard at the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-brings-portalguard-national-association-counties-conference-070808/">National Association of Counties Conference</a>.</p>

<p>As the name would suggest, the Sigma Synthetic Fraud solution analyzes financial transactions to watch for signs of synthetic fraud. The solution performs particularly well for high-risk users, and is able to spot roughly 90 percent of the synthetic fraud attempts amongst the three percent of users who are most likely to be engaged in such activity. It is also able to sort good from bad actors more generally, and is 97.5 percent accurate when sorting fraudsters from legitimate customers.</p>



<p>The goal, of course, is to help financial institutions mitigate the losses that result from synthetic fraud. In that regard, Sigma Synthetic Fraud can be supplemented with Socure’s DocV document verification to provide enterprises with greater assurances about their user base.</p>



<p>The Aite-Novarica Group’s Impact Innovation Awards are in their inaugural year, and were set up to highlight solutions that can effectively guard against rising levels of cybercrime. The winners were chosen by a group of international and Aite-Novarica Group experts, and will be honored during an awards presentation during&nbsp;the <a href="https://www.fincrimeforum.com/2021">Aite-Novarica Group’s Financial Crime Forum</a> virtual event, which is scheduled for September 14 and 15.</p>



<p>“With digital acceleration at hyper-speed, financial organizations are confronted with balancing the increasing demands for elevating customer experiences and uplifting operational efficiency against the expanding needs for building better fraud and AML control frameworks,” said Aite-Novarica Group Practice Leader&nbsp;Chuck Subrt. “Innovation holds the key to unlocking smarter, more efficient, and more impactful financial crime detection and prevention.”</p>



<p>“We are honored that Aite-Novarica Group has recognized our accomplishment and market-leading performance in such a prestigious way,” added&nbsp;Socure Founder and CEO Johnny Ayers.</p>



<p>Socure was recently <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/capital-one-investment-brings-socure-valuation-76202102/">valued at $1.3 billion</a> after receiving a substantial investment from Capital One. The company has <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/selfie-onboarding-boom-delivers-record-growth-socure-081003/">experienced surging demand</a> for its <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/socure-to-provide-biometric-onboarding-tech-for-draftkings-704091/">identity verification technology</a> during the COVID-19 pandemic, and is currently looking to build on that growth after <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/socure-names-new-vp-of-commercialization-708191/">hiring a new VP of Commercialization</a> in August.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/kuppinger">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Doing IT right is the premise for delivering time-to-value in the Digital Journey. Success requires an agile IT for delivering secure Digital Services on time.</p>
<p>Virtually all organizations have become digital at least to a certain extent in the past three decades since the World Wide Web (already an old-fashioned term) took off. But we are still on that journey. There is a good reason not to name this Digital Transformation, but Digital Journey. It is not about transforming from the analog to the digital state, but an ongoing journey.</p>
<p>This journey is driven by ever-changing business models, rapid innovation of products and services, as well as a shift from product business to service business, and last but not least, new entrants in the competition. Business must compete harder than ever before to be successful.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 1: Digital Services: Software as a differentiator. Success in the Digital Age builds on competitive differentiation through Digital Services &amp; Digital Experience.</p>
 &nbsp; 
 Making Digital Services a Differentiator 
<p>Differentiation in the Digital Business is based on Digital Services. The phrase “every business is a software business” never has been truer than today. Software is ubiquitous. It forms the backend of digital services, it forms the frontend via apps, it is in connected things, and it is in microchips of connected vehicles. Software is everywhere. The intellectual property of businesses is melded into software. The USP (Unique Selling Proposition) of companies results from delivering better digital services. This is what differentiates them in today's competitive environment.</p>
<p>However, Digital Services are not only about translating business into Digital Services, and thus software development. It is also about delivery, operating, and last but not least, securing these services. The link between security, Digital Services, and Digital Experience (DX) is Digital Identity. Only if delivery, operations, and security are built for agility and rapid, reliant, and resilient delivery of services, and only if the Digital Identity approach is built for the needs of today’s hyperconnected business, will organizations be able to deliver the Digital Experience that differentiates them from their competitors and makes them successful.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 2: Even greenfield IT consists of many components that must be delivered, managed, and secured. And even greenfield IT will become brownfield IT that has to cope with legacy.</p>
 &nbsp; 
 Conceal Heterogeneity through Standardization and Unification 
<p>While some startups can build on a greenfield IT, reality is that even this quickly becomes a mix of new and established (or “legacy”) elements, and is based on multiple clouds. For most organizations, though, it is about a complex mix of IT, both in the backend and with respect to all the devices that are used to access services. However, the latter are out of control of the business because Digital Experience is about supporting what the customers and consumers are using to access the Digital Services.</p>
<p>And, regardless of greenfield or brownfield approaches on IT: Digital Services consist of many elements, from backend applications, storage and data to the services themselves, the apps used, the software that is baked into microchips, and so on.</p>
<p>The reality of the IT of the vast majority of organizations is multi-cloud, multi-hybrid, with many different deployment models. Some can just build on multi-cloud, but even new organizations end up with more complexity when it comes to manufacturing, where on-premises IT and Edge Computing are needed. Thus, organizations must prepare their IT to deliver to the business on demand and on time, while accepting the heterogeneity of today’s IT. Heterogeneity will not easily disappear. Thus, it is about making it work better, by reducing complexity and by concealing heterogeneity through standardization and unification.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 3: IT must serve to the needs of agility and security while keeping cost under control and delivering to the control &amp; compliance needs of organizations.</p>
 &nbsp; 
 Keeping an Eye on the Costs 
<p>Agility in delivering to business demand is just one element of what a good, modern IT must deliver. As always, cost must be kept under control. Succeeding in the Digital Business will always require delivering the Digital Services at a reasonable and competitive cost. Control &amp; compliance requirements are more important than ever before, with ever-increasing regulatory pressure. Last, but not least, security and resilience are essential to the success.</p>
<p>Digital Businesses are at risk of cyber-attacks as well as failure in delivery. Failing in cybersecurity can destroy a Digital Business. When everything is based on Digital Services, when every business is a software business, then cybersecurity is more important than ever before.</p>
<p>The challenge is delivering on the various needs in an efficient, reliable manner across development, delivery, operations, security, and identity. This will not work with point solutions, because everything is integrated in the digital business. It will also not work when relying on manual administration in many of the areas. Manual work is expensive and error-prone. Using approaches like "everything as code" won't work. There are too few people who can code, and coding is both expensive and error-prone, as we all experience regularly in bugs, updates, and patches.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 4: Policy-based automation is the foundation for successfully running the complex IT environments of today and serving the demand of the Digital Business.</p>
 &nbsp; 
 Automation Is Key 
<p>The solution lies in automation based on policies, supported by intelligent solutions utilizing what AI (Artificial Intelligence), ML (Machine Learning), and other techniques can deliver. This requires collecting information about everything in IT, from services, backend applications, devices, and apps to all the various types of users to the underlying infrastructure, regardless of where this is located across the multi-cloud multi-hybrid IT universe of the organization.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 5: Management of IT must focus on what can be well-managed. Identities and services are where organizations can get a grip on. In the end, it is about someone or something accessing services. This is where IT unification starts.</p>
<p>When looking at automation, it requires infrastructure automation. It requires efficient development with automated testing and delivery into production. However, from a management perspective, the potential for unification and standardization across a heterogeneous, complex IT environment, is in focusing on the areas that organizations have under control: Identities and services or, in broader terminology, the resources that support and form the Digital Service.</p>
<p>Access happens from humans, devices, things, or services to other services. Identities can be managed and must be managed. Applications, their data, and the services and infrastructure delivering this are under control. It is way harder to get a grip on all the devices – just think about BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) approaches or all the different devices used by customers and consumers. Even harder, is control of the network in a hyper-connected world where Work from Home (WfH) is the new normal. Thus, Identity and Access Management (IAM) as well as a consistent, automated, efficient management of the IT services, is where the focus of modern IT must be.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 6: Digital Business: Technology impact on agility. Digital Identity, Cybersecurity and Agile Development &amp; Operations as key enablers.</p>
 &nbsp; 
 Managing Digital Identities Is Essential to Gain a Competitive Edge 
<p>The technology impact becomes visible when mapping the impact of technologies to support organizations in changing to the needs in their Digital Journey. Managing Digital Identities of everyone, specifically the consumers and customers, but also the relationships to devices and connected things, for example, is essential to win in the dynamic competition of the Digital Age.</p>
<p>The technologies with the highest relevance are: Digital Identity Management, Cybersecurity – to secure the Digital Business – and Agile Development &amp; Operations for developing and delivering the Digital Services.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 7: Eight fundamentals for successfully developing, delivering and securing the Digital Services that make Digital Business succeed.</p>
 &nbsp; 
 Eight Fundamentals of Digital Business Success 
<p>Success in the Digital Business is based on eight fundamentals:</p>
 
 Business demand drives IT, which exists &nbsp;to support the business – and IT has never been as important as it is today, where every business is some sort of a software business. 
 Multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT is the new normal. “Cloud first” is a meaningful paradigm, but Edge Computing demonstrates that not everything will run in the cloud, not to speak of a single cloud. 
 Built on policy-based automation. Policy-based automation is the key to managing complex, heterogeneous environments. Doing this right, requires the use of AI &amp; ML to help in creating and optimizing policies. 
 Gather the status of everything. Policy-based automation also requires data about everything. The identities, the infrastructure, the code and structure of applications, APIs, and so on. This must be gathered into repositories that then can be utilized by policies. 
 Identities &amp; resources in core focus. Someone or something (with an identity) is accessing services and the resources in the background. Which device is used, which network is used: This is hard to control. But identities and resources are known and can be well-managed. 
 Unified view of resources – everything as a service. This leads to a perspective where, ideally, everything is treated as a service, regardless of whether deployed from the cloud or on-premises. Identities are accessing resources – this is where unification can start. 
 Agile development, integrated delivery &amp; operations. Rapid delivery of Digital Services to the business demand requires agile development that integrates with delivery and operations (and, last but not least, security). Again: This will work across all layers only when being based on policy-based automation. 
 Automate security across everything: Identities &amp; resources. The automation of security must start where organizations have control. They have that control over identities and resources. Control is way harder to win over devices and networks. Thus: Focus on identities and resources for a unified, efficient management of IT. 
 
<p>It is time to revisit the way we do IT, and to improve it.</p>

			 How Fractionalization of NFTs Enables Co-Ownership<br>
 
<p>For months, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are making headlines in the blockchain space. NFTs are supposed to be unique and they usually represent an asset. Most of the time, the asset is digital and embedded in the token, but problems have come to the fore. Firstly, there is no proof that assets have not been duplicated before their tokenization, or that other NFTs will not represent the same asset. Secondly, how can users verify that the NFT creator is the asset owner?</p>
 <p>CREDIT: Elliptic</p> 
<p>Last month a collector bought a fake Banksy NFT for £244,000. The image, which features a figure smoking in front of industrial chimneys, supposedly commenting on climate change, was a hoax from a scammer. It is one example among many others.</p>
<p>With NFTs, the source and owner of the asset is simply not trackable. On platforms such as OpenSea (now valued at $1.5 billion), the authenticity is reliant on the seller saying they are who they say they are. Sounds a bit light in terms of customer protection from my personal opinion. Considering this, it is easy for me to see the use of NFTs for collectibles, but it is harder to see the benefits for real world asset tokenization.</p>
<p>Some NFTs are now becoming very valuable and start to struggle to find liquidity. Therefore, there is a new trend to fractionalize NFTs to enable co-ownership and make them more accessible. In some ways, fractionalizing NFTs is coming back to a use case of standard tokens, except the need to guarantee the ownership of the underlying asset. Moreover, in the traditional world, co-ownership is usually made possible with financial securities to protect owners and apply laws (taxes, inheritance, etc.). How could this be done on the blockchain?</p>
<p>NFTs are unique and indivisible by nature, so how can we fractionalize these assets? We can “wrap” up a NFT into a permissioned token with the&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-91xf0c2m94QWIot1fhg6czY2yr2DX6p-RCh_U_qXBMbGo9ZyZfi-ipIkriPBvVwOEHGMc3">T-REX protocol (ERC3643)</a>: a unique token smart contract is deployed (representing the asset) by a verified issuer (the asset owner or its custodian). The shares of the asset would be represented by the tokens generated via the smart contract. The asset is now divisible as much as decided by the issuer. The cap table of owners is transparent, automatically updated, and the ownership of these shares is guaranteed by digital identities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the same way, and as long as the custodian of the asset can be trusted, it is possible to “wrap” crypto, stablecoins, fiat, real world assets and securities in permissioned tokens. It guarantees the ownership of the underlying asset, and&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/digital-identity-the-key-for-security-token-custody/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-91xf0c2m94QWIot1fhg6czY2yr2DX6p-RCh_U_qXBMbGo9ZyZfi-ipIkriPBvVwOEHGMc3">makes the tokens recoverable in case of loss of wallets</a>.</p>

   Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a form of identity where users have complete control over their data and how it is shared with others. Verifiable Credentials (VCs), on the other hand, are a W3C standard for implementing SSI.  There are three parties involved in a VC — issuer, holder, and verifier, and together they form what’s called the trust triangle.  The entire process begins when the issuer

<p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity</a> (SSI) is a form of identity where users have complete control over their data and how it is shared with others. <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs), on the other hand, are a W3C standard for implementing SSI.</p><p>There are three parties involved in a VC — issuer, holder, and verifier, and together they form what’s called the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-is-the-trust-triangle-9a9caf36b321">trust triangle</a>.</p><p>The entire process begins when the issuer creates a VC that contains one or more details of a holder. As a part of this process, an issuer also can revoke a VC, as circumstances of the holder may&nbsp;change.</p><p>For example, a holder may no longer be a student of a university/college, hence his/her student VC must be revoked. The same applies when a holder is no longer an employee or when a government ID such as a driver’s license, visa, or passport has&nbsp;expired.</p><p>Now that you know why VCs need to be revoked, let’s drill down to the implementation.</p> Status of a&nbsp;VC <p>The status of a VC is checked by the verifier to ensure that it is still valid. From an implementation standpoint, W3C’s specification has a property called the credentialStatus property that contains information about the current status of a&nbsp;VC.</p><p>The credentialStatus property of a VC must&nbsp;include,</p>  id — a&nbsp;URL  type — describes the status of a credential. The value of this property is used to determine the current status of a&nbsp;VC  <p>The actual implementation varies greatly and could even include a link to an external document that contains the credential’s validity.</p><p>Here’s an <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-csl2017/">implementation example</a></p> {    "id": "http://dmv.example.gov/credentials/3732",    "type": ["Credential", "ProofOfAgeCredential"],    "issuer": "https://dmv.example.gov/issuers/14",    "issued": "2010-01-01T19:73:24Z",    "claim": {      "id": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21",      "ageOver": 21    },    "credentialStatus": {      "id": "https://dmv.example.gov/status/24,      "type": "CredentialStatusList2017"    },    "proof": { ... }  } <p>The above example is a list-based credential revocation, which means, the status of many VCs is contained in a single&nbsp;list.</p><p>Here’s how this list&nbsp;looks.</p> {    "id": "https://dmv.example.gov/status/24,    "description": "Status of sample DMV credentials."    "verifiableCredential": [{       "claim": {          "id": "http://dmv.example.gov/credentials/3732",          "currentStatus": "Revoked",          "statusReason": "Disciplinary action"      },      "issuer": "http://dmv.example.gov/",      "issued": "2017-12-05T14:27:42Z",      "proof": { ... }     }, {    "claim": {      "id": "http://dmv.example.gov/credentials/2363",      "currentStatus": "Suspended",      "statusReason": "Investigation"    },    "issuer": "http://dmv.example.gov/",    "issued": "2017-12-04T14:27:42Z",    "proof": { ... }    },  // ... more status info here ...  }],    "proof": { ... }  } <p>Finally, you have to provide the protocol, which is HTTP&nbsp;GET.</p> GET /status/24 HTTP/1.1  Host: dmv.example.gov  Content-Type: application/ld+json  Content-Length: 1062  Accept: application/ld+json, application/json, text/plain, */* <p>Thus, this is an example of how you can implement VC Revocation.</p><p>Moving on, let’s see Affinidi’s implementation of the&nbsp;same.</p> Affinidi’s VC Revocation APIs <p>Affinidi has implemented a list-based credential revocation, and its general flow is depicted in the below&nbsp;diagram.</p><p>The specific APIs that handle VC Revocation in Affinidi’s stack&nbsp;are:</p>  CreateDidAuthRequest  Revocation list 2020 Credential (issuerDid)  BuildRevocationList2020  RevokeCredential  PublicRevocationListCredential  <p>Let’s take a look at the functionality of each of these APIs including their sample requests and responses.</p> CreateDidAuthRequest <p>In the <a href="https://revocation-api.prod.affinity-project.org/api/v1/did-auth/create-did-auth-request">CreateDidAuthRequest</a> API, the client sends a request to the server that it wants to get authenticated. The server creates a request and the client creates a response for that request using auth. This uses HTTP&nbsp;POST.</p><p>Here’s a sample of the&nbsp;request.</p> {    “audienceDid”: “string”  } <p>And the response is the “string”&nbsp;itself.</p> RevocationList2020Credential (issuerDid) <p>This API is required to check if the VC was revoked. This uses the HTTP GET protocol.</p><p>The response to this HTTP request looks like&nbsp;this.</p> {    “id”: “string”,    “@context”: [      “string”    ],    “type”: [      “string”    ],    “issuer”: “string”,    “issuanceDate”: “string”,    “credentialSubject”: {      “id”: “string”,      “type”: “string”,      “encodedList”: “string”    },    “proof”: {      “type”: “string”,      “created”: “2019–08–24T14:15:22Z”,      “proofPurpose”: “string”,      “verificationMethod”: “string”,      “jws”: “string”,      “nonce”: “string”,      “signatureValue”: “string”,      “creator”: “string”    }  }  BuildRevocationList2020 <p>As the name suggests, this API builds the revocation list and uses the HTTP POST protocol.</p><p>The request must include the credentialID and the subjectDID.</p> {    “credentialId”: “string”,    “subjectDid”: “string”  } <p>The response will be like&nbsp;this.</p> {    “credentialStatus”: {      “id”: “string”,      “type”: “string”,      “revocationListIndex”: “string”,      “revocationListCredential”: “string”    },    “revocationListCredential”: {}  }  RevokeCredential <p>This API sets the revoke status based on the id and updates the reason for revocation as well. It also uses the HTTP POST protocol.</p><p>The request will contain two parameters, as&nbsp;follows.</p> {    “id”: “string”,    “revocationReason”: “string”  } <p>The response will&nbsp;be,</p> {    “revocationListCredential”: “string”  }  PublicRevocationListCredential <p>This API is required to be a separate endpoint at the flow, to have this service generic and revocation service to not know the issuer’s private key (so issuer signing revocationListVC on his side, and then using this endpoint to publish&nbsp;it.</p><p>Thus moving forward Verifiers will be able to use it to verify/check the status of revocable VCs related to this revocationList VC).</p><p>Here’s a sample of the&nbsp;request.</p> {    “id”: “string”,    “@context”: [      “string”    ],    “type”: [      “string”    ],    “issuer”: “string”,    “issuanceDate”: “string”,    “credentialSubject”: {      “id”: “string”,      “type”: “string”,      “encodedList”: “string”    },    “proof”: {      “type”: “string”,      “created”: “2019–08–24T14:15:22Z”,      “proofPurpose”: “string”,      “verificationMethod”: “string”,      “jws”: “string”,      “nonce”: “string”,      “signatureValue”: “string”,      “creator”: “string”    }  } <p>And the response will be like&nbsp;this.</p> {    “id”: “string”,    “@context”: [      “string”    ],    “type”: [      “string”    ],    “issuer”: “string”,    “issuanceDate”: “string”,    “credentialSubject”: {      “id”: “string”,      “type”: “string”,      “encodedList”: “string”    },    “proof”: {      “type”: “string”,      “created”: “2019–08–24T14:15:22Z”,      “proofPurpose”: “string”,      “verificationMethod”: “string”,      “jws”: “string”,      “nonce”: “string”,      “signatureValue”: “string”,      “creator”: “string”    }  } <p>Thus, this is how you can revoke VCs using Affinidi’s stack. As you can discern, these APIs handle the bulk of the functionality and all that you have to do is use them in your application.</p><p>If you have any further questions on using these APIs, reach out to us on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ffV5ctBMXr">Discord</a> or <a href="mailto:developers@affinidi.com">email&nbsp;us</a>.</p><p>Also, read through our <a href="http://academy.affinidi.com">blog posts</a>, join our <a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1FhRGo3c4T-erYRGOSRyzCQ8oa2v">mailing list</a>, and follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/affinidi/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/affinidi.devs">Facebook</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/affinidi">Twitter</a></p><p>The information materials contained in this article are for general information and educational purposes only.

<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2021">EIC2021</a> – the headline <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/">KuppingerCole </a>event kicks off Monday 13 September in Munich – with in person attendance!




 




<a href="https://www.meeco.me/">Meeco</a> is delighted to be attending and presenting. This is a very welcome opportunity to reconnect with colleagues from around the globe and sit side by side in this hybrid event.  The European Identity and Cloud Conference returns fully digital, reacting to the global pandemic.




 




KuppingerCole has used the experience of the past eighteen months in virtual conferencing throughout to offer a safe and hygienic event experience – on-site, virtual, and hybrid.




 




This year, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katrynadow/">Katryna Dow</a>, our CEO &amp; Founder attend in person, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/smithjase/">Jason Smith</a>, our Chief Commercial Officer will beam in virtually for his presentation.




 




Both Katryna and Jason are presenting on Tuesday 14 September; Katryna in the Consumer Identity and Digital Transformation, and Jason in the Privacy and Consent Management tracks. Following is an outline of their sessions.<br>




 





 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4626">The Next Frontier: Why Decentralised Identity is only Base Camp</a> 





 




Over the past decade significant advancements have been made towards decentralised, self-sovereign and tokenised identity. Now that we can tokenise a unique value, what is the new value we can enable?




 




The emerging post-pandemic world is already calling for a new type of ‘digital’ normal. We are at the beginning of a new design and architectural phase. Personal data linked to identity, fueled by AI will sit at the centre of everything.




 




If we get this right, we may enable citizens, students, patients, passengers and consumers to more equitably join the value chains fuelled by data and identity, which in turn could lead to greater trust, personalisation and a more prosperous society.




 




However, this will require new commercial models, enforceable regulation and the digital tools to transform our connected society.&nbsp;This session will focus on the work ahead to connect services, service providers to our semantic world.




 




<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4626">Tuesday, September 14, 2021 12:00—12:20 CET</a>




 





  





 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4652/2">Data Privacy</a> 




Do people really care about data privacy?




 




The pandemic has forced more of us into digital channels and with that has come an over sharing of personal data. It’s become too easy to upload an app and straight away put your name, email address, payment details in, without actually understanding fully where and with whom that information may be shared and why it’s being used.




 




Is this a cost that people are prepared to pay?




 




Latest research suggests a growing data privacy chasm between people and business. How can business bridge this chasm?




 




<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4652/2">Tuesday, September 14, 2021 15:50—16:10 CET</a>




 




It’s not too late to get your last-minute ticket!

If you’re at the event, we would love to have you join us in person, or of course in the comfort of your remote screen.

  <p>Is your IGA strategy keeping up with modern threats? Novel attack methods are revealed daily, compliance requirements never stop evolving, and how and where we work has forever escaped the traditional office. As a result, organizations require more flexibility than ever to protect what matters most. You shouldn’t have to compromise functionality nor security levels because your IT resources and people operate on-premises, in the cloud or in a hybrid environment. The point is that you don’t need to.</p>
<p>Don’t miss this 20-minute keynote address by One Identity’s Rima Pawar, VP of Product Management, as she discusses the secret fears of many CISOs and other senior IT leadership and how an identity-centric security strategy can mitigate modern threats and help IT executives sleep at night.

However, we are almost never in a greenfield position: we must interoperate with legacy systems and the demands of the business drive towards different and competing solutions for different problems.

Companies increasingly use digital technologies to transform the actual products and services they sell to their customers, while modern service and app architectures drive adoption of containers and micro-services. These trends pose new challenges and opportunities for security. The number of machine-to-machine interactions is growing, as is the need to establish trust in real time across many distributed systems. In this thought-provoking session, Joy Chik will explore trends that are making identity even more central to modern security.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2021-chik-identity-evolving-cloud-security"></a>

  <p>Blue is the world’s most popular color.</p>
<p>But this was not always the case. Originally, it was little used in art and clothing, and in turn, had little symbolic cultural value. In the course of a few key decades, however, blue overcame obstacles of sourcing and production, and its popularity exploded—rising to represent some of the highest values of society.&nbsp; Subsequently, a wave of innovation democratized the color, placing it in the hands of “normal people” and cementing its cultural legacy.</p>
<p>Identity finds itself on a similar path. After a period of relative obscurity, identity has begun its rise over the past decade—but the journey is just beginning. Like blue, it faces challenges to its ascendancy—both practical and ethical. We’ll extract lessons from the trajectory of the world’s most popular hue and seek to apply them to the arc of identity.</p>

  <p>Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC) research finds that three-quarters of Canadians feel that it’s important to have a secure, trusted, and privacy-enhancing digital ID to safely and securely make transactions online. As federal governments focus on post-pandemic recovery, investing in digital ID makes strong economic sense, especially for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs). For SMEs, the impact of digital identity could be used to improve processes that are difficult today. </p>
<p>This is especially true in situations where businesses need to provide proof of identity to another business. Considering SMEs account for approximately 30 percent of Canada’s overall GDP ($450 billion), if we assume that the average SME could be just one percent more efficient with access to trusted digital identity, this results in a potential $4.5 billion of added value to SMEs and reinvestments in the Canadian economy. This presentation will provide a detailed overview of research performed over the course of 2 years to quantify public perception and demand for secure, interoperable, digital identity that works across the whole of the economy.&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2021-brennan-demand-for-digital-id"></a>

  <p>When thinking about what SSI means for enterprises and providers of services to enterprises, it's easy to forget that SSI is about each of our sovereign selves. This means SSI should give us each a clear sense of independence, agency, and obvious freedom from the old centralized Identity Provider Relying Party model, and the federated one that followed from it. But we aren't there yet. What will it take to get us there—for our sovereign selves, and not just for hot new SSI businesses?</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2021-searls-sovereign-self"></a>

  <p>Everything is famously code today—cars are computers with wheels, appliances have Internet access, smart doors and houses are controlled from mobile phone apps. With all this code around, security is more of a challenge than ever. A central pillar of security is identity management: the technology that protects logins and controls access. This, too, is becoming code to work with all the other code. Libraries for developers are essential, including ID controls in mobile and Web applications for initial sign on, single sign-on, federated sign-on, biometric authentication systems, and controlling access to sensitive data. And code itself is becoming code: automation systems for producing code, deploying code, updating code, configuring resources and access controls. IAM code has to be wherever it’s needed, when it’s needed, and automated, just like any other code. The better we do this, the more secure we all are with our ubiquitous computers.&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2021-newcomer-rise-of-developer-iam"></a>

<p>Mobile apps are packed with our highly sensitive&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/14-real-life-examples-of-personal-data-you-definitely-want-to-keep-private-plus-how-to-do-it/">personal data</a>. But new&nbsp;<a href="https://researchspace.ukzn.ac.za/xmlui/handle/10413/19431">research</a>&nbsp;by South African law lecturer and High Court advocate&nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/the-privacy-by-design-approach-for-mobile-apps-why-its-not-enough-164090">Dusty-Lee Donnelly</a>&nbsp;says privacy by design and other standard privacy protections for mobile app data (the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/08/can-consent-ever-play-a-valuable-role-in-consumer-privacy/">consent model</a>&nbsp;and regulations and compliance) just aren’t enough.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donnelly takes aim at&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/how-we-apply-the-7-principles-of-privacy-by-design/">privacy by design</a>,&nbsp;arguing the interdisciplinary, systems engineering approach based on seven key principles by&nbsp;<a href="https://gpsbydesign.org/who-we-are/">Ann Cavoukian</a>&nbsp;isn’t enough to protect personal data in mobile apps because the “design decisions made by app developers are constrained by existing technologies and platform rules designed by others.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, Donnelly endorses “<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/06-22-2012-privacy-by-redesign-a-practical-framework-for-implementation/">privacy by (re)design</a>, where all roleplayers in the ecosystem take privacy seriously and redesign existing platforms and technologies. But enforcing that approach will require tighter legal regulation of third party data sharing.”</p>



<p><a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/06-22-2012-privacy-by-redesign-a-practical-framework-for-implementation/">Privacy by (re)design</a>&nbsp;is another brainchild of&nbsp;Ann Cavoukian, described as a transformative process that gives organizations a standards-based framework for managing privacy projects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Where privacy by design puts the onus on app developers to be proactive about data privacy, privacy by (re)design redesigns the&nbsp;“app ecosystem to address data sharing”, spreading the burden. Donnelly gives the example of how most apps transmit data directly to third parties, like Google and Facebook, but that privacy laws don’t adequately address this third party sharing which can leave app developers exposed to liability and users unprotected. Donnelly wants to “close the privacy loop” by making the parties who design the technologies and platforms on which mobile apps are built and marketed legally accountable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We agree that, as an app developer, your responsibility for “privacy by design” extends to what you create AND what you consume from an app ecosystem (analytics, advertising, etc). We see privacy by (re)design as a re-definition of where the boundary of responsibility for privacy design ends.&nbsp;As the app publisher, you are ultimately responsible for the data you process, and “ignorance is no excuse.” In a perfect world, services with the potential for introducing privacy risk would be better regulated or regulations would make it easier for an app developer to make good privacy choices, but data is the new oil and perfect worlds rarely materialize.</p>



<p>The existence and success of our consumer app&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;is proof that privacy by design is not widespread enough to provide broad spectrum protection, and that privacy by (re)design is an indirect description of another gap for which MySudo helps a person take back some control.</p>

 An international platform for shared&nbsp;missions <p>This piece was led by a member of the Dark Matter Labs team based in the UK as part of the #BeyondtheRules project, and as such is written in British English and has particular references to contexts in the&nbsp;UK.</p><p>This blog was written in August 2021 and reflects our learning at that&nbsp;time.</p> Our Context <p>In a context of climate breakdown and technological disruption, Dark Matter Labs works to accelerate societal transition towards collective care, shared agency, long-termism and interconnectedness. We focus on the dark matter — the invisible structures responsible for producing the majority of the world around us, from policy and regulation to finance and data, governance and democratic participation, organisational culture and identity.</p><p>We are a discovery*-based organisation — we enter most of our work not knowing the outcome — and sitting with uncertainty, complexity, and emergence is in every part of our fabric. Indeed, our own ‘dark matter’ and the organisational infrastructures that we build to shape how we show up together is also emergent. These infrastructures have had to rapidly evolve over the last two years while we have grown from 18 people to 55 and spread geographically, with operating vehicles now in the UK, the Netherlands, Canada, South Korea and&nbsp;Sweden.</p><p>We do not seek growth in and of itself but we know that a deeply enhanced scope and range of capabilities is needed to fulfil our missions, even though many of us instinctively have felt apprehensive about this at a time when so much of our internal systems have not felt ‘ready’ for scale. Indeed, we are increasingly accustomed to knowing that much of the work we do we may never feel fully ‘ready’&nbsp;for.</p><p>Through an ongoing pandemic, and the last 20 months has been quite the ride. It has impacted, in different ways, everyone across our team. It sped up the need to find alternative ways to share stories, thoughts, reflections, deep strategies and vulnerabilities in virtual spaces that before didn’t seem possible through a 2D online video square. It required a commitment to learning and intentionally putting the time into our shared relationships and social contract throughout the&nbsp;way.</p><p>It is much of this that defines our context as an organisation and from which the learning that we share here is anchored. In sum, we&nbsp;are:</p>  Mission-led  Focused on discovery* and&nbsp;learning  International with a planetary view  Primarily remote  Evolving constantly  <p>In this 4 part blog series, we’ll share how we’ve been building the organisational infrastructure for this work and what we’re learning:</p>  This blog (1) sets the context of our work and how we’re working towards a platform for DM that is mission-led, planetary in mindset, international in nature, primarily remote and legally compliant.  Blog 2 looks at what’s needed for people to navigate complex, emergent work. In particular, at how we try to compound learning and construct legibility in our&nbsp;systems.  Blog 3 looks at how we are working towards a distributed system of governance through self-management, legal stewardship and other means. It looks at the platform of deep care, security and safety required for&nbsp;this.  Blog 4 looks at how we organise as a team to build organisational infrastructure and the impact that our way of organising has on our ability to do our&nbsp;work.  <p>*We use the term ‘discovery’ tentatively, while trying to find a better term for it, recognising its colonial connotations and&nbsp;history.</p> Led by Planetary Missions <p>Exploring the ‘dark matter’ of our socio-economic systems is complex, interconnected and long-term work. Traditional top-down hierarchical structures of organising and planning are clearly not appropriate for this work. In setting up DML’s structures for organising, we took inspiration from Mariana Mazzucato and IIPP’s Mission Economy work and instigated a way for us to organise around Missions. It guides us to identify core outcomes that we consider critical, which we collaborate on building over the long-term, less swayed by the cycles of funding or projects.</p><p>By example, one of our missions is ‘Nature-Based Solutions’. It aims to provide the infrastructure components for radical collective action to regenerate, enhance and scale natural or modified ecosystems for thriving human and non-human wellbeing. This mission is made up of multiple strands of work which span from micro-actions like <a href="https://magicalmeadows.city/Story">Magical Meadows</a>, a citizens toolbox to facilitate citizens participation in urban greening, all the way to <a href="https://treesasinfrastructure.com/">Trees As Infrastructure</a>.</p><p>Trees As Infrastructure is a platform to value and invest in nature beyond carbon, which establishes nature as a critical part of urban infrastructure, alongside bridges, roads and rail, enabling investment, profitability and sustainability. An early-stage conceptual model for TreesAI was developed in 2019 with support from EIT Climate-KIC, resulting in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/trees-as-infrastructure-1dd94e1cfedf">this report</a>. In 2020, the ideas behind these were developed within our Healthy Clean Cities and ReCode work and, alongside, we began working with NatureScot on enabling Nature-based Solutions at scale and building the systemic capacity for establishing regenerative Natural Asset Markets in Scotland, more details can be found in the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OdtF45v59Zh7TDDrNRifnp4e6Cl4OIK0/view">published report</a>. In 2021, our work with NatureScot continued and the ideas evolved to include a pilot implementation in Leuven and replication in Madrid &amp; Krakow as part of the LIFE Climate Change Adaptation. As a recent recipient of the Google Impact Challenge on Climate and part of the inaugural Morgan Stanley Sustainable Solutions Collaborative Cohort, we will now be able to start building the technical platform to make the ideas possible in pilot location of Glasgow, more details can be found in our <a href="https://treesasinfrastructure.com/assets/01.07.21_TreesAI%20in%20Glasgow%20Synopsis.pdf">project synopsis</a>.</p><p>Through these varied projects, we gradually collaborate towards a broader&nbsp;mission.</p><p>We have been working on a framework that visualises these missions in an iterative way which we look forward to sharing in full when in&nbsp;use.</p>Our current framework in progress to visualise DM missions and their sub-projects<p>We recently published a DM Note on what we are learning in organising around missions, which can be read&nbsp;<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/dm-note-5-50e46540dd05">here</a>.</p> An international platform for&nbsp;missions <p>Dark Matter Labs was born out of <a href="https://www.project00.cc/">Project 00</a> and originated with a (hugely enabling) base in London. With much of the dark matter we explore being transnational, with partners emerging in locations around the world, with missions not being geographically bounded, it was clear that our work couldn’t remain centred in London. It required an international legal platform and multi-skilled people with perspectives from across the&nbsp;world.</p><p>The team began to grow internationally before the pandemic and we discussed the need to organise as a team that would be geographically decentralised by default. We didn’t know we would be as strongly incentivised to do so so fast in&nbsp;2020.</p><p>We now — at the start of Sep 2021 — have team members working from 15 countries ranging from India, Canada, Korea, Hong Kong, Hungary, Germany, Scotland, Sweden and more, although still with the largest mass in UK and&nbsp;Europe.</p><p>We currently work on strategic place-based innovation in 12 countries (some at a national level but others at a regional, city or neighbourhood level).</p><p>We knew that moving from being single-location to multi-geography would require us not to create geographical siloes. We would need to work according to the nature of the ‘dark matter’ being explored (with both local and planetary-scale questions entangled within them), enabling a cross-geographical focus whilst embedded in local contexts. Creating a system that allows for free-flowing connection and co-creation across geographies, however, swims upriver against most of the rules that we need to navigate (whilst we welcome some of the intended accountability — and at times, structure — of these&nbsp;rules).</p><p>When it comes to financial decisions, for example, we intend to take most of our decisions from an aggregated whole organisational perspective. This means that whilst we capture information on the financial performance of each legal entity/country in which we operate and we ensure it meets good standards, the information that guides our business model is our shared financial picture. This stops us from focusing on who or where is more sustainable/profitable but rather on ‘is the system thriving?’</p><p>This sits alongside national accounting requirements, for which we use national bookkeeping systems and aggregate the information into a shared picture; meanwhile, our cash flow information and monitoring is captured and shared primarily at an org-wide&nbsp;level.</p><p>Meanwhile, international tax regulations demand that any services delivered by an entity in one country on behalf of an entity in another must charge profits on the service (at internationally agreed thresholds), thus directly creating a client-provider relationship rather than a collaboration partnership across legal entities. We have Transfer Pricing Agreements between all entities to ensure that we comply with tax regulations and are accountable in our different jurisdictions, whilst also not letting the charges between our legal entities dictate the decision-making of how people spend their&nbsp;time.</p><p>In our governance, we have local legal stewards who are embedded in the local place, mixed with actors who take a whole-org perspective and are legal stewards in all DML entities. The finance team, which calculates the transfer pricing figures, have no legal stewardship in any operating companies to avoid conflict of interest.</p><p>Enabling this shift from London-centric to international is also about mental models, cultures, perspectives and contexts. Our team now benefits from an incredible range of cultures, languages, religions, ethnicities, traditions and more. On the organisational/operational level, reflecting this diversity within how we come together — and building towards inclusion and equity across the organisation — is a continuous and evolving&nbsp;process.</p><p>The art of organisational space-holding in general sets much of the cultures of how we come together, of which we will share more practical details in Blog 2 in this series. Our system of self-management (and distributed agency) is also a notable enabler to this work, which will be exploring more in Blog 3 to this&nbsp;series.</p><p>Timezones and language are two everyday areas that are challenging to navigate in this context. Finding a time for all team or cross-geography meetings is challenging when we now have team members in locations from Canada to Europe, India and South Korea, meaning that we span a huge range of timezones.</p>Cross geography timezones for a 9am&nbsp;meeting<p>When we come together - for meetings, shared decisions, connection, retreats - this becomes increasingly challenging to manage logistically.</p><p>Currently, some of our approaches are to hold team sessions with at least 2 timezone options and at times in circulating timezones so that they do not bias the geographical location of the organiser. Small tools - like people having the international clock embedded into their calendar with the different team members timezones showing - also help us to make the shift in habits in considering timezones whenever meetings are arranged.</p>Embedded timezone widget into calendars<p>Our recent hybrid gathering worked around timezones by scheduling a mixture of time all together virtually at the beginning and end of days (respective to geography), alongside time spent locally in-person that groups could self-design according to their&nbsp;flow.</p>Draft schedule of the August 2021 hybrid gathering<p>Language, meanwhile, codes our mental models and biases our framing of a scenario. For those working in their 2nd, 3rd (or more) language or within their first language but outside of cultural tongues, the additional effort and energy required is considerable.</p><p>English is our shared organisational language, which is perhaps to be expected as an international team with origins in London. Yet we know how important the rich diversity of language across the organisation is, including in each of our company locations. Notably, most of our team (more than 70%) speak English as their second, third or fourth language.</p><p>We continue to build ways to enable local languages to be the dominant language where possible, from holding local entity operations meetings in the local language; naming all companies in both English and the local language; translating key work relevant to local contexts into the local language; experimenting with translation headphones and other technology to allow local language led meetings that non-speakers can still understand.</p>DM articles and images in Swedish, Italian, French and&nbsp;Korean<p>As an organisation still with a strong UK, Europe and ‘Global North’ bias (around 85% of our team is resident in Europe) there are embedded biases and defaults towards these geographies, and we know that these will inevitably hinder rather than unleash us. We need to nurture both our capability to do the work that we do and for that work to be responsible to a plurality of perspectives. We intend to further geographically variegate over the coming years and to build on our practices towards equity as we do&nbsp;this.</p> Transnational Payroll and Contracting Areas of external regulation that we recognise we need to comply by and innovate&nbsp;around<p>In building this planetary ecosystem, team contracting and payroll are some of the knottier areas to navigate and a place where the current national-focused rules of the system particularly work in counter-current to our&nbsp;set-up.</p><p>With social security systems largely structured on a national (and federal) basis, having team members distributed around the world and working with mobility is a particularly challenging dance. As we have developed work within other operating countries, and our teams have grown and our contracting with partners become more numerous, we have found it necessary to set up legal entities to enable the payroll platforms and the contractual requirements of partners. Logistically, each investment into a new entity set up is significant (in time, cost, complexity, risk and&nbsp;more).</p><p>Alongside local payroll systems, it requires us to work with international payroll providers to set up payroll systems from these legal entities to other countries where our team is based to ensure that we are meeting the full tax contribution requirements of our network. The investment required into the intermediary providers is higher than the (important) tax contributions themselves and balancing this potential investment against others we wish to prioritise is challenging. For now, we have collectively agreed to invest into particular geographies and gradually grow these, actively setting up infrastructure for partners, companies, contracts, payroll systems and other structures there. Meanwhile, when team members need to join from other geographies (requiring new payrolls and administrative structures to be put in place when they are based outside of those countries) we will invest in that to be possible, but we expect this to be less frequently the&nbsp;case.</p><p>In contracting, the planetary system requires us to ensure that each contract complies with the shared principles of how we work, the national legislation of the contracting local entity and also the national legislation of the person’s country of residence. One of the unfortunate casualties of this complexity is that our ambition to redesign our contracting with one another to a way that deeply reflects how we want to show up together has been put on the backburner as we have had to invest time navigating compliance first. We hope to pick up the more visionary parts to our contracting towards the end of 2021/early 2022 and are grateful to have examples of contracts built by others — such as our valued friends at Civic Square — from which to draw inspiration.</p> Pay as a foundation <p>How we organise pay and how we contract with our team is a critical part of how we build a distributed international ecosystem. We have intentionally designed our pay and contracting systems to date in a way that is set up to avoid pay functioning as an incentive or a reward for work done or for rank, and instead tries to build it as a liberating structure to take financial worries off the&nbsp;table.</p>Our current pay formula (GBP&nbsp;version)<p>The proxy of experience (years of all experience as an adult) is intended as an (admittedly imperfect and only loosely correlated, with outliers) proxy for life costs, or a form of minimum basic income. This means that no matter where you are based geographically, and whatever role you play in the organisation and how that changes, we all share the same pay&nbsp;formula.</p><p>One of the projects we have had the benefit of taking part in — <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/beyondtherules-e3ab44f0dc3">Beyond the Rules</a> — undertook an exploration into Reimagining Pay, researching examples and hosting 50+ people in March 2021, from which the recording is <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UxESJiYrt42Ei-Ds7vCoCC2Z3dq6x33y/view?usp=sharing">available here</a>. Its <a href="https://www.notion.so/darkmatterlabs/Framing-Provocation-Reimagining-the-Wage-1d2140e1fb1d42efa55a00cd3bbd2f57#7916748318e84236845ee8e0568ee960">framing provocation</a> shares more about why we might need to reimagine how we structure pay and for what&nbsp;purpose.</p><p>In exploring these pay options it is interesting to see that whilst the law protects against demographic discrimination of various types in pay (such as in the Equality Act 2010 in the UK), it does not protect against the inherent discrimination structurally baked into our current economic system. Traditional pay structures bias types of experience (e.g. expensive higher education), types of social capital (e.g. networks that open doors to opportunities) and other factors that are intrinsically linked to systemic privilege.</p><p>For Dark Matter Labs, ‘<a href="https://www.notion.so/darkmatterlabs/Framing-Provocation-Reimagining-the-Wage-1d2140e1fb1d42efa55a00cd3bbd2f57#7916748318e84236845ee8e0568ee960">Reimagining Pay</a>’ brought up various questions such&nbsp;as:</p>  Whilst the pay formula provides a proxy for living costs, which on the macro level is fairly correlative, for some it really isn’t, and when it isn’t, it can be problematic to the point of very talented people not being able to thrive with&nbsp;us.  It doesn’t allow for any consideration of the historical systems that we are part of, who has been structurally divested from and thus what historic equality and justice looks like in pay. For example, it doesn’t take into account differences in intergenerational wealth and how that makes flat pay inherently problematic (the brilliant Farzana Khan eloquently speaks on&nbsp;this).  <p>Following the learning from Reimagining Pay, we recently discussed an alternative structure for pay, which tries to find the unique sweet spot for pay for each individual that is regenerative for both the system and for the&nbsp;self.</p><p>This approach might involve a facilitated self-reflective process to help people to (anonymously) establish an outline of where that sweet spot is for&nbsp;them.</p><p>The process invites each of us to reflect in private on the intersectional systems of privilege and injustice that we are each part of; our historical investment into the work of societal transition; how we show up in our setting; and our personal financial needs (chosen and unchosen).</p><p>The process would happen confidentially, however data would be aggregated and disaggregated by certain factors allowing the group to discuss and review pay ratios and fairness across the system and assess total needs against budget, in&nbsp;rounds.</p><p>At DM we recently discussed this approach, prior to which we collectively reviewed how we want to reinvest earnings into the system, including how much we intend to reinvest back into pay in the coming&nbsp;year.</p>Miro screenshot from our shard session on how we organise around finances at the August DM gathering<p>We are currently exploring how this iteration of pay might manifest, yet we’re aware this is the start of a journey of self-reflection and will take time. Some of what’s outlined above can be naturally uncomfortable to question in our own lives, and for some is not a reflection they are used to. We are working together on a pathway from our current system towards the principles that are embedded in this model, and we will be happy to share in due course how it&nbsp;goes.</p><p>If you would like to receive updates (every few weeks/months) about the #BeyondtheRules project you can do so via <a href="https://dark-matter-labs.typeform.com/to/jpm8rdp1?typeform-source=provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">this short form</a>.

<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There are differences in Digital Identity between US and Europe. What is the bigger picture?</p>
<p>
Yeah, well, I think as the first step we have to look at some global initiatives that are taking place in business. And if I have to mention two main things that are happening, one is the gig economy where the relationship between employees and the employer is changing. That employees are much more flexible and that a lot of the work is being outsourced and outsourcing can be done anywhere. And the second thing that is happening is that we are working towards anything as a service. We're used to software as a service, especially here in the IT industry, but we're also very familiar at the moment with car as a service. </p>
<p>And, one of our customers is also thinking of moving to ship as a service. So rather than buying a ship, you just pay for operating hours of such a ship. Well, these changes lead to changes in IT, it increases the dependency on IT. It leads to dominance of certain platforms in IT. Think of Amazon, Google, Microsoft - it leads to globalization. And of course, as a result, it also requires a higher interoperability. So, these things strongly influence the changes in digital Identity.   </p>

<p><br></p>
<p> What are challenges between the different aspects of Digital Identity?  </p>
<p>
With these changes with the gig economy and anything as a service - or I already mentioned that there is a bigger dependency on IT, and on the big tech providers. And there are some concerns, and these concerns result in the behavior of these organizations, not only in how they treat our privacy, but also in taxation or in copyright protection. And also, think of the data sovereignty that we want to have here in Europe, where we have seen that the US has implemented the Cloud Act in 2018. We are very aware here in this geography of privacy and we have developed the GDPR and adopted the GDPR and beyond GDPR, there will be other rules and regulations like privacy.</p>
<p>At the same time, we are in a very fragmented landscape here where interoperability is not so easy. So, if you look for example, at data residency, then, in the past we had the Safe Harbor agreement back in 2015, it was invalidated. And as a follow up of the Safe Harbor agreement, there was the privacy shield agreement that again was invalidated last year, known as the Schrems II outcome. And currently, in the EU, we are working towards a data sovereignty - we've seen that in Russia and China - and we are implementing now our own internet, Gaia-X. We are implementing other measures to transfer data from the EU to the US contractual clauses. The UK has their own guidelines and is building their own guidelines.  </p>
<p>And we see all kinds of interpretations in different countries, for example, in France, where they allow EU SaaS built on AWS provided that sufficient safeguards have been implemented. In the privacy area, we see that, although GDPR has been implemented, it is still only implemented in a pretty basic fashion. So going forward, I expect that, for example, consent management will get a lot more adoption, rather than the legitimate interest that we initially thought would be a ground for processing of data. And, at the same time, we see that in different industries, there are, per country, different regulations. Think of healthcare, think of insurance or banking. And last but not least, there is this interoperability question - we would like to inter-operate, we want to inter-operate across these verticals, which have their specific regulations - and also per country.  </p>
<p>But at this moment, we see, for example, identity providers like Speed in Italy, France Connect. We see Verimi in Germany, and we see Itsme in Belgium, DigiD and eHerkenning in the Netherlands. We are working - or the EU is working towards standardization with eIDAS. But this is still a bit of a free option for the different countries because their own identities have to be notified in the eIDAS. So, a new law is currently being developed by the EU for EU wide digital identity based on the wallet. So, there are a lot of developments in this area that try to solve the challenges of digital identity in and across Europe.  </p>

<p><br></p>
<p>How does that impact the platforms that customers need for their digital identities?</p>
<p>
I think first of all – the question of data residency – that is a clear question. So, the platforms that customers need, need to ensure that data is kept in Europe, because our customers don't want to be opposed to these constantly changing regulations that are constantly declared invalid, and on contractual agreements. That is a clear thing, other things, with the fragmented landscape, with the fragmented identity providers across Europe, we also see a need for a lot of flexibility in building a customer journey and for the onboarding of users at every point in the customer journey, you need to be able to make a step out. And the step out in Italy will be different from France and so forth. There is, of course, also the multi-language in Europe, we speak different languages. </p>
<p>And, for example, I'm from the Netherlands. If I drive two hours to the south, I need to speak French, and only French. If I drive to the east, I need to speak German, and very often only German. And to the west there is the UK. And these language barriers do not only give requirements for the end user, the consumer, but also if you work business to business and you work in a delegated fashion, then your business customers, or your partners – and I think again of that “anything as a service or to gig economy” - also, you need to address these type of business users within their own language. So, language support, not only for the consumer, but in the whole chain, B2B to B2C needs to be supported. And, of course with our consciousness on privacy, it is very important that we give full control in the platforms to the consumer on the usage of their data.  </p>

<p><br></p>
<p>What would your key take-away for the panel be?  </p>
<p>
Well, of course, for the customers, when they are looking for a platform, they need a platform that fulfils the requirements that were just mentioned here, the flexibility, the language, but it's not only that. There is a lot of dynamics in this world. The Gig economy and the SaaS and Anything as a Service are constantly evolving. That means that, if you have a vendor far away, most likely that vendor doesn't completely understand, or doesn't adopt these types of dynamics quickly enough. So, I'm advocating, being a European vendor, also to work with European vendors because they are on top of all these developments. And there is for the next years no such thing as a standard for customer Identity. I think that this place, especially in the regulated industries - Telco, energy, finance, and maybe to a lesser extent to retail and consumer goods - because things are less privacy sensitive. </p>

 Everything You Need To Know About Ontology EVM Contract Development — Part 1: Network&nbsp;Details <p>Today, Ontology, the high speed, low cost public blockchain bringing decentralized identity and data solutions to Web 3.0, announced the official deployment of a TestNet supporting EVM and opened the EVM compatible public beta to developers around the world. At the same time, the “<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontologys-evm-testnet-officially-deployed-now-opening-evm-compatible-public-beta-to-developers-6dddc2bdd764">Ontology Security Vulnerability and Threat Intelligence Bounty Programme</a>” was officially launched in cooperation with SlowMist, a well-known code auditing agency. The top reward for reporting a vulnerability is $12,000 in&nbsp;ONG.</p><p>Through the integration of the Ethereum virtual machine, Ontology has achieved full compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem. At present, the Ontology TestNet already supports EVM contracts and the node call method of the Ethereum chain. Developers can directly use EVM development tools such as Truffle, Remix and Web3.js on the Ontology TestNet for dApp deployment.</p><p>In order to encourage community developers to quickly and easily familiarize themselves with the Ontology EVM development environment, we specially prepared a “Handbook for Dummies”, which explains the essentials of Ontology EVM contract development.</p> 1. Network&nbsp;Details <p>Before using the Ontology EVM, let’s first look at its configuration information including ChainID, RPC URL, and blockchain explorer address. Based on this information, you can configure your MetaMask wallet to connect to the Ontology&nbsp;network.</p><p>Due to the difference between the ONG precision (9 bits) in the Ontology EVM and the precision supported by Metamask (18 bits), the display in Metamask may experience errors. We recommended using the <a href="https://bridge.ont.io/transfer">Ontology Bridge</a> to check the ONG balance or make a transfer.</p><p>1.1 Node&nbsp;Network</p>  MainNet Information  <p>2) TestNet Information</p><p>Note: When using MetaMask to connect to the Ontology network, please select “Custom RPC” in the MetaMask network settings, and then enter and save the configuration information according to the network&nbsp;type.</p><p>1.2 EVM assets on the Ontology&nbsp;chain</p><p>TestNet</p><p>1.3 Gas&nbsp;Fee</p><p>The deployment of the EVM contract on the Ontology chain requires ONG as a handling fee. You can click <a href="https://developer.ont.io/">here</a> to receive the ONG test&nbsp;coin.</p><p>1.4 Ontology&nbsp;Bridge</p><p>Ontology Network has achieved compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem through the Ontology EVM virtual machine. Therefore, in addition to native contracts, the contract types supported by Ontology now include NeoVM contracts, Wasm contracts, and EVM contracts. This also means that NeoVM-based OEP-4 Tokens and EVM-based ORC-20 Tokens can exist on the Ontology blockchain. Since the address format and signature method supported by EVM are different from those supported by NeoVM/WasmVM, ORC-20 assets (EVM contract implementation, similar to ERC-20 assets), the Ontology system must be stored in the Ethereum private key corresponding address (beginning with 0x), OEP-4 assets (implemented by NeoVM contract) must be stored in the address corresponding to the Ontology private key (beginning with A). As the transaction fee of the Ontology network ONG is an exception, ONG can also exist in the Ethereum account address and Ontology account&nbsp;address.</p><p>In order to facilitate the mutual circulation of ORC-20 assets and OEP-4 assets within Ontology network between Ethereum accounts and Ontology accounts, Ontology provides the <a href="https://bridge.ont.io/">Ontology Bridge</a> service, which is used in Ontology network deploys a Bridge contract (implemented by Wasm contract) to realize the mutual exchange of ORC-20 assets and OEP-4 assets between two different types of accounts. For ONG, users can use Ontology Bridge to transfer money between different types of addresses.</p><p>Ontology Bridge contract implementation logic</p>  Exchange OEP-4 for&nbsp;ORC-20  The user calls the oep4ToErc20 method of the Bridge contract through the Ontology private key signature. This method transfers the user’s OEP-4 assets to the Bridge contract address, and then transfers the corresponding amount of ERC-20 assets in the Bridge contract address to the user’s Ethereum private key generated address.  Exchange ORC-20 for&nbsp;OEP-4  The user needs to first use the Ethereum private key to call the approve method of the ORC-20 assets to authorize the address corresponding to the user’s Ontology private key to be able to transfer the ORC-20&nbsp;assets.  The user uses the authorized Ontology private key to call the ERC-20 to OEP-4 method of the Bridge contract. This method will transfer the asset in the user’s Ethereum address to the Bridge contract address, and then transfer the corresponding amount of OEP-4 assets to the user’s Ontology&nbsp;address.  <p>Note that in either of the aforementioned two asset exchange processes, the user always uses the Ontology private key to interact with the Bridge contract in order to transfer the asset in the user’s Ethereum address (the user is required to use the Ethereum private key for authorization operations). During the redemption process, remember that ORC-20 assets always have the address corresponding to the Ethereum private key, and OEP-4 assets always have the address corresponding to the Ontology private&nbsp;key.</p><p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 Gas Tank on Polygon 
<p>We are making blockchain gas fees transparent for our users through the implementation of a “Gas Tank” service.</p>

		 
	 
                               <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in September 2021.</p>   
	 
		 
			 
 
 
<p>This month we take a look at how Tokeny is making blockchain fees transparent for its users through the implementation of a “Gas Tank” service.</p>
<p>We are, on an optional basis, providing investors with a built-in custodial wallet1&nbsp;associated to their ONCHAINID digital identity. This allows users to hold assets and/or instruct transactions on the blockchain without having to safekeep their private key themselves. These wallets are available both on Ethereum and on Polygon.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/5-reasons-why-we-partnered-with-polygon/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_kydTMPIHYtv-ax-ol2J2U9HJ10W4zO1hmWnq3GNOg4GISunHJzobV5s_5y3tjN5vcXmJW">network fees on the Polygon network are substantially lower</a>&nbsp;– roughly by a factor of 1/10’000 – than on Ethereum, they nevertheless still exist and need to be covered for transactions to be executed. This obviously means wallet holders need to make sure to have enough MATICs – the cryptocurrency used to pay the gas fees on Polygon – in their wallet to ensure their transaction(s) from not being processed. This might cause an unnecessary burden on those investors who are not familiar enough with the blockchain to monitor the MATICs they have on their wallet(s), to buy new ones when needed and to transfer them on their wallet.</p>
<p>To avoid such confusion and make the process of holding and transacting in security tokens deployed on Polygon as seamless as possible, we have developed a “Gas Tank” solution ensuring that, at any time, there is enough MATICs available on all built-in wallets to cover the transaction costs of the wallet holders.</p>
<p>In essence, the Gas Tank:</p>
 
 continuously monitors the level of MATICs available on the Wallets; 
 detects the wallets which are running short and; 
 tops-up the MATIC provision on those specific wallets. 
 
<p>The process is fully automated, provided at no additional cost to the wallet holders and … live!</p>
<p>The main benefits users can expect from the “Gas Tank” are:</p>
 
 a more seamless user experience; 
 simpler operations: no need to monitor their wallet and top it up; 
 reduced risk of transactions not being processed; 
 reduced costs: no transaction fees for them to pay. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

		 
	 
    
	 
		 
			<p>We trust that the implementation of this new “Gas Tank” functionality will be a significant step for us to simplify the access and the administration of security tokens on the Polygon network.</p>
<p>1&nbsp;The built-in custodial wallets are provided in partnership with Tangany GmbH</p>

<p>For our 7th Close-up Magic meetup, we welcomed <a href="https://twitter.com/srmullen">Sean Mullen</a> and <a href="https://8-b.site/">Mattias Inokuchi</a> to talk&nbsp;about:</p>  How Svelte Kit differentiates itself from other frameworks like React and&nbsp;Angular.  The developer experience Svelte offers developers.  The gaps Svelte needs to fill before it can rank as the #1 UI framework.  <p>Here are a few of our favorite takeaways.</p> Key Takeaways  Svelte uses a smarter programming model than React&nbsp;🧠 <p>Like React, Svelte is a UI framework that makes it easier to write components. But instead of using a virtual DOM to track state changes and to re-render pages, Svelte pretty much avoids it. This is because React’s virtual DOM introduces unnecessary work for developers that, if done incorrectly, results in a slow performing app.</p><blockquote>“The danger of defaulting to doing unnecessary work, even if that work is trivial, is that your app will eventually succumb to ‘death by a thousand cuts’ with no clear bottleneck to aim at once it’s time to optimise.” (<a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/virtual-dom-is-pure-overhead">src</a>)</blockquote><p>React’s diffing algorithm cannot identify which element in the DOM is a state that is actually prone to changes, and its JSX syntax makes it easier for developers to write components that slows the app&nbsp;down.</p><p>Instead of using a virtual DOM and delegating the diffing work to the browser, Svelte puts on the smart compiler hat, figures out which states could change in your app at build time, and turns your code into tiny Vanilla JavaScript code. Pretty neat,&nbsp;huh?</p> New coders will fall in love with Svelte&nbsp;👏 <p>Sean, Mattias, and I agreed on a bunch of things during our talk. My favorite was the fact that Svelte is super beginner friendly for new programmers. This is because Svelte is made up of the OG tools of web development — HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. If you write any valid HTML/CSS/JS code, it will also be valid in a Svelte&nbsp;app.</p><blockquote>“As a beginner, it’s easy to recognize HTML and CSS compared to React.” — Mattias&nbsp;Inokuchi</blockquote><p>Since coders are saved from studying DOM manipulation, how to write in JSX, React Hooks, and more, there’s less barrier to entry and more time to get something working&nbsp;faster.</p> Svelte is the fastest growing frontend JS framework ⚡️ <p>One of the questions I asked Sean and Mattias is, “Will Svelte be able to capture the market share it needs to grow?” Although there weren’t any definitive answers, we discussed the positive indicators of Svelte’s continued growth.</p><p>Sean expressed that Svelte is a framework that he’s recommending to his friends. And it appears this type of word-of-mouth marketing in tech communities like Tech Twitter, Reddit and Discord is working because Svelte was found to be the fastest growing framework in August, 2021 based on NPM weekly downloads (<a href="https://twitter.com/zoltanszogyenyi/status/1431599979404087297">src</a>).</p><blockquote>“I’ve never been in a position where I can’t find a library to do what I want. Anything that you can do in another framework, it’s either already part of svelte or there’s a library to do it. Or it’s just much easier to accomplish in Svelte in the first place.” — Sean&nbsp;Mullen</blockquote><p>Sure, our key takeaways explain why developers love Svelte. But there’s more reason to love it. The blogs Rich Harris writes are always insightful and delightful, and the community behind Svelte is also super&nbsp;helpful.</p><p>💡 Ready to give Svelte a try? Follow the Guide Sean Mullen created&nbsp;<a href="https://magic.link/posts/magic-svelte">here</a>.</p> Q&amp;A Session <p>At the end of the talk, we received a great question from one of our listeners.</p><blockquote>Q: What do you think about integrating Svelte with Docker, Kubernetes, and working with environment variables?</blockquote><p>Curious to know the answer? Make sure to watch the recording of the fireside chat&nbsp;below.</p> Interested in Close-up&nbsp;Magic? <p>If you ever want to be a special guest for Close-up Magic and talk about a tech you’re passionate about, schedule a chat with Maricris&nbsp;<a href="https://calendly.com/magic-maricris/15min-1">here</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/how-svelte-cybernetically-enhances-web-development-ae5eb45d464b">How Svelte Cybernetically Enhances Web Development</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 A New Way&nbsp;Forward: <blockquote>By Sanja Bojanic, Biljana Cvetanovska Gugoska, Lazar Pop Ivanov and Narine Sahakyan, UNDP North Macedonia; Mihai Chereji, Meggan Collins, Indy Johar, Linnéa Rönnquist and Zehra Zaidi, Dark Matter&nbsp;Labs</blockquote><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has been a wake-up call for governments on the vulnerability of our economic and social systems, and the ability of the machinery of government to be able to process rapidly changing, cascading impacts into policy, programmes, financing decisions and continuous feedback and review. We know that other threats such as climate change and automation loom large on the horizon, with an ever-shortened window to be able to mitigate their impact. So how do democratic nations build the capabilities to deal with the long-term and cascading global challenges of the next twenty&nbsp;years?</p> Introduction <p>As explored in <a href="https://awayforward.undp.org/">‘A Way Forward’: Governing in an Age of Emergence’</a>, a previous collaboration between UNDP and Dark Matter Labs, over the next 20 years, governments around the world will be facing critical choices on climate, digital and democratic transition for their economy and society — or what we term “human, machine and ecological transition”. We are living in a global age of long, interlinked emergencies. <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/syr/">Climate change</a> (1), <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2019/05/nature-decline-unprecedented-report/">biodiversity loss</a> (2), <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/13-10-2020-impact-of-covid-19-on-people's-livelihoods-their-health-and-our-food-systems#:~:text=The%20economic%20and%20social%20disruption,the%20end%20of%20the%20year.">pandemics</a> (3), <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antibiotic-resistance">antibiotic resistance</a> (4), <a href="https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/wmr_2020.pdf">migration</a> (5) and <a href="http://report.hdr.undp.org/">human development</a> (6) are just some of the challenges, whose impact falls most heavily on the world’s most vulnerable people&nbsp;(7).</p><p>How do democratic nations build the capabilities to deal with long term and cascading global challenges of the next twenty years? Each one of these challenges can have devastating economic and social consequences — as has been laid bare by the COVID-19 pandemic. It is also evident that no government would be able to tackle all of these challenges on its own by top-down solutions, but would rather need to enable and incentivise other actors in society to embrace the policy mandate and play their part in affecting change. Fundamentally, this requires not only new innovative policy but a transformation of the machinery of government in how to formulate, disseminate and implement policy and the types of tools and methods that it uses. It requires new institutions, new ways of financing, an acceleration towards digital and analytical capability to ensure real-time evaluation against cascading risks, and the building of new capabilities not only across government but also society, and in a way that disseminates learning across&nbsp;society.</p><p>Finally, the question we are posing in this blog is how do we create a framework for a National Development Strategy that builds the nation’s capabilities for adaptation and resilience so that the whole of society is able to meet the future and the scale of adaptation required, and not with fear, but with renewed optimism to truly “build back&nbsp;better”?</p> Five Strategic Shifts For A New Way&nbsp;Forward <p>Human, machine and ecological transition requires us to develop strategic and critical responses that orient structural transformation towards long-termism and consideration for future generations. How we decide to use our land and resources today has long-term implications, yet our current systems are struggling to make sense of decisions that impact across multiple time horizons (from political cycles to fiscal budgets). We must ‘break the tragedy of the horizon’ (8), as Mark Carney, former Governor of the Bank of England, so eloquently stated in a much-cited speech at Lloyd’s of London in&nbsp;2015.</p><p>The transition calls for a revision of our relationships with: (A) The economy, challenging the way we assign value to certain contributions over time (9); (B) The environment, addressing the increasing uninhabitability of our environment; and (C) Society, challenging ageing populations and demographic slowdown (10). The transition also demands a new pathway for countries and importantly a new lens through which to see the nation-state. There is an inherent limitation in seeing the nation-state purely as a bounded territory. A border defines the geographic territory of a country over which its government can enact legislation, but it is redundant when dealing with the constant flows in and out of a country that impact everything from the economy to the environment, or when dealing with the prevention or mitigation of any one of the interconnected global challenges set out&nbsp;above.</p><p>In conceptualising a framework for a National Development Strategy in North Macedonia, we have embraced five strategic shifts for a new way&nbsp;forward:</p><p>1. Re-imagine statecraft for an age in which we see the nation as a system. We are moving from seeing the nation as a bounded territory to seeing the nation as a knotted system of flows impacted by transnational behaviours. The level of uncertainty inherent in the nation system means we cannot accurately predict or plan for the long-term future; nor can we silo and compartmentalise interventions because when you change something in any one space, you will be creating cascading impacts throughout the whole system (See Figure 1). We can no longer have a one-to-one, “action-reaction” response to deal with strategic risks, but rather it requires a network approach consisting of a number of parallel processes involving multiple&nbsp;actors.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic can be understood as a warning sign, a probe into the structural weaknesses of our existing systems (11). It shows how futile it is to address 21st-century challenges with the institutions and methods of 20th-century governance. It will not be enough to simply respond to crises, we need to scaffold the transition to a new human contract with the world around&nbsp;us.</p><p>2. Build a more inclusive democracy and one in which we act as custodians for future generations. Governments are waking up to the urgent need to build the capacity of the whole of society to care about, and take decisions on, the impact that we have on our planet and future generations.</p><p>In this age of complexity, top down government is neither sustainable given the scope and scale of interventions required, nor effective given the range of actors involved in our interconnected nation system. Moreover, the increased risks faced by the nation system need bold interventions that require building legitimacy across society for such actions. One way to build legitimacy is by fostering more inclusive, transparent and accountable policy making and programmes implementation (12). We also need to reinforce the multi-party democratic system. Not only is parliamentary debate and scrutiny essential, but it becomes imperative to take a cross-party collaborative approach and to be mindful of those who would try to game the system of democracy. Issues such as climate change need to go beyond party politics and a political system that continuously rewards one party for another’s failure.</p><p>The unprecedented future that countries are facing requires a level of citizen participation that can drive collaborative rather than centralised innovation. Future imagining and collective but distributed decision making will be central to this development (13). Our current mechanisms for democratic participation struggle to incorporate meaningful deliberation. We need to design deliberative processes, planning systems, policy and regulatory frameworks, better markets, and the ability to “contract” for the future (14). Simultaneously, nations need to prioritise investment in the rebuilding of societal trust so that different non-governmental actors are ready to listen, engage with and support the policy making and programmes implementation function of government.</p><p>3. Build <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile">antifragility</a> (15) for nation states to adjust, learn and deeply grow (16) in an age of long emergencies (as illustrated by the currents of uncertainty in the Deployment Framework Diagram in Figure 2 below). Antifragile systems are more than simply resilient and adaptable. They do not merely bounce back from shocks, or respond effectively in the wake of shocks, but thrive and improve because of such shocks. We need to build the capabilities for a nation to thrive in uncertain environments so that we are not always planning for the next crisis, whilst repairing the damage from the last one (17). Our collective strategy of renewal to “build back better” ought to be premised on a systemic response built on emergent, discursive, contingent processes of perpetual learning and self-renewal.</p><p>4. Transition as fast as possible to a “safe zone of operation” by using <a href="https://www.kateraworth.com/doughnut/">the Doughnut Framework by Kate Raworth</a> (18) as the “guard rail” in our transition journey, whilst recognising the divergent development cycles of different nations.</p><p>The Doughnut is a visual “safe and just space” framework that sets the goal of operating within safe planetary boundaries and social boundaries, acting as a compass for human progress. In terms of transition strategy, it can be used to identify interconnected risks and potentials over a time horizon and is therefore an evaluation tool or framework from which human, machine and ecological development can&nbsp;emerge.</p><p>The Doughnut Framework is not a set of policies and institutions, but rather principles for humanity to thrive in the 21st century. It is to be noted that one of these principles is moving from the goal of endless GDP growth to thriving in the doughnut where everyone’s needs are met. For middle income and low income countries that still need to develop and grow their economy, but want to adopt aspects of the Doughnut Framework, we have pursued the idea of deep&nbsp;growth.</p><p>5. Embrace a new thesis of human-machine-ecological deep growth, recognising a new human economy from care to creativity, unleashed by a new machine economy revolution of automation, AI, and structured on a new foundation of ecological regeneration, repair and biomaterial circularity.</p><p>Whilst many countries are seeking growth strategies alongside an improvement in quality of life. UNDP’s <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi">Human Development Index</a> (19) scores, and the adjusted <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/planetary-pressures%E2%80%93adjusted-human-development-index-phdi#:~:text=Planetary%20pressures%E2%80%93adjusted%20Human%20Development%20Index%20(PHDI),-About%20Planetary%20Pressures&amp;text=The%20PHDI%20is%20the%20level,as%20an%20incentive%20for%20transformation.">Planetary pressures-adjusted Human Development Index</a> (20) present another type of growth measure, beyond GDP. Any meaningful National Development Strategy needs to adopt a new theory of growth that fundamentally integrates the new human-machine-ecological economy as a virtuous system of both maintaining and expanding economic potentialities, and not see technological advancement as a threat or ecological preservation as a constraint.</p><p>Human-machine-ecological deep growth&nbsp;is:</p> National Development Strategy for a 21st Statecraft <p>Designing for the 21st Century <br>How does the nature of the transition inform how a National Development Strategy is&nbsp;created?</p><p>A National Development Strategy is a comprehensive umbrella policy for a country that sets a medium to long term vision not only for economic development but also considers economic, social, political and environmental dimensions in combination. It ensures synergy among various policies and programmes that contribute towards stated national priorities, with a view to achieving defined objectives within a given timeframe, and thus becomes a tool to measure ‘progress and success’.</p><p>However, the uncertainty and complexity inherent in transition presents a challenge for development strategies that aim to set defined objectives within set timeframes. Another challenge is how to move towards genuine long-termism in such strategies where, in terms of transition, a responsibility is borne to future generations?</p><p>A strategy needs to be designed in a way that enables it to stay relevant and a distributed driver for change over the time period that it is meant to guide. It cannot become outdated in 4 to 5 years’ time when there has been a change of government with new priorities, in 10 years’ time when long term trends such as migration or rural displacement have changed the social and economic fabric of regions in a country, or in 20 years’ time when the average temperature rise of the planet has created both predictable and additional, unknowable consequences.</p><p>Strategic Principles<br>What are the strategic principles that can guide the long term planning needed for transition?</p><p>We have identified a set of principles that are crucial to enable a twenty-year transition:</p><p>1. Long-Termism (22). A development strategy needs to be embedded in long-termism and build the social covenant necessary to scaffold large scale change. A development strategy needs to build cross-societal agreement about structural transition, as well as civic resilience against the inevitable disruptions in an age of long emergencies, such as loss of jobs as a result of large scale degenerative business models or automation.</p><p>2. Systems Approach (23). The transition required is systemic. We know climate change is fundamentally a symptom of a structural problem in how we govern and how our relationships in the world are governed. In terms of transition policy, we need to be mindful of our relationship with the future, our relationship with the natural and material world, and our relationship with each&nbsp;other.</p><p>3. Embedding Adaptability (24). It is impossible to accurately predict every required policy response to all future challenges. Flexibility needs to be at the heart of any National Development Strategy. We have proposed that a development strategy needs to be a living document (as opposed to a static document) that is able to adjust to real-time data, feedback and evaluation. It needs to be parametric in scope and engineered with contingent capabilities for an unknown&nbsp;world.</p><p>4. Capability Building (25). We are living in a global age of long, interlinked emergencies, with interconnected challenges faced by all actors in society (government, academia, industry and civil society). The dynamic and linked nature of these emergencies will require governments to become enablers for society to work together, building horizontal strategies and collaborative capabilities.</p><p>Any development plan needs to be focused not only on one-to-one, action-reaction responses to strategic risks but build the capabilities of a nation (See Figure 3). Some design questions include:</p>  How do we build a shared language and contextual framework of the future, i.e. a whole of society approach?  How do we bring more sections of society into political decision-making in an age of long emergencies (from how we decide to use our land and resources today to acting in a crisis tomorrow)?  How do we build capacity for an agile, democratic state when all our institutions are designed for linear, waterfall orchestration (26)?  How do we create and regulate markets for infinite games (for the purpose of maintaining) as opposed to finite games (for the purpose of gaining/winning)?  How do we build the imagination, invention and innovation capacity of the whole of&nbsp;society?  How do we build the distributed and decentralised sense making capacity of the whole of&nbsp;society?  How do we build new public accounting capacity for long-termism, which uses methods and practices informing such liabilities, and thereby invite appropriate investment theses?  <p>5. Funding.Traditional public finance frameworks rely heavily on ex-ante cost-benefit analysis (27), leaving little room for dynamic spillover analysis (i.e. a policy intervention can have ripple effects throughout the system, beyond what any direct cost-benefit analysis could estimate). Equally, these frameworks are stuck in annual budget cycles, struggling to unlock long-term patterns of behaviour and fundamental shortfalls in capital provision for the challenges ahead. Critical sectors such as education and health deliver outcomes with significant spillover effects, and these require sustained financing.</p><p>Key considerations for any National Development Strategy geared for transition are:</p>  Building the fundamental financial innovation capacity to address the scale of challenge that we face such as enabling investment in and accounting for intangible asset creation;  Addressing the bias towards short-termism in financing. As ecological degradation and technological risks become a reality, we no longer have the luxury of time to treat the future as a distant outpost. How can we create new instruments, mechanisms and vehicles that can invest over longer time frames, maintain the flexibility to adapt to new information, invest in the institutional deep code experimentation necessary, invest vertically in portfolios spanning deep culture change to new institutional infrastructures to accelerate the transition?  Building the capacity for the decentralised capital formation necessary to address society’s complex nature of needs. We also need to simultaneously tackle the disbursement of central government funding to municipal authorities, an the issue that most nations demonstrate an over-reliance on;  Building the institutional capacity to code and recode — a 21st century form of capital for operating with uncertainty, inclusion and sustainability;  Building new capacities and protocols of decision&nbsp;making;  Enabling investment in and accounting for intangible asset creation (such as trust, mental health and social cohesion). The transition requires us to build new capabilities for resilience, adaptability, creativity, self-learning, self-development and self-renewal. Outcomes-based funding still struggles to capture the intangible benefits of programmes, and the conditions attached to funding needs to create the space for&nbsp;this.  Building new mechanisms of inclusive governance and transparency attached to funding to ensure integrity and accountability;  Building the transition pathways to gradually shift donor funding to more sustainable and longitude means of financing.

The infinite game — there is only one — includes any authentic interaction, from touching to culture, that changes rules, plays with boundaries and exists solely for the purpose of continuing the game.

*Check out the Holdersland x Urbit collection: [holders.land/urbit](https://holders.land/urbit)*

We sat down recently with Haleek Maul to discuss the current state of NFTs and the future of Urbit IDs and digital communities.

Are Urbit IDs NFTs? Sure, they're ERC-721 non-fungible tokens which you can buy on OpenSea—but to be clear, we made them way back before the word "NFT" had entered mainstream consciousness. An Urbit ID is a number that is used to generate both a phonetic name and an avatar (what we call [sigils](https://urbit.org/blog/creating-sigils)), but it is so much more than your average NFT—it is a key to an entire digital world.

We built Urbit IDs for digital communities and the people they’re made of. An Urbit ID is a decentralized and pseudonymous identity perfect for your collective, commune, squad, team, or DAO. Unlike most addresses or social identities, you own your Urbit ID like you own your crypto. Your Discord handle might be free for now, but as the saying goes, if it’s free then you’re the product. On Urbit your ID is actually yours and you pay for it up front. You can log into third party apps or software without ever relinquishing control of your data. What is yours stays with you. IDs themselves can be owned collectively—there are already DAOs on Urbit who jointly own stars and galaxies.

Urbit IDs are evolving and generative. They’re generative because some IDs spawn additional NFTs which themselves can be bought and sold. For instance, each star can spawn 65,535 planets, and each galaxy can spawn 255 stars. The network itself is evolving, meaning that the network can be upgraded via a majority vote by galaxy holders. Urbit IDs and the Ubit network itself are inherently dynamic.

At Urbit, we support communities of all kinds. We recently granted Holdersland ten Urbit IDs: four stars and six planets to be auctioned off. Haleek Maul (his Urbit ID is `~fosmex-hocmel`) will be creating custom artwork for each of the sigils. The proceeds of the auction will help support Holdersland in bringing blockchain technologies to the Caribbean. The auction will go live on September 16th, 2021 on [holders.land/urbit](https://holders.land/urbit).

Without further ado, here’s Haleek Maul.

---

**Tell us a little bit about yourself and Holdersland.**

Sure. My name is Haleek Maul and I’m a multi-disciplinary artist. I was born in America and came to Barbados when I was three years old. I’ve been making music since 2007. I put out my first debut project in 2012 and since then it has been a process of creating art from the stuff flowing through my mind.

Holdersland is a digital extension of my artistic project—a way of creating change in the world around me. When I was younger, there weren’t many artists like me coming from Barbados. I was into a lot of niche electronic and club music and felt alienated from the larger conversation. Holdersland is a way to help creative people in the Caribbean connect with like-minded people around the world, especially using new technologies like blockchain. So I founded Holdersland in 2020 when I left my record label after four years. I felt like music institutions was archaic and didn’t feed into my other artistic practices. I wanted to create an institution that captured the full creative practice—all the way from creating to selling. Most importantly, I wanted to get artists from Barbados and the Caribbean involved in global conversations around art and technology.

**What exactly is Holdersland?**

It’s a company centered around Caribbean intellectual property. We’re trying to help people get connected with new web3 technologies, especially artists. Holdersland is an aggregator that helps connects those who are interested in new technology with those those who actually develop it.

For example, there is a lot of math that underlies music. Part of our project is to extract these mathematical principles and see how they can help generate new forms of art that can be widely distributed. So we’re working to build our own projects and work with users to adopt some of these new technologies. It’s a community of people centered around these values. We plan to implement voting, governance, and incentive structures into the community soon.

**What do you think is the link between your two main interests: music and technology?**

I’ve always been interested in technology. Anyone who has made music in the last twenty years has had to get involved with tech. Especially if you’re a producer. There are many young kids who are downloading music software and messing around with it, and in the process becoming knowledgeable about music production and design. Science and math live right beside art.

I was also into web development when I was a teenager and was very interested in how the internet worked. This led into the work I’m doing with Holdersland. Technology, more often than not, is concerned with collaboration and communication. But in order to develop new technologies we often need to talk about nitty-gritty details. This requires detailed knowledge of particular technologies.

**What is the great hope or promise with new decentralized technologies like blockchain or Urbit?**

They lower the barrier to communication and trade. Especially for countries like Barbados, we don’t have access to the world market. But now with these networks, and assets like NFTs, we can engage in commerce without borders. It allows new entrants to join the market.

It also allows new financial relationships and funding structures to emerge. Rather than have a few people contribute $20k, you can have hundreds of people contribute $100. Once again, this lowers the entry for people to invest is early-stage projects. This changes the way that companies build and ship products.

Brain drain is when skilled workers move abroad for more profitable employment. These new technologies allow native Carribeans to stay where they are while earning money. Using these new technologies, the Carribean can prosper while not losing its unique character and cultural identity. Crypto is permanently going to change the distribution of wealth and culture around the world.

Discord is a fine community solution, but it’s not ideal. There’s an endless array of plugins and dependencies that makes Discord unstable. However, it is a good mixture of an office, a storefront, and a club: I can do my work, sell assets, and just have fun. Communities are important. People naturally want to be in communities, we just need a better solution than Discord. Especially one that’s crypto-native and allows for commerce. Urbit is a one-stop shop that could fill that gap.

**What is the collaboration between Holdersland and Urbit that’s happening this week?**

I’m producing some custom sigil artwork for a set of stars and planets. Both the Urbit assets and artwork will be auctioned off together. The proceeds from the event will go towards creating a community music studio here in Barbados and technology education around the island.

A lot of people here in Barbados don’t even understand what crypto is. A lot of the work being done around this project is to raise awareness about the potentials of this new technology. I want this to be a general springboard for the Caribbean to gain greater technological literacy. That literacy is an important step for lower-income people to drastically change their situation.

**What are you looking forward to talking about on the New World Energy panel at Assembly 2021?**

I want to talk about how to migrate communities onto Urbit. How to use Urbit as a new platform for niche cultures found around the current internet. Also the great strength and power provided by Urbit’s digital identities.

NFTs can be very powerful—there are a lot of possible applications of a unique digital asset. It’s already dissolved geographical boundaries which will help countries to export their intellectual products freely. Countries need first to gain knowledge around these technologies and their economies will follow.

**Thanks for chatting!**

See you at Assembly 2021!

SEC chief Gary Gensler closes in on&nbsp;crypto Gary Gensler, center, answers questions during a June 18, 2018, hearing of the House Committee on Agriculture on potential federal oversight of cryptocurrencies. Photo: House Committee on Agriculture<p>With the world’s decision makers chilling at their summer homes, the last week of August before Labor Day weekend is typically one of the quietest of the&nbsp;year.</p><p>But new SEC boss Gary Gensler has been burning the midnight&nbsp;oil.</p><p>First, there was this ominous interview w<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fb126d79-2e60-4002-8aba-b08887fca609">/the&nbsp;FT</a>:</p><blockquote>“At about $2tn of value worldwide, it’s at the level and the nature that if it’s going to have any relevance five and 10 years from now, it’s going to be within a public policy framework,” he said. “History just tells you, it doesn’t last long outside. Finance is about trust, ultimately.”</blockquote><blockquote>Gensler expressed disappointment with the industry’s response to his suggestion that trading platforms register with the SEC on the grounds that a sufficient number of cryptocurrencies qualify as securities.</blockquote><blockquote>“Talk to us, come in,” he said. “There are a lot of platforms that are in operation today that would do better engaging and instead there is a bit of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. begging for forgiveness rather than asking for permission.”</blockquote><p>Now, there’s nothing actually wrong with that statement — aside from hints of a potential threat. For crypto to grow up and truly be relevant and useful, it does indeed need to work symbiotically within a public policy framework. Part of the issue here is that, rather than presenting a clear framework, the SEC has so far regulated via enforcement.</p><p>For Gensler and the SEC, it’s a bit of a pickle. If you’ve ever played chess, you’d know that a classic rookie error is to overcommit your pawns too early. Better to let the game play out so you can better assess your structure. The thing with pawns is that, once you move them forward, you can never move them back. Overcommitted pawns create weaknesses in your set up that your opponent can then&nbsp;target.</p><p>That’s why even answering basic questions such as — Is Ethereum a security? — proves challenging to impossible at the moment. It’s one pawn move too far at this stage of the game. Leaving those questions unanswered leaves more leeway for the SEC’s future enforcement actions.</p><p>Now, it’s easy to put all the blame here on Gensler’s SEC. The reality is that the sort of clarity required will eventually have to come from Congress.</p><p>The crypto space operated for years with little oversight. It’s too big for that&nbsp;now.</p><p>Speaking of enforcement, the SEC is now going after DeFi in the form of Uniswap, one of the largest DeFi exchanges.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/regulators-investigate-crypto-exchange-developer-uniswap-labs-11630666800?mod=djem10point">the&nbsp;WSJ</a>:</p><blockquote>The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the startup behind one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, as regulators probe further into parts of the digital-asset market that have resisted oversight, according to people familiar with the&nbsp;matter.</blockquote><blockquote>Regulators are examining Uniswap Labs, the main developer of the world’s largest decentralized exchange, called Uniswap, the people said. Enforcement attorneys are seeking information about how investors use Uniswap and how it is marketed, the people&nbsp;said.</blockquote><p>Gensler had spoken about DeFi at Aspen earlier in August. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptos-defi-projects-arent-immune-to-regulation-secs-gensler-says-11629365401?mod=article_inline">The WSJ&nbsp;again</a>:</p><blockquote>But Mr. Gensler, who took over in April, said projects that reward participants with valuable digital tokens or similar incentives could cross a line into activity that should be regulated, no matter how “decentralized” they say they&nbsp;are.</blockquote><blockquote>“There’s still a core group of folks that are not only writing the software, like the open source software, but they often have governance and fees,” Mr. Gensler said. “There’s some incentive structure for those promoters and sponsors in the middle of&nbsp;this.”</blockquote><p>With how DeFi currently works, with users holding and trading assets through a non-custodial wallet, exchanges such as Uniswap don’t have proper AML/KYC procedures in&nbsp;place.</p><p>During this next period of evolution for the DeFi space, various initiatives will start looking toward digital identity solutions in order to comply with existing regulatory frameworks.

This time, we spoke with <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-harbinger-interview-series-alvin-d4252dab97d1">Alvin</a> from our Philippines community who shared his experiences as a Harbinger, being able to learn about the latest developments of Ontology and interacting with community members.  Ontology Harbinger Emilio from our Spanish community, was invited to join a workshop hosted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1433474808281550851?s=20">Blockchain Summit Global</a>. He shared Ontology’s latest progress and had in-depth exchanges with members of the Spanish community.    We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1433512553599193090?s=20">weekly Discord Community Call</a>, led by Humpty Calderon, our Head of Community. He mentioned that Ontology is committed to bringing trust, privacy, and security to Web 3.0 through decentralized identity and&nbsp;data.  We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1432266843348156418?s=20">new Telegram weekly Community Call</a> for the first time, led by Astro, an Ontology Harbinger from our Asian community. He had a lively discussion with community members, focusing on DID applications, ONTO and Ontology EVM&nbsp;TestNet.  As always, we’re active on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a> where you can keep up with our latest developments and community updates.  <p>Global News</p>  ONT Login, the decentralized identity universal login component based on ONT ID and ONT TAG, the batch verification solution have been officially released, forming a complete Ontology DID product matrix together with the on-chain credit score, OScore. The <a href="http://ont.id">ONT.ID</a> website is now live. This product matrix supports comprehensive DID solutions with easy-to-integrate products, friendly to both dApps and traditional web applications.  Ontology partnered with <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-partners-with-4everland-to-accelerate-web-3-0-adoption-dfc658e8ea21">4EVERLAND</a> to accelerate Web 3.0 adoption. Ontology’s primary website, <a href="https://ont.io/">ont.io</a>, has become fully decentralized using 4EVERLAND’s DWeb hosting services. Decentralization of <a href="https://ont.io/">ont.io</a> will facilitate greater security, transparency, and traceability, whilst further improving data processing.    Ontology published its <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1429747737285730304">#WEB3 101</a> Series on domestic and overseas platforms. The thread introduced the decentralized identity solution: ONT ID, OScore, and SAGA, the decentralized data protocol powered by the Ontology blockchain. Ontology provides trust for users with technology, promoting the advent of the Web 3.0&nbsp;era.   Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>The Machine — <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/08/25/how-to-rebuild-trust-in-web-3-0/">How to (re)build trust in Web&nbsp;3.0</a></p><blockquote>As Web 2.0 mined our interests, activity, and online footprints, a focus on growth over trust opened the door to cybercrime, online harassment, and unconscious bias built into the programming. There is a cyber-attack every 39 seconds, more than 40% of U.S. internet users have reported online harassment, and AI recognizes white-skinned men 34% better than dark-skinned women. So, we simply lose our trust in the web where our data is being breached, our safety is threatened, and the technology discriminates against human&nbsp;beings.</blockquote><p>Ontology’s mission is to return control of data and digital identities to the user. In this way, only the user can decide who can access his or her data. This promotes privacy and autonomy, which are severely lacking in the current Web 2.0 era. Ontology’s solution to the Web 2.0 identity problem is ONT ID and OScore. ONT ID is Ontology’s decentralized identity framework that enables users to control their data and decide whether a third-party can access a particular piece of information about them. It protects user privacy and ensures data security, enabling trusted collaboration.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>You can find more details on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> for all of our decentralized solutions across identity and data, or keep up with us on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a>.

Vadim Lander, Symantec Identity Management Security Chief Architect and CTO, Broadcom is to give a presentation entitled <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4604/1" title="The Dawn of Digital IAM"> The Dawn of Digital IAM</a> on Monday, September 13 starting at 17:40 pm at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2021" title="European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021">EIC 2021</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Vadim some questions about his presentation.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>How would you describe the state of identity today? </p>
<p>
I think in the identity management space today, we're seeing a number of challenges. Identity is often called the last perimeter or sometimes the only perimeter and now identity has become a highly critical component of the enterprise architecture. And as enterprises continue to figure out how they need to grow, how they need to compete, how they need to pick up the right kind of IT infrastructure. They're also looking at how to modernize their investment in identity and access management, how to modernize the IM architecture itself, to be able to implement the kinds of experiences that businesses need to deliver to their customers. So that is creating what I would say, a revolution for identity and access management, requiring IAM to be revolutionized, modernized, and then rethought in terms of how does it behave? How it's supposed to integrate, and then how is it helping organizations to create great customer experiences?   </p>

<p><br></p>
<p>How should or could identity evolve?   </p>
<p>
I think identity, for the most part, typically looking at it from three perspectives. One perspective is, how does it help a business create the right user experiences? We, as consumers, as employees, as business partners always want to see 360 of the enterprise, of the organization, and then the organization needs to see 360 of us, of our identities and sometimes we call that omni-channel. So, one dimension that identity has to evolve in is in terms of being able to provide us with capabilities across different channels while maintaining security, while maintaining great user experience, while maintaining the right level of privileges. To ensure that identities get what they need and then enterprises handle this security the right way.  </p>
<p>The second point is about being able to bridge the question of entitlements. We've always, as an industry, struggled with what is an entitlement then? How do you properly align the use of the entitlement with the management of entitlement? And so this is the “I” in the IAM as Identity, and the "A” in the IAM is access and being able to fuse the identity aspect of who can do what, and then the access aspect of what are they supposed to be able to do, is really the question. And, we're seeing now steps you need - IAM architecture - to be able to fuse these into fewer data models, simpler data models, and easier to administer, and easier to manage this kind of relationship.  </p>
<p>And third is, I would say, it's the architecture itself, how do we practice identity management? How do we run identity management? Where does it run? So being able to create an environment where identity management itself as an IT architecture can take advantage of modern compute infrastructure, of modern cloud or hybrid cloud environments, and being able to connect the dots across the extended IT fabric of the organization. So the “I” in itself as an architecture is now undergoing changes to be able to take advantage of the latest advances in compute fabrics.   </p>

<p><br></p>
<p>What should be done to make digital IAM a reality?  </p>
<p>
I think it starts with the understanding of what are the goals? What are the business drivers here? Are we looking at expanding or making the user experience great across Omni channel? So, we need to help with the modern way to authenticate identities. The passwordless starts to come into the picture, but not just the passwordless, but also the right level of risk management. Every IAM decision that has to be done with some form of risk being measured and acted upon - and this is exactly, for example - where zero trust principles, zero trust computing comes into the picture. So you have to understand exactly “where are the business needs”?  </p>
<p>How do we help users have much better user experiences? Where do we need to invest to create a more secure and while making it more agile environment? And how are we able to delegate these capabilities to the line of business, to the application teams that have to be able to ramp up their application environments, get the new business apps out the door. So, the line of business teams, the application teams, the IAM program teams and the IT infrastructure have to work together to make this a reality now. </p>

<p><br></p>
<p> Is Identity Fabrics the key to digital transformation and the future of IAM?  </p>
<p>
I think so. I think what we mean when we say identity fabrics is, we mean availability of capabilities. We mean on demand availability of identity, dial tone, which doesn't necessarily mean identity as a service, in terms of SaaS infrastructure. But what it does mean is being able to incorporate identity and security capabilities into the fabric of your applications, no matter where those applications may be now that we don't have a perimeter anymore. Identity is the perimeter. And we need to make sure that the decisions we make regarding identity, regarding who you are, what you're able to do, what are your privileges? Those decisions can be incorporated into the fabric of your applications and that requires use of standards, that require use of APIs. So, I would say now the identity has to be a hundred percent API driven, so they can be incorporated into the fabric of your environment. And that's really where the notion of fabric comes into the picture, meaning that you can put together these scenarios and then have the right level of identity and security products as the fabric of your apps. </p>


<p><br></p>
<p>  Could you give us a sneak peek into your presentation: “The Dawn of Digital IAM”?  </p>
<p>
Yes. So, I'll just mention a couple of things. One is I'll be talking about identity and access management in terms of how it's being modernized. So, how do I think it used to be modernized? What are we, as an organization, doing to help our customers modernize their identity and access management infrastructure? How does this relate to zero trust principles? Because zero trust - being able to incorporate risk into everything we do and making sure that the identity management itself can be seen as an omni-channel, continuous fabric of identity capabilities - really part of this new architecture that IAM used to deliver on. We are working on that. We are working on helping our customers modernize the environments. And, I do believe that the fabrics concept, and the notion of identity services really become key in this modern world. </p>

 Let’s talk about digital identity with Margus Pala, Founder and CEO at eID Easy, and Johan Nyman, Project Coordinator at Åbo Akademi University. 
<p>In our 50th episode, Margus and Johan discuss eSignatures. Coming from Estonia and Finland, they explore the use (and potential future use) of simple, advanced and qualified eSignatures in two of the world’s most digitally advanced countries. They also delve into how we can standardise the use of eSignatures in Europe, and advice for business owners on what to ask from an eSignature provider.</p>
 <p>Margus Pala</p> 
<p>Margus is from the world’s most digitally advanced country, Estonia, and has seen the future many years ahead of most other countries. He started his professional career as a programming teacher before being part of multiple start-ups, including one unicorn – Playtech. He is also an officer in the Estonian army’s National Guard Cyber Unit and has a master’s degree in Cyber&nbsp;Security. For the last 5 years he has been running <a href="https://eideasy.com/">eID Easy</a>, whose mission is to help everyone benefit from the future of digital identity and electronic signatures – not by breeding faster horses, but going to a whole new level.</p>
<p>Find Margus on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/MargusPala">@MargusPala</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/e_id_easy">@e_id_easy</a> and on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/smartman/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
 <p>Johan Nyman</p> 
<p>Johan’s interest in digital identity, and specifically electronic signatures, is manifested in two areas: 1) the citizens’ perspective; how citizens can take advantage of national PKI (public key infrastructure) available on their ID cards to produce and use qualified electronic signatures, and 2) the public sector; how organisations working within the public realm, e.g. universities, can use national PKI for issuing e-signed documents, and also how they can raise their awareness and knowledge to handle qualified e-signatures in incoming correspondence from persons using e-signatures. He works as a project manager in university administration at Åbo Akademi, in Turku/Åbo, Finland.</p>

  <p>When it comes to code quality and code security, <a href="https://www.sonarqube.org/">SonarQube</a> is your teammate! This analysis tool is pretty straightforward to use, especially with some help from Docker.</p>

<p>In this post, I’ll show you how to run a Docker container with SonarQube to analyze the code of a simple ASP.NET Core 3.0 application. Code analysis is a critical component of app development because it can identify security issues and other tricky bugs that might be overlooked until unexpected behavior impacts end-users. Let’s take a look.</p>

 What Is SonarQube? 

<p>In addition to evaluating the overall health of an application, SonarQube can highlight issues and bugs in the code. With a Quality Gate in place, you can Clean As You Code and improve code quality systematically. Even more, this tool facilitates planning and allocating tasks for a group of programmers.</p>

<p>SonarQube can help measure progress easily and validate the importance of technical work that’s difficult to view or demonstrate, especially with non-technical customers. Let’s explore some of the benefits of SonarQube and how you can implement it in your workflow.</p>

 Key Features of SonarQube 

<p>Before we get started on the tutorial, here are some of the capabilities of SonarQube that make it useful for automating code review in .NET Core:</p>
 
   Quality Gate lets you set an acceptable quality standard for merging branches and releasing applications to production. 
   Code analysis is presented graphically and transparently. Programmers and non-programmers alike gain visibility into coding progress. 
   You gain the insights needed to analyze bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code duplication. 
   Quickly prioritize code changes and improvements. 
   SonarQube doesn’t just pinpoint predefined code quality issues. If you wish, you can create custom rules to monitor specific issues. 
   Support for more than 27 programming languages. SonarQube continues to offer a free and open source Community Edition, along with several Editions for commercial use. 
 

 Prepare the SonarQube Environment 

 Install Java and Docker 

<p>To use SonarQube, first prepare your environment.  The requirements are pretty simple, a Java SDK for starters. We also recommend using Docker; a popular approach nowadays. If it’s your first experience with Docker and you have doubts or questions,  there are many excellent online learning resources including <a>A Developer’s Guide to Docker</a> on this blog.</p>

 
   
    <p>Since SonarScanner uses Java, you’ll need to add a Java SDK (Java 11 or later) to <code>PATH</code>, and you’ll add <code>JAVA_HOME</code> to your system variables.
Download <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/">the right version of the Java SDK</a> for your system. During the process, you should accept the default settings. This way all required elements are added to the system variables.</p>
   
   
    <p>Docker provides a popular way to run many solutions without huge effort. You can <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/">download Docker</a> and install it by following the instructions included in the link. The install process is straightforward and you should not anticipate any difficulties.</p>
   
 

 Set Up a Sample Application 

<p>You can use any application you like, but a <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/dotnet-sonarqube-example">sample app</a> comes along with this post. If you choose to work with your own project, simply skip this step.</p>

<p>Next, we need an application to analyze with SonarQube. You can use any application you choose, or you can run the example app I built for this tutorial:</p>

<p>Run</p>

   <code>$ git clone https://github.com/oktadev/dotnet-sonarqube-example
</code>   
<p>And now we’re ready to see what SonarQube can do.</p>

 Analyze Your Project with SonarQube 

 Run SonarQube on Docker 
<p>Start the SonarQube server with the following command:</p>

   <code>docker run -d --name sonarqube -p 9000:9000 -p 9092:9092 sonarqube
</code>   
<p>After you log in the first time (initial credentials are login: “admin” with password “admin”), you’ll be prompted to change the password.</p>

 Install SonarScanner for .NET Core 

 
   Download <a href="https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-scanner-msbuild/releases/download/4.7.1.2311/sonar-scanner-msbuild-4.7.1.2311-netcoreapp2.0.zip">SonarScanner</a> from GitHub.
You don’t have to run analyses with user credentials, you can generate tokens instead. For  quick setup in this tutorial, we won’t cover the token approach, but you can learn more about <a href="https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/user-guide/user-token">user tokens</a> in the SonarQube documentation. 
   Add the path of the extracted SonarScanner folder to your <code>PATH</code> environment variable. 
   Run the command: 
 

   <code>  dotnet tool install --global dotnet-sonarscanner
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE:You can <a href="https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/scan/sonarscanner-for-msbuild/">read more about this setup process</a> in SonarQube documentation.</p>
</blockquote>

 Analyze the Code 

<p>To run SonarScanner, run the following commands:</p>

   <code>dotnet sonarscanner begin /k:"project-key" /d:sonar.login=admin /d:sonar.password=admin
dotnet build &lt;path_to_solution.sln&gt;
dotnet sonarscanner end /d:sonar.login=admin /d:sonar.password=admin
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: Remember to replace “path_to_solution” and “password” with correct ones for your example.</p>
</blockquote>

 Analysis Results in SonarQube 

<p>Take a look at the main view of SonarQube by going to <code>http://localhost:9000</code>. The configured Docker container is exposed on that port. This view presents general information, such as counters for bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells or number of code duplications. It’s the simplest view - no-frills metrics.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You’ll find more detailed reports in the Measures section.</p>

<p></p>

<p>For example, it’s possible to determine how many bugs each project file contains and preview the problematic lines of code.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The Issues section lets you go deeper into analysis of the source code. SonarQube reports on all possible problems: from minor issues to critical bugs. You can explore every issue in the code that you should take into consideration, along with an explanation of the issue and an estimated time for solving it.</p>

<p></p>

 Additional Configuration and SonarQube Customization 

<p>SonarQube will run on almost any stack. For this reason, you may notice some unwanted notifications. Pre-set rules may not work correctly in all frameworks, and may not know how to handle all file extensions.</p>

<p>Adding custom rules and configuration is a straightforward process, similar to excluding files or paths in GitHub. You can apply custom rules globally for your system or locally for a single project. To be precise, you can:</p>

 
   Completely ignore some files or directories 
   Exclude files/directories from Issues detection (via specific rules or all of them),  but analyze all other aspects 
   Exclude files/directories from Duplications detection but analyze all other aspects 
   Exclude files/directories from Coverage calculations but analyze all other aspects 
 

<p>In order to make adjustments, go to
Administration &gt; General Settings &gt; Analysis Scope (global settings) or
Project Settings &gt; General Settings &gt; Analysis Scope (local configuration).</p>

<p>You can learn more about <a href="https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/project-administration/narrowing-the-focus/">project administration</a> in the SonarQube documentation.</p>

 Code Analysis Matters 

<p>We just explored how to set up SonarQube quickly and without too much effort. The solution we stepped through in this tutorial was based on .NET, however, you can easily apply it to over 20 other popular programming languages.</p>

<p>As a developer, it’s important to stay focused on code quality, especially with tools like SonarQube that make it easier than ever to analyze code and learn best practices for code security and resilience. In the workplace, it’s also essential for developers to produce code that integrates gracefully with the work of others—and with SonarQube as a teammate, coding can become even more of a collaborative team sport.  😉</p>

 Over 1.5 Million Users Now Managing Their Digital Identity Using ONT ID, Ontology’s Decentralized Identity Application  To date, ONT ID has been integrated into a number of leading products through partnerships with Mercedes Benz manufacturer Daimler Mobility, Microworkers, ROCKI and many&nbsp;more. <p>Reflecting a major endorsement for decentralized identity, <a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a>, the project bringing trust, privacy, and security to Web 3.0 through decentralized identity and data solutions, announced today that <a href="http://ont.id/">ONT ID</a>, its decentralized digital identity application, has surpassed 1.5 million&nbsp;users.</p><p>ONT ID uses blockchain and cryptographic technology to connect people, data, and services in a decentralized way. It allows users to take charge of their digital identity by giving them control of how and when their information is shared, and with whom. Centralized systems have repeatedly failed to safeguard user data, with more data breaches and hacks announced every day. As such, users are embracing blockchain solutions to protect their digital identities.</p><p>Reflecting that trends in the wider crypto ecosystem drive uptake in different areas of the blockchain sector, ONT ID experienced a spike in sign-ups during the crypto bull run in mid June of this year. The application’s user base is predominantly based in Asia (50%), reflecting a strong appetite for decentralized digital identity applications there, followed by the United States&nbsp;(7%).</p><p>Companies across the globe have embraced ONT ID. Ontology has <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/welcome-home-is-now-approved-f8aada08a1bc">partnered</a> with Mercedes Benz-manufacturer Daimler Mobility to develop ‘Welcome Home’, an in-car personalization and management solution that uses ONT ID to store drivers’ in-car preferences. Pushing social good through a <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/microworkers-integrates-ontologys-onto-wallet-to-facilitate-additional-payment-options-for-workers-1163291af76c">partnership</a> with global freelancing marketplace leader <a href="https://www.microworkers.com/">MicroWorkers</a>, ONT ID is also being used to assist workers to receive rewards and gain greater access to capital. More recently, Ontology <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ontology+rocki&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enIE945IE945&amp;oq=ontology+rocki&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i61l2.2769j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">partnered</a> with <a href="https://rocki.app/">ROCKI</a>, a next-generation music streaming service and NFT platform built on <a href="https://www.binance.org/en/smartChain">Binance Smart Chain</a> (BSC), to use its decentralized identity solutions to prevent bad actors from impersonating artists and help buyers avoid purchasing inauthentic NFTs.</p><p>Ontology’s interoperable tools and multi-virtual machine support give developers the tools they need to build upon ONT ID. Businesses don’t need to discard their existing systems — Ontology’s decentralized identity and data protocol is a complementary layer that integrates seamlessly with existing systems and ONT ID’s software development kits (SDK) can be integrated in&nbsp;minutes.</p><p>Commenting on the milestone Li Jun, Founder of Ontology, said:</p><blockquote>The fact that over 1.5 million users have embraced decentralized identity through ONT ID reflects the significant appetite for blockchain solutions that safeguard user privacy in the midst of ongoing scamming, identity fraud, data leaks and ransomware attacks. Our upgraded product will make it easier for developers to utilize ONT ID and develop novel use cases that feed into the wider decentralized identity ecosystem.</blockquote><p>To facilitate its ever expanding user base, ONT ID has undergone an upgrade that will improve the user experience, whilst also making it easier for developers to build sophisticated applications and real world use cases through ONT ID. The Ontology products now integrated with ONT ID&nbsp;include:</p>  <a href="https://login.ont.id/">ONT Login</a>, a new feature that makes trustless universal authentication for websites and applications possible, allowing users to log into multiple platforms without having to remember passwords.  <a href="https://tag.ont.id/">ONT TAG</a>, Ontology’s new decentralized solution for online identity verification, which helps applications access users’ verifiable credentials, such as KYC verification, whilst also allowing users to protect their privacy by authorizing information independently.  <a href="https://www.ocredit.io/">OScore</a>, a DeFi credit score, used to measure creditworthiness, which is calculated using different types of on-chain transaction data.  <p>Humpty Calderon, Head of Community at Ontology, added:</p><blockquote>It is incredible to see that over 1.5 million users are now registered with ONT ID. To put this into context, that’s over a fifth of the population of Singapore! As more and more people seek to protect their identities using our solutions, we will work hard to incubate a community that supports their needs and takes into account their feedback and views on our products as we progress.</blockquote><p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 Digital Identity for Development — and protection Afghan election commission workers transfer data from biometric devices to the main server in Kabul, October 2019. Photograph: Mohammad Ismail/Reuters — from the Guardian’s version of this&nbsp;story<p>On August 27th, the Taliban<a href="https://nypost.com/2021/08/27/taliban-kill-squad-hunting-afghans-with-americas-biometric-data/"> boasted of using US digital identity technology to hunt down Afghans who had worked with the international coalition</a>. This poses a huge threat to all Afghans who are recorded in these identification systems, and should be a wake-up call to all those working on digital identity and digital public infrastructure for development.</p><p>The Taliban’s claim was made just days before the formal departure of the coalition forces and the Taliban takeover of the Afghan government. In addition to the US military’s<a href="https://theconversation.com/the-taliban-may-have-access-to-the-biometric-data-of-civilians-who-helped-the-u-s-military-166475"> Handheld Interagency Identity Detection Equipment (HIIDE, biometrics devices)&nbsp;,</a> the Taliban takeover means they also have access to and control over the digital identification systems and technologies that had been built through international aid support&nbsp;. These include the<a href="https://asan.gov.af/Eng/"> e-Tazkira</a>, a biometric identity card used by Afghanistan’s National Statistics and Information Authority, which includes fingerprints, iris scans, and photographs, as well as<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-election-technology-idUSKBN1WD0DM"> voter registration databases</a> and the<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/08/30/1033941/afghanistan-biometric-databases-us-military-40-data-points/"> Afghan Personnel and Pay System (APPS), used by both the Afghan Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Defense to pay the national army and police</a>. As a result, many Afghans are<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/afghanistan-tech-conflict/afghans-scramble-to-delete-digital-history-evade-biometrics-idUSL8N2PO1FH"> “frantically going through phones to delete messages they have sent, music they’ve listened to &amp; pictures they’ve taken,” BBC reporter Sana Safi wrote on Twitter on August 15.</a> For those in official databases, particularly the APPS, user deletion is not an&nbsp;option.</p><p>What does this situation mean for Afghanistan, for Afghans, and for the wider international community working on digital identification for development?</p><p>For Afghanistan and Afghans, it means that the Taliban have sensitive personally identifiable information that they have said they will use to target those they deem enemies or threats. Of course, these databases are not the only way they might be identified — <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/26/us-officials-provided-taliban-with-names-of-americans-afghan-allies-to-evacuate-506957">US officials gave the Taliban names and details of American and Afghan allies to assist in evacuation efforts</a>, while<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-staff-left-documents-afghans-working-them-british-embassy-kabul-the-times-2021-08-26/"> the UK had to rescue families of Afghan embassy staff whose names had been left behind at the embassy</a>. Quite apart from anything else, the evacuation has shown how badly information security has been handled by the coalition — another reason for an expanded immigration offer to all&nbsp;Afghans.</p><p>For those working on digital identification for development and more broadly, what are the lessons? For a start, it is a wake-up call to remind us that that development benefits of identification systems, enshrined in the Sustainable Development Goal 16.9 — Right to Legal Identity — should not come at the expense of individual safety. To date, the international development community’s efforts have focused on adoption and inclusion — the fastest and cheapest ways to make everyone visible to the state in order to manage access to rights and entitlements.</p><p>The benefits of inclusion in digital identification systems are well known. Identification is<a href="https://statelessnessandcitizenshipreview.com/index.php/journal/article/view/187"> key to obtaining legal status, recognition, and associated rights and entitlements</a>. The World Bank notes that<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/immersive-story/2019/08/14/inclusive-and-trusted-digital-id-can-unlock-opportunities-for-the-worlds-most-vulnerable"> without some form of legal identity people are unable to access critical healthcare and social services, enroll in school, open a bank account, obtain a mobile phone, get a job, vote in an election, or register a business in the formal sector — along with other basic services, rights, and opportunities that would empower them to improve their live</a>s. The World Bank also notes that <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/immersive-story/2019/08/14/inclusive-and-trusted-digital-id-can-unlock-opportunities-for-the-worlds-most-vulnerable">women are disproportionately less likely to have official proof of identity; women, refugees, stateless persons, people with disabilities, and people living in rural and remote areas often face the greatest hurdles to obtaining official&nbsp;IDs.</a></p><p>Digital Identity and&nbsp;Risk</p><p>Despite growing calls from a number of organisations for a greater focus on the risks of new digital technologies, the issue of digital identity and protection has not received the same level of attention and access and inclusion, in part because<a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/20539517211006744"> debate is polarised between advocates and critics,</a>. For example, Privacy International have long<a href="https://privacyinternational.org/campaigns/demanding-identity-systems-our-terms"> advocated for greater attention to security</a>&nbsp;,including on<a href="https://privacyinternational.org/report/4529/biometrics-and-counter-terrorism-case-study-iraq-and-afghanistan"> Afghanistan’s biometrics programmes</a>, and Access Now’s campaign on rationales for digital identity have pushed particular security and privacy concerns. At a higher level, initiatives such as the World Bank–hosted<a href="https://id4d.worldbank.org/principles"> Principles on Identification for Sustainable Development</a> and the<a href="http://good-id.org/"> Omidyar Network–supported Good ID initiative</a> (which Caribou Digital helped initiate) assert a normative approach founded on the belief that digital ID can ‘be good for all.’ However, as analyses of the risks and dangers of digital identitifcation emerge — <a href="https://blogs.prio.org/2021/08/contingency-planning-in-the-digital-age-biometric-data-of-afghans-must-be-reconsidered/">such as Jacobsen and Steinacker’s in-depth perspective on humanitarian and military biometrics in Afghanistan</a> — concerns about the downsides of these technologies are only going to grow as the contexts in which digital identification systems are deployed increasingly<a href="https://www.kerenweitzberg.com/post/the-future-of-biometrics-not-fintech-rationing-universal-basic-income-border-enforcement"> face the threats of climate change, inequality, and conflict</a>, leading to political instability.</p><p>Digital identity systems are like all technologies — they are<a href="https://www.kerenweitzberg.com/post/the-future-of-biometrics-not-fintech-rationing-universal-basic-income-border-enforcement"> neither good nor bad, but never neutral,</a> and they<a href="https://www.kentarotoyama.org/papers/Toyama%202011%20iConference%20-%20Technology%20as%20Amplifier.pdf"> amplify the power of those that control them</a>. No technology is going to change the intent of actors such as the Taliban to target those they wish to find. In the face of these inevitable political risks, the deployment of digital identification systems needs to get smarter about understanding the political interests and risks that shape the contexts in which identification systems are used — our<a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/kenyas-identification-ecosystem-7cbc2ee27"> ID Ecosystem Mapping tool</a> supports risk assessment arising from the deployment of digital identification systems.</p><p>Strategies for Protection</p><p>But even where political risks are identified, identification systems are still going to be rolled out, so we must start paying more attention to emerging approaches to data management and technologies that might mitigate the misuse of these technologies by bad&nbsp;actors.</p><p>For example, we need to instil a greater focus on the ‘data minimisation principle,’ as outlined in the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/data-minimization-principle/"> the idea that one should only collect and retain that personal data which is necessary</a>, and not collect more information than is needed. This approach contrasts with the<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-safrica-tech-rights-idUSKBN29C2UL"> South African proposal from earlier this year to collect all sorts of biometric and other data</a>, including from&nbsp;babies.</p><p>We also need to move away from centralised data collection approaches, and instead focus on decentralised approaches that place greater control over data in the hands of individuals. For example, there could be a greater emphasis on decentrasiling the storage of sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) through the use of<a href="https://blogs.icrc.org/law-and-policy/2019/10/18/innovation-protection-icrc-biometrics-policy/"> smart cards that store data, rather than dumb cards with centralised data storage — an approach advocated for by the International Committe of the Red Cross</a>.&nbsp;.</p><p>We can also learn from efforts to decentralise data storage and control — what some call federated or self-sovereign identification systems. Countries such as<a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/suche/germany-and-spain-and-join-forces-on-the-development-of-a-cross-border-decentralised-digital-identity-ecosystem-1947302"> Germany, Spain</a>, and the<a href="https://www.blockchain-lab.org/trust/"> Netherlands</a> are developing digital wallet–based identification systems to hold verified credentials, while the EU’s <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/coronavirus-response/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans/eu-digital-covid-certificate_en">COVID-19 vaccine passport</a> employs a similar&nbsp;model.</p><p>Established technologies such as<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/zero-knowledge-proofs/"> Zero Knowledge Proofs</a> and emerging innovations such as encrypted hashes of sensitive information can support greater protection over personal data. For example,<a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/perspectives/2020/signed-sealed-encrypted-this-digital-id-is-all-yours/"> Mastercard and TrustStamp’s</a> encrypted hash of biometric data makes it almost impossible to identify individuals without Mastercard’s proprietary algorithm&nbsp;; humanitarian organisations are developing similar technologies.</p><p>But while there are scattered, isolated examples of efforts to develop better approaches and innovations to better protect people and their data, there is no established, independent body of knowledge and expertise addressing these issues. There is a need for independent, critical research and advisory services on this critically important topic. There is a wealth of expertise, dispersed around the world in various governments, companies and associations, in niche newsletter groups, and online publications that could usefully contribute to thinking and policy positions, particularly for development donors, to support decision-making and investment that can help advance the benefits of digital identification whilst ensuring that their risks are mitigated.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/digital-identity-for-development-and-protection-d92716f24bb6">Digital Identity for Development — and protection</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Kay some questions about Kantara’s planned workshop.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Which audience do you hope to attract to the Kantara workshop? </p>
<p>
We really hope that a diverse audience will be attracted to the Kantara workshop. The reason I say that is - we're very focused, obviously in the work we do around identity, around assurance programs, around really developing what we recommend the part of standards that are used internationally. And then also taking that the next step and making sure that those standards are implemented in the identity products that are available in the field. So I hope that we will attract people with a variety of interests who want to learn about - what are some of the cutting edge issues, especially around identity standards that we are trying to tackle - much of which there is – it's all new work that's happening.</p>
<p> So I hope that people will be interested for that reason. And I also hope that people who are interested in implementing good protocols, procedures, products that balance privacy and security, and are really held to a very high standard, will also be interested to find out what we're doing, to help those in the field, to really be able to manage that, because it's a tricky balance. We have a program with a lot of integrity that I hope people will be interested to learn more about.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>What are Kantara's goals? </p>
<p>
The mission of Kantara is to grow and fulfill the market for trustworthy use of identity and personal data. And that's a very broad mission. But to do that, some of the things you see in our mission are words like trust, grow, fulfilling what the market needs. So, those are kind of areas that we focus on. We do this in a couple of ways. One, we have what I would describe as a stellar, really a remarkable assurance program, which provides companies and governments with the ability to trust services that are held to a set of service criteria. So that's really important. The other goal is that we have been a trust framework provider since about 2010. So we have accredited assessors. We have approved service providers, it's all based on agreed service assessment criteria.   </p>
<p>So, it's a very structured program and in some ways it's very tough. But that said, it really is a program with so much integrity and it really provides the ability for a third-party assessment to help those who want to provide services. As I mentioned, that really balanced that privacy and security in an efficient and effective manner, and yet is able to support that trust that is really needed in the system. So those are pretty broad goals, but we also, in many ways - and I think I hope this is clear to people - we're a neutral body, so we're not supporting specific ways to solve for any of these. What we're saying is, let's all be held to this high standard so that the products that people come up with, that they have developed really meet the needs of the users and of government agencies and of those in the field.  So, those are, I think, our big sort of high-level goals.  </p>


<p><br></p>
<p>What would you like the key takeaways of the workshop to be? </p>
<p>
Going back to some of the things that I said about the goals, I really hope that they will take away a couple of things. One, Kantara as a neutral body, as a nonprofit is a place where people can engage and they can be a part of these discussions so that they are learning and building their own professional knowledge and skills. And at the same time, they're contributing to these emerging areas where the standards are not well-developed yet, but we need the voice of the people in the community. So it is a wonderful opportunity for people to get involved and I would encourage them to consider that. And it's also an area where we need more diversity. We need more people to be engaged. Kantara is very much a global organization.   </p>
<p>And so we really open our doors to folks who work in this industry from all different parts of the world. And I think coming together to understand and build systems that are standards based, and assess to a specific set of criteria is very important. And I hope that people will walk away feeling like they understand the work that we're doing, but also that they see an opportunity for themselves to get engaged. And we hope they will.  </p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Has the pandemic affected Kantara's plans? </p>
<p>
The pandemic really hasn't affected our plans in terms of our mission and vision remained the same. If anything, I think it is emphasized and made that mission even more critical. So it's become more important to have programs, to have identity products, to provide services that, as I said, assure that privacy and still maintain security, and that are interoperable, that work collaboratively with the private sector and with government entities.   </p>
<p>I see Kantara as the organization that can help make that a reality. And so, in that sense, the way that it has affected us has made our mission even more critical than it was before. So, in many ways, it's a leap forward. It is not a step back and we're very committed to that. We're very committed to maintaining an assurance program that's dedicated to the highest level of ethics and confidentiality standards - really support service providers. We're very dedicated to that. And the pandemic has just made that even more of a priority. So in some ways it's a blessing in disguise. It has turned out, I think, that has just heightened the level of interest and focus on the work we do.   </p>


<p><br></p>
<p>Are there new areas of focus for you in Kantara? </p>
<p>
There are some new areas, and there's probably more than I'm going to be able to list today. So hopefully people will come to the workshop because I think you'll get a chance to hear a lot more about many of the new areas. I'll just highlight a couple things. One, a new area of focus is on mobile driver's licenses. That is really something that is taking off - that is a growing area. And there's a real need for standards and criteria in that specific area, because it's relatively new. But again, in many ways, the pandemic has made the focus on that more critical than it might've been. So a lot of things has sort of jumped to lightspeed because of the pandemic, because now we are so reliant on being able to do all of these different things virtually and identity proofing has become more important than ever.   </p>
<p>And there's a lot of issues with the pandemic that need to be addressed. So that's one - another area that I hope we will work on – and this is as a new executive director – I am hoping for more diverse participation. I would love to encourage others who might have seen the Kantara organization as a little bit more narrowly focused to encourage you, that we support diversity in our membership and in all of the activities and the work that we do. And that's very important. And so I hope that that will be an area of focus that we will encourage that broader participation. So, I hope that folks coming to the workshop will be interested to learn again, how they can get involved. And I think help us, because the more diverse that we are, the better work products we're going to have, right? We're going to be establishing new input on standards, the more diverse the participation, the better that's going to be, and that permeates everything that we do. So we're very excited to open up our doors to many folks to get involved. So I hope the conference participants will really consider taking a few moments to comment here about the new goals and the new products and the new areas that we're working in. </p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/hill">Richard Hill</a></p>A trend compelling IGA modernization is the need for an Identity driven security model; due to identity silos created by rapid cloud adoption. As organizations rethink their IAM/IGA systems, they may also need to utilize their existing systems while re-architecting their security environment to support new requirements. Keeping what it already has and having the ability to gradually migrate from these legacy systems to what it wants in the future using modern software architecture is pivotal. An Identity Fabric provides the agility and the integration support for what organizations already have while allowing organizations to move ahead at their own speed.

<p>I’ve now used versions of this post in various presentations, including a UN/CEFACT Forum Webinar, the Blockchain Technology Symposium 2021 (BTS’ 21) and others. </p>
<p>I feel like it’s a good primer on Self-Sovereign Identity, that takes us away from the technology, allowing us to focus more on the why. </p>
<p>I’d like to thank John Jordan, Executive Director for the BC Digital Trust Services for explaining the concept of Digital Trust to me so elegantly, which in turn allowed me to better frame it for folks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why Digital Trust? 
<p>We tend to focus too much about the tech behind Self-Sovereign Identity. This leads us down rabbit holes to do with standards, protocols, blockchains, cryptography and more. But what’s the purpose of SSI? It’s about enabling Digital Trust (which is quickly becoming an integral part of digital transformation for organizations).</p>
<p>First, we’re talking about Digital Trust and Trust in general. That’s a very high-level idea, so let’s break that down a little bit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we talk about Trust, generally speaking, we focus on a relationship between two parties.&nbsp;For example, perhaps between me and another individual like you the reader; or between me and a business that I’m going to do something with; or a relationship between a business to a business.</p>
<p>My full-time job is with Northern Block, and there’s a trust model between Northern Block and its employees. In this case, I’m talking about a relationship between two parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The determination of trust is a combination of things;&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 
 Do I have some type of method of conveying trust between those two parties in the context of a transaction; and&nbsp; 
 Do I have an understanding of why I would trust that other party? 
 
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Interactions and Relationships in the Physical World 
<p>In the case of a business to a business transaction, we tend to develop relationships through human interaction.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We find each other’s business, we’re going to become a supplier or a customer, and then we tend to have a mechanism by which we formalize that relationship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We call this a contract, and contracts are everywhere. Contracts are one of the key mechanisms we have in society for establishing a formal relationship, and defining the boundaries of that relationship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If somebody goes outside of those boundaries, it’s governed by the contract.</p>
<p>Now, shifting the topic bit..</p>
<p>Personal identity is given to you by the Government in a lot of ways; that is, in an administrative sense, and not your philosophical sense of being, and who you are.&nbsp; Rather, the fact that I can say that my name is Mathieu Glaude, and my age is x and so forth. Those attributes or characteristics of one are attested to by the Government, based on an administrative process of registration and their authority to manage that.</p>
<p>In the same way for businesses, we have business registries, and they have a process for creating legal entities. It is these sources of truth, or these administrative authorities, which allow us to enter into contracts.</p>
<p>Back before these things we call computers were around, it was difficult to create or recreate these documents, because printing presses were big and expensive, and there were techniques that could be deployed by them to prevent fraudulent copies of these things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And importantly, because everything was on the physical edge (credentials, interactions), and because things happened at paper speed, the risks were relatively low in terms of the wide-scale ability to defraud.</p>
 Interactions and Relationships in the Digital World 
<p>In turn, the web has introduced a new actor, that we don’t have an equivalent for in the physical world.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>On the web, we have this idea of ‘login’; there’s an intermediary between me and another person, or between me and the business I’m trying to do something with, and so forth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This intermediary has no defined role in any of our legal structures. For example, there’s no such thing as ‘the login service’ in the Business Corporations Act of Ontario.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, because we have this login service, there’s a sort of ‘middle person’ in between our relationships, which has some very significant consequences.</p>
<p>One of the consequences is that it means that none of my relationships online are confidential: meaning that they’re not only known between me and the party I’m trying to interact with. </p>
<p>If I go to the gym, or I go to rent a car, or I go to the doctor or the lawyer or whatever, that interaction that happens is private. It’s not known, generally speaking, by any other entity, including the Government.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If all of my relationships were known, then I would be very unhappy — we call that surveillance, and that would be a severe privacy erosion.</p>
<p>As a result, we don’t even have the conditions on the web for privacy.&nbsp;By the very architectural structure of it, there must be a login service in order for me to connect to another party.&nbsp;By definition, that means it’s not confidential.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Often, the information or data that I exchange with that other party is subject to loss; that other party I’m talking to gathers a lot of information about me, and if they don’t protect it well, it can be stolen.</p>
<p>There’s this Trust Model that applies to the physical world in transactions, and we’re creating the equivalent digitally now.</p>
 The Verifiable Credential Trust Triangle 
<p>When we talk about the Trust Triangle, we use this jargon called “Issuers, Holders, and Verifiers,” and that exactly maps to the world that we have today.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>We often play those roles at different times and in various interactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To give an example: let’s use the onboarding a corporate customer to a financial institution (opening up a business account), just because we’ve been covering lots of these types of use cases at <a href="https://northernblock.io/about/">Northern Block</a>.</p>
<p>Originally, we would say that the Bank is going to be a Verifier. It’s going to take on the Verifier role; you’re going to show up at the Bank’s door, and you’re going to say, “I’d like to open up an account.”</p>
<p>The Bank would say, “Great, tell me some things about yourself, so that I can understand who I’m doing business or working with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So you’d provide your Personal ID from a reliable source, such a a driver’s licence, articles of incorporation, etc. The Bank needs to verify you, the company and ensure delegated authority to act on behalf of the company. They’re verifying this information. They have a business process to approve it, and when they approve it, they become an Issuer.</p>
<p>They will issue you credentials to a bank account. All the while, you as the individual, and you as the individual representing the corporation, are what’s called the Holder.</p>
<p> You’ll note in this model that there’s no mention of login or intermediary </p>
<p>Your interaction with the bank is a Direct and Private one.</p>
<p>Just as your relationship with whoever issued you your credentials that you’re presenting to the Bank (e.g., Government) are private to you as well.</p>
<p>At no time does the other party know of the other relationship.</p>
 Digital Verifiable Data 
<p>This new digital mechanism I’m discussing, ensures that the authenticity and origin of the digital credential being presented to the bank can be verified, without a third party.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can have a direct relationship with the entity you’re interacting with.</p>
<p><a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-enterprise-cloud/features/">And this process is now doable digitally</a>, through Verifiable Credentials, Wallet Technology and Blockchain.</p>
<p>Entities can trust the credentials being presented to them through with a blockchain acting as a root of trust. Verifiers can query the blockchain to find out if what is being presented to them is valid, who it’s been issued from and whether or not its been tampered with.</p>
<p>The other piece not being displayed here is the governance piece. And we’re working within the <a href="https://northernblock.io/toip-101/">Trust Over IP Foundation</a> to build the Governance models across the stack, to manage business legal, technology and social governance frameworks.</p>

 ONT Login, the decentralized identity universal login component based on ONT ID and ONT TAG, the batch verification solution have been officially released, forming a complete Ontology DID product matrix together with the on-chain credit score&nbsp;OScore. <p>The world is becoming increasingly digitized, with Web 3.0 right around the corner. With more and more of our lives being spent online, it is essential to develop a reliable and trustless way to verify who we are. Blockchain has equipped us with the technology needed to not only authenticate identities on-chain, but to do so in a way that protects user privacy. ONT ID is Ontology’s decentralized identity solution, designed to be both trustless and private, empowering users. This article outlines ONT ID’s key features, along with its complementary services, ONT Login and ONT&nbsp;TAG.</p><p>ONT ID is a decentralized identity framework that complies with W3C’s recommended standards for decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials. Based on blockchain and cryptography, ONT ID can quickly identify and connect people, data and services. Decentralization, self-management, privacy protection, and ease of use are the key features of ONT ID that ensure users fully control their data and identity.</p><p>As a blockchain project focusing on bringing secure, trusted, and privacy-respecting decentralized identity and data solutions to Web 3.0, Ontology focuses on building a Web 3.0 trust infrastructure, allowing individuals and businesses to apply decentralized identity solutions whilst fully respecting user privacy. After over three years of development, Ontology released its on-chain credit system, OScore, designed for programmable reputation based on ONT ID. OScore is integrated with Wing Finance, Ontology’s decentralized digital asset transfer protocol, a real application for decentralized credit. On this basis, the newly released centralized identity universal login component <a href="https://login.ont.id/">ONT Login</a> and the batch verification solution ONT TAG have further enriched the Ontology DID product matrix, bringing better product experiences for application parties and individual users.</p> ONT Login <p>Traditional servers use the “username + password” method for authentication and login. Due to the security risks of this authentication method and the tendency of users to reuse the same password on different platforms, this brings a lot of cost, security, and user experience problems. At the same time, many services require users to bind information such as mailboxes, phone numbers, and social media accounts. Users need to prove the authenticity of this information through OAuth or verification codes. This way of information authorization increases the user’s&nbsp;costs.</p><p><a href="https://login.ont.id/">ONT Login</a> is a Decentralized Universal Authentication login component designed to solve these problems. By helping developers shield the details of authentication implementation, ONT Login can bring enterprises into the Web 3.0 era with secure login experience. ONT Login standardizes the centralized authentication protocol and provides front-end and back-end SDKs for rapid integration between suppliers and users. At the same time, it provides a communication interface with a decentralized identity management wallet to facilitate rapid integration of identity management applications.</p><p>As a product for all Web 3.0 and traditional Internet application developers, ONT Login has the following advantages:</p>  No need for third-party trust: Achieve safe and effective verification of user identities and data in a decentralized manner; adopt a challenge-response authentication model and use digital signature technology to ensure the security of the authentication process.  Password-free login: Users do not need to memorize complex passwords; avoids risks such as server collision with the database; improves user information security; in the decentralized identity wallet, users can verify their email, phone number, etc., and obtain relevant credentials; when logging into different service parties, you can directly show the relevant credentials, eliminating the need for multiple verifications.  Independent management of information authorization: Using decentralized identification and verifiable credential technology, users can log in quickly while selectively authorizing necessary information to the server, protecting their&nbsp;privacy.  Rapid deployment: Provide front-end JavaScript SDK, and provide back-end Golang/Java SDK suppliers to quickly integrate in&nbsp;minutes.  <p>ONT Login not only supports traditional internet platforms to achieve Web 3.0 login methods, but also supports various blockchain systems including public chain alliance chains, multiple DID methods, and multiple digital signature mechanisms. In short, ONT Login can be configured to support specific business&nbsp;needs.</p> ONT TAG <p>Due to increasingly expensive gas fees on Ethereum, it is not cost efficient to perform individual transactions to authenticate user identities. <a href="https://tag.ont.id/">ONT TAG</a> solves this problem by enabling applications to authorize user authentication results.</p><p>In short, ONT TAG is a complete DID-based batch verification solution. By using ONT TAG, an application can quickly obtain the user’s verifiable credentials with the user’s authorization. The authorization process is also performed whilst protecting user privacy. If and when to authorize access to user data is determined solely by the&nbsp;user.</p><p>The advantages of <a href="https://tag.ont.id/">ONT TAG</a> are not limited to these. This set of solutions fully takes into account the verification requirements of users and applications for specific information sources. Integrating Ontology’s own resource advantages, it can provide KYC verification by multiple international authoritative identity authentication service providers including CFCA, IdentityMind, Shufti Pro, etc., as well as social account platforms including Twitter and Facebook.</p><p>When any decentralized application (dApp) or Web 2.0 application applies for a credential through ONT TAG, ONT TAG immediately retrieves the information provided by each integrated trust anchor and generates a credential. When the application initiates a request to obtain the credential from the ONT TAG, it can be automatically sent to the user through the application, and the user decides how to display the credential to the application. The entire process only takes a few minutes, is cheap, and prevents the application from collecting user&nbsp;data.</p><p>As people have become more aware of their digital identities and data privacy, more and more countries have established laws and regulations to protect user data. These include the European Data Protection Act (GDPR), California’s Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and China’s “Personal Information Protection Act”. ONT ID is a complete decentralized identity framework featuring a user credit evaluation function, universal login system, and batch verification mechanism for authentication of user data. Based on ONT ID’s previous integrations with world-renowned automobile manufacturer Daimler Mobility, decentralized music streaming and NFT platform ROCKI, Ontology is already providing solutions in a variety of technical industries.</p><p>Log into <a href="http://ont.id">ONT.ID</a> now to access the development documents and SDK for OScore, ONT Login and ONT&nbsp;TAG.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p>To give you sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Joni some questions about her planned presentation.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In what ways has the pandemic impacted digital identity ecosystems?</p>
<p>
The pandemic has absolutely impacted digital ID ecosystems. It's done so in a number of ways, it's driven demand for people to start working from home, who hadn't before in the past, it's driven more need for convenient use of services that have more higher risk profiles, such as banking or needing to transact with governments. And absolutely from an enterprise perspective, when we have people's patterns changing, we have workforces that are now working from home. It's driven the need for more and more security while maintaining that quality workforce being engaged in the ecosystem. Of course, if we look at the pandemic and the terms of proving particular attributes, like have you received a vaccine or not, or is your COVID 19 tests negative or not?  If we think about those concepts, what's really important, important about them is that they are in fact bound to a digital identity, a COVID test or a, or a vaccine proof doesn't necessarily matter, unless we know that you are the person that is attached to that particular attribute.</p>
<p>So COVID-19 pandemic has driven all of these demands forward with a more urgent and a much higher level to where in the past, when we talked about digital ID, sometimes we talked about it as more of a convenience so that we could transact easily from anywhere now it's about life needs, ensuring that food can stay on the table, that people can stay employed, that the economy can keep moving forward, while not leaving anyone behind. So ensuring that we have social inclusion and its social equity in these systems as we move forward in the pandemic. </p>
<p><br></p>

<p>When it comes to digital ID, there is always a tradeoff between security and usability. What should vendors, or anyone building identity platforms, focus on? </p>
<p>
So when we talk around digital ID, we often hear that there are trade offs between security and usability or between security and privacy, for example,I really think we should challenge vendors to try to look at the ecosystem more as a positive sum approach. And so how can we build security and usability? How can we build in security and privacy? I think there's a challenge first of all, to really look at this ecosystem as additive, versus, you know, having to have one or the other, in terms of usability, we have to have usability. These systems have to be easy for people to use and in a lot of cases, we're just not there yet. And so we may find that the most easy to use solution will win the day, but it will be very low or much lower in terms of security or privacy and personal data protection.   </p>
<p>So the identity and access management, industry practitioners and vendors and ecosystem at large, is really challenged to try to bring each of these forward and security and privacy security and usability, and that takes commitment and investment user testing. We certainly are making it further down in terms of progress to get to systems that are, have all of these features. So I think we should try to ensure that we have the easiest system that we can use, a lot of education around these systems, while not lowering or degrading the privacy protection the personal data control and the security protection. That is the foundation of the challenges that we're trying to solve with digital identity.   </p>
<p><br></p>

<p>Could you deep dive on the biggest security challenges when it comes to digital ID? </p>
<p>
Some of the biggest security challenges regarding digital ID. I would say really do rely on the fact that the system that we are working with has flaws from a digital ID perspective that are built into it. And so we know that the internet was not built with an identity layer. And so some of the challenges in this space are,  shall we build a new internet that now has an identity layer, or shall we build an identity layer, that can hook into the existing systems? And I would say we really whenever we see the idea of, should we do one thing or another thing we should challenge ourselves to try to do both of those things and try to bridge those things together. And so we don't have an identity layer in the current internet. There is work being done to build that those capabilities and those solutions, and they do exist in different solutions and in different ecosystems today.</p>
<p>There are other communities who are trying to, if you will rebuild the internet from the ground up. And so both of these piles should be encouraged. And the challenges sometimes are brought about by fracture in terms of marketplace fracture, in terms of developers and vendors, as well as relying parties and clients trying to determine which direction they should invest in. And so I would really encourage and, and, and, and try to push our communities that when we see this kind of fracture happening for one approach or another approach, we should really challenge ourselves to build bridges between these approaches. We should really focus on globally interoperable standards that are being built in often in associations of industry practitioners, who have the experience and the know-how, and are trying to build things such as, for example, a common data model, like the W3C work for a common data model for verifiable credentials would be one example. Where we see, I think fracture is one of the largest challenges, particularly for investors for the, for the, the marketplace. And we as a community should be working to address that fracture while promoting choice of solution and approach. And, and one of the ways you do that is by working with industry standards that are global, and are, and are built by industry expert practitioners.  </p>

<p>Could you give us a sneak peek into your keynote at EIC? </p>
<p>
I'd love to give you a sneak peek into my keynote for this year's European Identity and Cloud Conference. As the president of the digital ID and authentication council of Canada, I will be discussing some of the main work that we do, which is the Pan-Canadian trust framework, a technology agnostic framework of rules and tools so that different solutions can exist in one ecosystem, with a baseline of requirements, providing people and clients with a choice about how and which systems they'd like to use. We've done some year over year research regarding digital identity. And so we see where perspectives have changed and where they've stayed the same, with regard to personal data sharing convenience versus security, usability versus security, what are, what are people really demanding, when it comes to digital identity and how in fact COVID, and the different realities of living in COVID in a world of social distancing and less travel and working from home,  which populations have been most affected, and where are they from which actors and from which stakeholders are they looking for their solutions to come from?</p>
<p>
And who are they trusting, for management and access to personal data? So it's great demographic research that intersects, some of the realities around market awareness and understanding, or on digital identity itself, and how the COVID-19 pandemic and everything that comes with it has intersected if people's perspectives and their demand. And the short story is, COVID-19 has driven,  more demand for digital identity and we'll get into some of the details, and the demographics, and around what people are thinking. </p>

 Self Sovereign Identity/Decentralised Identity and Financial Services Webinar — A&nbsp;Synopsis <p>September 2nd, 2021 was a big day for all of us in the Global Developer Ecosystem (GDE) team of Affinidi as we geared to host our first <a href="https://youtu.be/kR0IGOqmEwI">webinar on Self Sovereign Identity/Decentralised Identity and Financial Services</a> with Varsha Jagdale (General Manager of Financial Services at Affinidi) and Joseph Thompson (CEO of AID:Tech) as the speakers.</p><p>Sandeep, our Community Manager at Affinidi, was the host, and he started by giving a brief introduction on <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-is-the-trust-triangle-9a9caf36b321">Self-Sovereign Identity</a> and Affinidi’s work in this&nbsp;space.</p><p>This was followed by Varsha Jagdale who spoke about what Affinidi is doing in the financial services industry.</p> Varsha Jagdale — Impact of SSI on Financial Services <p>Varsha used real-life scenarios to describe the huge changes that the financial industry has gone through in the last few years and also the challenges that come with these&nbsp;changes.</p><p>For example, she talked about the pushcart owners in Indonesia who represent one of the lowest socioeconomic segments of the&nbsp;society.</p>Street Food vendors — Indonesia<p>These vendors borrow money in the morning to buy the supplies, make food, and sell it to customers through their pushcarts. At the end of the day, they return the money borrowed with interest, Typically, the interest rate is around 10 to 15% for this microloan, thereby leaving them with very little money in their&nbsp;pockets.</p><p>Another scenario that Varsha talked about is tech company deals that typically take around 12 to 18 months to complete.</p>Closing a Business Deal — 12 to 18&nbsp;months<p>This long cycle is mostly due to the long time that banks take to go through their processes before approving/financing the&nbsp;deal.</p><p>Another player in the financial spectrum is the SMEs that are involved in the export and import of goods. Most times, these companies are too small to get loans from banks and don’t have the documents and processes required for the Know-Your-Business (KYB) process of&nbsp;banks.</p><p>She explained that a common theme across all these scenarios is a lack of trust, where one entity doesn’t know or understand who the other entity claims to be. This is where Affinidi comes in, as it uses <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credentials</a> to empower businesses to operate in a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-is-the-trust-triangle-9a9caf36b321">trusted environment</a>.</p><p>Varsha went on to talk about <a href="https://www.goodworker.in/">Goodworker</a>, one of the sister companies of Affinidi, and how it empowers blue-collar workers to find the next job, gain financial security, get access to insurance and loans, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Similarly, she explained how Affinidi is trying to empower SMEs by creating <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/selective-disclosure-share-what-you-want-8ae367655b7b">a sense of trust</a> about their business and operations, thereby enabling them to address their challenges and become more productive and profitable.</p><p>Finally, she talked about the Affinidi ecosystem and the benefits it offers for both issuers and verifiers.</p> Joseph Thompson — Impact of SSI in the Social&nbsp;Sector <p>Taking on from where Varsha left, Joseph Thompson, the CEO, and Co-Founder of AID:Tech, talked about how digital identities have empowered some of the poorest and marginalized sections of the society such as displaced Filipinos and Save the Children NGO by giving them financial aid directly through their digital identities. He opined that the transparency of this process is what really makes it unique and effective.</p><p>With this introduction, he jumped on to two use-cases. Both these are built on Affinidi’s <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/8-reasons-to-use-verifiable-credentials-300833276b52">verifiable credentials</a> because it is simple to understand and use, thereby saving time and helps to get the product to the market quicker. <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/affinidi-partners-with-aid-tech-exploring-new-horizons-in-digital-identity-and-verifiable-661c9e61f7e8">Click here</a> to learn more about AID:Tech and Affinidi’s partnership.</p><p>Joseph’s first <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">use case</a> was the Save the Children project that required the creation of a verified decentralized Digital Identity that was owned and controlled by the user and could be used across multiple services such as health, education, welfare, etc. These IDs also “acted as gateways for accessing financial services.”</p><p>This was a pilot project that got a big response, so <a href="https://www.aid.technology/">AID:Tech</a> is building on it based on feedback about user experience.</p><p>Next, Joseph talked about a project with the Women’s World Banking that involved the distribution of microinsurance to women in Uganda and Nigeria. This is likely to extend to women in the Philippines next year. This project will essentially allow women to get access to healthcare through their digital identities built on verifiable credentials.</p><p>He concluded by saying that his company is building these identities using Affinidi’s verifiable credentials <a href="https://github.com/affinityproject/affinidi-core-sdk/tree/master/sdk/core">tech&nbsp;stack</a>.</p><p>Joseph’s presentation was followed by an enthusiastic Q&amp;A session where participants sent their questions through Affinidi’s Discord channel and Zoom. While the business-level questions were answered by the guest speakers, the technical questions were handled by Affinidi’s engineers.</p><p>Some of the interesting questions were:</p>  Which revenue streams are ‘encouraged’ for the app/ solution developers? I mean, Is Affinidi’s solution designed to generate revenues for the issuer/ holder or the verifier? Thanks.  Thanks for the informative webinar. How do individuals manage their data across the use cases&nbsp;shared?  Why would large organisations (e.g. banks) be incentivised to come on board as issuers? Has this got to be regulations driven?  <p><a href="https://discord.com/channels/806805256314028082/882352117564715068">Join our Discord</a> channel to view the answers and for more questions.</p><p>Thus, Affinidi’s first webinar came to an end, and it created an indelible learning experience in the minds of all participants.</p><p>We thank everyone who joined us on this milestone and we look forward to having you in our subsequent webinars as&nbsp;well.</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1FhRGo3c4T-erYRGOSRyzCQ8oa2v">join our mailing list</a> and follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/affinidi/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/affinidi.devs">Facebook</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/affinidi">Twitter</a>.

<p>The metaverse is a limited view of the future. Let’s not let our material conditions degrade in the physical world in the pursuit of experiences and riches in the virtual. Let’s build systems of value that traverse&nbsp;both.</p><p>On the <a href="https://interdependence.fm/episodes/primacism-david-rudnick-on-the-struggle-for-primacy-type-and-poetrys-unique-value-in-an-age-of-digital-and-physical-conflict-and-percy-shelleys-mont-blanc">Interdependence podcast</a>, graphic designer David Rudnick set forth his theory of primacism in the context of the upward trend of popularity and valuation of cryptocurrencies and NFTs. He described two modes of&nbsp;primacy.</p><p>There is the longstanding mode of physical prime, in which physical goods, artifacts, and experiences are valued and held in high regard. In the past thirty years, however, we have seen a huge shift towards digital prime thinking with the advent of the internet, gaming, and cryptocurrencies challenging the traditional conventions of how we value and experience phenomena.</p><p>This divide is not only generational but also ideological. Where we land on digital versus physical primacy affects where we allocate our energy and resources in building new techno-social systems.</p><p>Mattereum, while operating largely in a physical prime mindset, believes in a hybrid future where property and value transcends the usual constraints of either the digital or the physical.</p><p>An early tool for experimenting with this new form of “omniversal property rights” is the Real-World Asset NFT, a method of bringing physical goods into the rapidly growing (largely speculative) crypto economy. Building this bridge would not only greatly increase the value and utility of crypto but also allow for a more decentralized and secure approach to physical commerce which is under constant threat of monopolization and systemic vulnerability.</p> The Metaverse Is A Critically Narrow View of the&nbsp;Future <p>In recent months, the “metaverse” meme has gone viral with everyone from Mark Zuckerberg to VC firms to Fortnite creator Epic Games to anon crypto traders citing it as the new frontier of commerce and entertainment. Everything of value subsumed into virtual&nbsp;worlds.</p><p>However, it is important to acknowledge the origins of the term “metaverse” and the critical blindspot it presents.</p><p>One of the most influential works of literature in the tech industry is Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson. This post-modern, cyberpunk classic featured the first publication of the term “metaverse,” describing a shared virtual reality that the characters of the novel frequent throughout.</p><p>The protagonist of the novel, Hiro, is a gig-worker who lives in a modified storage container with a broke, alcoholic roommate in the backdrop of an anarcho-capitalist corporate dystopia where late pizza deliveries are literally punishable by&nbsp;death.</p><p>The material conditions of the bottom-rung of society are horrific, but thankfully they have a shared illusion to escape to and action&nbsp;aplenty.</p><p>Why invoke Snow Crash? Well, many of the individuals and institutions building virtual worlds and virtual property cite it as a primary influence on their work. This metaverse is a north star for centralized corporations with monopolistic tendencies and globally-distributed, decentralized techno-social movements alike. People are actively working to build this&nbsp;future.</p><p>Let’s look at crypto: the total market cap for the industry exceeds $2 trillion, over $80 billion is locked in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and people are buying pixel avatars for millions of dollars. All of this value while providing little to none in the way of actual social&nbsp;impact.</p><p>If we’re not careful, we will find ourselves completely entranced by the world of bits (dominated either by corporations or crypto protocols) while living in the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulacra_and_Simulation">desert of the&nbsp;real</a>.”</p><p>Let’s ground ourselves a bit, and use these incredible tools to improve our material conditions.</p> Real-World Asset NFTs Expand the Scope and Utility of&nbsp;Crypto <p>The Real-World Asset NFT (rNFT), or physical NFT, is a method of using legal and software engineering to tokenize physical property such that it can be traded, collateralized, governed, and owned using the same global medium of value transfer that powers the multi-trillion dollar crypto&nbsp;economy.</p><p>These tokens expand on the functionality of the NFTs gaining popularity in the creative industries by granting the bearer the right to take physical custody of an underlying object. The idea is simple, but the opportunities are&nbsp;vast.</p><p>How exactly do we build this, and what are the implications for crypto and&nbsp;beyond?</p> Real-World Asset NFTs are Built Upon Mattereum Asset Passports <p>Mattereum’s approach to asset tokenization is to clearly identify an object and define the property rights using the <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/composable-commerce-with-mattereum-asset-passports-4e102f85139a">Mattereum Asset Passport</a> (MAP), a powerful and composable legal-tech framework which bundles warranties around goods and services. One of these warranties can include digital asset issuance via an NFT, as shown&nbsp;below:</p>For a more detailed breakdown of generating physical NFTs, we recommend referring to the <a href="https://mattereum.com/2021/04/01/mattereum-product-walkthrough/">Mattereum Product Walkthrough</a>.<p>The key modular element of the MAP is the warranty. Each warranty covers various terms of a contract ranging from identity, authentication procedure, vault status, tokenization, carbon offsets, and eventually even anti-slavery certification.</p><p>The MAP is a dynamic, living document that follows an object’s lifecycle, binding warranties together around an object over time to secure value, create clear lines of accountability, and maximize&nbsp;utility.</p><p>This tool opens up a vast design space that we have only just begun to&nbsp;explore.</p> Real-World Asset NFTs Can Bridge the Virtual Economy and the Physical&nbsp;World <p>The current crypto economy is largely (mostly) speculative: multi-billion dollar networks without mainstream application, DeFi “money legos” powering financial protocols used primarily to expand existing fortunes, and NFTs being traded for vast sums with no clear valuation model.</p><p>In the early days of an internet of programmable value, this is inevitable.</p><p>With smart contracts, anyone can build all manner of familiar and exotic financial instruments, so this kind of runway experimentation is to be expected. In a summer 1996 talk, ex-cypherpunk Perry Metzger quipped that in time financial cryptography will be able to produce any form of digital value one can imagine e.g. “<a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-geodesic-market/">gold-denominated Burmese opium futures</a>.”</p><p>This is startlingly true, twenty-five years&nbsp;later.</p><p>To reduce speculation in, bring stability to, and expand utility of the crypto economy, it is necessary to re-balance digital prime thinking with physical prime, onboarding the hundreds of trillions of physical assets throughout the world that colossally dwarf the market cap of crypto by an incredible magnitude onto the blockchain.</p><p><a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/all-of-the-worlds-money-and-markets-in-one-visualization-2020/">All of the World's Money and Markets in One Visualization - 2020 Edition</a></p><p>So far, Mattereum has passported and tokenized a wide range of objects, from <a href="https://opensea.io/NTFA">gold-backed NFTs</a>, to <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/third-millennia-collection-1">pop culture memorabilia</a>, to <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/mattereum-fine-art-and-antiquities-collection-warr">historical/cultural artifacts</a>, with many more in the pipeline.</p><p>The potential boon for crypto is limitless. DeFi protocols could use less-volatile forms of collateral. DAOs could govern the maintenance and use of physical properties. NFTs could facilitate the transfer of clearly defined property rights. This can be done&nbsp;today.</p><p>The benefits flow the other way as well. The combination of blockchain and NFTs can bring the programmability of smart contracts and the provenance of immutable transaction ledgers to goods and services in the physical world: eliminating fraud, securing trust, and allocating social, financial, and intellectual capital to the governance and maintenance of shared resources.</p> Commerce Beyond Metaverse: A Look to the&nbsp;Future <p>We currently have the ability to build bidirectional links between physical objects and their digital asset counterparts using MAPs and NFTs, vastly opening up the design space of digital commerce.</p><p>This technology blurs the distinction between digital and physical value, between objects in the metaverse and objects in the material world. Imagine a primarily digital construct that has been passported, with all design blueprints stored on IPFS, all physical instantiations of the object paired with an NFT, and a cryptographic evidence chain securing all transactions and attestations throughout the object’s lifecycle (Bruce Sterling’s “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spime">spimes</a>”.) The tools to create this form of hybrid asset are live this very&nbsp;moment.</p><p>Blockchain NFTs in conjunction with legal engineering can create and enforce property rights across the metaverse and the real world simultaneously. We don’t have to direct all of our resources to the development of one at the expense or neglect of the&nbsp;other.</p><p>We can do&nbsp;both.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/breaking-open-the-metaverse-with-real-world-asset-nfts-dccb00251fdf">Breaking Open the Metaverse with Real-World Asset NFTs</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>To give you sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Sadrick some questions about his planned presentation.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What do we miss when talking about identity management?</p>
<p>
When we talk about identity management, it is mainly about digital identities, for example, a user logging in to an e-commerce shop. But there are different qualities of users – we at cidaas like to call these qualities - Trust Levels. To make this more clear – a user with a newsletter might be a weak Identity, but a user who performed a digital identity verification, for example with a bank account, is a strong identity. A user can move easily between trust levels, especially when using features like progressive profiling with which the user can enrich the user data successively and contextually. As an example a user who is interested in a product and signs up to a newsletter is initially a weak identity – but then becomes a stronger identity when purchasing the product. </p>
<p>What we also completely lose sight of is the real-world identity. Let’s take a theme park; a user registers in the online shop and buys a ticket. We consider this the digital identity. The real-world identity comes into play when the user visits the park. The user authenticates with the personalized ticket at the entrance or might get a discount in the park, during breakfast, so then he [the user] becomes a real-world identity. Considering membership cards or personalized tickets, these are authentication options in the real world. Basically, we need to achieve a linking of the digital and the real-world identity in the future. </p>
<p><br></p>

<p>Why is Identity Management important for businesses in Europe?</p>
<p>
In general, the topic of sovereignty is a big issue in Europe, especially solutions from Europe are very important, considering identity management or other features, or other solutions, which are key to digitalization in the future. The General Data Protection Regulation has changed the game in the last years. It is not only about the legal implications, but also about transparency and trust towards users. Businesses need a so-called Real-GDPR to establish a trustful relationship. In this context the question of make vs. buy arises. Basically, the question must be: "What competitive advantage do I have if I, as a company, develop an Identity and Access Management (IAM) solution myself?</p>
<p>The next question is then: What advantage do I have if I run the IAM solution in-house? The answer is simple, I do not create any benefit by developing or hosting an identity management solution myself. Especially with the solutions available today, such as cidaas and others, which are available as a cloud service, the decision is clearly with ‘buy’. </p>
<p><br></p>

<p>What changes Identity Management?</p>
<p>
Many factors have an impact on Identity Management, first and foremost the user convenience drives the development in the identity management sector. Thereby, in particular new authentication methods arose in the last years, making the user experience not only more convenient but also more secure. In addition, many new touchpoints arose, both on digital channels and in the real world, such as access points in a theme park, a stadium, or smart factories. With all these changes, we must not lose sight of security – in particular since the challenges in the context of security have evolved in the same way. One can say - Identity Management is more than the sum of its parts.  
</p>
<p><br></p>

<p>Could you comment on the evolution of Identity?</p>
<p>
A key development in the evolution of identity management was the cloud. With modern cloud solutions such as cidaas, the topic of identity management has arrived in all companies, regardless of size, industry or sector. Thus, in the age of the cloud, high costs for software licenses and the operation [of solutions] are a thing of the past. So, considering the way companies are interacting with customers changed. Digital Channels and Services play an important role in the acquisition of prospects and engagement with customers. Thereby identity management became a crucial part to offer those services, provide new benefits, create unique selling points, having new touchpoints in place and recognizing user potential.   
</p>
<p><br></p>

<p>Could you give us a sneak peek into your Keynote: “Give Me 10 Minutes, I'll Give You the Truth About Identity”?</p>
<p>
In my Keynote “Give me 10 Minutes, I’ll give you the truth about identity” we will see what can be achieved within 10 minutes in the context of Identity &amp; Access Management. We’ll jointly rethink the identity management and why user convenience has become so incredible and so important for both employees as well as partners and customers, be it in B2C or B2B and what the changing factors in the near future will be.</p>

<p>To give you sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Dave some questions about this panel.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>How can digital identity secure the pharmaceutical supply chain in the future?</p>
<p>
So what is going on in United States is there's a rule called drug supply security act. It is one of the only serialization acts in the world that requires change of ownership. It's not a dispense model like in the EU where you just, you scan it at the pharmacy and verify the serial number. In the US, you have to exchange data between your supply chain partners and also they can make requests, asking for the validity of the serial number or batch number or expiration date. So what we're looking at here is we need some kind of electronic or digital system to verify the players in the DSC systems. They are who they say they are their authorized training partner. And then in the US and authorized trading partner, somebody with a valid state license or FCI, that's FDA, facility establishment ID. And that's mainly for manufacturers.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p>How is Novartis meeting regulatory requirements to secure the supply chain? </p>
<p>
What Novartis is doing to meet and secure the supply chain and comply with DSE ESA. There are several attributes. We are putting a serial number on cases and sellable units and aggregating. We are implementing a VRS system through SAP, which is a wholesale sellable returns where the wholesaler can request if the serial number, the expiration date, the batch number of G10 or authentic, that is going to be expanded to other entities in the supply chain towards 2023. And especially to partners that are indirect. And what we need here is to do this is credentialing digital ID because what's happening here is I'm getting a request from somebody for a verification, or I'm sending product out and it's called cash to order. And I have to verify that who I'm sending that product out to has a valid state license. So what we're doing to use this, digital ID is we're putting it in, embedding it in our systems with the cooperation of SAP and other supply chain partners. So, we can secure the network because it's a distributed network. It's not a centralized database, it's a distributed network. So we need to know, as we communicate with 70,000 supply chain partners, who you are, are you saying who you are and are you an authorized trading partner? So that's how we're building out to secure the supply chain, not just to meet the doc USA requirements, but to assure that Novartis is sending product to, to the correct individuals and that they're not bad actors.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p>You will be participating in a panel together with other pharmaceutical supply chain actors. Can you give us a sneak peek on the context of the panel?</p>
<p>
Yeah. So what we will do is we will discuss how we built out digital ID for VRS and with SAP at other supply chain partners with other service providers in that work in the United States, we will talk about what we currently are doing in piloting, and we're now going to our production model. And also we have four service providers who had cooperated through OCI to build an inoperable credit digital ID system and where it also can be expanded in the future, like order to cash and maybe other opportunities for 2023 and at what the importance of this is, and also why we did it. We'll find out is that we were using and other methods to identify partners. And that was not sufficient. We were finding that there was no registrations that, uh, people who are using them were not the people who said they were using them. So we will go through all that in this panel and show the importance of digital identity.</p>

<p>On a daily basis, payroll providers solve many of the pain points faced by HR teams. For example, payroll solutions save employers time and resources and deliver valuable services that enhance the employee experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, by leveraging their valuable data in new ways, payroll providers have the ability to deliver income and employment verification solutions that even better meet the needs of HR teams. Payroll providers can benefit from their data by connecting with an open banking platform—a consumer-permissioned means of accessing financial data via APIs. By leveraging data to enable empowering and innovative services open banking benefits both the service provider and the consumer.</p>
<p>Ultimately, payroll providers also hone their competitive edge and bolster their security when they connect to open banking platforms. Once connected to the platforms via API, payroll providers empower employers and consumers to benefit from their payroll data on request. The API connection is a partnership between a payroll provider and an open banking platform. A mutually-beneficial partnership that’s dedicated to delivering the best, most secure experience to businesses and their employees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Providers can use the open banking connections to add new services and apps to their offerings. Additionally, the data doesn’t have to be sent in batches to be stored in a database to be used by third parties. These real-time data connections benefit consumers, payroll companies, and employees by minimizing when and how data is used and providing it more securely and transparently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s look at how these partnership-driven connections help payroll providers unlock new opportunities.</p>
 How Does Connecting to Payroll Data Work? 
<p>Payroll data can streamline the <a href="https://www.finicity.com/mvs-simplicity-flexibility/">verification of income and employment</a> for various use cases, such as:<br>
</p>
 
 Mortgage lending 
 Auto lending 
 Personal lending 
 Tenant screening 
 Background checks 
 Government verification 
 Personal financial management<br>
 
 
<p>Payroll providers can connect to open banking platforms and data aggregators in a variety of ways. Many aggregators offer only credentialed access to payroll data, which means that the data access provider uses a consumer’s credentials to access a payroll platform and get the necessary data. While this method may deliver the data necessary for employment and income verifications, credentialed access is less secure for payroll providers and a less consumer-friendly experience since employees may not know their payroll provider or login credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ideally, <a href="https://www.finicity.com/payroll-data-open-banking/">connecting consumers to their valuable payroll data happens via direct API connections</a>. API connections are far more secure than credentialed access and don’t require employees to know their payroll portal credentials to access the content. The user doesn’t even have to know their provider. An open banking platform, or data access provider, is a better method to connect employees to their data with a direct API connection. It provides the highest standard of control and transparency over who is accessing their data and how it is being used to benefit them.</p>
<p>Payroll data clearly helps consumers benefit from their financial data to access important financial services. But what’s in it for payroll providers? Why should they connect to open banking platforms?</p>
 How Payroll Providers Benefit from Connecting to Open Banking Platforms 
<p>Payroll providers can leverage open banking platforms to enable better experiences for their customers, effectively improving their competitive position and ensuring secure data sharing. A competitive advantage of payroll providers would then be the security and privacy standards baked into the API direct connection. In the end, everyone benefits, from payroll providers, to data access providers, to verifiers, to employers and employees.</p>
 How Connecting to Open Banking Platforms Makes Payroll Providers More Competitive 
<p>Connecting to an open banking platform empowers payroll providers to better serve their core target: HR executives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do HR executives need? They need a reliable payroll solution, one that may also deliver other ancillary services, such as benefits, expense reporting, applicant tracking. Like almost any other executive, HR executives need more time and resources for their team, which means that time-consuming, manual employment and income verifications can become a burden.</p>
<p>Many HR executives are already choosing to outsource their payroll and ancillary HR services in order to cut costs and save time. But to whom they outsource matters. The payroll and HR experience is an important element of a positive employee experience with a company. Payroll providers who already offer successful payroll and HR experiences have the opportunity to further enhance those experiences with an additional service: streamlined, simple, and empowering income and employment verification.</p>
<p>By connecting to an open banking platform, payroll providers enable employees to self-permission their employment and income data when trying to access a financial service or engage with the other use cases described above. In this way, the employee benefits from their financial data by delivering a more reliable, comprehensive view of their financial story for greater access to financial services. In turn, verifiers get more accurate, real-time data for better decisioning. Both get a streamlined, faster experience that saves everyone time and resources. And employers (HR executives specifically) never had to waste the resources performing the verifications.</p>
<p>A ready connection for third parties through an open banking connection also makes it easier to add or provide services through third parties like fintechs. These connections can provide financial guidance, simplify complex purchases like insurance or mortgages, or just provide a clearer view for tax preparation.</p>
<p>All of those benefits come from the payroll provider who, through partnership with an open banking platform, offers a better experience and empowers both employer and employee. That payroll provider distinguishes itself among its competitors and better positions itself to onboard more clients and scale.</p>
 How Connecting to Open Banking Platforms Maintains Payroll Providers’ Security 
<p><a href="https://www.protocol.com/fintech/payroll-data-plaid-fintech">In contrast to the model described above</a>, payroll providers and employers open themselves up to risk when they send data used for verifications in batches and are stored with a third party. These methods leave them open to breaches because they house the data. This method potentially compromises employees’ private information by duplicating data and storing it in multiple places. However, connecting to an open banking platform through an API removes the necessity of sending data in batches. Instead, verifiers only need to access the data at the moment of verification. Thanks to real-time connections to accurate, data,no parties have to pass through the protection of an employer’s or payroll provider’s firewall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And when those APIs use secure authentication, such as OAuth, employees keep their credentials secret and secure. By partnering with an open banking platform, payroll providers protect themselves, employers, and consumers. Offering a secure experience also empowers employers and employees, and further sharpens the competitive edge already honed by connecting to an open banking platform.</p>
<p>Connecting to open banking platforms enables payroll providers to scale by delivering secure, streamlined, empowering experiences for HR teams and employees.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>At a very high level, the SCIM (System for Cross-Identity Management) protocol exists to provision and sync users and groups across various, independent systems. There is some room for nuance in the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7644">SCIM spec</a>. In this post we will take a look at some basic SCIM operations. We’ll peek under the hood at the flow between Okta and a SCIM server built in Flask using PostgreSQL as our app database. Even if you’re not a Python dev, hopefully you can take away some of the concepts in this guide for your own SCIM implementation.</p>

 What You’ll Need 

 
   <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html">virtualenv</a> 
   <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> 
   <a href="https://ngrok.com/">ngrok</a> 
 

 Setting Up the Flask Server and Postgres DB 
<p></p>

 
   Clone the repo found <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-scim-flask-example">here</a>, open terminal and <code>cd</code> into the project root. 
   Create a new virtualenv in the root folder with <code>virtualenv env</code>. 
   Run the virtual environment with <code>source env/bin/activate</code>. 
   Install necessary Python packages with <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>. 
   Install <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/download/">Postgres</a>. 
   Create a new Postgres database named <code>scim</code>. Enter the <code>psql</code> shell by opening a new terminal tab and typing <code>psql postgres</code>. Create the DB with <code>CREATE DATABASE scim;</code> (Run <code>\list</code> to double-check the database has been created). 
   Go back to the terminal tab that is in the flask app root. Run the following commands to create migrations and tables in the <code>scim</code> database:
     
       <code>python manage.py db init</code> 
       <code>python manage.py db migrate</code> 
       <code>python manage.py db upgrade</code> 
     

    <blockquote>
      <p>Feel free to hop back to your Postgres tab and run <code>\c scim</code> to navigate into the scim db, then <code>\dt</code> to see your new tables: <code>groups</code>, <code>users</code>, <code>link</code>. (<code>link</code> is a table facilitating the many-to-many relationship between users and groups.)</p>
    </blockquote>
   
   Everything should be set up now to run the server locally. Finally, run <code>python app.py</code> to do so. You should now have your SCIM server running on <code>http://localhost:5000</code>. 
 

 Set Up Ngrok to Route Requests From Okta to Localhost 

<p>Once you have ngrok installed, run <code>./ngrok http 5000</code> to create a tunnel from ngrok to your <code>http://localhost:5000</code>. Copy the <code>https</code> Forwarding URL created by ngrok as you will need it later.</p>

<p></p>

 Creating and Configuring Your Okta Application 

<p>Now it’s time to create a new SCIM integration in Okta. If your SCIM app(s) are already set up on the Okta side, feel free to skip ahead to <a>Test the SCIM Server</a>. There are two options that will work with this server, and I will ALWAYS recommend the first, which is to use an Okta SCIM template application.</p>

 Option 1: SCIM Template App 

 
   In your Okta dashboard, go to Applications -&gt; Applications, then click the Browse App Catalogue button. Search for SCIM 2.0 Test App (Header Auth) and click the Add button once you have it pulled up. 
   In the General Settings tab, click Next. 
   We will set this up as a SWA application, so in the Sign-On Options tab, click Secure Web Authentication. 
   Click Done. 
   Tab over to Provisioning and click Configure API Integration. 
   Check Enable API integration. 
   In the Base URL field, paste in the ngrok url you generated above with /scim/v2 appended to the end. In the API Token field, type Bearer 123456789. (Later on we will go over how to customize this auth header, but out-of-the-box, the SCIM server expects this value.) 
   
    <p>Click Test API Credentials and you should get a success message like the below:</p>

    <p></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>You can check the ngrok logs by navigating to <code>http://localhost:4040</code> to see the request from Okta as well as the response from the SCIM server.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p></p>
   
   
    <p>Click Save. Now your Provisoning tab will look a bit different.</p>
   
   Click Edit next to Provisioning to App and check off:
     
       Create Users 
       Update User Attributes 
       Deactivate Users 
     
   
 

<p>And Save.</p>

<p></p>

 Option 2: Enable SCIM Provisioning for Existing App Integration Wizard (AIW) App 

<blockquote>
  <p>Feel free to skip over this section to Test the SCIM Server if you set up your SCIM integration above.</p>
</blockquote>

 
   In your Okta dashboard, go to Applications -&gt; Applications, then click the Create App Integration button. For this setup we will select SWA - Secure Web Authentication. Click Next. 
   You can put whatever you’d like for the App Name and App Login Page URL, as we will just be loking at the SCIM functionality and not the SWA aspect of this app. Click Finish. 
   In the General tab of the app, click Edit and toggle Provisioning from None to SCIM. Click Save. 
   
    <p>Your app should now have a Provisioning tab. Tab over to it and fill out the integration settings to match those in the image below. Make the Authorization header 123456789. You can change this later in the SCIM flask app.</p>

    <p></p>
   
   
    <p>Click Test Connector Configuration and you should see the following success confirmation:</p>

    <p></p>
   
   
    <p>You can now click Save.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>You can navigate to <code>http://localhost:4040</code> to see the request from Okta on this request, as well as the response from the SCIM server.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p></p>
   
   Now your Provisoning tab will look a bit different. Click Edit next to Provisioning to App and check off:
     
       Create Users 
       Update User Attributes 
       Deactivate Users 
     
   
 

<p>And Save.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You should now be set on the Okta side to start testing the SCIM server.</p>

<p></p>

 What Did We Just Do? 

<p>Before we go ahead and test our SCIM server, let’s talk a bit about what we did in the setup steps above. Essentially we set up the following 3 components:</p>

<p></p>

<p>In this setup, Okta is the source of truth for user data. The SCIM server opens up four endpoints locally, which Okta is able to access thanks to the routing capabilities of ngrok. These endpoints are:</p>

 
   <code>https://localhost:5000/scim/v2/Users</code> 
   <code>https://localhost:5000/scim/v2/Users/{user_id}</code> 
   <code>https://localhost:5000/scim/v2/Groups</code> 
   <code>https://localhost:5000/scim/v2/Groups/{group_id}</code> 
 

<p>These endpoints trigger <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD operations</a> based off the requests from Okta. Some examples of these calls:</p>

 CREATE 

<p>Okta Examples:</p>

 
   When a user is assigned to the Okta app, Okta will make a <code>POST</code> to <code>/scim/v2/Users</code> 
   When a group is assigned to the Okta app, Okta will make iterative <code>POST</code>s to <code>/scim/v2/Users</code> with each member of the group 
   When using Push Groups to add a new group to the Okta app, Okta sends a <code>POST</code> to <code>/scim/v2/Groups</code> 
 

 READ 

<p>Okta Examples:</p>

 
   When importing users &amp; groups from the external app Okta sends a <code>GET</code> to <code>/scim/v2/Users</code> and/or <code>GET</code> to <code>/scim/v2/Groups</code> 
   When getting all (or filtered) users from the external app, Okta sends a <code>GET</code> to <code>/scim/v2/Users</code> 
   When getting a sole user from the external app, Okta sends a <code>GET</code> to <code>/scim/v2/Users/{user_id}</code> 
   When getting all (or filtered) groups from the external app, Okta sends a<code>GET</code> to <code>/scim/v2/Groups</code> 
   When getting a sole group from the external app, Okta sends a<code>GET</code> to <code>/scim/v2/Groups/{group_id}</code> 
 

<blockquote>
  <p>With the exception of import, these actions are initiated by Okta prior to a CREATE, UPDATE or DELETE action. You can think of these calls as a sync verification step.</p>
</blockquote>

 UPDATE 

<p>Okta Examples:</p>

 
   When updating user attributes in Okta, Okta sends a <code>PUT</code> or <code>PATCH</code> to <code>/scim/v2/Users/{user_id}</code> 
   When assigning or unassigning a user that already exists in external app DB, Okta sends a <code>PUT</code> or <code>PATCH</code> to <code>/scim/v2/Users/{user_id}</code> 
   When changing membership of a pushed Okta group, Okta sends a <code>PUT</code> or <code>PATCH</code> to <code>/scim/v2/Groups/{group_id}</code> 
 

 DELETE 

<p>Okta Examples:</p>

 
   When selecting “Delete the group in target app” after selecting “Unlink pushed group” in the Push Groups tab, okta sends a <code>DELETE</code> to <code>/scim/v2/Groups/{group_id}</code> 
 

<p>Let’s move on to testing the SCIM server to see some of these calls in action!</p>

<p><a></a></p>
 Test the SCIM Server 
<blockquote>
  <p>Note: I am using the SCIM template integration in the steps below. If you are using the AIW version, there may be subtle differences in some of the calls. More info <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/scim/scim-20/">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

 
   
    <p>Navigate to <code>http://localhost:4040</code> to see all the requests and responses taking place between Okta and the SCIM server. I will be truncating mine a bit in the examples below for brevity.</p>
   
   
    <p>From the section above, you saw that we set up our SCIM integration with Bearer 123456789 in the authorization header. You can change this header to whatever you’d like in the app.py file at the following line of function auth_required:</p>
   
 

<p><code>if request.headers['Authorization'].split('Bearer ')[1] == '123456789':</code></p>

<p>Replace 123456789 with whatever unique value you’d like and make sure to update this in the provisioning tab of your Okta integrations.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: This is just for convenience in testing - NEVER store sensitive credentials in source code. More info <a href="https://developer.okta.com/books/api-security/api-keys/keep-keys-private/#api-keys-keep-keys-private">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Authentication exists to protect your endpoints from unwanted requests. In this guide we set up header authorization, but you can also use basic auth or OAuth. This tutorial doesn’t delve too deeply into this aspect of SCIM.</p>
</blockquote>

 Assign a User 
<p>Under the Assignments tab, click Assign -&gt; Assign to People. I assigned user obi-wan.kenobi@iamciam.dev. Here is a look at the requests and responses from Okta to my SCIM server:</p>

 
   Okta Request: 
 

   <code>GET /scim/v2/Users?filter=userName%20eq%20%22obi-wan.kenobi%40iamciam.dev%22&amp;startIndex=1&amp;count=100
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>Okta will first run a GET with a userName filter query parameter to see if the user already exists in the external app, since no external ID for the user yet exists to link them to the Okta user.</p>
</blockquote>

 
   SCIM Server Response: 
 

   <code>200 OK
</code>   

   <code>{
    "Resources": [],
    "itemsPerPage": 0,
    "schemas": [
        "urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:ListResponse"
    ],
    "startIndex": 1,
    "totalResults": 0
}
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>This response tells Okta that the user does not currently exist in the database and thus informs the next call - a <code>POST</code> to create the user.</p>
</blockquote>

 
   Okta Request: 
 

   <code>POST /scim/v2/Users
</code>   

   <code>{
    "schemas": [
        "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User"

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: The above password value is randomly generated by Okta as many external apps require this value on user creation. As the app is federated, this password cannot be used to login.</p>
</blockquote>

</code>   

 
   Now If you navigate to your local scim database and run <code>select * from users;</code>, you should see the assigned user in the database. 
 

<p></p>

 Unassign a User 

<p>Let’s go ahead and unassign the user we just assigned in Okta. Under Assignments, click the X next to the user we just assigned:</p>

<p></p>

<p>The request/response should look like this:</p>
 
   Okta Request: 
 

   <code>PATCH /scim/v2/Users/289383d9-ff3a-48bb-99ea-3048762267c7
</code>   

   <code>{
    "schemas": [
        "urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:PatchOp"
    ],
    "Operations": [
        {
            "op": "replace",
            "value": {
                "active": false
            }
        }
    ]
}
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>Okta does not delete an unassigned user but rather updates their <code>active</code> value to <code>false</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

 
   SCIM Server Response: 
 

   <code>204 NO CONTENT
</code>   

 
   And sure enough, if you run that same <code>select * from users;</code> in the scim db, you will see the user is now <code>active: false</code>: 
 

<p></p>

 Assign a Group 
<p>Under the Assignments tab, click Assign -&gt; Assign to Groups. I assigned group Droids. Note that this behavior is similar to the way individual users were assigned above. Okta will iterate through the group membership and create the users in the external SCIM server - but the Group itself won’t be made. That is done in Push Groups, which we will handle later. Here is a look at the requests and responses from Okta to the SCIM server:</p>

 
   Okta Request: 
 

   <code>GET /scim/v2/Users?filter=userName%20eq%20%22c-3po%40iamciam.dev%22&amp;startIndex=1&amp;count=100
</code>   

 
   SCIM Server Response: 
 

   <code>200 OK

    "startIndex": 1,
    "totalResults": 0
}
</code>   

 
   Okta Request: 
 

   <code>POST /scim/v2/Users
</code>   

   <code>{
    "schemas": [

   SCIM Server Response:

   <code>{
    "active": true,
    "displayName": "C 3PO",

</code>   

 
   There are 3 members in my Droids group: C-3P0, R2-D2, and BB-8. The above req/resp chain repeats for the other 2 users. Now when I run <code>select * from users;</code> in the scim database I can see the assigned users: 
 

<p></p>

 Push Groups 

<p>As mentioned above, assigning a group in Okta only adds the users to my SCIM server, not the Group itself. Push Groups is an Okta-specific functionality. It gives you the granularity to assign Okta group members to a SCIM application without automatically adding that group to the external app. More info can be found <a href="https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/users-groups-profiles/usgp-about-group-push.htm">here</a> In order to add a Group to our external app, tab over to Push Groups in your Okta app integration. Click Push Groups -&gt; Find groups by name and select the group you assigned above. Make sure Push group memberships immediately is checked and click Save. Two calls should be made by Okta - one creating the group itself and another updating the group membership. Here are the requests and responses for my Droids group push:</p>

 
   Okta Request: 
 

   <code>POST /scim/v2/Groups
</code>   

   <code>{
    "schemas": [
        "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:Group"

<p>And you can view the link table, which displays the many-to-many relationship between the users and groups. You can see this with <code>select * from link;</code>:</p>

 In Conclusion 

<p>This covers the basic functionality of SCIM integration from Okta. Other use cases haven’t been tested extensively and may need tweaking over time, but hopefully, this guide helps developers to better understand Okta’s SCIM functionality.

Many of you who follow Holochain come from the cryptocurrency world, so naturally, you’re probably interested in Holochain as a platform for building new cryptocurrencies. But you probably also know that they won’t work like traditional cryptocurrencies. So how will they work? Using a technique called countersigning. Because every participant in a hApp has their own source chain, every transaction is a bit like a cross-chain atomic swap (not exactly, but close&nbsp;enough).</p><p>Paul has put together an incredible explanation on how countersigning will work on Holochain in the latest version update for Holochain.</p><p><a href="https://blog.holochain.org/countersigning-in-holochain-v0-0-103/">Read more on Countersigning in Holochain v0.0.103</a></p> Regular Holo Dev Updates on&nbsp;Twitter <p>If you are curious about the — hot from the press dev updates — those can be found on Holo&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/H_O_L_O_">Twitter.</a></p> Holochain is the Ideal Network for&nbsp;NFTs <p>Are non-fungible tokens the biggest thing in crypto ever?

We’ll see. But the prospect of immutably tracking ownership of things without centralized intermediaries certainly has people’s attention.

<p>For our 6th Close-up Magic meetup, we welcomed <a href="https://twitter.com/chris__lu">Chris Lu</a>, Co-founder of <a href="https://www.copy.ai/">CopyAI</a> to talk&nbsp;about:</p>  How No Code disrupts the tech&nbsp;industry  What CopyAI is and how it helps copywriting  Insights on being an&nbsp;investor  <p>Here are three of our favorite takeaways.</p> Key Takeaways  No code helps you move quickly, not creatively 💭 <p>In order to move quickly, the initial prototype of CopyAI was built with the No Code philosophy in mind. To Chris, No Code meant being able to use existing tools to create things that can be delivered to users as quickly as possible. The no code or low code tools CopyAI used were Webflow, Firebase, and&nbsp;Magic.</p><blockquote>“Magic is a no code piece of auth. Just one line of code and instantly you have complete authentication built&nbsp;in.”</blockquote><p>Although Webflow and Firebase helped the team build the initial prototype of CopyAI, they couldn’t provide them with the custom features they needed. This includes web sockets, real-time notification, and collaboration features. This is where some No Code or Low Code tools lacked; they weren’t advanced enough to give developers the freedom to be more creative.</p><p>Now the team is rebuilding CopyAI to move away from Webflow and Firebase, and towards React and their own database. This will allow them to improve the UX, the site’s performance, and even how the team works together.</p> CopyAI will help build a more creative world&nbsp;🎨 <p>CopyAI is an AI powered copywriting assistant. But the vision for CopyAI is much grander than&nbsp;this.</p><blockquote>“CopyAI’s vision is to help people run and grow their businesses not just in a marketing copy sense, but in all&nbsp;senses.”</blockquote><p>If you have a product in mind, CopyAI will make it easier for you to bring it to life in the most creative way possible. Pretty cool,&nbsp;huh?</p> When investing, keep an eye on Net Revenue Retention 📈 <p>I also got a chance to talk to Chris about his 4+ years of angel investing experience. Angel investing is when you invest your own money in the best companies, as early as possible. You’re pretty much betting on the company’s future&nbsp;success.</p><p>Chris’s favorite part about investing is being able to see how the inner functions of a company works to deliver value efficiently to their customers, and whether or not that value grows over time. He’s also fascinated by the different business models and how they each make a massive company or a small business.</p><blockquote>“Net Revenue Retention: If you don’t get any new customers, will you continue to grow, or will you&nbsp;shrink?”</blockquote><p>His advice on investing in successful companies is to watch out for a metric called Net Revenue Retention. This reflects the success of a company’s customer retention. You know your product is incredibly valuable when you continue to grow by some percentage, even if you don’t get any new customers.</p> Q&amp;A Session <p>At the end of the talk, we received a few great questions from our listeners, including this&nbsp;one:</p><blockquote>“Where do you see CopyAI going? Product Roadmap?”</blockquote><p>Curious to know Chris’ answer? Make sure to watch the recording of the fireside chat&nbsp;below.</p> Interested in Close-up&nbsp;Magic? <p>If you ever want to be a special guest for Close-up Magic and talk about a tech you’re passionate about, schedule a chat with Maricris&nbsp;<a href="https://calendly.com/magic-maricris/15min-1">here</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/recap-copyais-no-code-journey-4dc798b767fe">CopyAI’s No Code Journey</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 GiD Report#175 — Everyone wants an&nbsp;NFT <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-174-facebook-is-a-monopoly-again-ec2a4477d020">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p> This week:   The month of the&nbsp;NFT  Chart of the&nbsp;week  Stuff happens   1. NFT sales reach almost $1 billion in&nbsp;August Degen Ape NFTs on&nbsp;Solana<p>At this point, most people have heard of a non-fungible token (NFT), but for the still uninitiated, here’s a quick&nbsp;primer.</p><p>Your typical cryptocurrency, much like currencies in general, are fungible. All that means is that you’re happy to accept a like-for-like replacement if you own one. I’m happy to have any U.S. dollar — it’s all the same to&nbsp;me.</p><p>That’s not the case for non-fungible tokens, which represent unique assets. Your plane ticket — that’s technically an NFT. Trade your ticket with someone else and it means you’re sitting somewhere else on the&nbsp;plane.</p><p>That makes an NFT very suitable for digital art, content, and collectibles. And beyond that, these tokens have potentially countless use cases. Maybe it’s a collectible. Maybe it’s a ticket to an event. Maybe it’s a membership pass, functioning as gated access for a private community. Maybe it’s a way for creators to assign attribution to their&nbsp;work.</p><p>After a brief lull after the crypto correction in May, the market is once again exploding.</p><p>Visa just <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/23/why-did-visa-buy-a-150k-nft-why-does-anyone/">bought a cryptopunk for $150,000</a>.</p><p>Ripple is <a href="https://ripple.com/insights/evolving-ripplenet-for-a-tokenized-future/">leaning into tokenization</a>.</p><p>Facebook is talking about<a href="https://blockworks.co/facebooks-novi-digital-wallet-could-support-nfts-in-future-exec-says/"> including NFT support for its Novi wallet</a> later this&nbsp;year.</p><p>European soccer teams have <a href="https://protos.com/fan-tokens-socios-european-football-clubs-200m-selling-crypto/">sold over $200 million worth of tokens</a> to its&nbsp;fans.</p><p>Justin Sun <a href="https://www.morningbrew.com/daily/stories/2021/08/23/justin-sun-buys-nft-rock-half-million-dollars">bought a digital rock</a> for half a million dollars. Yes — digital rocks are now status symbols in the crypto community. Don’t&nbsp;ask.</p><p>And the success of NFT projects such as degen apes (again, don’t ask) on Solana has helped <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/solana-summer">skyrocket the speedy, scalable crypto token</a> to over $100. (Hard Yaka is an early investor in&nbsp;Solana.)</p><p>All told, August has already seen <a href="https://blockworks.co/nft-craze-rages-on-as-august-sales-near-900m/">NFT sales over $900&nbsp;million</a>.</p><p>Let’s not get it twisted — this bubble will likely burst at some point and a lot of people will get left holding the bag. But some will also likely hold lasting value. (Good luck picking the right&nbsp;ones.)</p><p>Speculation aside, the concept, the technology — that’s real. That’s sticking around. And we’re only just experimenting with the tip of the iceberg here. We haven’t yet grasped its full potential. But it will forever change the way we interact with digital things and each other on the internet.</p> Relevant:   <a href="https://blockworks.co/facebooks-novi-digital-wallet-could-support-nfts-in-future-exec-says/">Facebook’s Novi Digital Wallet Could Support NFTs in Future, Exec Says — Blockworks</a>  Via <a href="http://global.id/m">/m </a>— <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-24/facebook-fb-explores-nfts-as-part-of-novi-digital-wallet">Facebook Considers Building NFT Features Alongside Digital&nbsp;Wallet</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/23/why-did-visa-buy-a-150k-nft-why-does-anyone/">Visa Gives NFTs Their El Salvador Moment | David Z.

 At Anonyome Labs we value well-written code that has good tests. This is a guide on how we go about producing useful and meaningful tests for our Android code. 



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



 Testing approach: SDK or app? 



<p></p>



<p>Testing code isn’t a “one approach fits all” affair. The nature of the code you want to test will dictate the strategy you should employ. For example:</p>



  Building an SDK?&nbsp;<br>Unit tests that use a mock environment will give good coverage of hard-to-reach error paths, plus integration tests that run on Android device or emulator will exercise real world behaviour.  Creating an app?&nbsp;<br>Unit tests that use a mock environment plus Espresso visual tests that exercise all the visual elements and the screen-to-screen navigation will give you confidence all is well.  



<p>Your desire to test your code well will often mean you will structure your code in a way that makes it easier to test. It might make it a little more complicated than you had originally intended, by causing you to make parts of it replaceable when under test, but don’t be shy of this. Good tests will give you confidence in your code and give the next person who has to maintain it confidence they have not broken anything.</p>



 Unit tests that use a mock environment 



<p></p>



<p>Writing tests that run your code under the control of&nbsp;<a href="https://junit.org/junit5/">JUnit</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="http://robolectric.org/">Robolectric</a>&nbsp;with a mocking library, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/mockito/mockito-kotlin">Mockito</a>, will allow you to replace the code you didn’t write with mock or spy versions. When the tests run your code, they can check it made all the right calls. You can use these mocks to cause exceptions to be thrown from all the different places where an error can occur and check your code handles them correctly. In many cases, trying to test the error paths without using mocks and spies can be very difficult.</p>



<p>Imagine you have created a nice new API and you want to test it. Here is a very simple example:</p>







<p>At point&nbsp;A&nbsp;in&nbsp;MyApi&nbsp;you can see that the&nbsp;Worker, which simulates some other system your API needs to use, is provided to the API in the constructor which will allow you to override it in tests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here is a test you might write to exercise the API and check the API does what you intend under normal operation and that the error conditions are handled correctly under abnormal conditions:</p>











<p>At&nbsp;B&nbsp;in&nbsp;<code>MyApiTest,</code>&nbsp;a&nbsp;<code>mockWorker</code>&nbsp;is created that replaces the real&nbsp;<code>Worker</code>&nbsp;at&nbsp;C. This allows you to control the behaviour of the&nbsp;<code>Worker</code>&nbsp;and get it to misbehave when you need it to in the tests that check handling of error conditions.</p>



<p>At&nbsp;D&nbsp;in&nbsp;<code>MyApiTest,</code>&nbsp;the&nbsp;<code>fini</code>&nbsp;method is annotated so that it is run after (<code>@After</code>) each test (<code>@Test</code>). It checks that the test that has just been run has correctly verified that every interaction by your API with the mock has been accounted for with a&nbsp;<code>verify</code>&nbsp;call. This will trap any unexpected interactions by your API with the&nbsp;<code>Worker</code>.</p>



<p>At&nbsp;E&nbsp;in&nbsp;<code>MyApiTest,</code>&nbsp;the&nbsp;<code>mockWorker</code>&nbsp;is changed for just that test to throw an exception instead of returning a result. This allows you to check that all the error conditions that can occur are dealt with by your API.</p>



<p>Other interesting aspects to note about this test are:</p>



  The test methods have unusual names. They provide a description of what the test is doing and the expected outcome. They often have the form&nbsp;<code>`&lt;method name&gt; should &lt;do|not do&gt; &lt;something&gt;`.</code>  There are many powerful testing libraries that can make your test easier to read and maintain. The&nbsp;<code>shouldThrow</code>&nbsp;method is used to check that the&nbsp;<code>doWork</code>&nbsp;method throws an exception and that it is the the correct exception.  The comments&nbsp;<code>given</code>,&nbsp;<code>when</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>then</code>&nbsp;are encouraged because they make the tests easier to read and make it clear which part of the code is setup, invocation and checking for expected results.  



 Spy versus mock 



<p></p>



<p>There are situations where using a spy instead of a mock object may be beneficial. A mock is appropriate when you want to replace all the methods of an object. A spy can be used to replace a small number of methods on a real object. This is particularly useful on objects with many methods.</p>



<p>Imagine you have an API that uses&nbsp;<code>android.content.Context</code>&nbsp;which is a very common class with many methods.</p>







<p>And of course you want to test it well but mocking out the&nbsp;Context&nbsp;class would be tiresome — after all, your API only uses one method. This is where a spy is useful.</p>











 Testing on an Android device or emulator 



<p></p>



<p>Testing with mocks under the control of&nbsp;<code>JUnit</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>Robolectric</code>&nbsp;is a great way to really exercise your code, but it’s not the real world. Writing a test that runs on Android and makes use of the real environment will give you an extra level of confidence that you are using the right APIs on the platform and that you are using the environment correctly and have all the necessary permissions. This is very valuable when you are dealing with connections over a network, local databases or any other type of specialised API.&nbsp;</p>







<p>This test focuses on checking that the API operates correctly under normal conditions when run on an Android device or emulator. Interesting aspects of this test are:</p>



  The method names have to be proper Java identifiers to be run on Android.&nbsp;  A different runtime environment is required for on device tests (<code>@RunWith(AndroidJUnit4::class)</code>).  No mocks are being used.  



<p>It is possible that setting up an integration test that can authenticate with your servers to run the tests may be difficult. This will depend on the nature of your API and authentication mechanisms. Don’t immediately throw this in the ‘too hard basket.’ At Anonyome we design our systems so that we always have a test authentication mechanism that can be used instead of the production authentication system by developers during development and by automated tests. Naturally this must be done very carefully to avoid introducing a security hole, but if you can achieve this you will have a well-tested system in which you will have confidence.</p>



 Testing an app screen 



<p></p>



<p>When building an app, it is good practice to structure your code so that each screen can be tested thoroughly in isolation. Generally at Anonyome we use the VIPER design pattern for each of our screens. This pattern leads us to naturally break up the parts of each screen into pieces that can be easily separated. Each piece is supplied with the APIs it needs, usually at construction, making it easy to mock these pieces and then use the&nbsp;<code>verify</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>verifyNoMoreInteractions</code>&nbsp;methods to check we have accounted for all the places our screen interacts with other parts of the app.</p>



<p>Here is a simplified example of a screen implemented as a VIPER module:</p>







<p>Because the classes of the screen communicate to each other through interfaces, it is easy to test each part of the screen in isolation. Here is an example of how the presenter test might look:</p>







 Visual testing with Espresso 



<p></p>



<p>While it’s good practice to test all your screens in isolation with unit tests and mocks, this can’t give you confidence that your app actually hangs together. Unit tests can’t check that the flow of screens in your app is correct and that the right screen is shown in the right order. This is where visual testing with Espresso comes in.</p>



<p>Espresso tests invoke an&nbsp;<code>Activity</code>&nbsp;within your app and then simulate clicking on views, entering text, scrolling and all the other actions a real user would perform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are many&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso">articles</a>&nbsp;on how to write Espresso tests available on the Android Developers site and elsewhere, so I won’t repeat that material here.</p>



<p>When you start developing an Espresso test for the first time using the Espresso APIs you very quickly end up with a test with hundreds of lines of calls of the Espresso methods. This usually results in a long test that can be very difficult to understand for developers who have to maintain the code after you.</p>



<p>To combat this there is a pattern for developing Espresso tests that we have adopted at Anonyome. We use a robot pattern for our tests. Each screen of your app has an associated robot that knows about the controls of that screen and sometimes how to navigate to it from when the app is launched.</p>







<p>Using the robot the test becomes much simpler and easier to maintain:</p>







 Recipes 



<p></p>



 @VisibleForTesting 



<p>There may be parts of your app that you need to expose to test code so that it can check for correct operation. This can be done by making those parts more widely visible and annotating them with&nbsp;<code>@VisibleForTesting</code>which tells the IDE that only tests can exploit the wider visibility of this item.</p>







 Capturing arguments from calls to mocks 



<p></p>



<p>When using a mock there may be times that at the end of the test you want to check that not only was the method of the mock called but it was called with the correct arguments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you only want to check a few of the arguments of the call there is the&nbsp;<code>argThat</code>&nbsp;matcher that can help. In this example we want to verify that our code invoked an&nbsp;<code>Activity</code>&nbsp;with the correct action.</p>







<p>If you have more complicated checks that you wish to perform on the method arguments, you can capture the value(s) with an&nbsp;argumentCaptor&nbsp;and perform all sorts of checks. In this example we want to verify that our code invoked an&nbsp;Activity&nbsp;with the correct information inside the&nbsp;Intent.</p>







 Conclusion 



<p></p>



<p>If you are building an app, use a combination of unit tests and Espresso tests to give you excellent coverage and confidence your app is working properly. If it’s an SDK, then the combination of unit tests and integration tests will do the same.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To take advantage of the full power of mocks and spies in unit tests, you may have to structure your code so that is exposes the interfaces your code uses to communicate with other parts of the app or operating system. This will allow you to thoroughly check all the paths through your code.</p>



<p>Use the robot pattern to make your Espresso tests concise, readable and maintainable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How regulatory risk and growth go hand in hand</p>
<p>The fintech revolution has led to significant disruption in the financial services and banking sector. Through lower cost, fast development, use of better technology, and superior <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ekyc-europe-regulation-customer-experience/">customer experiences</a>, fintechs operating in every banking area have impacted the way banks innovate and customers bank.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As fintechs consider their growth plans, there are many factors to consider, such as international expansion, what type of additional licenses to obtain to expand their product suite and how to utilise the most innovative technologies. These considerations and subsequent decisions lead to increasingly complex regulatory requirements and more regulatory risk, specifically in the area of KYC and AML. fintechs must essentially balance between sustainable growth plans and taking on the right amount of regulatory risk. Without considering regulatory risks due to new licenses and international expansion, fintechs run the risk of a material impact on the business.&nbsp;</p>
 Regulatory risks every fintech should consider 
<p>The European eKYC mix varies by country, with different options, norms, and standards. Similar national identity systems in Scandinavia, such as BankID, make for a relatively easy international expansion for a fintech based in Denmark to expand into Sweden or Norway. However, most countries experience differences not just in national KYC regulations but also in how the majority of customers approach data privacy and views on using fully digital financial services. For example, a UK fintech looking to expand in Germany will need to consider different KYC regulations stipulated by the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/bafin/">BaFin (German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority)</a> and a higher proportion of customers who value digital privacy and may not have experience in undertaking digital KYC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A second risk involves acquiring new licenses to operate. In general, fintechs either hold an e-money institution, a banking license, or passport off the license held by a Banks as a Service (BaaS) provider.&nbsp; Fintechs tend to start with either an e-money license (EMI)&nbsp; or using a BaaS provider, as the time, resources, and capital requirements for a banking license are arduous. However, as fintech “grow up,” they acquire the coveted banking license, either by application or by acquiring an existing bank. When a fintech company becomes a licensed bank, there is greater regulatory scrutiny and requirements. Although the door is opened to offer a broader range of products and services such as loans and investments, new products are inherently subjected to greater risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A third risk applicable to fintechs is how to implement and potentially experiment with new technologies which could be subject to regulation. Fintechs pride themselves on their “digital-first” mentality. Specifically, fintechs operating in the cryptocurrency space, or using AI and Machine Learning for robo-advice or lending products, face a high risk of medium to long term regulation in how these technologies can be used in a financial services context, regardless of the type of license they hold.<br>
</p>
<p>Although fintechs face a range of regulatory risks as they scale, maintaining and re-assesing&nbsp;an effective risk management strategy and implementing future-proof KYC solutions are key.&nbsp;</p>
 Finding a future-proof solution to mitigate regulatory risk 
<p>An eKYC solution, such as AI-driven ID verification is one way fintechs can ensure they are mitigating regulatory risks at almost any stage of their growth plans. These solutions are highly customizable, ensuring that fintechs are adhering to the necessary KYC requirements based on their license, technology uses, and geographies they operate in, and provide a seamless customer experience, a critical factor as fintech disruption has been the result of putting a good UX front and center. Solutions that can also similarly <a href="https://www.idnow.io/aml-screening-monitoring/">AML screening and monitoring</a> with KYC can create a quicker, user friendly and memorable <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/customer-onboarding-banking-balance-security-ux/">onboarding experience</a>, ensuring fintechs keep ahead in the battle for user experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For fintechs from various areas, such as Buy-Now-Pay-Later companies, early and late stage cryptocurrency companies and fintechs with an EMI looking to broaden their product offering with a full-banking license, regulatory risk should be top of mind. In particular, mitigating risks through a future-proof KYC strategy are critical in ensuring the technological, product, legal and cultural growth of any fintech are aligned to the future vision and plans for growth. Looking to a customizable, future-proof eKYC solution, such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AI-driven ID verification</a>, can ensure that your fintech can seamlessly launch in new markets, mitigate significant changes in maintaining compliance with the addition of new licenses, and mitigate risks when using new and unchartered technologies.</p>

<p>Dit artikel van Gert Vasse is gepubliceerd <a href="https://www.ockto.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/p42-43-Gert-Vasse.pdf">VVP 4-2021</a>.</p>



<p>Innovaties moeten altijd even landen. Vaak duurt het even voordat het massaal omarmt wordt. Maar soms wordt het ook snel omarmd en gebruikt, en komt later meer oog voor detail.</p>



<p>De Inkomensbepaling Loondienst rekentool (IBL) is een voorbeeld van de laatste categorie. De tool is de afgelopen jaren in rap tempo door adviseurs omarmd. Het is de perfecte manier om vroeg in het adviesproces de consument al duidelijkheid te geven over het inkomen uit loondienst en daarmee de leencapaciteit. Met die zekerheid onder de arm kan de consument met een gerust hart gaan bieden op een woning.</p>



<p>De rekentool werd in februari dit jaar tijdelijk offline gehaald, tot afgelopen maand. Adviseurs en consumenten hebben dus 5 maanden lang extra inspanningen moeten doen om in deze verhitte woningmarkt snel de zekerheid te krijgen of het inkomen voldoende was voor die ene schaarse woning. En het was niet enkel de woningmarkt die verhit was.</p>



 Als de angst regeert 



<p>Velen van jullie hebben net als ik de kredietcrisis in alle hevigheid meegemaakt. “Dit mag ons nooit meer gebeuren, laten we zaken beter reguleren om herhaling te voorkomen!”. Met dat in het achterhoofd zijn vervolgens alle hypotheekprocessen en innovaties kritisch gewogen. Dat gebeurt, begrijpelijk, nog iedere dag. Maar soms schieten we met z’n allen in de stress en lijkt de angst te regeren.</p>



<p>Achteraf hoor ik van de grote meerderheid dat het een storm in een glas water was; zowel van hypotheekverstrekkend- als adviserend &amp; bemiddelend Nederland. En ook dat de angst voor overkreditering gelukkig niet is uitgekomen. Ondertussen zijn wel heel veel mensen druk geweest met audits, reviews van dossiers, etc. Het heeft vele verhitte discussies tussen de ketenpartners opgeleverd. Er zijn veel lessen geleerd, hoop ik…</p>



 Extra stempel in het rijbewijs 



<p>Goed, over tot de orde van de dag. We werken met z’n allen als professionals in de financiële sector. We mogen dus van onszelf verwachten dat we altijd zelf ook blijven nadenken over de wereld achter de innovaties. En accepteren dat er altijd bepaalde restrisico’s zijn die zich kunnen voordoen.</p>



<p>De adviseur is over het algemeen de enige persoon in het hypotheekproces die ook daadwerkelijk de consument spreekt. Dit specialistische paar ogen is zeer waardevol voor de consument, maar zeker ook voor de hypotheekverstrekker. De consument ken je pas als je ‘m hebt ontmoet, en de dialoog bent aangegaan over de woon- en hypotheekwensen. Innovaties voegen daar stapsgewijs waarde aan toe: de Inkomensbepaling Loondienst zorgt dat je met de klant aan tafel direct een groen vinkje krijgt voor het loondienstinkomen. Waarmee je als adviseur dus feitelijk een stukje werk van de hypotheekverstrekker mag overnemen, een bevoegdheid om heel zuinig op te zijn! Zie het maar als een extra stempel op het rijbewijs.</p>



<p>Het is dus niet zomaar een trial &amp; error tool: het is een stuk gereedschap dat enkel door pro’s gebruikt mag worden die donders goed weten wat ze doen. Deze pro’s kennen het klantdossier als geen ander én hebben als enige personen in het proces de klant gesproken over de bestendigheid van het inkomen, de woonwensen en de impact van eventuele levensgebeurtenissen.</p>



 Ode aan de Inkomensbepaling Loondienst 



<p>We hebben veel te danken aan de IBL rekentool. Adviserend Nederland kan eindelijk weer in een vroeg stadium een grote groep consumenten zekerheid geven of het inkomen voldoende is voor de woning. Ook hebben we de afgelopen maanden geleerd dat we als mens alert moeten blijven. Hopelijk schieten we niet weer met z’n allen in de stress bij een volgend incident. Want 1 ding is zeker: incidenten zullen er altijd zijn.</p>

 This is an ongoing series featuring Ontology’s Harbingers. Harbingers are exceptional leaders that help Ontology grow its community and ecosystem, making it an ever-stronger blockchain, and decentralized identity and data&nbsp;leader. <p>In the sixth interview in this series, Ontology speaks with <a href="https://twitter.com/alvinTIOx">Alvin</a>, administrator of our <a href="https://t.me/OntologyPH">Philippines Community</a>.</p> 1. How did you hear about Ontology? What drew you to Ontology? <p>I first heard about Ontology via a website called stakingrewards.com. I liked the idea of decentralized identity (DID) and also the staking reward opportunities.</p> 2. What made you become a supporter of Ontology and a champion of its&nbsp;brand? <p>I own some ONT tokens and wanted to give my full support. I like the Ontology brand and&nbsp;product.</p> 3. What do you see as the key role of a Harbinger? What is your favorite thing about being a Harbinger? <p>The key role of a Harbinger is to increase awareness about Ontology, grow the community, educate newcomers about Ontology’s products and earning opportunities, and answer any questions from the community.</p> 4. Why is being part of the Ontology community important to&nbsp;you? <p>Being part of the Ontology community is very important because I interact with other like-minded people and stay up-to-date with Ontology’s latest developments.</p> 5. How is Ontology’s community different from other blockchain communities? Is there anything that makes it stand&nbsp;out? <p>The Harbinger program. Other projects don’t have a community-oriented program like this. Ontology has a variety of local language communities to accommodate community members from different parts of the&nbsp;world.</p> 6. What do you use as your key channels for engagement with the Ontology community and why? Would you like to see any&nbsp;others? <p>Twitter, Facebook, and Telegram. I really want to have a YouTube channel as well but I don’t have enough funds to set one up. I don’t have a camera or microphone for live streaming. One day in the future I hope to be able to start a channel to help support Ontology.</p> 7. Can you share a memorable experience or something you’ve learned from being a Harbinger? What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Harbinger? <p>I received Ontology merchandise, including Ontology T-shirts, a bag and stickers. I earned these from my service as a Harbinger. My advice would be to get active in the project, study it and its products and share your knowledge with&nbsp;others.</p> 8. How would you describe the Ontology community in three&nbsp;words? <p>Growing, active, consistent.</p> 9. How do you think Ontology could expand its community going forward? What would you like to see more/less of? What kinds of things do you see community members do that you think help our community grow? <p>Doing AMAs is great but I would like to see it in all local communities, not only in the ONTO Wallet Telegram group. For example on Binancei, every time there is a new project, an AMA is held in all of their local communities.

 Sterke vereenvoudiging gemeentelijke dienstverlening door eenduidige procesvoering 



<p>BS&amp;F en Ockto breiden hun samenwerking uit. In het introductiejaar zijn al meer dan 20 gemeenten Ockto in combinatie met het platform Gezondverzekerd.nl van BS&amp;F gaan gebruiken om gemeentelijke regelingen op rechtmatigheid te toetsen. Beide partijen kijken terug op een succesvol jaar en intensiveren nu hun samenwerking met de ontwikkeling van één uniforme applicatie voor het gemeentelijke domein.</p>



<p>Met deze applicatie kunnen minima en kwetsbaren eenvoudig inzicht krijgen voor welke regelingen zij in aanmerking komen en deze via één uniform aanvraagproces eenvoudig aanvragen. De nieuwe applicatie biedt gemeenten een volledig geautomatiseerd toetsingsproces ten behoeve van een efficiënte uitvoering van deze regelingen. Met het ontwikkelen van één uniforme applicatie willen BS&amp;F en Ockto de&nbsp;versnippering van processen rondom gemeentelijke regelingen oplossen.</p>



 Eén proces voor alle gemeentelijke regelingen 



<p>Binnen de nieuwe applicatie hoeven gegevens slechts eenmalig, volledig AVG-proof, aangeleverd te worden via de Ockto-app. Daarmee worden de gegevens in één keer correct, volledig en digitaal aangeleverd. Via de Ockto-app haalt een inwoner de benodigde gegevens rechtstreeks op bij overheidsbronnen zoals de Belastingdienst en het UWV. Na toestemming van de aanvrager worden de gegevens verstuurd en direct ingelezen in de Backoffice applicatie van BS&amp;F, waar de gemeente de getoetste aanvragen kan inzien en behandelen.</p>



<p>De applicatie maakt op basis van de aangeleverde data direct inzichtelijk voor welke regelingen de inwoner in aanmerking komt. Zo worden behoefte voor aanvullende regelingen en kwalitatieve toetsing sneller bij elkaar gebracht en processen voor de vele verschillende regelingen gestandaardiseerd.</p>



 Reductie administratieve lasten van wel 60% 



<p>Dit levert een forse besparing op van de administratieve lasten bij gemeenten. Laurens Krol, directeur BS&amp;F: “In een Randstedelijke gemeente waar onder andere de toetsing wordt uitgevoerd van de Gemeentepolis leidt dit al tot een reductie van 60% van de benodigde capaciteit. Het inzetten van de applicatie voor de andere gemeentelijke regelingen biedt kansen voor verdere optimalisatie.”</p>



 Aansluiting met andere initiatieven in het sociale domein om versnippering te voorkomen 



<p>Andere initiatieven in het (gemeentelijke) sociale domein kunnen hun oplossing ook aansluiten op het BS&amp;F platform. Hiertoe wordt&nbsp;<a href="https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgezondverzekerd.nl%2F&amp;data=04%7C01%7Crob.janssen%40bsenf.nl%7Cea21f065027b4b90082208d948292322%7Cfd0a521d354d4e2db363f5d833376d6f%7C0%7C0%7C637620163791275099%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=ZotG01jZrFxvsCX6pKhzrpe6VxwE%2B1RQZMUmdcRTC30%3D&amp;reserved=0">Gezondverzekerd.nl</a>&nbsp;ook toegankelijk gemaakt voor andere partijen. Zo ontstaat er een brede samenwerking, die alle partijen in de keten van (schuld)hulpverlening ondersteunt om minima financieel, fysiek en mentaal fitter te maken en de uitvoering sterk te vereenvoudigen. Auke Dirkmaat, Head of Sales Ockto: “Hiermee wordt voor alle partijen het oerwoud aan regelingen inzichtelijk gemaakt in een uniforme oplossing voor alle regelingen binnen het sociale domein. Toegankelijk voor iedereen, op basis van betrouwbare gegevens die zorgen voor een enorme efficiëntieslag bij de toetsing op rechtmatigheid”.</p>



 Over BS&amp;F 



<p>BS&amp;F biedt al ruim 20 jaar toegang tot zorg en ondersteuning van kwetsbare inwoners. Via Gezondverzekerd.nl kunnen in meer dan 300 gemeenten inwoners met een laag inkomen een Gemeentepolis afsluiten. Onlangs kondigde BS&amp;F aan samen te gaan met Intermediad. Intermediad is marktleider in stadspassen voor diverse doelgroepen waaronder minima&nbsp;en ontzorgt met Bureau Minimaregelingen gemeenten in de uitvoering hiervan.</p>

<p>The growing digitalization of our lives means that we interact with thousands of apps, hundreds of companies, and possibly millions of users each year, depending on what we do&nbsp;online.</p><p>While these interactions have opened a world of possibilities, it has also greatly increased the risk of data breaches because we don’t know where our data and identities are stored, who accesses them, and where they are used. These concerns of privacy and security have led to the evolution of a framework called the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign identity</a> (SSI), where the owner of a data controls where his/her data resides, chooses where to use it, and determines with whom it can be&nbsp;shared.</p><p>The widespread implementation of SSI or any other framework for that matter requires a set of standards to make the data interoperable and to create an ecosystem that will leverage its power. One such standard implementation is the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/demystifying-decentralized-identifiers-dids-2dc6fc3148fd">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs) that uses claims or data objects called <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credentials</a>.</p><p>As a user, you might wonder why in the world you should embrace VCs and what’s in it for you. Well, here are some reasons to use&nbsp;them.</p> Follows the Principles of Decentralization <p>Verifiable Credentials put you right at the center of the system, as per the principles of decentralization.</p><p>Contrast this with some of the more prevalent systems such as the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/compare-and-contrast-federated-identity-vs-self-sovereign-identity-227a85cbab18">Federated Identity Management</a> (FIM), where the identity provider is at the center of the system and determines where and how data must be stored and used. Sometimes, these identity providers even decide which apps can be given access to your data, and in the process, creates a centralized and monopolized system.</p><p>But with VCs, the data owners determine the applications that can access their data. In fact, these owners sit in the middle of what’s called a trust triangle, thereby connecting the issuers and verifiers in an ecosystem.</p><p>Let’s understand this with an example. An individual (holder) has taken COVID vaccination at a healthcare company and the details of this vaccination have to be verified by airport authorities before the holder can board a flight. Here, the healthcare provider is the issuer and the airport authority is the verifier, and these two entities are connected by the holder, thereby making him/her the central point of the transaction.</p><p>Thus, VCs empower decentralization because every piece of data is owned and controlled by the individual holder and not by any single&nbsp;entity.</p> Interoperable across&nbsp;Systems <p>VCs are interoperable across many systems and can be used in almost every possible scenario. Here is a list of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-proof-of-concept-poc-for-verifiable-credentials-edf684b592f2">use-cases</a> where VCs can be used and PoCs developed based on&nbsp;them.</p><p>The biggest advantage of VCs is they are interoperable. Let’s say, you have your date of birth as a VC that’s stored in a digital wallet. Now, you can use this VC by itself to prove that you are above 18 years or you can combine it with other VCs to create a verifiable presentation and share it with the chosen verifier.</p><p>The number of places where you can use these VCs is virtually endless. Going back to the date of birth VC, you can show it as proof of age to buy alcohol or you can combine it with a bunch of other VCs into a verifiable presentation to open a bank&nbsp;account.</p><p>The possibilities and use cases are truly&nbsp;endless.</p> Secure and Authentic <p>VCs are a safe and secure way to ensure that your data is seen only by the intended recipient, which is often the verifier, though it can also be seen by companies to whom you choose to sell your&nbsp;data.</p><p>All VCs are secured by <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/role-of-public-key-cryptography-in-self-sovereign-identity-8c2dc37a2bf3">Public Key Cryptography</a> and digital signatures, so they can’t be seen by unauthorized entities. Further, these encryption mechanisms help the verifiers to attest to the authenticity of the data and the&nbsp;issuer.</p><p>In this sense, <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">VCs</a> are a win-win situation for everyone involved. It creates business opportunities for the issuer, secures the data for the holder, and ensures the authenticity of the data for the verifier.</p> Complete Control over your&nbsp;Data <p>One of the driving principles of SSI is data control and ownership, and VCs help to achieve&nbsp;that.</p><p>Typically, the issuer provides a VC to a holder, which is stored by the latter in a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/5-reasons-to-use-an-identity-wallet-c289ba2980cf">digital wallet</a>. The holder (which is you) has the power to decide what parts of a VC should be combined in a verifiable presentation sent to the verifier.</p><p>For example, if an issuer has given your full name, date of birth, and a government ID as a VC, using <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/deciphering-bbs-signatures-e853bbf437bf">BBS+ signatures</a>, you can just take one credential, say your government ID, put it in a presentation, and send it to the verifier.</p><p>That’s the level of granular control you have over who views your information.</p> Protects Privacy <p>One of the biggest issues with the current digital identity systems is a lack of privacy. Besides hackers, your online activities can be monitored by government agencies, your Internet Service providers (ISPs), and&nbsp;others.</p><p>But these issues are non-existent with VCs because every piece of information is digitally signed. The issuer encrypts the data using the holder’s public key, and this credential can only be viewed by the holder, thanks to the public-private key pair in digital encryption.</p><p>Hence, no one besides you and those with whom you want to share your data can encroach into your private&nbsp;life.</p> Meets Compliance <p>As governments understand the need for security and privacy, they are pushing towards a decentralized digital environment with the required legislation. A case in point is the EU’s Digital Wallet announcement and the&nbsp;<a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-a-verifiable-credential-based-ssi-implementation-meet-gdpr-compliance-5039d0149ea4">GDPR</a>.</p><p>As governments move farther on this front, you need a system that will meet these compliance requirements, and as you have guessed, VCs perfectly fit the&nbsp;bill.</p> Easy to Implement <p>VCs are easy to implement from a developers’ standpoint and easy to use from an end-user perspective.</p><p>Affinidi’s tech stack gives all the APIs and SDKs you need to build a VC-based application, and it also offers support to developers throughout the development process.</p><p>As for end-users, accessing and sharing VCs is easy too, as they can hold it in a digital wallet that’s controlled by them, and share it by combining it all in a verifiable presentation. A friendly UX can hide the complexities for the end-user, making it a breeze to securely share credentials with anyone in the&nbsp;world.</p> Power to Monetize your&nbsp;Data <p>VCs give you the option to monetize your data with the company you want. This provides two major benefits straight out of the box. First off, you get to make money out of your data instead of an identity provider raking in profits from your&nbsp;data.</p><p>Secondly, you know who is using your data and how it’s likely to be used. In this sense, you make money on your terms and through a company or way that’s most comfortable for&nbsp;you.</p><p>To conclude, VCs are likely to be a gamechanger and an integral part of the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/innovation-in-digital-identity-and-credentials-in-the-post-covid-world-f182a5743ce8">future</a> given the many benefits they offer to individuals, businesses, and the web ecosystem as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p>To learn more about VCs and how you can use them to build applications, reach out to us on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ffV5ctBMXr">Discord</a> or email&nbsp;us.</p><p>Affinidi provides building blocks for an open and interoperable Self-Sovereign Identity ecosystem.</p><p>Follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/affinidi/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/affinidi.devs">Facebook</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/affinidi">Twitter</a>.

<p>Per velocizzare le procedure di apertura di un conto Widiba, dallo scorso 21 giugno è possibile usare l’identità digitale InfoCert: pochissimi minuti per sbrigare le pratiche. Il direttore IT e Innovazione Daniela Pivato: “Puntiamo a rendere l’interazione col cliente più semplice, intuitiva e di valore”.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Ad oggi, sono più di&nbsp;21 milioni gli italiani in possesso delle credenziali SPID. Lo strumento è nato per rispondere alle esigenze dei cittadini di interfacciarsi in maniera smart ai servizi della Pubblica Amministrazione, ma oggi finalmente si registra un’altra &nbsp;importante svolta verso il settore privato.</p>



<p>Grazie al supporto di InfoCert infatti, Banca Widiba, l’istituto di credito “digital native” – che ha appena vinto il premio innovazione Abi per la digital transformation – aggiunge un nuovo tassello nell’ambito della strategia votata ai servizi innovativi, integrando la soluzione di InfoCert nella sua piattaforma per certificare l’identità dei clienti e i processi di contrattualizzazione.</p>



 Widiba e InfoCert insieme per una migliore customer experience 



<p>Widiba è la prima banca in Italia a sfruttare le potenzialità dello strumento SPID per aprire un nuovo conto bancario. Questa scelta è derivata anche da una lunga collaborazione con InfoCert, che già da anni supporta l’istituto di credito nell’acquisizione di nuovi clienti e nella gestione delle pratiche bancarie.</p>

 Sneller duidelijkheid over hypotheekaanvraag door online verzamelen documenten 



<p>Vanaf 31 augustus 2021 biedt De Hypotheker de Ockto-app aan al haar klanten aan. Hiermee onderscheidt zij zich in de markt door bronontsluiting als nieuwe standaard te hanteren voor het aanleveren van gegevens. Met de Ockto-app kunnen klanten via verschillende overheidsportalen zelf alle benodigde documenten voor een hypotheekaanvraag ophalen en verzamelen. Doordat al deze data via één digitaal loket worden ontsloten, zijn deze in één keer volledig beschikbaar, waardoor klanten eerder zekerheid krijgen over hun hypotheekaanvraag. Doordat alle digitale gegevens al zijn gevalideerd, kan de geldverstrekker de actuele en correcte documenten bovendien direct accepteren.</p>



<p>Met de introductie van de Ockto-app bood De Hypotheker een deel van haar klanten al sinds 2019 de mogelijkheid om documenten die nodig zijn voor de acceptatie van de hypotheekaanvraag, digitaal te verzamelen. Nu breidt zij deze dienstverlening uit naar al haar klanten, waardoor de Ockto-app de nieuwe standaard is voor het aanleveren van de benodigde hypotheekgegevens. Het enige wat klanten hoeven te doen, is de app downloaden, waarna zij worden gevraagd een QR-code te scannen in de Mijn Hypotheker-omgeving. Vervolgens wordt klanten stap voor stap meegenomen door de app. Per overheidsbron worden zij gevraagd met hun DigiD in te loggen om de documenten te ontsluiten.</p>



<p>Alle benodigde informatie kan op deze manier eenvoudig en veilig worden opgehaald &nbsp;bij verschillende <a href="https://www.ockto.nl/databronnen/">overheidsportalen</a>, zoals MijnOverheid, het UWV, de Belastingdienst en Mijnpensioenoverzicht.nl. De documenten worden vervolgens via Mijn Hypotheker direct in het systeem geplaatst. Daarnaast worden gegevens – zoals personalia, inkomens- en pensioengegevens – zo veel mogelijk automatisch ingevuld. Alle documenten worden opgeslagen in de <a href="https://www.ockto.nl/hypotheekacceptatie/">Ockto Brondata </a><a href="https://www.ockto.nl/hypotheekacceptatie/">Service</a>, een beveiligde database waar geldverstrekkers toegang tot kunnen krijgen voor het accepteren van de hypotheekaanvraag. Hiermee beschikken klanten over de zekerheid dat alle data veilig worden verzameld en gegevens niet worden opgeslagen. Ockto versleutelt alle persoonlijke informatie, waardoor alleen de partij die toestemming heeft de informatie kan inzien.</p>



 Snel duidelijkheid over hypotheekaanvraag bij De Hypotheker 



<p>Door de gevalideerde data kan een hypotheekadviseur in een veel eerder stadium zekerheid bieden over de hypotheekaanvraag. Dankzij een samenwerking met een groeiend aantal geldverstrekkers kunnen de ontsloten brondata na toestemming van de klant ook door deze geldverstrekkers worden opgevraagd. Omdat het door alle partijen gevalideerde brondata betreft, kan een aanvraag bij de samenwerkende geldverstrekker vrijwel direct worden geaccepteerd. “We zijn erg blij dat wij de Ockto-app vanaf nu standaard kunnen aanbieden voor alle hypotheekaanvragen: van de aankoop van een woning, het oversluiten van een hypotheek tot het financieren van een verbouwing”, zegt Jasper Cuijten, directeur Business Development van De Hypotheker. “Doordat zij alle brondata via deze app kunnen ontsluiten, bieden we klanten veel meer gemak tijdens het verzamelen en delen van alle gegevens voor hun hypotheekaanvraag. Samen met hun hypotheekadviseur doorlopen zij vervolgens in een aantal overzichtelijke stappen het financieringsproces, zodat zij snel zekerheid krijgen over hun hypotheekaanvraag.”</p>

<p>Are non-fungible tokens the biggest thing in crypto ever? Apparently, they are bigger than <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=NFTs+%22bigger+than+defi%22&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk020T7TNS77c1oHsAa0VVXY8uxGnHg%3A1627771163791&amp;ei=G9EFYYvUL-iE9PwP3P65WA&amp;oq=NFTs+%22bigger+than+defi%22&amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBwgjEK4CECc6BwgAEEcQsAM6BQghEKsCSgQIQRgAUJ2aAVj-nAFgkZ8BaAJwAngAgAGhAYgBiwSSAQMzLjKYAQCgAQHIAQTAAQE&amp;sclient=gws-wiz&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLzfiPsI7yAhVoAp0JHVx_DgsQ4dUDCA4&amp;uact=5">DeFi</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfZDS9XGl0A">Hip Hop</a>, and <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/polygon-studios-blockchain-gaming-nfts">Hollywood</a>. We’ll see. But the prospect of immutably tracking ownership of things without centralized intermediaries certainly has people’s attention. And, in many cases, their money: the first half of 2021 saw <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/nft-sales-climb-to-2-47b-in-first-half-2021-report">close to $2.5B in NFT sales</a>, with some tokens <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_non-fungible_tokens">going for millions apiece</a>.</p><p>I won’t try to make this article an NFT explainer, but the basic idea is that NFTs are meant to be unique representations of ownership of an object. Objects can be digital, like a particular tweet or image file, or, in principle, physical, like a house. </p><p>To date, NFTs have been versions of smart contracts, meaning they are programs that execute particular functions using a blockchain-based computing network such as Ethereum’s. For example, an NFT might have not only a means of its ownership being transferred (with that record then stored on the blockchain), but also of a royalty being automatically sent back to the original artist every time that happens (with payment sent automatically by the blockchain network).</p><p>So, it might seem that NFTs rely on blockchain technology. It turns out, though, that NFTs are more straightforward, more versatile, and more efficient to run on Holochain than on blockchain. In this article we look at three ways this is true and why. But first a word on what it means for something to be ‘fungible’.</p> On Fungibility <p>When an item is fungible, it’s interchangeable with other instances of the item:</p>  A can of soup is more-or-less interchangeable with other cans produced from the same batch.  A brand-new tennis racket is more-or-less interchangeable with other brand-new rackets of the same make and model.  Units of a currency are designed to be interchangeable with all other units of that currency.  <p>Items in real-world systems, meanwhile, are rarely fungible:</p>  An acre of land isn’t interchangeable with other acres of land. This is why we have title records that rely on wordy descriptions of property, containing latitudes, longitudes, landmarks, and other surveyor notes.  Your favorite houseplant isn’t interchangeable with similar plants.  Friends are not interchangeable, despite what our Facebook counts might imply.  <p>Actions are also not interchangeable:</p>  When someone says “I love you”, it’s not equivalent to when someone else says it, or even when the same person says it at a different place and time. The meaning and value of the statement is inherently connected to the context in which it was spoken.  When someone dunks a basketball, it’s a unique dunk at a unique moment in time. The two points are equivalent to all the other points scored in the game, but the play has more nuance and more value than just the points scored: it provides momentum, it makes highlight reels, and it might build fan excitement or star power in a particular way that a different dunk in a different moment does not.  <p>And, of course, physical artworks and acts of art are not fungible: paintings, hand-made sculptures, particular performances of a piece of music.</p><p>What about a digital work? This one is a little trickier, because digital works can be easily replicated. But the movement toward NFTs is predicated on an idea that someone can declare a digital work to be scarce– “there will only be one NFT representing this basketball highlight clip” or “I will sell only 50 NFTs representing this painting” – and then the item, or at least its representation(s), are made scarce by that act. The token(s) representing the digital work are non-fungible.</p><p>Alright, with that established, here are three reasons NFTs make a lot of sense on Holochain.</p> I. Holochain NFTs are Efficient <p>Because blockchains are historically designed to manage interchangeable units of currency, there’s no inherent function to make units unique. When Alice spends 10 Bitcoin from her wallet, there’s no way of identifying whether the units she’s spending are ones she got from Bob, Carol, or elsewhere. It’s like water scooped into a bucket: when you scoop some out, you don’t know which inbound scoop of water the molecules you’re getting came from.</p><p>So in order to create a unique representation of something, an additional layer must be created: smart contracts that uniquely identify assets and keep the NFTs distinct from one another as their ownership is transferred. The idea is to make sure that a particular token isn’t just a representation of a certain piece of art; it is the token representation of the piece of art.</p><p>Holochain is different in its principle of provenance: every piece of data, everything ever said or done, is associated with its source. This means that every piece of data, including every token, is inherently unique – the data itself plus its source information – so no additional code is required to keep instances of data distinct from one another. Thus, an NFT on Holochain is an extraordinarily simple application: it’s just a transfer protocol, a means of assigning the token from one person to another.</p><p>Holochain’s built-in uniqueness saves on all kinds of work and costs relative to blockchain-based NFTs – developer work, storage work, and especially computing work, all of which lead to energy consumption and cost. We <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/blockchain-a-holochain-perspective/">wrote previously</a> about how blockchain’s need to reach global consensus results in substantial costs (usually called gas fees), transaction delays, ecological impact, and other inefficiency challenges. With NFTs this is even more the case, since blockchain NFTs are <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/true-or-false-a-single-nft-can-power-a-european-household-for-1-5-months">particularly energy-intensive</a> relative to ordinary transacting. Plus, as with all blockchain smart contracts, nodes are required to retain all transaction data forever, so there’s a hefty storage cost in addition to computing cost. And that’s to say nothing of storing the actual digital works that NFTs often represent.</p> II. Holochain NFTs Can Store the Actual Digital Work <p>Blockchain-based NFTs are not the actual file they represent, nor do they contain the actual file they represent. The digital work needs to be stored somewhere else – somewhere public – in order for it to be clear what the token represents. But how meaningful is it, really, to own a token of something that anyone else can access and download for themselves any time?</p><p>It’s no wonder that people question the point of NFTs and debate whether an item that’s not actually scarce can just be declared to be scarce and sold as such. Sure, there’s a case for saying the answer is yes – after all, that’s sort of what money is – but wouldn’t it be better if it were possible to buy and sell the actual unique digital file along with the NFT? Then there’s just no question.</p><p>Holochain makes that possible because files can be stored privately on one’s own personal ledger of events known as a source chain. The record representing the file’s ownership is made visible to the network, along with maybe a thumbnail of the image, but the file itself does not need to be published, even as the two are inextricably linked. This way, an artist can create a digital asset that is truly unique (or limited to a certain number of ‘prints’). When an NFT is signed over to a new owner, the actual file can get sent along with it, without sharing a copy with the world, similar to transferring a physical art piece.</p><p>It’s also easy to create ‘replicas’ of the digital work – versions that can be published widely that differ just a bit, visibly or invisibly, from the original(s). This way, the work can still serve a public purpose and/or become widely known, even as the ‘real’ version, which might be the highest-resolution version, lives safely with its owner… again, just like in the physical art world.</p> III. Holochain NFTs Can Represent Real-World Works and Property <p>How do we know for sure that a blockchain-based NFT represents the work it claims to represent? For digital works the mechanism is reasonably reliable: a unique ‘hash’, or fingerprint, of the digital file is created and stored as part of the token. But for non-digital works, the mechanism breaks down. There’s no way to be sure that the NFT you’re buying is the NFT that corresponds to the piece of land, the boat, or the painting in question. It’s a version of blockchain’s oracle problem: with everyone being anonymous and no central authority, it’s virtually impossible to incorporate real-world events (such as the creation of a painting) into on-chain events (such as designating a token to uniquely represent the painting). For this reason, blockchain-based NFTs have so far focused on digital works only – quite a major limitation.</p><p>Whereas blockchains try to provide anonymity, Holochain is optimized for accountability. Holochain’s provenance means that it’s always evident who created the NFT; its creation is digitally signed by the creator’s private keys. If an NFT supposedly represents The Starry Night, you can check to see if it was created by Vincent Van Gogh, or (more likely) the Museum of Modern Art. Of course you might have some real-world homework to make sure that the MOMA was the rightful owner of the painting at the time of the NFT’s creation, but records already exist for that, and in any case it’s a much smaller problem than one in which anyone can anonymously create an NFT claiming to represent the painting.</p><p>(Yes, you’d also need a reliable way of knowing that the private key account claiming to be the museum is actually the museum, but this is easily accomplished through <a href="https://hackmd.io/Y4QSGqn6T_amCvHv6T9f6A">Holochain’s identity protocols</a>.)</p><p>If someone else is trying to sell you The Starry Night, you can readily see the chain of ownership within the NFT’s published records, all the way back to the MOMA if this is the legitimate NFT. So not only are you sure that this NFT truly represents the painting, but you’re also sure that the person claiming to have the current right to sell it truly does.</p> The Future of Ownership <p>With the ability to represent real-world objects, the implications of Holochain NFTs extend well beyond artworks to all kinds of property – land, homes, and vehicles, for starters – pointing to a future of ownership that is digital, reliable, and independent of centralized government records. </p><p>Right now, every time you buy a house, or even refinance one that’s already yours, you pay thousands of dollars for agents to search a patchwork of municipal records systems, to make sure that the property description (still) accurately describes the property and that the title is free and clear. Title insurers currently collect <a href="https://www.firstresearch.com/industry-research/Title-Insurance-Carriers.html">$16B annually in the U.S alone</a>, mainly to ensure that property owners have the rights to sell the property they’re selling (and insure against the possibility that they don’t).</p><p>None of that is necessary in the Holochain age. Each piece of property can simply be referenced by a digital identifier, which could be called a token, that is created by the property’s originator and passed through immutable transfer protocols when a sale is made. Like all data on Holochain, the NFT data is hosted by the owner of the property. (Or on a peer hosting network such as <a href="http://holo.host">Holo</a> – but still affiliated with the property owner’s private signing keys.) The data is then ‘published’ (shared) to a table that is also held among the members of the network.</p><p>Government clerks could still sign every property transfer; we’re not talking here about eliminating municipal systems necessarily, or at least not eliminating them prematurely. But the government no longer needs to manage and host a whole bunch of offline or online infrastructure, and people retain authoritative copies of their own records.</p><p>Permissions can also be set so that owner information is shared only on a need-to-know basis, which could be useful in particular for vehicles, where we expect more privacy than with property ownership.</p><p>There’s precedent for this kind of scenario already. Estonia has converted its property records to being hosted on immutable hash chains. But Estonia did need to build new infrastructure to pull this off, plus the records are still relatively centralized, with government agencies remaining a <a href="https://medium.com/@joshmzemel/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-communication-31bf1866e193">point of enclosure</a> (concentrated power) as well as still incurring overhead that needs to be paid for one way or another.</p><p>When everyone can just speak for themselves about their right to sell their property, with their speaking instantly verifiable just by looking at the record they’re presenting, the tracking of ownership becomes quite simple. So does shipping and logistics, which isn’t chain-of-ownership but is still chain-of-custody: imagine simplified tracking of who delivered what to whom when, making <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resources,_Events,_Agents">REA accounting</a> easy (HoloREA is building such tools [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uDrVLt4oN8">short video</a>|<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4xcaYnI9iY">full video</a>|<a href="https://github.com/holo-rea/holo-rea">Github</a>]) as well as improving supply-chain transparency so you can tell where your food, electronics, and other products came from.</p><p>More broadly, provenance around custody is a version of provenance around information: we <a href="https://medium.com/holochain/is-holochain-a-safe-haven-for-dangerous-extremists-or-a-beacon-of-hope-for-accountability-fcbb8f5d38c6">wrote previously</a> about the idea of a Holochain-powered verified web, in which signal (accurate information) is discernible from noise (potential disinformation) because no one can ever claim something was said that wasn’t, or claim something wasn’t said that was.</p><p>It might seem like a stretch to categorize provenance of all information on Holochain, property-related or otherwise, as a version of ‘NFTs’. But, from a technical standpoint, it’s actually not. Every communication and transaction on Holochain, whether it’s sending money, transferring property rights, or ordering a sandwich, is inherently non-fungible because data is always associated with stamps of time and authorship. This makes every entry of data, effectively, a unique token. Thus, Holochain isn’t just an ideal framework for NFTs; it builds the properties everyone wants from NFTs into everything. From a Holochain vantage point in which all data is already unique, the very idea of making data unique, which is what blockchain NFTs jump through hoops to try to do, may begin to seem like an artifact.</p>

<p>With many places such as restaurants, schools, and gyms now checking for COVID credentials in the U.S., we wanted to remind our users that GlobaliD currently has a quick and easy method for storing your vaccination record card with your digital identity.</p><p>Simply add the COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card self declaration (Identity tab→ [+] → Personal) in your GlobaliD app. You will be asked to take photos of your vaccination record card. Only you have access to the stored imagery, which you can share as necessary to prove that you’ve gotten your vaccination.</p><p>Of course, there are limits to this approach. The main issue is that there isn’t a convenient way to verify the authenticity of the vaccination card, <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2021-08-20/global-black-market-for-fake-covid-19-vaccination-cards-flourishing">a growing problem</a> as some companies, schools, as well as the government have implemented vaccination mandates.</p><p>This implementation was always going to be a stop-gap solution.</p><p>And so today, we’re super excited to talk about the future of where the GlobaliD credentials platform is&nbsp;going.</p><p>The new and improved GlobaliD credentials platform</p><p>The existing GlobaliD verifications platform is undergoing a major upgrade — a new self-sovereign identity (SSI) framework, of which the first implementation has already been&nbsp;built.</p><p>The primary benefit of this new system is interoperable, portable, verifiable credentials that groups can issue and that users can carry with them across platforms and borders. This new framework will not only be much more scalable but also industry backed — thanks to the work of the Linux Foundation’s Cardea Project, which is working on global standardization around COVID credentials. (GlobaliD is <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-joins-the-linux-foundations-cardea-project-22f29803224">a founding member and part of the steering committee</a>.)</p><p>In case you missed <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-joins-the-linux-foundations-cardea-project-22f298032240">the announcement</a>, this is what the Cardea Project is all&nbsp;about:</p><p>Cardea is a complete ecosystem for the exchange of privacy-preserving digital credentials, open sourced as a project in Linux Foundation Public Health. Launched by Indicio.Tech, Cardea provides an easily verifiable, trustworthy, unalterable proof of health tests or vaccination that can be shared in a privacy-preserving way. Cardea easily integrates with existing health systems to ensure trusted data sources for credentials and uses decentralized identity technology to enable better control of data for individuals.</p><p>With our new platform, we’ll also be releasing a brand new COVID credential. Users will be able to validate the authenticity of their digital vaccine record from around the world and store the proof of the validation as a credential in their GlobaliD app. The user would then be able to present this proof in the interoperable format within the Cardea ecosystem and beyond. However, GlobaliD will not stop there. Because GlobaliD also enables verification of government IDs, verification of ownership of the vaccine digital record will also be possible by comparing personal information from both documents in a privacy preserving way.</p><p>Indicio.Tech, the firm that launched Cardea (and also a GlobaliD partner), is already working on active pilot implementations in <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/sita-indicio-pave-way-to-safer-travel-experience-with-launch-of-aruba-health-app/">Aruba</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/indicio-and-liquid-avatar-technologies-launch-canada-s-first-privacy-preserving-decentralized-technology-for-sharing-health-data-827748977.html">Canada</a>.</p><p>An interoperability hackathon</p><p>On September 9, GlobaliD will be participating in an interoperability hackathon — Cardea’s Interop-athon:</p><blockquote><a href="https://cardea.app/">Cardea</a>, the COVID credential project hosted at Linux Foundation Public Health, is going to host an “Interop-athon” on September 9, 8:00 am to 12:00 pm Mountain&nbsp;Time.</blockquote><blockquote>As Cardea is now being commercially deployed to share COVID-19 test results, vaccination, and trusted traveler credentials, it is important to facilitate and showcase the interoperability among these projects. To this end, Cardea will host a four-hour interoperability “hackathon style event”. The maintainers of Cardea will stand up a test environment including an Issuer, Mediator, Government, and Verifier Agents for participants to test against. Participants can also bring their own decentralized network!</blockquote><p>GlobaliD will be demoing an early implementation of our latest version of the COVID credential.

MetaMUI is the 1st Identity-based blockchain to truly enable regulated, identity-based Peer-to-Peer (P2P) transactions, it can be used as the cornerstone for most financial offerings, with its high versatility and support for custom-developed use cases that enable Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) implementation and issuance easily on the MetaMUI CBDC platform.</p><p>MetaMUI completely redesigned the blockchain-based on SSID technology. By combining the SSID and blockchain token mechanism, MetaMUI was able to create a new identity-based CBDC system that can protect user’s privacy while providing an identity-based transfer system that can satisfy travel rules and other regulatory requirements such as Know your customer (KYC), Anti-money laundering (AML) and Counter Financing of Terrorism (CFT).</p><p>In SSID, the user’s personal data is stored and controlled by the user. This data never leave the user’s device without prior consent. This is a radical shift from the most centralized and incompatible identity systems that are widely used today. In line with these constraints, MetaMUI has developed its blockchain technology around Self-Sovereign Identity&nbsp;(SSID).</p><p>MetaMUI Blockchain uses a hybrid system of high-performance digital cash and high-security digital checks. This hybrid architecture allows MetaMUI’s blockchain to be used in global-scale applications, including central banks, digital stock issuance, digital currency exchanges, non-fungible tokens, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>We utilize our indigenous multi-ledger architecture — which means that each digital currency generated on MetaMUI Blockchain will have its own blockchain ledger.

 Interview Credify’s Head of Compliance Bruno Sivanandan 



<p>Vietnam is preparing to implement its new <a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=2a984c37-100b-498c-895a-81cdb0412c7e">Decree on Personal Data protection</a> at the end of 2021. Currently, it already has many regulations that govern the collection, receipt, transmission, and use of data, still many cases of infringement persist. In this interview, we had a discussion with Bruno on what Vietnamese businesses can expect and prepare for themselves when the decree comes into practice.</p>



<p>From his early working experience, Bruno soon realized the difficulties of companies to adapt their systems to such regulations. Now being the Chairman of Eurocham Digital Sector Committee, Bruno can bring discerning insights to Vietnamese businesses affected by this new decree. He also shares his case study at Credify on data compliance that can save many businesses in transforming their system architecture and coping with the growing complexity of the digital economy.</p>



<p>*Disclaimer: The comments of this article only reflect the opinion of Bruno Sivanandan and by no means those of the Eurocham or the Digital Sector Committee. Moreover, they are based on the draft decree and will be only relevant provided the actual decree does not change extensively comparatively to the draft.</p>







 What do you think about this new decree on personal data in general? 



<p>The draft Decree on Personal Data Protection is to be analyzed in relation to an array of policies pertaining to data and privacy protection, such as the Cyber Security Laws or the Decree 72 on the management, provision, and use of Internet services and online information. This regulation is absolutely necessary for Vietnam, where the digital share of the economy is growing dramatically. Without clear rules and guidance, it is likely that personal data would be handled inappropriately. This would leave the privacy of the citizens at risk and, on another scale, limit the perspectives of the inclusion of Vietnam in the global economy.</p>



<p>We are currently witnessing forced digitization of the economy, especially in Ho Chi Minh, with the strict regulations related to COVID-19. We always use more services and those are always handling more sensitive data… Even our financial and health data transit through applications nowadays. The framework in which these internet-based services operate has to ensure our safety and privacy. This is the challenge Vietnam is tackling with those regulations.</p>



 What would be the impact on Vietnamese people, to specify, the consumers and data owners? 



<p>The daily experience of the users will not change much. The main difference would be that upon accessing a service, users will have better information about why their data is collected, and to whom it is provided. The idea is that citizens be confident that any digital service they access on Vietnamese soil will respect their privacy and that authorities will actually enforce infringements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, citizens will be entitled to specific rights on their data they can use to force a service provider to erase their records or print out their data for them.</p>



 What does this decree mean for Vietnamese firms? How would it impact their business? 



<p>The private sector is likely to be the most impacted by the decree on Personal Data Protection and related laws mentioned above. Companies that are processing personal data will have to obtain a license to do so. First, this license will require proof that one’s system is secure enough, preventing hackers from getting their hands on the intimacy of the citizens. Secondly, companies need to prove that they are processing the data legitimately, i.e that the user gave his consent with sufficient details about the processing itself. Thirdly, that all the third parties involved in processing the data are themselves compliant.</p>



<p>In practice, such requirements are very costly to set up and enforce. Ideally, it means that all companies processing personal data, and that is a lot of companies, should be audited before having a license to operate, which is absolutely impractical.</p>







<p>However, where to find such resources is a problem that every single country is facing, amid a rise in cyber attacks. Only wealthy corporations are able to pay for such massive transformation projects.&nbsp; But what about the rest of the economic actors, how can we build a trusted network? We need new services on the market that lower the cost of compliance to acceptable levels. That is where Credify enters the dance!</p>



 What does this decree mean for international enterprises located both in Vietnam and overseas? 



<p>This is the million-dollar question. Cross-border data transfer is a Gordian Knot nobody has slashed at the moment. The most formidable example is probably the Privacy Shield breakdown by the Schrems II court decision. This means that European and American companies are not able to legally exchange personal data since the 16th of July 2020… it is obvious is the million-dollar question. Cross-border data transfer is a Gordian Knot nobody has slashed at the moment. The most formidable example is probably the Privacy Shield breakdown by the Schrems II court decision. This means that European and American companies are not able to legally exchange personal data since the 16th of July 2020… it is obvious that we have a problem here. This is one of the main topics we are working on at the Digital Sector Committee, we are working on solutions with the input of relevant governmental bodies.&nbsp;</p>



 What measures from governments can be taken to enhance the practice of this new decree? 



<p>Governments, in general, need to issue guidance that is as clear as possible for businesses to follow. From general legislation that states the spirit in which the law has been written, there is a need for precise “how-to” manuals for each industry. For example, in the e-commerce industry, what are major platforms supposed to do? How are they supposed to make sure their system is secured and that users are sufficiently aware of what is going on with their data?&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is where we mix the legal field with the IT engineering field, and typically where Best Practices need to be detailed measures by measures. The best way to achieve this is to let experts in each industry gather in working groups and issue “Codes of Conducts” for their peers to follow. Such precise guidelines clarify what exactly needs to be implemented to gather a user’s consent, encrypt a password, protect your system from an array of cyber attacks, and so on.</p>



“Only wealthy corporations are able to pay for such massive transformation projects.&nbsp; But what about the rest of the economic actors, how can we build a trusted network?“



 What advice would you give for Vietnamese businesses to prepare before the decree comes into effect? 



<p>Any business needs to have a digital transformation strategy, the Covid crisis has only accelerated a trend that has been ongoing for a few decades and made it critical to have one! In my opinion, the main elements are to focus on what is your core business and to outsource the rest to companies you trust. One example is the cloud computing services: most companies prefer to outsource this responsibility to trusted companies like AWS, Azure, GCP, it has become too costly and even less secure to buy your own servers, build your data center, cool it, assess the personnel, maintain backups and so on… If it’s not your business, leave it to people who focus on it!&nbsp;</p>



<p>The methodology I advise is first to map your system, document all the business processes, the data each one is handling, under whose supervision, and so on. This is tedious work, but it will serve as the basis of any compliance program for the Vietnamese regulation, the GDPR, an ISO certification, and much more.&nbsp;</p>







<p>The most impacted businesses are obviously those relying on personal data to provide their services. It is especially important for such companies to convey to their users the exact list of sensitive data they are processing, for what purpose, and with the help of which subcontractor(s). At the scale of a company, it is challenging to keep this documentation up to date, as it requires real discipline from the workforce.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A general thought process is to imagine an auditor inspecting the system of your company. The auditor will want to make sure that every data flow is secured with adequate technical measures, relative to the sensitivity of the data. It is up to the company to be able to demonstrate their compliance.</p>



 How is Credify responding &amp; contributing to this new decree on data protection? 



<p>If you were to remember one idea of this article, I would go with that one: Credify is an enabler for the economic actors to take part in the digitization of the economy with minimal effort, leaving the burden of compliance to Credify.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Credify has a cutting edge technology to transfer data between two systems with a high level of security while dealing with consent gathering and audibility. The vision of Credify is two-fold: first create a trusted network of companies relying on personal data, enabling them to access personal data sitting in another system while complying with the regulation, the details of how to comply are dealt with by Credify, that is our serviceX product. Secondly, empower the user with their data, that they can use to access different services, that is idX.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The level of security required to operate this data bridging service is extremely high, and one needs to add all the constraints mentioned above that come from the regulation. It becomes clear that handling sensitive data is becoming a craft of its own. Companies will need a reliable partner to do it, just like they do with Cloud computing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is where Credify displays its value! We are building a network where members can exchange users’ data securely, under the supervision of the users. This enables, with minimal efforts, traditional businesses to make a first step in the digital economy, or for tech-savers businesses to dramatically enhance the exposure of their services in the trusted network of Credify.</p>



 About the Head of Compliance 



<p>As the Chairman of Eurocham Digital Sector Committee, Bruno takes the role of enabling members of the committee to express their opinion about the Vietnamese Digital regulatory Landscape. Their purpose is on one hand to clarify the regulation for the business community, and on the other to give their opinion on key policies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He earned his Computer Engineering degree in the National Institute of Applied Sciences of Lyon, a leading engineering university in France. He then had a diverse experience when decided to come to Vietnam, step out of the engineering world and try himself at doing business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bruno is now the Head of Compliance of Credify. Thanks to the knowledge he brings about data protection and privacy regulation, coupled with his insights from being the chairman of the digital Sector committee of the European Chamber of Commerce, and his IT background, Bruno can share a valuable perspective on the products and strategy of Credify.</p>



<p>Credify’s products, idX and serviceX, both have data privacy and cyber security at the core of their design. Therefore, Bruno’s role is to help streamline the production processes of the company to ensure everything we ship is secured, as well as designing the contractual structure with our customers to fit in the regulatory landscape that is being built.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On another hand, he is involved in gathering intelligence about the potential markets Credify can reach through this new industry of “data bridging”. This intelligence is then projected in the way we package our technology for the actors of e-commerce, insurance, finance, healthcare etc.</p>

    Important COVID-19 announcement.
  
  <br><br>
  
    Before we dive into explaining this amazing opportunity, we don’t want to waste your time. So, if you don’t have Australian citizenship or permanent residency, or if you are representing a recruitment agency, remote worker or offshore provider, then this is not for you. This role is based in Adelaide, Australia and requires the successful candidate to also have the necessary work experience and visa status and living in South Australia. Unfortunately, with the current COVID situation in Australia, the changing conditions and closed borders present too much uncertainty to candidates outside of South Australia.
  
 

<br><br>




 




<a href="https://www.meeco.me">Meeco</a> is looking for a&nbsp;Senior Multimedia Specialist&nbsp;for&nbsp;our&nbsp;Australian&nbsp;team, where you can contribute to the success of our product team developing our globally awarded personal data platform. The Meeco platform is comprised of suite of products including a decentralised wallet, key management store, exchange for identity, credentials &amp; tokens and secure data enclave (vault).




 




At Meeco we build the tools to enable people and organisation to access, protect and create mutual value from personal data. We are personal data pioneers offering a range of solutions powered by Meeco and decentralised on Hedera Hashgraph.




 




We are passionate about building a new digital economy where data is not refined, as is done with oil, for power and profit, for the benefit of a few mega corporations. Rather, we are committed to finding a new equilibrium where people and organisations enter a relationship of mutual value and build a new, more meaningful way to personalise digital services. <a href="https://www.meeco.me/manifesto">Read our manifesto</a> to learn more about our thinking and the vision that drives us.




 




We have built a diverse team, and we welcome everyone. Our team is spread across Australia, Belgium and the UK. Collectively we come from diverse cultural backgrounds, speaking a range of languages, and each bring a unique personal data story that advances our mission.




 





 About the role 




This is an exciting opportunity to apply your expertise with a technology scale-up working to improve the world! Meeco is a growing team of 25 people based in Australia, Belgium and the UK and we are looking for a senior Multimedia Specialist to join our Adelaide based design team.




 




This role is ideally suited to someone who has commercial experience and is excited and passionate about communication and multimedia and how these can be used to help humanise technology.




 




You will be working closely with our executive team including our CEO and report to our Chief Experience Officer. Alongside an experienced (in person team) you will be involved in the full communication design process. The following will help you understand what you’ll be doing on a day-to-day basis:




 




As Meeco’s Multimedia Specialist, you will be responsible for both creating both internal and external communications and all projects involving the creation of digital media. You will be the first point of contact for communications and coordinate external communications with the CEO and Chief Commercial Officer. Your duties will include creating concepts for new designs, providing cost estimates, and ensuring all content meets our guidelines and security requirements.




 




This role will have client contact, therefore excellent communication and presentation skills are critical. You will be required to coordinate with clients at a variety of levels and across functions and oversee client expectations to accurate and timely delivery, including the following responsibilities:




 




• Oversee the production of digital media including videos, website development, online advertising, and email marketing




 




 •  Assisting in analysing, specifying and developing Meeco’s digital and on-line strategy including plans, guidelines and monitoring for quality and alignment to brand




 




 •  Create computer animation, audio, video and graphic image files for multimedia presentations for Meeco’s and client’s digital and web assets




 




 •  Maintain Meeco’s websites and web applications, including web programming, scripting, authoring, content management and file management




 




  •  Manage Meeco’s Digital assets (e.g. LinkedIn, Telegram, YouTube, Wistia, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Hootsuite) including posting, moderating and maintaining branded content




 




 •  Provide multimedia support for Meeco and industry events, including key notes, trade shows and conferences




 




 •  Take briefs from internal stakeholders and external clients and foster long-lasting relationships with them




 




 •  Ensure all stakeholders and clients are updated on the delivery of digital campaigns

 •   Develop Meeco iconography, and visual language in line with Meeco’s brand and style guides




 




 •   Prepare and develop internal learning materials which may include product guides and FAQs




 




 •   Contribute to the design library for the Meeco Developer Portal




 




 •   Manage multiple projects simultaneously




 





 Information security 




Meeco is an accredited ISO27001 organisation. Information Security sits at the centre of everything we do internally and for our partners. Therefore, and understanding of information security, access management, quality assurance and security communication will be highly regarded. As would experience in the preparation of communication systems for security monitoring and audit.




 




Additionally, you will work closely with Meeco’s engineering team to ensure that security protocols are followed for digital assets and hosting websites, including backup and disaster recovery.




 




This will include designing, developing and coding with other specialised inputs, such as image files, audio files and scripting languages, to securely produce, maintain and support Meeco’s digital assets.




 




We use a variety of industry standard tools including Figma. It is not a requirement that you have experience in using any of these tools, but a willingness to learn and self-directed education is required.




 





 About you 




We are looking for someone who is an experienced multimedia professional with a minimum of 5 years’ demonstrable experience.




 




We build applications for the internet of tomorrow, a place where personal data is placed right at the centre, protected start to finish. This means we often tackle questions that have no established technical or design solutions.




 




Meeco is an environment with more questions than answers. If you are drawn to original problems, which require imaginative solutions, you’ll feel right at home. This does require you to be open for and comfortable learning new things and develop proof-of-concepts on short timelines, identifying the tasks that matter the most. English is our primary language, but as we work with European clients, having the command of other European languages is a huge plus.




 




The following is our wishlist. It is not necessary that you have all this experience, but the more you have or can pick up quickly will increase your chances of success in the role:




 




 • Be able to demonstrate a genuine interest in UX/UI, either through your study or personal projects




 




 • A tertiary qualification in the marketing field and/or a Bachelors degree (or equivalent) in the communications field, ideally a majors in multimedia




 




 • Experienced in using design tools such as Figma, Sketch, Affinity or Adobe design suite and Content Management tools such as Webflow and WordPress (including migration)




 




 •  Solid copywriting skills as well as editing and proofreading




 




 •  Experience working across different time zones, where English maybe the second language for many of your colleagues. An understanding of Dutch or French would be highly desirable




 




 •   A technical understanding of English to assist in the proof-reading and editing of content or experience in English language teaching would be a bonus




 




 •   Demonstrated understanding of what a Design System is along with keeping up to date with the latest marketing, UI/UX design and usability trends and techniques




 




 •  Experience writing and reviewing internal policies, including security and audit documentation




 




 •  Understand and have experience with web development technologies such as Javascript and CSS.




 




Whilst Meeco supports remote work, this role will be based in our Adelaide Office. Given the collaboration aspects of this role, we would like you to be in the office at least three-four days a week.&nbsp;At other times&nbsp;you are free to work where you work best.




 




We have team members in Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney in Australia, London (UK) and spread out in Belgium. An important reality is that this can often mean early mornings or long days.&nbsp;




 




We have flexible hours, so you can design your day around being an early bird or night owl. For six months of the year the time difference with Europe can feel brutal, and then the other six months when Europe is on summertime it is much easier. However, being able to work across time zones and be self-directed is a critical aspect of this role.




 




We value people who can work independently, are able to manage themselves, are supportive to each other and not afraid to ask for help when needed.&nbsp;We love you asking for help!








  What we offer 




We pay a competitive start-up&nbsp;package&nbsp;based on your experience and seniority in line with the existing members in the team. As we are still building our foundation team, additional incentives such as Options are available for the right person.




 





  What we have achieved

Funding; our founder bootstrapped the company for the first two years before raising private equity. We have runway and revenues, so the focus for us now is building awesome products and helping our partners adopt them.




 




Brand &amp; Reputation: We launched our first product into the market in 2014 and have built a strong brand in the personal data community.

If you would like to know more about the exciting stuff we are working and have in store, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CM8tuZW5YU">check out this recent webinar</a>.




 




Awards: We have won&nbsp;nine&nbsp;international awards in Australia, UK, Netherlands and Germany for personal data management, identity, innovation and FinTech services.




 




Market: We recently launched a media platform&nbsp;for kids&nbsp;called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.miks-it.com/">mIKs-it</a>&nbsp;and a decentralised Wallet to support identity and verifiable credentials. These are just two great examples of how enterprises and other start-ups are using our technology to developer better Privacy and Security by Design personal data solutions.




 




Innovation:&nbsp;Over the past year we have grown&nbsp;our engineering team along&nbsp;with some really interesting&nbsp;blockchain/distributed ledger&nbsp;projects&nbsp;which we are currently&nbsp;productising and been launching throughout&nbsp;2021.

<p>Asset passports are more than object identities — they are dynamic tools for designing commerce using legal and software engineering.</p><p>The explosive growth of DeFi (decentralized finance) in the blockchain ecosystem has showcased the incredible power of “money legos” in building out an open, permissionless, and borderless alternative to traditional finance. At the time of writing, the total value locked in these protocols has exceeded $85 BILLION. Yet all of this value is largely speculative, facilitating little in the way of actual commerce or social&nbsp;impact.</p><p>Bringing the programmable and combinatorial nature of these open financial protocols to commerce in the real world could revolutionize how people access and provide goods and services in the years to come. But how do we bridge these two&nbsp;worlds?</p><p>The foundation of the Mattereum Protocol, the Asset Passport provides a powerful and composable legal-tech framework by bundling together warranties around goods and services which can broaden and secure the design space for digital commerce.</p> Warranties: The Legal Lego of Asset Passports <p>The Mattereum Asset Passport (MAP) was<a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/introducing-the-mattereum-asset-passport-72f28c9ba6f1"> originally presented</a> as a digital identity for physical things. The idea was to use legal and software engineering to create a persistent digital identity for goods rather than people. Tethering an object with a cryptographic key pair would enable a secure evidence chain of interactions and transactions around an object, securing provenance and value for years to come. The design methodology stems from the<a href="https://iang.org/papers/intersection_ricardian_smart.html"> Ricardian contract framework</a> developed by Ian Grigg, which allows us to secure and execute property rights in virtual and physical space through dual integration of legal contracts and software.</p>The Ricardian “Bowtie”&nbsp;Model<p>In the process of gathering the data, certifying authenticity, cryptographically signing agreements (warranties) on the blockchain, and storing all documentation on IPFS, we realized that this design framework was very modular and customizable, on both the legal and technical side.</p><p>The key modular element of the MAP is the warranty. Each warranty covers various terms of a contract, ranging from identity, terms of service, arbitration, vault condition, tokenization, carbon offsets, and eventually even anti-slavery certification.</p><a href="https://passport.mattereum.com/ntfa.20210319.100.alpha.001.150768/">https://passport.mattereum.com/ntfa.20210319.100.alpha.001.150768/</a><p>With the Ricardian framework, we can bind warranties together around an object over time, securing value and accountability while maximizing utility.</p><p>Let’s explore these areas in more&nbsp;detail.</p> Asset Passports Give Objects Accurate and Lasting&nbsp;Value <p>Securing the value of property is a core purpose of MAPs. We can look at two distinct but related elements which enable this within the Mattereum Protocol: digital provenance and trust communities.</p><p>Blockchain-Enabled Provenance Creates an Enduring History of&nbsp;Trade</p><p>By using the Ricardian framework of using cryptographic signatures to bind contracts and software, we can bring together all warranties around an object or service in such a way that any transaction or change to the documentation is recorded in a cryptographically secure and verifiable evidence chain of activity.</p><p>And since we use the public and global infrastructure of a blockchain shared ledger in tandem with immutable, distributed file storage via IPFS instead of traditional client-server databases, there is a much higher confidence in the integrity and accessibility of that data for years and decades to&nbsp;come.</p><p>Instead of relying solely on paper certificates of authenticity or siloed ledgers across individuals and organizations, we can immortalize the information of an object’s ownership history on the most secure networks on the&nbsp;planet.</p><p>Trust Communities: Distributed Trust Networks Secure Value &amp; Reduce&nbsp;Doubt</p><p>One of the innovations which arises from the MAP is the Trust Community, a peer-produced alternative to centralized certification methods whereby a network of independent certifiers provides digital warranties to facts within the MAP over time. All claims are backed by financial stake, putting skin in the game and adding weight to their assessments. In blockchain parlance, Trust Communities can be seen as mini-DAOs for securing product information.</p><p>Without a durable and incentivized trust framework like Trust Communities, commerce on the Internet suffers from the “doubt discount.” Lack of trust and certainty impairs the value of goods online, costing sellers an average 20% per exchange.</p><p>Mattereum Trust Communities, built upon the composable, legal-tech framework of the Asset Passport, restore value, increase liquidity, and bring peace of mind to digital commerce.</p> Asset Passports Create Accountability in Digital&nbsp;Commerce <p>A clever and powerful aspect of the MAP’s design is how the dual-integrated, legal-transactional framework creates crystal-clear lines of accountability: between buyers, sellers, certifiers, and other third parties (custodians, C02 offset markets). Whenever an entity interacts or transacts with the asset, they show intent to honor a shared agreement by signing the document with a cryptographic key.</p><p>When multiple parties sign a shared agreement in this way, an interwoven evidence chain of signatures is produced which is cryptographically secure and verifiable. Ian Grigg has referred to this process as “entanglement.”</p><p>Now what happens when things go&nbsp;wrong?</p><p>In the event of a commercial or systemic fallout, any party within the MAP can file a claim for breach of a warranty which is then presented to a designated arbitration court to settle. Applicable in 150+ countries under the 1958 New York Convention on Arbitration, this digital dispute resolution framework enables near universal legal enforceability of the contracts that comprise an Asset Passport.</p><p>This arbitration clause is included in the core contract of the MAP, waiting to be invoked if things go&nbsp;south.</p> Asset Passports Give Objects More&nbsp;Utility <p>In a world littered with hundreds of billions in stranded, underutilized goods, passported objects are not only more valuable than their zero-history counterparts but are also more useful. Without a system akin to the Asset Passport, goods drastically lose their value in the secondary market and either gather dust at best or end up in a landfill at&nbsp;worst.</p><p>An object with an MAP is imbued with more potentiality, as we can then program value flows and structure social protocols which unlock its full potential. This can encompass all scales of value: a socket wrench shared by a neighborhood, a treasured art piece secured in a vault, or even a forest that owns&nbsp;itself.</p><p>Using warranties which connect to smart contracts, we can bring blockchain innovations in finance and governance into the real world. From various forms of tokenization to collective ownership and management of assets, we can create new modes of value creation that oscillate between the realm of matter and the realm of&nbsp;bits.</p><p>It’s warranties all the way&nbsp;down.</p><p>Warranties within a MAP give us a composable design space for commerce on the Internet. We can offset carbon emissions behind the production and use of goods, bind an asset to a smart contract (tokenization) to mint digital assets of varying utility (physical NFTs, securitization, etc.), obtain risk protection, and provide digital dispute resolution in the case of commercial or systemic fallout. And this is simply what we’ve built to&nbsp;date.</p><p>What started as “digital identity for physical things” became a framework for programming value flows around goods and services as well as structuring the social protocols around them: a precursor to the Mattereum vision of <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/introduction-to-smart-property-ecb446268f23">smart property</a>.</p><p>Join us as we build new experiences in this exciting new frontier of digital commerce!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/composable-commerce-with-mattereum-asset-passports-4e102f85139a">Composable Commerce with Mattereum Asset Passports</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 UPDATE: 1 September — KILT’s crowdloan is&nbsp;closed.  We hit our max cap of 220,000 KSM very quickly on 1 September at 3pm CEST, and further voting for KILT is not possible. <p>We were thrilled to see the early excitement from our community, with more than 12k contributions voting for KILT since 27 August, when we launched the voting with the below announcement.</p><p>KILT aims to secure slot #6. The auction continues through Wednesday 8 September at 11:00 GMT which includes the candle&nbsp;phase.</p><p>Earlier post is&nbsp;below.</p><p>If you’ve got your KSM ready, head over there now and vote for&nbsp;KILT!</p><p>To vote in KILT’s auction&nbsp;bid:</p>  KSM holders can lock their KSM for KILT via the <a href="https://fearlesswallet.io/">Fearless wallet</a> or <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama.api.onfinality.io%2Fpublic-ws#/parachains/crowdloan">Polkadot.js</a> — see instructions below.  If you want to support us and your KSM is currently being used for staking, unstake&nbsp;now.  If you don’t own KSM and want to participate, you need to purchase KSM and start voting for KILT&nbsp;then.  The minimum crowdloan contribution for KILT is 0.1&nbsp;KSM.  <p>Kusama crowdloans are run as candle auctions. For this reason, we encourage our community to enter their bids up to September 3rd at 9:00 GMT. Afterwards, you can continue to support KILT with additional bids until the auction ends on September 9 at 9:00&nbsp;GMT.</p> KILT’s crowdloan reserve <p>KILT is bidding for an 8-period parachain slot; when secured this lease will last for 48 weeks total. Participating in a crowdloan means the KSM you lock is unavailable to you during the unlocking, bidding, and parachain lease&nbsp;period.</p><p>Transferring or staking KSM is not possible during this time. We’ve set aside a crowdloan reserve of 4.5 million KILT Coins in order to say “thank you” for your support. This reserve is set aside for distribution by the KILT governance when KILT is decentralised. BOTLabs, the entity behind KILT Protocol, will vote in the parachain auction process but is excluded from this&nbsp;reserve.</p> KSM&nbsp;:&nbsp;KILT <p>The maximum cap for KILT’s crowdloan is 220,000 KSM; when 220,000 KSM is received no further bids will be accepted.</p><p>KILT’s crowdloan reserve is set aside for the governance to divide among the crowdloan supporters (excluding BOTLabs). This means that if governance follows our proposal and the maximum cap is achieved, you can get a minimum of 25 KILT Coins per 1 KSM that you bid in support of KILT’s parachain slot. If the maximum cap is not achieved, you would receive even more. Everyone who voted for the successful KILT bid would receive these coins regardless of when their KSM was&nbsp;placed.</p><p>When the parachain slot expires, or in the event that KILT is not successful in obtaining a slot within the 6–10 auction period, the Kusama crowloan module automatically returns your KSM to your wallet within 8&nbsp;weeks.</p> Step-by-step guide <p>First, you need to buy KSM or use the unlocked KSM you already have. Then decide if you want to participate via Polkadot.js or the Fearless&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Instructions for both are&nbsp;below.</p> Polkadot.js: If you have a KSM&nbsp;account <p>If you have available KSM on Polkadot.js, go to the <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama.api.onfinality.io%2Fpublic-ws#/parachains/crowdloan">crowdloans</a> page on Polkadot.js and click “Contribute” in the column on the right next to KILT Spiritnet.</p><p>This will open up a pop-up&nbsp;window.</p>  Select the account you wish to contribute from.  Select the amount of KSM you wish to contribute.  Click “Contribute” (bottom&nbsp;right).  <p>You will then be asked to sign and submit this transaction.</p><p>Congratulations — you’ve now successfully voted for the KILT parachain slot!</p> Polkadot JS: If you don’t have a KSM account&nbsp;yet <p>If you don’t already have a KSM account on Polkadot.js, set one up by following the steps <a href="https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000098878-how-to-create-a-dot-account">outlined here</a> and watch the how-to video. (Ignore the “DOT” header — the process is the same for DOT and&nbsp;KSM).</p><p>When you go to <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer">https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer</a> to begin the process, make sure you switch to the Kusama network before you follow the instructions.</p><p>You can do this by clicking on the network on the top left (see&nbsp;arrow).</p><p>This opens up the network options. Click “Kusama &amp; Parachains”.</p><p>This opens up the Kusama network options. <a href="https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000169778-how-to-switch-network-nodes">Select a network</a> and click “Switch”.</p><p>When the Kusama network loads, click “Network” in the top bar, and “Parachains” in the dropdown.</p><p>Click on the “Crowdloan” tab.</p><p>This opens the list of active crowdloans. Then follow the instructions at the top of this section for contributing to the KILT crowdloan.</p><p>That’s it!</p> Fearless Wallet <p>Set up an account with Fearless Wallet; download links are on their website <a href="https://fearlesswallet.io/">here</a> and you can ask any questions on <a href="https://t.me/fearlesswallet">their Telegram here</a>. You can buy KSM directly via Fearless Wallet as part of the setup&nbsp;process.</p><p>When your account is securely set up, go to the “Crowdloans” tab at the bottom of the&nbsp;screen.</p><p>Select KILT from the list of ACTIVE crowdloans.</p><p>Add the amount of KSM you wish to bid. This view will indicate the network fee, estimated reward, and leasing period. You can also see the crowdloan info specific to KILT, such as the amount raised, time left and a link to the KILT crowdloan page.</p><p>Tap “Continue” to&nbsp;proceed.</p><p>Check that the amount you are adding to the KILT auction bid is&nbsp;correct.</p><p>Tap “Confirm”.</p><p>It’s that simple to add your KSM to the KILT auction bid via the Fearless&nbsp;Wallet.</p> Helpful resources from Kusama and&nbsp;Polkadot <p>If you haven’t participated in a Kusama parachain auction before, it’s very important to DYOR (do your own research!) to become more familiar with the process. We strongly recommend taking a look at these Kusama and Polkadot resources:</p>  Kusama: <a href="https://kusama.network/auctions/">Parachain Auctions overview</a> and video <a href="https://youtu.be/YrTxDufrcQM">How to Participate in Crowdloans on&nbsp;Kusama</a>  Polkadot: <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/mirror-learn-crowdloans">Crowdloans Wiki</a>  Polkadot Decoded: General overview “<a href="https://youtu.be/sxju74QqYuA">Auctions, Crowdloans, and Parachains, Oh&nbsp;My</a>!”  <p>All our crowdloan information is available on the “<a href="https://www.kilt.io/crowdloan/">Crowdloan</a>” section of KILT’s website.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/balaganski">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>The idea of low-code/no-code (LC/NC) application development seems to be extremely popular nowadays, to the point of it almost becoming a marketing buzzword similar, say, to “Zero Trust”. For decades, creating “proper” application software was a complex and tedious process that required qualified professional developers to produce even the smallest app. Organizations only had two choices: either purchase an existing off-the-shelf product from a software vendor or commission an internal or external development team to design, code, test, and deploy a custom application. Well, that or write an Excel macro…</p>
<p>LC/NC strives to change this dichotomy by offering a third choice: let business people build their own custom apps just by using a graphical design tool, choosing from a library of existing building blocks, or maybe even let artificial intelligence do the heavy lifting. The users, or “citizen developers” as they are now called, would only need to provide their domain knowledge, with no coding skills required.</p>
<p>In theory, the idea is great: every accountant, doctor, business analyst, or HR employee should be able to solve their small daily problems of finding the right information, doing a small calculation, or automating a back-office task without the need to involve software developers. There are so many potential use cases for LC/NC solutions and so many opportunities for software vendors to attract new customers with their citizen development offerings!</p>
 Do not trust the label! 
<p>Unfortunately, the market for these solutions is still in the very early stages of maturity – the diversity of products being sold under the “low-code/no-code” label is astounding. Anything ranging from sophisticated integrated development environments and robotic process automation platforms to glorified scripting tools and even chatbots – anything passes for LC/NC nowadays. This makes finding the right tool for a specific use case very difficult and, of course, only further increases the danger of Shadow IT – having an uncontrolled zoo of low-code tools in an organization is just as dangerous as letting your employees use unsanctioned cloud services.</p>
<p>However, the security and compliance implications of current-generation low-code platforms are much larger than that. First of all, “proper” software developers do not just write code. They are responsible for the full life cycle of their applications, from early design to implementation, operations, monitoring, fixing bugs and vulnerabilities, and, last but not least, protecting apps from attacks and preventing security breaches.</p>
<p>Low-code platforms must be able to implement all these capabilities, but even better than traditional software platforms because the customer simply does not have a team of citizen DevOps engineers and citizen security analysts. Even the largest enterprises that do have such teams at hand usually don’t plan to involve them in their citizen developer projects. After all, the biggest selling point of such projects is that business people can use them directly, without relying on their colleagues from IT.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most solutions currently available on the market seemingly do not focus too much on these challenges, as some of the recently discovered problems indicate. Just a few days ago, <a href="https://www.upguard.com/breaches/power-apps">multiple data leaks</a> were reported in Microsoft Power Apps – a popular suite of apps, services, and connectors, as well as a data platform, that provides a rapid development environment for custom business apps.</p>
 The dangers of "shadow citizen development" 
<p></p>
<p>Although the platform provides a number of tools to enable user authentication, configure access permissions for tables that hold data, and so on, these controls were not enabled by default, leaving many apps created by customers completely exposed to anonymous access via the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/odata/">Open Data Protocol</a> API. Since all customer apps are hosted on subdomains of the same domain and the API endpoint address is fixed, the security researchers were able to quickly discover hundreds of affected companies and over a thousand lists with sensitive data such as passenger contact information, healthcare records, and even Microsoft’s own internal business data.</p>
<p>This particular data breach was quickly contained but who knows how many others are waiting to be discovered? Similar past problems with the likes of Amazon S3 or MongoDB clearly show that if a database or service allows making sensitive data public, it will eventually happen again and again, most commonly through negligence and misconfiguration, but sometimes by the hand of a malicious insider.</p>
<p>And if this can happen to a seasoned IT expert, how can we expect every citizen developer to be able to secure their data properly? Potential privacy implications of letting non-technical (and non-legal) people decide which data should be put into a no-code platform and who should have access to it might be massive, too. After all, citizen developers are just as likely not to understand international privacy regulations like GDPR as they are to have no clue about security principles.</p>
<p>Also, let’s not forget that one of the most popular usage scenarios for a low-code platform is combining and analyzing data from multiple external sources – for visualization, reporting, or automation, for example. If a custom app can be easily breached through such a trivial vulnerability in the underlying LC/NC platform, it will essentially turn into a massive security hole, potentially letting hackers pivot to and breach multiple other IT systems.</p>
 Choosing the right low-code/no-code solution 
<p>What should customers do to avoid such problems? Even before they decide to adopt the citizen development methodology, they have to carefully incorporate the idea into their existing security and compliance policies. They have to consider all the potential challenges and carefully evaluate the risks of “shadow citizen development” as well.</p>
<p>When choosing the best LC/NC solution, one should understand that the market is nowhere near maturity yet, and available capabilities can vary dramatically. There will probably never be a single product that can address all potential use cases, but again – business people alone should not be allowed to decide which tools (and to what extent) to use just based on their needs. All such tools must be carefully vetted by security and privacy experts, and proper constraints and policies must be established for their usage. Needless to say, access to any sensitive systems and data sources through a low-code platform must be controlled, secured, and generally treated as untrusted.</p>
<p>If an LC/NC platform comes with its own data platform, it must be secured to a higher standard than other enterprise databases, not a lower one. All the security and compliance controls for a database used by citizen developers must work at least as efficiently as for other sensitive data sources, but in addition, they must be fully transparent, not user-serviceable, and always on.</p>
<p>And, of course, creating an app in a modern low-code/no-code environment should be at least somewhat more convenient than writing an Excel macro. Otherwise, nobody will bother to use it.</p>

 Filling the information gap. <a href="http://eepurl.com/hGNtSH">Subscribe to the newsletter</a>. This is for you who doesn’t want to read through all the messages on Discord everyday (where all the latest project information can be found.) For you who can’t be bothered with following social media. For you who just generally wants to have a life and still get the occasional updates on Verus and its ecosystem. And everyone else is welcome&nbsp;too. <p>Next to publishing the monthly recap on Medium, I will send the exact same content through a newsletter. <a href="http://eepurl.com/hGNtSH">Subscribe here</a>. I’ll try to keep things short and to the point. So let’s get started with the very first monthly&nbsp;recap.</p> August 2021  Preparing Testnet for Ethereum&nbsp;Bridge <p>The multi-chain testnet has been reset. This in preperation for the bridge to the Rinkeby testnet. It has been said we are very close to this game-changing release.</p> Wallet Updates <p>Highly recommended non-mandatory Verus Desktop and CLI wallet updates have been made available. (Critical for notaries and pools). <a href="https://verus.io/wallet">Download v0.7.4&nbsp;here</a></p> Conversations with Mike &amp;&nbsp;Bluesky <p><a href="https://blueskyweb.org/">Bluesky</a> is an initiative from Twitter to create a decentralized social media platform. Verus lead developer Mike Toutonghi had some very interesting posts in their Discord channel explaining the benefits that Verus and VerusID can bring to their project. Everyone in their Discord is still shell-shocked from the bombs that Mike dropped on them. <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/505987175062437888/879966215857127454/unknown.png">Read a part of the messages here</a>. Verus has been selected to start a workgroup to integrate with <a href="https://openid.net/">OpenID</a>. The future will tell if it is something worthwhile. One big positive is that more people, and especially developers, will learn about Verus. You can read all the messages back in the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/YmrHBhCuFa">Bluesky Discord</a>, and please keep the shilling to yourself. We want to foster professional and productive environments.</p> Giant Website&nbsp;Overhaul <p>We are close to finishing a giant website overhaul. Better, more concise messaging. Easier to understand copywriting. More illustrations. Clearer design. All-in-all easier to digest for all people. I personally can’t wait for it to be online. I believe it to be a great improvement that will definitely get more people more interested in&nbsp;Verus.</p> Mobile Wallet Developments <p>Interesting progress on the mobile development front. Verus Mobile will be able to function as an encrypted local repository for your personal data, creating a central place for you to securely store information about yourself (that only you control.) This data allows you to integrate your wallet with in-app service providers that extend application functionality. Initially, this is how fiat on/off ramp services (<a href="https://www.sendwyre.com/">Wyre</a>) will be connected to the wallet. Later on, VerusID integration gives users the power to prove information about themselves in a decentralized, self-sovereign way. Exciting&nbsp;stuff!</p> New Docs&nbsp;Website <p>In addition to the new website we are working on a documentation website. In here you can find information if you want to take a deeper dive into Verus blockchain technology. It will be online the same time as the new website. Although this one is still a work-in-progress and needs to be updated constantly.</p> Community-Made Videos <p>Community member tango808 made an awesome video showing current and near future capabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwjfB184qfg">Check it out on YouTube</a>. He made even way more and you can find <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18GDpFFP1BngAPXOjvlyVhP_d4DrexZH5">them here</a>. Please share them around if you&nbsp;want!</p> Ecosystem Project&nbsp;Valu <p>Community member Consilience from <a href="https://www.valu.earth/">Valu</a> low-key confirmed that they will launch their project soon after PBaaS (Public Blockchains as a Service) has been brought to mainnet. One of those things are fiat gateways for Verus. It will be a giant boost for the ecosystem I’m&nbsp;sure.</p> Fun Fact <p>At the time of writing the active amount of $VRSC staking is over 33M. Not bad. Still room for improvement. So get staking! Or not (more for&nbsp;me.)</p><p>Thanks for reading. That’s it from me. Until next&nbsp;month!</p> Please <a href="http://eepurl.com/hGNtSH">subscribe to the monthly recap</a> so you’ll get it each month in your&nbsp;mailbox.  <p><a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/august-2021-verus-monthly-recap-4241c7c80b8a">August 2021— Verus Monthly Recap</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin">Verus Coin</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Shyft Network and Kylin Network take steps towards building compliant DeFi infrastructure for Financial Institutions. <p>Bridgetown, Barbados — We are delighted to announce our partnership with <a href="https://kylin.network/">Kylin Network</a>, the cross-chain data infrastructure powered by Polkadot, to collaborate and build cross-chain data infrastructure for Decentralized Finance&nbsp;(DeFi).</p><p><a href="https://shyft.network/compliant-defi">Shyft Network’s</a> opt-in compliance infrastructure, such as whitelisted addresses and Anti-Money-Laundering (AML) and GDPR compliant systems, will be further strengthened by Kylin Network’s data infrastructure and oracle&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Kylin Network commits to provide required datasets to Shyft Network, allowing it to build a “compliant DeFi” framework, which would allow institutional funds and financial institutions from capital markets to deploy funds into the DeFi ecosystem in a secure and compliant manner.</p><p>Some key parameters of the partnership:</p>  Kylin Network will afford the opportunity to placehold a validator node for Shyft Network. The first validators are vetted by the Kylin Network such that the health of the network in the crucial early days of the ecosystem is robust. We expect heavy demand to be a validator node, and only select partners will be invited to take&nbsp;part.  Kylin will also work with Shyft Network as a parachain to call each other’s functions via XCMP pallet-calling. XCMP pallet-calling is a revolutionary way to call the functions of another parachain or parathread on Polkadot. Kylin has innovated this feature and will work closely with Shyft Network to identify cool ways to implement it in&nbsp;synergy.  With data feeding provided by Shyft Network, and then filtered through Kylin Network’s consensus and arbitration mechanisms, an augmented robustness of data accuracy and trustability becomes possible. Basically, we can add another layer of trust and validation to whatever data that Shyft Network provides.  In turn, Shyft network will expose Kylin Network to its burgeoning community and innovations in the field of compliance-managed data solutions.  <blockquote>Dylan Dewdney, Chief Stratosphere Officer of Kylin Network said, “The coming renaissance in DeData-enabled Web 3 solutions will naturally include emergent data validation layers. Kylin Network and Shyft Network will work in concert and synergy to find ways to validate and render the many nascent use cases of validated web 3 data journeys into incentivized frameworks that undergird more accurate and trustworthy results”</blockquote><p>Shyft Network recently announced the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-based-shyft-network-launches-aims-for-fatf-compliant-defi">launch of its mainnet</a> and, shortly thereafter, the coordinated <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/global-crypto-exchanges-begin-phased-deployment-of-veriscope-the-decentralized-solution-to-the-b049fcb24cdf">deployment of Veriscope</a>, the decentralized solution to the Financial Action Task Force’s Travel Rule. This signals the first steps in the development of a global, decentralized, and opt-in compliance infrastructure.</p><blockquote>Juan Aja Aguinaco, Co-Founder of Shyft Network said “Shyft’s strength comes from its network of partners and participants; as a data validation layer, Shyft Network’s integration with Kylin Network helps build a stronger, more reliable and functional oracle infrastructure. By leveraging Kylin’s consensus and arbitration mechanisms, we get closer to reaching our goal to enable institutional funds from capital markets and financial institutions to participate in compliant DeFi and create a new era for&nbsp;crypto.”</blockquote> About Kylin&nbsp;Network <p>Kylin Network aims to build a cross-chain platform powering the data economy on Polkadot. It will be the data infrastructure for the future DeFi and Web 3.0 powered by Polkadot. Kylin Network hopes to provide valid, reliable, secure, cost-effective, and easily coordinated data sources and data analytics.</p> Contact Kylin&nbsp;Network <blockquote>Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/KylinOfficial">https://t.me/KylinOfficial</a></blockquote><blockquote>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/Kylin_Network">https://twitter.com/Kylin_Network</a></blockquote><blockquote>Discord: <a href="https://discord.gg/PwYCssr">https://discord.gg/PwYCssr</a></blockquote><blockquote>Medium: <a href="https://medium.com/kylin-network">https://medium.com/kylin-network</a></blockquote><blockquote>Linkedin: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/kylinnetwork">https://www.linkedin.com/company/kylinnetwork</a></blockquote><blockquote>Official website: <a href="https://kylin.network/">https://kylin.network/</a></blockquote> About Shyft&nbsp;Network <p>Shyft Network is a public protocol designed to aggregate and embed trust, validation, and discoverability into data stored on public and private ecosystems, and facilitate information transfer between permissioned and permissionless networks.

Chris Owen,  Director of Product Management at Savyint is to deliver a presentation on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4614/1" title="Worlds Collide: The Importance of Convergence in IAM"> Worlds Collide: The Importance of Convergence in IAM </a>on Tuesday, September 14 starting at 8:30 pm at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2021" title="European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021">EIC 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Chris some questions about his planned presentation.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When worlds collide is an interesting subject. What does it actually mean and what is colliding?  </p>
<p>
Worlds colliding is essentially looking at the different markets that exist within the identity space. So in particular, if we take privileged access management (PAM) and identity governance and administration (IGA), they've typically existed within silos. So PAM tools were originally designed for on-premise infrastructure, for managing access into a data center and critical assets. IGA tools have really focused on provisioning identity life cycle management. What we're starting to see now is these worlds really coming together. And a lot of that is driven by cloud adoption because now everything has an identity.<br><br>And as people adopt more cloud, privileged controls are really having to change, it's no longer just about access to servers and where the critical data is. It's access to interfaces, consoles, and at the same time everything has an identity. What's becoming important is the fact that you need to govern these identities, have visibilities of where they are, and bring further context into the management of these identities. The concept of worlds colliding is really these two types of technology really becoming closely aligned together, and what we call convergence, where essentially they are becoming the same platform.   </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Is this specific to IGA and PAM or do you see this happening in other areas?  </p>
<p>
This is definitely something that's happening in other areas. So if we look at the identity market as a whole, we're starting to see a lot of consolidation taking place. A lot of vendors are starting to now combine technologies, not just IGA and PAM, you're starting to see PAM and IDaaS type solutions. You have typical IDaaS vendors, such as Okta that are making moves into the IGA and PAM space as well. So there's a lot of adjacent things happening. There's also other areas within security in the identity space. So new acronyms around cloud infrastructure, entitlements management, cloud security, posture management, kind of coming together and that may get consumed by Pam IGA tools as well.   </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Some customers have already made large investments in identity solutions, why would they move to a converged solution?  </p>
<p>
There are really some key drivers to moving towards a converged solution. Some of those are cost savings, benefits, time, efficiency, and that type of thing, but certainly a lot of organizations have made investments. These may be on-prem, they may be more traditional siloed approaches. So there's definitely a good time to embrace these types of technologies. Digital transformation is a key driver to look at our technology stacks, to make sure it's meeting our requirements, to make sure that it's fit for purpose. And that's a good time to transition towards these type of new converged solutions as they are.    </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Do you expect more changes in the future?  </p>
<p>
I think the technology landscape is constantly evolving. I think we will definitely see more. I think we'll see more consolidation within the industry. There'll be more acquisitions. There'll be more, I guess, new bleeding edge type of technologies that come into the fold as well. So cloud security posture management is definitely the big subject of the moment and infrastructure entitlements management. At the moment, that is very much a segregated market. And there's a lot of new vendors coming into that space. But I think we'll definitely see more consolidation take place there, and perhaps, more established markets such as secrets management, really being brought into that fold as well.  </p>

<p>How can we streamline and improve the techno-social protocols around commerce so we can better maintain equilibrium with our planet and ourselves?</p><p>This article is a companion piece to the first episode of The Future of Stuff podcast. Listen to Vinay unpack the idea of smart property in the debut episode&nbsp;🎙</p><p>Humanitarian engineer Buckminster Fuller once described an approach to building economic systems which he referred to as ephemeralization, defining it as our ability to “do more and more with less and less until eventually we can do everything with nothing.”</p><p>Now, such a thing seems impossible with the numerous technological and social constraints that come to mind, but the idea of “doing more with less” as a design principle — if followed responsibly — could eventually lead us to a future where atoms and bits dance in perfect synchrony, benefiting everyone at the expense of no&nbsp;one.</p><p>With that north star, we can start prototyping the systems of tomorrow with the tools of&nbsp;today.</p><p>With that in mind, let’s explore a potential techno-social medium for building this future: smart property.</p> What is Smart Property? <p>In the online age, people are used to summoning entities around the world to meet their everyday needs. A few taps on the scrying mirror of a smartphone can marshal human and autonomous agents to provide all manner of services. Transportation. Goods. Housing. Entertainment. Education. Nearly anything.</p><p>This ability to program value flows and social interactions around goods and services presents an incredibly powerful design space which we can refer to as smart property.</p><p>In practice, smart property is property that can be bought, sold, collateralized, and accessed via software APIs and search engines. While we already have this in a sense with housing (AirBnB), transportation (Uber), distribution (Amazon), and other areas, these systems are often controlled by centralized corporations operating under the illusory banner of “platform,” resulting in ongoing concerns around privacy, security, and labor practices.</p><p>At Mattereum, we believe smart property is an inevitable evolution of commerce, but how this system is implemented and the motivations behind it are paramount. Smart property can be how we achieve equilibrium with the planet and with each other, or it could be co-opted by the incumbent powers-that-be with results that can be read in dystopian science&nbsp;fiction.</p> Smart Property Can Fix Society’s Inventory Problem <p>The world is suffering from a severe misallocation of resources, especially on a long-term time horizon. At the core, this is a system design problem. Between planned obsolescence and trade globalization in the pursuit of corporate profit, the things we produce are not actually built to last and rely on an unimaginably complex, global infrastructure powered by distant (or not so distant) horrific labor practices and environmental costs.</p><p>The IPCW industrial cycle, designed by Mattereum CEO Vinay Gupta and a team at the Rocky Mountain Institute, provides an almost mandala-like mapping of industry. As you can see, the four main areas are Investment (of different capital types), Production, Consumption, and&nbsp;Waste.</p><p>One way to explain this odd paradox of gluttony and scarcity in the world today is to map where in this cycle we have innovated over the last half century, and where we have&nbsp;not.</p><p>Investment and Production witnessed a transformative leap in operational efficiency and scale in the post-WWII era, yet similar progress has not been made in optimizing Consumption and managing&nbsp;Waste.</p><p>Tightening these feedback loops will require better policy, technology, and social awareness.</p><p>We don’t know what we don’t know about our stuff and figuring it out is critical to achieving sustainability and improving quality of life for&nbsp;all.</p><p>Smart property as a design framework can help us generate, access, and act upon the necessary product information to build secondhand markets of durable quality goods and facilitate truly efficient p2p commerce. Imagine a digital wallet interface akin to an MMORPG’s character inventory in which the assets are actual objects which can be owned in common, shared, leased, bought, or sold with a few taps on a&nbsp;screen.</p><p>This is possible.</p> Smart Property Streamlines Complexity in&nbsp;Commerce <p>It is important to emphasize that smart property is not about embedding sensor devices in everything under the sun (Internet of Things, smart cities) and more about designing the social protocols around goods and services enabled by a tight integration between law and software to streamline, structure, and secure the numerous interactions and transactions around a good or&nbsp;service.</p><p>Oddly enough, with smart property it is the space and social interaction around an object which is where the magic happens. The ‘ground’ is the key design space rather than the ‘figure’ of an&nbsp;object.</p><p>On the first episode of The Future of Stuff podcast by Mattereum, Vinay illustrated the potential of smart property in multiple examples, including one that would seem random at first glance, but is profound in its implications.</p> The Logistical Nightmare of Wedding&nbsp;Planning <p>If the idea of smart property is to automate and streamline transactions and interactions between various parties around a good or service, reducing complexity and costs to those involved, then wedding planning makes for a surprisingly fitting use&nbsp;case.</p><p>Venue. Catering. Travel. Entertainment. Fashion. So many moving pieces in constant motion. What if there were a system which allowed one to aggregate these pieces via software protocols, creating order in the chaos and vastly reducing mental and transaction costs?</p><p>As Vinay explains, someone in charge of planning the event could use a smart property system to “build a multi-path matrix of possible solutions,” securing various options leading up to the day of the event as a safeguard for any failure or setback in the&nbsp;chain.</p><blockquote>“It’s this ability to take processes where there are tons and tons of dependencies, turn the dependencies into option contracts, group the option contracts together until you have a solution, and then once you have a solution, execute all of the options. Bringing that kind of capability out of heavy engineering and finance into ordinary everyday people’s lives will be completely revolutionary.”</blockquote><p>Of course, the application of smart property in event planning is not limited to weddings. Think of all the events we attend throughout our lives which involve networks of contracted parties which do the work of creating these dynamic social experiences. Concerts. Reward ceremonies. Conferences. Imagine booking and planning these events as easy as using&nbsp;AirBnB.</p> Smart Property is a Critical Use Case of Blockchain <p>It is imperative that a smart property system be decentralized and operated on a peer-to-peer basis. There’s a real risk of smart property systems as envisioned by Mattereum being co-opted by the incumbent Big Tech companies and being absorbed into monopolies and oligopolies, resulting in economic centralization with severe consequences for society (price distortions, resource misallocation, etc).</p><p>We do not want a world in which everybody owns nothing and Big Tech companies lease the majority of material goods to the populace, under contractual agreements which favor them at the expense of the user at every turn. No recourse. No&nbsp;agency.</p><p>If antitrust legislation and governmental efforts to prevent monopolies or keep them in check fail (and such legislation tends to wax and wane across administrations), then people would be at the mercy of market forces (such mercy does not&nbsp;exist).</p><p>Building smart property systems with p2p protocols is critical to ensuring that the already terrible distribution of wealth and power is not made even worse for future generations.</p><p>Blockchains provide cryptographically secure and verifiable transaction networks for the seamless and borderless exchange of value. A global, programmable medium of value transfer open to all is a design space we are still trying to wrap our heads around. And it is currently the most compelling technological solution for smart property.</p><p>Traditional client-server databases are silos which lack the interoperability necessary for coordinating and streamlining complex business transactions across multiple contexts. Having a shared financial infrastructure instead of a patchwork of protocols that struggle to maintain consensus can vastly reduce complexity and cost of&nbsp;trade.</p><p>However, neither blockchain nor any other computer system for that matter can power smart property alone. There needs to be a way of “programming” the material world and the social agreements between&nbsp;people.</p><p>Bringing the programmable value of blockchain into the real world requires a tight integration between legal systems that enforce property rights and the software systems which facilitate commerce.</p><p>Enter Mattereum.</p> Prototyping Smart Property with the Mattereum Protocol <p>Mattereum is building the legal-transactional framework that secures trust in digital commerce. Bridging the programmable value of blockchain-based digital assets with the programmable agreements of contract law with the affordances of both presents a compelling design framework for smart property.</p><p>The Mattereum Protocol leverages an integrated legal and software system consisting of three main components: Mattereum Asset Passports, Real-World Asset NFTs, and Trust Communities. Here’s how the protocol works, in&nbsp;brief:</p><p>(For a more detailed guide of the protocol, we highly recommend referring to the <a href="https://mattereum.com/2021/04/01/mattereum-product-walkthrough/">Mattereum Product Walkthrough</a>.)</p>  Asset Passports are a bundle of legal warranties tied to a particular object. Essential warranties include identification, confirmation of the presence and capabilities of verification technologies such as NFC tags, vault status, carbon offsets, anti-slavery certification, and tokenization. The heart of the Mattereum Protocol, Asset Passports are powerful, composable tools for securing property rights in virtual and physical&nbsp;space.  Real-World Asset NFTs are unique digital tokens that denote the right to take physical custody of a particular object. While sharing features with the NFTs now gaining popularity in the cultural mainstream in the creative industries, these tokens are different in that they are backed by an underlying physical asset, complete with warranties, insurance, and legal enforceability to create trust in trade. They are paired with objects via a warranty in the Asset Passport.  Trust Communities are the networks of expert certifiers that accrue around each object (artwork, memorabilia, precious metals) throughout its lifetime. All expert certification of an object is backed by a legal warranty as well as financial stake, adding weight to an expert’s assessment. Built upon the composable, legal-tech framework of the Asset Passport, Trust Communities restore value, increase liquidity, and bring peace of mind to digital commerce.  <p>So far, the Mattereum Protocol has tokenized a wide range of objects, ranging from <a href="https://opensea.io/NTFA">gold-backed NFTs</a>, to <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/third-millennia-collection-1">pop culture memorabilia</a>, to <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/mattereum-fine-art-and-antiquities-collection-warr">historical/cultural artifacts</a>.</p><p>Currently, these assets and arrangements are only a simple display of smart property. An asset is secured in a vault and can be physically delivered to the NFT bearer upon burning the token, with all the necessary legal warranties attached to the property. A transferable, cryptographic voucher of&nbsp;sorts.</p><p>Mattereum is researching and developing tools and methodologies to build upon this groundwork, streamlining the passporting and tokenization process for a wider range of asset classes and exploring new opportunities in this exciting design&nbsp;space.</p><p>In the future, there will be smart legal templates which create a streamlined user experience around generating the Asset Passport and minting digital assets, automated custodians that reduce the risk and complexity around custody of physical goods (and even provide corporate legal status of certain objects to empower collective ownership, asset governance, amongst other possibilities), advanced search capabilities with robust metadata schemas of all goods and services on the protocol, and APIs that allow others to build and expand on these foundations.</p><p>The idea of smart property is to use technology to create a better relationship between ourselves and the planet. The digitization of commerce is a trend with no stopping point, so we might as well be good at it. Eventually, the technological and social systems which underlie trade will become so coordinated that we will move into an era of property rights so fluid and dynamic that it will be more akin to “streaming property” than owning property. How we build this system is crucial to preventing injustice and inequity in the world, and Mattereum is aiming to build the protocols to enable this future such that everyone can benefit at the expense of no&nbsp;one.</p><p>In the spirit of Buckminster Fuller, let’s build a future of “more with less” where everything simply works in stunning techno-social grace.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/introduction-to-smart-property-ecb446268f23">Introduction to Smart Property</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Ian Grigg is one of the most influential builders in the crypto space, having built digital asset systems since the nineties. We discuss his invention of the Ricardian contract framework, what makes cryptonetworks successful, identity as communal phenomenon, and the importance of building positive-sum systems.</p> EPISODE NOTES <p>In this episode, I had the pleasure of talking to financial cryptographer Ian Grigg (@iang_fc). Ian is an unsung hero in the blockchain/cryptocurrency space, having built crypto-based digital asset systems since the nineties using the Ricardian contract, a design framework for binding software with legal agreements that has been the foundation of many crypto projects over the years, including Mattereum. We discuss the invention of the Ricardian framework, its design philosophy, the importance of community in the formation of one’s identity and the success of entire cryptonetworks, as well as the critical need to shift our focus from building zero-sum games to crafting positive-sum systems that benefit everyone at the expense of no one. I learned a lot from Ian in this conversation, and I hope you find the insight as enriching as I&nbsp;did.</p><p>Track: “Optimist” by Zoe&nbsp;Keating</p><p>Links:</p>  <a href="https://iang.org/">https://iang.org/</a>  <a href="http://www.financialcryptography.com/">http://www.financialcryptography.com/</a>   Episode Outline   The Origins of the Ricardian Contract [00:01:20]  Ian on the Advent of Cryptocurrencies [00:09:27]  Blockchain is Just Another Tool [00:12:47]  Mattereum’s Building on the Ricardian Framework [00:14:46]  The Cost and Necessity of Building Governance [00:16:35]  The Chamapesa Project [00:20:53]  Identity Through Community [00:24:05]  Dissonance Between Identity Frameworks &amp; Societal Expectation [00:26:02]  Reputation &amp; Identity in Cryptosystems [00:28:19]  Zero-Sum vs Positive-Sum Games [00:33:10]  Ian on Encouraging Ricardian Contract Adoption by Devs [00:38:21]  On the Future of Smart Contracts [00:43:04]  Improving Asset Custody in Smart Property Systems [00:47:11]  <p>Welcome to the podcast&nbsp;Ian.</p><p>Ian: Good to be&nbsp;here.</p> The Origins of the Ricardian Contract [00:01:20] <p>Garrison: A lot of people who are kind of familiar with what Mattereum does and how it approaches building things may be familiar with the concept of the Ricardian contract as this kind of hybrid system for integrating contractual agreements with software that executes the agreement. That’s kind of foundational to what we do. It’s also been used in a lot of different projects and inspired a lot of amazing work across smart contracts and formation of entire digital organizations. Could you kind of describe how the Ricardian contract was formulated?</p><p>Ian: It all happened around about 95 to 97. What was happening there was that digital cash was a hot topic, a very hot topic. And it was kind of funny because when the Bitcoin thing started out and that became a hot topic, it was just an echo of the nineties to a lot of us who had already been there, done that and so forth, seeing what would&nbsp;happen.</p><p>While the digital cash people over in Amsterdam — that’s DigiCash, David Chaum’s company — were doing digital cash, I was sitting in finance classes and learning about zero coupon bonds and a zero coupon bond is basically like a dollar note, if you like, or a pound note or something like that. And listening to all this, I realized that actually, if you’re trying to do digital cash and digital cash is a dollar or a pound or a Euro or whatever it was, and a zero coupon bond is the same thing. The zero coupon bond is actually the atomic element of finance in terms of mathematical modeling.</p><p>From that you can build up everything else practically speaking. You can build up derivatives as constructions of zero coupon bonds. And it occurred to me that, well, if we can do digital cash, we can do everything in finance. This light bulb moment got me thinking. And I started out with a mate and I moved to Amsterdam and we started working on digital cash and digital assets. The ones we chose were bonds and to cut a long story short, the thing about bonds, I did a lot of research into this. It took me six months to figure this all out. Bonds are legal contracts. If we could do a legal contract in a digital form, then we could do bonds. And then a bit later on it transpired that bonds themselves are just the simplest form of financial instrument. And most other things are based on the contractual mechanism.</p><p>Most of them. I mean shares are based on government say-so, but even then shares could be based on contracts. So we could do everything if we could do contracts. And I went through a long process of trying to work out how to do contracts. I got stuck on the normal computer science notion: oh gosh, a contract is a bunch of data so we shove it in the database and we get stuck into normalized forms and all this sort of stuff. Which is normally good&nbsp;stuff.</p><p>And the world often reduces to that in computer science terms which is why so many databases are built out there in the world. But the contract just didn’t work. I discovered that bonds, for example they were lots of lots of words which had very strange meaning, especially to a computer scientist. The bonds didn’t have standard words. And every time somebody came out with a new bond, they changed the wording. And it was often just a little bit. So you wondered whether they were responding to new events. There’d been some new crisis or whether it was just the lawyers deciding that they needed to generate fees or something. But either way, didn’t really matter to us. The bonds kept changing, so databases just didn’t&nbsp;work.</p><p>And at that point I had this second light bulb moment. If you like, when I said, “Okay why don’t we flip the problem upside down, give the lawyers what they want, give them a text document. It will make the computer science side work harder than try and pander to the computer programmers. We’ll pander to the&nbsp;lawyers.</p><p>So we constructed, or I constructed a simple text document, which included the text of the contract. And instead of it being, shall we say, all the words that the legal people wanted to wrote, write, and nothing more. It included some parameters in there. And these parameters were very simple line based things, which said something like name equals 2009 bond from the Pacific railway. And the denomination could be in dollars and so forth. Simple tag equals value. And what that meant was that the program could dive into the document with a very simple parser. We’re talking about a line based thing which can be knocked up by any decent programmer. Read down, grab out the tags. And then with that document, the software could then display it to the user. So the software didn’t need to be didn’t need to know what the contract was beforehand. It got all the information it needed out of the contract, such as the denomination, such as the decimalization, the symbol to display. And then when it came to showing the user what was going on, it could simply use those tags without necessarily understanding them.</p><p>Which if you think about it, that’s what you want. If you’re going to be handling many, many bonds, you don’t want to know what the bonds are in advance. You don’t want to modify the software for every bond or every asset or every Bitcoin or every Ethereum or whatever. You want a standardized document that tells you what it&nbsp;is.</p><p>So out of that process, we added rooting to find out where the actual asset was, was managed. And we added digital signatures, such that the issuer would make this claim as a contract. And that was the&nbsp;method.</p><p>The funny thing is we didn’t realize that what I’d come up with was much of an invention, but we found every time we were talking about it we were saying, well the way you issued a bond is you write a contract and it’s the contract form that’s inside Ricardo, the name of our digital cash system. And that got shortened to the Ricardian contract. Hence the name. So eventually after our gosh six or seven years of having these conversations, I realized I had to basically publish a paper on it and did that. So from then of course everybody could just refer to the paper. So that’s the foundation of&nbsp;it.</p><p>But it’s quite interesting because we did discover it was very broad. We could do every sort of financial asset with the Ricardian contract. And not only that other people came along and did other things with&nbsp;it.</p><p>Chris Odom turned it into configuration files. The configuration of his software was a set of Ricardian contracts.</p><p>And the OpenBazaar people turned it into a trading cycle in that their invoices, for example, would be a Ricardian contract. And that would refer back to a previous author to enter into a contract. And then the receipt, for example, would be pointing back to the invoice and the payment would be pointing back to the receipt. So they had these chains of things where they’re basically pointing at each other. And that was very interesting because it created this cycle where everything was available and everything was documented in cryptographic security which allowed a lot of software to work pretty much perfectly. And it removed the problems that are caused by insufficient information. So yeah, it was interesting.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah, it’s a really interesting kind of design space. Paper you wrote “The Intersection of Ricardian and Smart Contracts,” you have this kind of X and Y axis of where the Y axis I believe was like semantic richness. So it’s more leaning into the, natural language kind of agreement. What we traditionally think of as a contract document. And then on the X axis you have operational richness, which is basically what’s actually executable by code. And I think that’s a great kind of mapping of how to map things that are working in this kind of legal&nbsp;tech.</p><p>Ian: Yeah.</p><p>Garrison: And it can vary from asset to asset from use case to use case. There’s so many possibilities there.</p> Ian on the Advent of Cryptocurrencies [00:09:27] <p>Garrison: So when Bitcoin and smart contract platforms like Ethereum emerged. With Bitcoin, we had I guess you could say like the first digital cash system that kind of persevered or kind of survived and kept going and withstood regulatory friction and a lot of forces of nature kind of working against it. Then we had Ethereum that emerged six years later, or, handful of years later, and it kind of delivered on this, on this promise of the smart contract, which Nick Sabo proposed in like&nbsp;1994.</p><p>So when these cryptocurrencies and smart contract platforms emerged, what was your initial response to them in relation to this digital cash system that you had actually&nbsp;created.</p><p>Ian: Mm. Yeah. Well, I was in the cryptography group when Satoshi published and discussed and eventually published his&nbsp;paper.</p><p>And I read the paper at the time. I didn’t like it. The key thing was, it was a very clever invention obviously and I realized that at the time, but this notion of having a competition for consensus meant immediately to me, people are going to be burning energy on this thing. And that seemed to me to be an unsustainable expense. But actually the author was clearly a lot cleverer than I was and had managed to constrain it, such that it didn’t completely get out of control. It was a stability involved based on the price which we didn’t really see it until prices actually started to move from zero upwards. But then, there was a stability in the system based on the number of people who were trading these things which was very clever. And obviously a massive breakthrough.</p><p>What was the big issue there was because considering that I had come from the client server world, we had all been thinking that client server was the only way to do it. But what we had entirely missed was that the server was always a weakness. And we had been somewhat blinded by our, if you like, our bias towards client server. So whenever one of these systems failed, we hadn’t treated it as a server failure. So for example, I was involved in the e-gold community. built a thing called Digigold. You could consider it to be e-gold version two or something like&nbsp;that.</p><p>Which we got up and going, but it got into trouble through the actions of the people involved. I mean, to put it short in short terms, I and Douglas Jackson, the e-gold founder, got into court battles and so forth and so on. And, because I was the guy who was running Digigold and he was the guy running e-gold, these things didn’t survive because the founders behind these systems got into distracting arguments.</p><p>And it wasn’t clear that the problem there was the architectural problem was that there was a founder, there was an owner, there was a contractor party, there was somebody managing the servers. The inspiration of this, of Satoshi, was — yeah, that’s the problem. The people behind the servers or the people behind the center are the problem, not the solution. So let’s figure out a way to remove that. And that was the big that the huge breakthrough that changed everything.</p> Blockchain is Just Another Tool [00:12:47] <p>Garrison: And was there kind of a moment where there was like Bitcoin or Ethereum that you thought that: finally there’s like the infrastructure that we needed to do the things that you had envisioned or was it just another tool that kind of just&nbsp;emerged?</p><p>Ian: No. I think it’s just another tool that it merged. Obviously did a lot better than what we had done. There was a moment where I decided that actually this thing had passed the test of time and was here to stay. And that was when a fund in America paid me to go and be their dark horse. They’re anti-Bitcoiner. Through that process where I sat in front of 20 or 30 potential investors into their fund and I argued against Bitcoin and so forth. And when I saw what was happening there, I thought, okay, this is interesting. Regardless of what I think technically, we’re now at the point where enough people will believe in this thing such that it will sustain and it’s clearly sustained itself in the past. So, well, I kind of flipped at that and realized, well, this thing here is here to&nbsp;stay.</p><p>Not that I’ve ever got over my, if you like, my distaste of the proof of work consensus, load cost, and so forth. So I actually, I was very happy to join the Block One crowd and work on DPoS, delegated proof of stake, because that is a system that gets rid of the expensive proof of work mechanism. Albeit it brings in its own problems. So if you like the proof of work thing gives you open access and open entry, and therefore it is in a theory, it’s a fair mechanism, whereas delegated proof of stake encourages the problem of cartelization amongst the block producers. Which eventually causes problems unless you’re very careful to keep that down. There’s swings and roundabouts, there’s pluses and minuses with all these systems. So you have to be very careful about what it is you’re trying to do before you choose one of these mechanisms.</p> Mattereum’s Building on the Ricardian Framework [00:14:46] <p>Garrison: Yeah, absolutely. So to kind of bring it back to Mattereum, it would be fun to kind of explore initial conversations you had with Vinay when he was like conceptualizing Mattereum and thinking about it. Could you unpack what was part of those conversations? Those initial conversations.</p><p>Ian: To be frank we didn’t have that many conversations on it. Vinay has always been very, very solid about saying that basically he’s just building on the Ricardian contract and the governance techniques that I did in the nineties. There’s a thing called five parties model, which I put together in the nineties. It wasn’t so much an invention as take classical governance techniques and lay them out and just slot them into the digital world. This is what we did at e-gold and Gold Money and the various other players. And it’s what they should be doing with the stablecoin issues for example, and also ICOs and so forth, but they haven’t learned this&nbsp;yet.</p><p>These things were all available to Vinay and I think, yeah, he mostly did his own study on it. He really came back to me and said, what about this? What about that job? He just seemed to drink it up. So it’s unusual to find somebody who can actually drink this stuff up just by reading the documentation.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah. I remember like when, he was telling me the kind of origin story, if you will. How he was basically like screaming into the void at the rest of the people in crypto. That we have to get the legals right in order to actually properly integrate the system with the real world. If you want this world changing potential of blockchain, you have to be able to connect these two realms in an effective way. And most people would just completely ignored him. So then eventually he founded a company that was aiming to do just&nbsp;that.</p> The Cost and Necessity of Building Governance [00:16:35] <p>Ian: Yeah. And it’s interesting because I faced the same dilemma. We issued gold in around about 2000, the Digigold thing. And we issued physical gold in 2002 thereabouts. We had a kilogram bar, which was our reserves. The custodian was designated as a person. The mint was designated as a person. Todd Boyle, the accountant, was in fact part of that circle of governance. And we got the whole thing completely right, and issued it and so forth. But it was interesting because some people appreciated that but the vast majority of people didn’t really appreciate what we done. It was a if most people would look to other people for validation. And therefore you had this wide open space for scams. All you had to do is generate the sense of validation in some sense, And everybody would pile in because somebody had validated it to them and they’d been validated by somebody else. And it eventually becomes a circle. But to do it properly is actually a bit of work. It took us a month to set up the governance, just the governance of the gold bar, for example, in terms of agreements and contracts and understanding, getting everybody on board for the parts that they&nbsp;play.</p><p>It’s quite easy to fall into the trap of saying, “Yeah, let’s ignore all that stuff, throw it out there and see what happens.” And of course, people start throwing you money. And what, somebody once said to me, or somebody frequently said when there was, if you like, opposition to his ideas, he kept saying, “People keep sending me money and therefore I know what I’m doing.” And he was right until he wasn’t right. And it all came crashing down and that’s where you need those better mechanisms. So if you’re in it for the long run, yeah, you need to do all this&nbsp;stuff.</p><p>And actually that’s a really good way of figuring out whether something is a fraud or not, or something is going to be undermined and fail. Or not, it doesn’t necessarily have to be a fraud. Do they do the governance? And the governance is fairly simple. It’s all standard. It’s all documented. You just follow these steps. Did they do it, or did they not? But nobody seems to want to get into that because it’s not sexy. It’s not tech. It’s&nbsp;not</p><p>Garrison: Yeah. It’s very&nbsp;human.</p><p>Ian: Yes. It’s not this magical consensus thing. This proof of work and NEMIS keys and all that sort of&nbsp;stuff.</p><p>Garrison: One of the projects that Mattereum is working on currently is launching gold-backed NFTs. Which is kind of like just the recent iteration of the kind of gold digitization that e-gold did and Digigold and. It is true. It’s a lot of work to deal with all the humans or wet code that’s kind of necessarily involved to do the right governance. And when you’re, when you’re dealing with physical objects and stuff like that. If we can do that process well enough and perhaps streamline it over time, it opens many use cases in terms of like what kind of assets can be created or managed. Or opening access to certain&nbsp;assets.</p><p>If we can get the governance right around digital assets or digital assets that are tethered to physical objects, then it would open up a lot of doors for us. Like just as a society in terms of managing commerce and production and consumption. But you know there’s a lot of tough work that you have to do in order to kind of get to that&nbsp;future.</p><p>There’s a lot of things that you’ve worked on that I’ve been very fascinated about. Whether it’s governance. Governance of entire blockchain networks, like with the design of EOS, for example, or integrating crypto with like existing social structures, which I find really fascinating with like Chamapesa. You’ve explored a lot of the different kind of use cases of these technologies, drawing upon like the foundational work and thinking that you did around the Ricardian contract. Like what, what excites you these days? What actually stands out to&nbsp;you?</p> The Chamapesa Project [00:20:53] <p>Ian: The work I do these days is still the old Chamapesa project. It’s working slowly because I’m having to code it up myself. I guess I should say a little bit about that. The notion that you can come together as small groups and you can decide to commit as a group to do savings together is something that can be done completely disconnected from the financial system. So you’ve actually created, if you like, your own answer to financial inclusion because what you’ve done is you’ve excluded the financial system from yourselves. The financial system was already excluding you from their participation. So you have to start&nbsp;again.</p><p>But it only works not as individual system and not as a large community, but as a small group. It only works because what you can do is you can choose the members of the group to start from a very high trust level, even in a totally corrupt environment. Enough people very close by and you can select from them who is trustworthy and bring those together as a very small, tight, trustworthy group.</p><p>And on top of that, you can do all sorts of things because we’re trying to do savings in these groups. That means we’re handling each other’s money and therefore we’re very dependent on each other. And once we get that level of trust, it’s possible to do a lot of things. We can interact with other groups. We can do supply chain. We can do organizations of payments, for example. We don’t need to worry too much about who the other party is as long as we know which group it is. We can rely on the group to look after its members. We can do things like identity. There’s a lot of things that we can&nbsp;do.</p><p>So consequently my work these days is trying to build a platform which works with those groups and allows them to, if you like, utilize their capabilities in better ways, in more powerful ways. As I say, it’s slow work cause I’m doing it all&nbsp;myself.</p><p>Garrison: I love that concept of like focusing on smaller groups and then scaling from there. That’s just natural to how people organize and cooperate with one another. Something that I pay a lot of attention to is projects, both within crypto and outside of crypto that are kind of founded on more like, principles of cooperation and interdependence rather than absolute independence, assuming that everyone is working in their own selfish interests. I don’t really buy into that framework so much. But I really liked that idea of scaling up from existing social structures and trust relationships, because you could apply that to social savings groups in Africa. But also in other parts of the world, cooperatives throughout the world. The context could vary from just the community to art co-ops or studios and stuff like&nbsp;that.</p><p>I really like that kind of approach to things. Cause a lot of people try to have this monolithic solution. We cook up some solution in Silicon Valley and then we try to export it to other parts of the world in different cultures. And it’s like that doesn’t work&nbsp;out.</p> Identity Through Community [00:24:05] <p>Ian: That doesn’t work out at all. Yeah. It’s interesting. You say that it’s natural. It’s actually more than being natural. It’s who we are. Because if you look into it, try and figure out where all this came from, it traces back to basic anthropology and society in the sense that if you start, for example, with the child or the baby that’s born on day zero, they’re basically a tabula rasa, an empty slate, blank slate. And there’s nothing in there except the ability to cry and suckle basically. But if you shift forward 20 years or so, you’ve now got a working functioning adult with all the sophistication that is needed to do complex trades to engage in negotiations, to date with a person and start a family of her&nbsp;own.</p><p>So how did this happen? Well, actually it turns out the answer is very much in groups. It starts out with the mother of course, bringing the baby up, but pretty soon on the father turns up and upsets the very cozy arrangement that the baby had with the mother. So the baby now needs to learn how to deal with the father, which creates a sense of identity. And then they’ve got siblings and uncles and aunts and grandmothers and so forth. So actually the child is brought up in the context of a group. And therefore, when it comes time to leave the nest, when the child is booted out, because she’s now an adult and she’s got to go make her own way, she carries with her, this, this shall we say, groupness, this sense of identity inside a group. So naturally she’s quite happy to form another group or to participate in a group or to find a&nbsp;group.</p> Dissonance Between Identity Frameworks &amp; Societal Expectation [00:26:02] <p>And the reason we don’t really treasure this, we in fact avoid it in, if you like, academic discussion is because of the Western tradition for the last 500 years or so of individualism and capitalism. We treasure the notion of individualism and capitalism and so forth. And you’re going out to fight in the markets and become a millionaire by the time you’re 50 or whatever it is. These things are inculcated as the way we work in the world, but it’s not the way we work in the world. The way we work in the world is inside&nbsp;groups.</p><p>So the whole Western economy, if you like, has this dichotomy where we’ve got this theoretical notion of individualism fighting with our natural sense of community in groups, whereas we go outside the Western world, they don’t have the dichotomy. They’re much more oriented to the notion of, “Yes, we are naturally in our groups. We have groups, we work with groups, we have extended families. We have community groups, we have this, we have that. That’s how we do things.” So they don’t have that, if you like, collision of&nbsp;ideas.</p><p>Garrison: It all comes down to people’s framings of identity. Crypto is, in large part although it’s certainly changed over the years, tends to be a little more very capitalist driven, libertarian, rugged individualism. It’s kind of lacking in the kind of interdependence and kind of cooperative principles that you find a little more in other cultures. Or at least it’s more prominent or foundational to other cultures.</p><p>I love your example of how an identity is formed because there’s like a — what was it? I don’t know if I’m saying that right — concept of like “I am, because we&nbsp;are.”</p><p>Ian: Yes,&nbsp;indeed.</p><p>Garrison: Is that what it is or am I misquoting?</p><p>Ian: That’s exactly what it is. Yes, yes. Yes. I am because we are. I am the person that my community defines myself, defines me as. I am the person that everybody around me, who I hold close will say that I am. And my position in the community is my future, if you like. I’m not an individual, I’m a member of a community.</p> Reputation &amp; Identity in Cryptosystems [00:28:19] <p>Garrison: The paradigm for awhile, at least in the blockchain space, has been. Assuming that the networking question has some sort of protocol token, that the more of that said token that you have, the more power you have or that kind of defines your presence within that ecosystem. Whereas there’s other design approach where it’s like, okay, well, identity is more about connections between people and your history. So like how do we, how do we build that? And kind of operationalize that.</p><p>And you’re starting to see people kind of talk about this more often lately and like the past year or two about like on chain reputation, or kind of being able to aggregate your on chain activity in a way to kind of prove that, oh, you’ve contributed to this or contributed to&nbsp;that.</p><p>It’s a little more meritocratic. Rather than kind of this. Identity along the edges that we’re talking about, but you’re starting to kind of see that&nbsp;shift.</p><p>The core principles.</p><p>Ian: Yeah, people have been talking about reputation since the beginning of computer time. It was a topic in the nineties and every year or two, somebody would come up with this new concept of putting reputation onto the internet and it never works. It never works. And the reason is that reputation is a very broad group-wise thing whereby in my head, there’s something about you and in your head, there’s something about me. It’s almost by definition, not quite by definition, but almost by definition, you can’t reduce it to a number. You can’t reduce it to a database entry. I mean, they do these things with credit scores and so forth, but obviously that’s such an approximation that it misses out the richness of what’s going&nbsp;on.</p><p>And so, consequently, I think anybody who’s talking about reputation first hasn’t understood the problem at all, and they will waste a lot of time. It turns out that reputation, if you like, comes from groups, comes from identity, comes from trust and so forth and so on. So you have to talk about those things first. And once you’ve got those things sorted out, reputation not only falls out very simply, it’s not particularly important. What’s important is what you’ve&nbsp;built.</p><p>You can see all this in world of, for example, ICOs and token sales and so forth. People looking at the number, the amount of tokens, and they’re saying, “Well, this is the power. This is the goal. This is why we’re here.” But actually the numbers are just the outcome. And if you go back and you look at the process of say, successful token sales, you’ve got this situation where some of the ICOs are fluff. There’s nothing in them. Then others of the ICOs are actually really good projects and really good people and so forth. But one of the ICOs might make more money than the other, or raise more capital or sell more tokens or whatever it is. And it’s not necessarily correlated to how good the project is in a technical sense. You mean, you could look at two white papers and say this one’s good this one’s bad, but the bad one makes more token sales than the good one. What it’s really correlated to is the strength of the network that the founders bring to the&nbsp;table.</p><p>So if you look at, for example, the EOS thing, which I had a lot to do with. It sold tokens to something like $4.1 billion or whatever the published number was. I don’t know what the real number&nbsp;was.</p><p>Garrison: I believe it was the largest of its kind. To this day, it’s the&nbsp;largest.</p><p>Ian: An order of magnitude. Yes. The only one that came close was the Telegram one, but that had to be wound back because they got in trouble with the SEC. Anyway, the reason that happened was because of the strength of the network and that network was a broad group of people who were already operating the BitShares network and the Steemit network. So there are already thousands of people across the world who were interested in, shall we say, Dan Larimer’s next venture. That whole network moved in to purchase the EOS tokens, making it very large. So yeah, the notion of relationships and networks is more or less ignored by the technical community, but it is the&nbsp;key</p><p>Garrison: And there’s a potential risk there as well. if you have a powerful existing network that carries over, especially if it follows like a particular builder or a founder, you do run the risk of cartelization. Because they’re like, “Oh, well, we can put the stakes down, claim our territory right out the gate and it can cause more centralization, cartelization moving&nbsp;forward.</p> Zero-Sum vs Positive-Sum Games [00:33:10] <p>That idea of the network, the kind of social ecosystem that surrounds the project is kind of what lends to its success. It seems interesting that there’s this tendency to completely ignore this kind of like what we’ve been talking about, this kind of more social&nbsp;,community-driven, interdependent aspect of things, which is natural to us as human beings. But there’s this tendency to think of it as, oh, it’s just a flaw that needs to be fixed with some new some new application. So it can be kind of difficult to kind of like steer the blockchain community to like kind of thinking more along these kind of lines of interdependence rather than just everything is competition over cooperation and stuff like that. And that’s just. Differences in philosophy, I&nbsp;guess.</p><p>Ian: Well, it’s differences in economic models, if you like. Those people who are focused on the pure mechanics of a smart contract and the zero sum game, and the notion that we can do these things without having to trust our counter parties. Missing the fact that actually, even if you do these things, there is going to be a large proportion of people who aren’t trustworthy coming in to game the system. So you’re going to end up with, if you like, a very adversarial community. Which is fine if you get it perfectly right, and your use case just needs that. But the vast majority of use cases do need some form of trust. They need some form of positive engagement such that you can actually do things together.</p><p>For example, just the issue of not being able to hack the smart contract is an issue of community in the sense that the hacker is part of your community. Now, what is incentivizing the hacker to not hack? We know what’s incentivizing the hacker to hack, that’s getting all the value and stealing it, but how would you incentivize that person not to hack and without thinking about that, you’re basically creating, if you like, a very technocratic foundation.</p><p>We’ve been doing software since 1943 or thereabouts. And what we have discovered is that software always has a terrible amount of bugs. A huge number of bugs. So when we go forward and say we’ve got this wonderful machine, the smart contract, that can be written to do a perfect zero sum game such that everybody’s happy. Well, that’s total bullshit. We just don’t know how to write good software either as a discipline or a profession or whatever. It’s just not on the table. So we’re fooling ourselves. We’re representing something that we have never really mastered. There is an exception, and that is the spacecraft software, software to run the space craft, the shuttle, so forth. But even there they’ve had quite a few disasters based on program. So yeah, we just can’t prove this. So we are living in a world where we have a cognitive dissonance where we believe two separate things. That software can create this perfect zero sum game, but we know we can’t do anything perfect with software.</p><p>Garrison: One of the things I kind of hope for is kind of shift from zero sum thinking to positive sum thinking, like creating systems that by design are intended to encourage positive sum games or outcomes. Cause it’s just better. I think it’s better if everyone that’s interacting within a system they all benefit in some way. And it seems like it’s just a design approach. But there’s a lot of core philosophies that kind of drive or influence how people think about things much less actually build them or implement them.</p><p>Your example of the spacecraft. Or even airplanes. That software that has in the event of a failure it’s catastrophic. There’s a sense of lives at risk. There’s a weight to&nbsp;it.</p><p>You don’t really see people thinking of smart contract development, building decentralized finance protocols, thinking necessarily with that same kind of weight. Responsibility with what they’re trying to build. It’s very much kind of experimental. Because ultimately even the so-called mature DeFi protocols that people will think of as established are still experiments that are like three years old at the&nbsp;most.</p><p>I’ve seen you on Twitter emphasize strongly how like the contract, the thinking of the contract behind these digital assets, is still lacking. Do you have any thoughts on like how to like convince people who operate in this kind of like digital prime thinking, where it’s all very technical kind of focused in the digital realm, to adopt kind of more like the physical prime thinking where like, oh actually the kind of agreements between people, actual people, are really important to building these&nbsp;things.</p> Ian on Encouraging Ricardian Contract Adoption by Devs [00:38:21] <p>Ian: I have done some recent thinking on this because it’s pretty obvious that people haven’t gone in that direction other than exceptions like Mattereum and so forth. The, the vast majority of the market, we’re talking 99% or so, has just skipped past that and had lots of fun issuing tokens. NFTs, of course, the recent&nbsp;craze.</p><p>So what’s going on here? It’s relatively easy to convince lawyers because lawyers, of course, their meat and drink is contracts. To almost an exclusionary approach. They can’t even think outside the realm of a contract. So they’re quite happy with the concept, but lawyers don’t program. So they can talk and talk and talk about this. And also lawyers aren’t entrepreneurs. They don’t act, they respond. So their way of thinking is, “Oh, there’s a dispute coming, I need to defend.” Yeah. And even if you ask them to write a contract, they’re writing in the future as if there’s a defense needed, there’s a dispute so they’re already in court in their mental state. They’re responding to an&nbsp;attack.</p><p>Whereas your entrepreneur acts into the void and create something in the void. So the lawyers are particularly helpful in this respect. So the other community, if you’d like, that’s interested in this is the developers and I’ve had a look at the whole the development process and I’ve actually come up with a recent thought and that is: okay, how do we make it easier for the developers to do&nbsp;this?</p><p>Well, one thing is we need the tool to write the contract. Another issue is what’s the tool to share the contract? And if you think about, for example, Google Docs, it’s a great tool for sharing documents, but it’s a lousy tool tool for exporting.</p><p>You can’t actually get access to it easily, except by exporting it as a PDF, for example. And that’s a useless form. You can imagine trying to teach lawyers to use Google Docs, but they look at it blankly and say, well, hold on, where’s Microsoft Word? I can’t see it. So you’ve got this huge difficulty and the same happens with programmers, but there is a tool where programmers do share documents, and that’s&nbsp;Git.</p><p>So what I’ve done is I’ve dived into Git, and specifically GitHub, the commercial company, and started modeling the Ricardian contract in GitHub as a GitHub posted document in Markdown format. Now that’s a document that is accessible and it’s shareable by the developers so they can contribute to it by means of pull requests. And they can come to a consensus over what the right version, and it can be exported from because GitHub posts all these different URLs you can use to get access to the document. So I’m now actually reconfiguring all of my software to do GitHub Markdown as the format. I used to use the old Microsoft INI format from 30 or 40 years ago. And that gave us good&nbsp;service.</p><p>We have, if you like, a non-technical, a co-operative requirement, and I’m experimenting with the notion that if we use GitHub, we can show the software and the contract being built up at the same time and therefore attract more developers to the process. And once we get enough developers doing it, there’s going to be the sense whereby, okay, gosh, there’s these developers over here that are using the Ricardian contract. And then there’s the majority of the market, which just don’t know don’t care don’t want it. But if you could compare them, the amount of information available in the Ricardian contract is orders of magnitude better because it’s tied to the NFT. It is the NFT and it is the contract. And we can hold that person to account and say, this is the contract you issued, right? You sold me an NFT, a photo with these rights. The right to hang it on my wall. Okay. Where’s the picture? When can I hang it on my wall? And you can state that with absolute certainty because it’s written in the contract. And once you get that, what you do is you will cause this, if you like, this bifurcation, this forking in the market, such that there’s the people who are doing it properly, the contracts, and then there’s the&nbsp;rest.</p><p>And then will start to spread. Because once you have this very solid difference, like Mattereum is trying to generate now. The Mattereum gold bar is a gold bar, and it’s on the net and it can be purchased and it can be traded. And that works because it’s based on contracts. Once you get that, enough people know that, you’ll start to, if you like, export the proper way of doing&nbsp;things.</p> On the Future of Smart Contracts [00:43:04] <p>Garrison: The kind of trends that are going on right now, both social trends and technological trends. Where do you see smart contracts 5, 10 years from&nbsp;now?</p><p>Ian: So, I’ve long predicted smart contracts really won’t come into their own until they’re incorporated with the legal documentation. And there are a few people that have gone in that direction. So for example, EOS put in the elements of smart contracts and Mattereum of course is doing it with it’s NFTs and so forth. But just getting that element together, you also need the governance and the governance is a lot of work. It’s a lot of costs. Getting that right, is something where somebody’s basically got to invest in doing it right up front to show that over the long run this thing works because we got the governance up and going in the beginning and that we sustained that governance through the lean years to the point where now it’s starting to generate some return for both the customers and for the investors or owners of the&nbsp;system.</p><p>So I think we’re still in the phase where we’re building enough of the building blocks to the point where we can set up, if you like, a foundation, enough foundation, so we can start building the use cases until we’ve got a smorgasbord of governance techniques to choose from and a smorgasbord of contractual mechanisms and different contracts and a smorgasbord of accounting systems and then a smorgasbord of, shall we say, smart contract coding and so forth. Until we’ve got that all nicely laid out such that we just pick one of each of them, put it together, and we create our foundation, we are going to be stymied in building a lot of complicated apps.</p><p>So it’s still a building phase. And I see that Mattereum for example, but there are others doing this as well, doing the brave work of investing upfront into the uncertain future, because if it can get this right, it will create that cornerstone that couples in with the other cornerstones, which makes the foundation work. Somebody has got to do that. Unfortunately, we hit the HODL problem in that it’s far easier to sit there and rely on other people to do the good work and just basically pretend we’re innovative, but really the only innovation we’ve got is bringing more people into the HODL circle, uh, which locks up so much of the capital. And makes it very hard, for example, to create reality, to create a substance. It’s good that people like Mattereum people like Vinay and yourself are pushing forward on this because that’s where the value is going to come from. And that’s where the real value is going to come from, building these building blocks and getting it up and&nbsp;going.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah. That’s very well said. From what I gather it is a very expensive and time intensive process to kind of get these governance issues right. But it’s even just important just to give it due consideration before you just jump into some new&nbsp;venture.</p><p>A lot of budding entrepreneurs in the blockchain space. It’s really easy to kind of get carried away by the hype and the potential and the narrative. The kind of lasting impact will be in kind of just staying the course and thinking very longterm. Instead of short term potential or gains and stuff like that. I think there’s more maturity. more maturing going on in the development space. And people’s imaginations are just broader in terms of use cases. So like you get different types of thinkers and builders involved with the technology. So I think that will be hopefully great for all of us. And building better systems, better financial systems, and new ways of cooperating.</p><p>So we’re coming up on an hour into the session here. We’ve covered some of the work you’re currently doing and thinking you’re doing. Is there anything else you’d like to plug before we round things&nbsp;up?</p> Improving Asset Custody in Smart Property Systems [00:47:11] <p>Ian: So one of the things that I’ve done is I’ve looked at a problem that Mattereum had, which was how to do a solid custodial arrangement for some of these physical things. They have the bare bones but what they needed was something a little bit more, if you like, scalable and professional, and so forth. And I just happened to be working with a company called Hover, which is a specialist in the field of setting up custodial arrangements for physical&nbsp;items.</p><p>And I was able to introduce Hover and Mattereum together. I’m related to both companies, so it was a very easy introduction to make, but of course, I also end up being I’m able to participate in the discussion except to jolly things along a bit, because I’m in a conflict of interest. But that’s&nbsp;fine.</p><p>So Hover is a company that is explicitly setting out to create a good custodial arrangement for these assets. And therefore what it does is it solves one of the problems from Mattereum, which is great. How they do it I’m not gonna mention because at the moment they’re still in there shall we say their first or their seed round. And they need to get some money and build their MVP, which is going to happen. And then we’ll start, we’ll be able to talk about how they’ve actually done this but it’s been good because together we’ve found that missing piece which allows the full Mattereum puzzle to be solved. At least that’s the piece that I’ve been advised was missing. So now it’s not missing so that’s&nbsp;good.</p><p>It’s interesting because if you look at the whole arrangement to do this properly, not only do you need the smart contract, the coding, not only do you do need the legal document, but you also need people to hold assets and you need dispute resolution You need these different components which all get put together as a sort of Lego building. And until you’ve got them all there it’s not going to last in the long run. It’s going to be one of these flash in the pan things that scream up and then get into trouble and spring down&nbsp;again.</p><p>Garrison: It puts a lot of pressure to kind of generate a lot of intellectual and financial capital in the very early days of conceiving of this and having to kind of stay the course to make sure you get it right. Cause if you don’t get it right, then there’s a lot of legal systems and software systems start becoming detached from each other and it can be a messy a mess to clean&nbsp;up.</p><p>Ian: It gets messy, which creates costs, which drags everything down.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah, absolutely.</p><p>So where can people follow you and your&nbsp;work?</p><p>Ian: These days I tend to use Twitter. But, but that’s just rambling on topics of the day. Iang_fc is the handle. I have a blog called Financial Cryptography that was a long standing blog for over a decade, but I don’t post much on there. In fact, I don’t post anything on there anymore because broken. I haven’t got the wherewithall or the patience to go in and fix&nbsp;it.</p><p>One thing that is happening is that the entire identity cycle has been turned into a book and that book is coming out fairly in the next few months. And that describes, if you the Chamapesa journey and the relationship of social groups to identity and so forth. It’s a long book in terms of an internet read. A 100 or 200 pages. But unfortunately to actually explain why this is so, I had to go very deep and trace through things like the anthropology of the child’s upbringing and so forth. Therefore the description is quite long winded. But without that it’s too many jumps and too many leaps of faith. It took me six years to get it all written down. So consequently, it’s a long read if you like, which is not useful in today’s terms, but anyway, the book will be coming out at some point and hopefully that will be amusing to some&nbsp;people.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah, that’s fantastic. I I’ve read a lot of your writing on like identity and not just the Ricardian contract side of things, but also digital identity and your thinking behind that. It’d be great to have it all kind of both compiled and expanded. The connective tissue of that concept. And actually I would love to have you on the podcast again to kind of dig, really dig into the identity thing. We touched upon it in this conversation, which I’m really glad we did. But it’d be great to kind of focus on that. Get a more kind of overarching view and dive deeper into that particular subject.</p><p>Ian: Well, when the book comes out, I guess I’ll be happy to talk if you drifted into the book and actually got some questions out of it. That’d be&nbsp;great.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah, absolutely. And for listeners, I highly recommend going to — it’s iang.org right that you have some of your papers and&nbsp;—</p><p>Ian: Yeah, it’s just my stuff really. It’s just the stuff site. It’s not pushing any particular concept. I’ve got a section for this, a section for that. I collect everything there so it’s more like a CV or resume than a website, but&nbsp;—</p><p>Garrison: A lot of the topics we covered a lot of the papers that kind of articulated these ideas are in there. I highly recommend if users are interested in like Ricardian contract or thinking about like digital identity and the kind of frameworks for building financial cryptography systems. Definitely check it out. There’s a lot that I think people could get out&nbsp;of.</p><p>Ian: Yes. And the other one is financialcryptography.org. There’s nothing new there, but there are something like 1500 posts over the last decade or&nbsp;so.</p><p>Garrison: Excellent. Thank you very much for coming on the show in Ian. A lot of the work you do is like something that I’ve paid attention to for three, four years now. So it was great to kind of dive in and get your perspective on&nbsp;things.</p><p>Ian: Good to hear. I mean the point of writing it all down is so other people can take from it and maybe learn a bit, but also maybe build on it and do something bigger. It’s encouraging to see Mattereum basically do that. Grab some papers. And race with them. Try and build the&nbsp;future.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/fos-ep-5-ian-grigg-on-crypto-identity-community-and-building-positive-sum-systems-17ef316703b9">FOS Ep. 5: Ian Grigg on Crypto, Identity, Community, and Building Positive-Sum Systems</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Tomorrow’s lending experience runs on consumer-permissioned data. Credit scores and self-submitted details have provided a framework for easy personal lending and even some business loans, but tomorrow’s lending will utilize consumer-permissioned data. This data comes directly from bank accounts, and this process increases accuracy and&nbsp; improves the experience for borrowers when used to augment credit scores and verify self-submitted information.</p>
<p>This transformation into consumer-permissioned data use in credit-decisioning is already happening today thanks to Finicity’s leading open banking data access connections direct to bank accounts. Where’s lending with data headed? How will it benefit lenders and consumers? <a href="http://www.finicity.com/lend-infographic">Download our open banking lending infographic to learn more</a>.</p>
<p>Introducing <a href="http://finicity.com/open-banking">consumer-permissioned financial </a><a href="http://www.finicity.com/open-banking">data</a> from Finicity’s open banking platform to lending makes a difference in a number of ways.</p>
<p>This data allows for simple, personal experiences to capture customers and build trust. It also reduces friction and allows consumers to apply for loans across the devices they use.</p>
<p>One interaction with your borrower can tell a complete financial story using data from different accounts for real-time insights without needing to wait to confirm borrower-submitted details.</p>
<p>Empowering experiences provide direct benefits to the customer by allowing access to their&nbsp; financial data, control over how it’s used, and the ability for them to benefit from its use, such as with obtaining a better loan product or lower interest rate. Additionally, this new innovative service&nbsp; provides lenders a competitive edge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A more secure experience provides clear reasons for consumers to test the waters of new lenders or new products. Knowing your data is safe makes trying new lenders, partners, or products more likely providing a boost to innovative, new products by answering a big question for many people — security.</p>

The FTC is back with its suit against&nbsp;Facebook <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/19/technology/ftc-facebook-antitrust.html">The NYTimes</a>:</p>Photo: Alessio&nbsp;Jacona<blockquote>“Facebook lacked the business acumen and technical talent to survive the transition to mobile,” Holly Vedova, the acting director of the bureau of competition at the agency, said in a statement. “After failing to compete with new innovators, Facebook illegally bought or buried them when their popularity became an existential threat.”</blockquote><blockquote>Facebook responded: “There was no valid claim that Facebook was a monopolist — and that has not changed. Our acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp were reviewed and cleared many years ago, and our platform policies were&nbsp;lawful.”</blockquote><p>As the NYTimes report continues, this is one of Lina Khan’s first big tests after he judge dropped the initial case that’s since been resubmitted:</p><blockquote>The F.T.C.’s core argument is that Facebook tried to maintain a monopoly over social networking through its acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. Slow to develop its app for mobile phones, the company sought to “buy or bury innovators threatening to out-compete Facebook in the new mobile environment,” the agency said in its complaint.</blockquote><blockquote>The lawsuit also says that, beginning in 2010, the company stifled competitors like Circle, a social network, and Vine, a short-video platform, by adding new limits for how outside developers whose products connected to Facebook could work with other social networks.</blockquote><blockquote>“Facebook beat competitors not by improving its own product but instead by imposing anticompetitive restrictions on developers,” according to the&nbsp;lawsuit.</blockquote> Relevant:   <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/19/technology/ftc-facebook-antitrust.html">U.S. Revives Facebook Suit, Adding Details to Back Claim of a&nbsp;Monopoly</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-hit-with-renewed-antitrust-lawsuit-as-ftc-tries-again-11629387483?mod=djem10point">Facebook Hit With New Antitrust Suit From Federal Trade Commission</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/techs-antitrust-nemesis-girds-for-battle">Lina Khan Gets to Work at the&nbsp;FTC</a>   2.

<p>If you have a minute, read&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/john-herrman">John Herrman’s</a>&nbsp;thought-provoking&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/31/style/anonymity-pseudonymity-online-identity.html">piece</a>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;New York Times&nbsp;titled “Reconsidering pseudonymity and what it means to be ourselves online.”</p>



<p>We liked the article because it highlights why&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/about/">Anonyome Labs</a>&nbsp;exists and states a position we’ve always believed in—that there’s a genuine place for anonymity and pseudonymity online.</p>



<p>For years solutions to the growing problem of trolling and abuse have largely centered on ridding the internet of anonymity—forcing people to reveal their real names and identities when they engage online. But unmasking the vile troll&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0155923">won’t stop the abuse;</a>&nbsp;instead, it would leave the honest majority of users without protection, freedom and control.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Often when the legitimate need for anonymity and pseudonymity is discussed, the conversation starts and stops with the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/04/removing-anonymity-online-would-risk-the-most-vulnerable-users/">most vulnerable groups</a>. While a completely valid use case, this tends to marginalize the general need to a niche, a notion that Anonyome Labs rejects. We started our company in 2014 expressly to provide such services for the general public.</p>



<p>We believe that all people should be able to determine how, when, where, and with whom they share their personal details, and that level of control is best delivered via&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">digital pseudonymized identities</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, the public discourse needs to catch up to the broader need for anonymity and pseudonymity. As John Herrman says in his article: “When represented at all, positive uses of anonymity and pseudonymity are portrayed as narrow and exceptional; it makes sense for dissidents, for instance, but what does everyone else have to hide?”.</p>



<p>That’s why we’re pleased to see the nuances of anonymity and pseudonymity explored in a publication as mainstream as the&nbsp;New York Times. The world needs to have this conversation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because after all, as Herrman says: “The desire for semi-anonymity shares one concern: control. A troll wants control over who knows what about him; a master-of-the-universe type wants to decide what gets stuck to the family name; a young person needs a space to figure things out; an older person needs a space to change. And yet, the desire to be different to different people is as familiar as family, as common as having friends and living around other people, valuable to the powerful and the weak. Who hasn’t, at some point, yearned for that kind of agency?”</p>



<p>It’s hard to argue that those sentiments aren’t universal, even if you also think Internet trolls are ruining the world.</p>

In the past year, as Urbit has become more reliable and easier to use, we find that we're spending almost all of our time on the network. We've disappeared into the system we've been building, and it's a pleasure to be on Urbit. There's nowhere else we'd rather be.

If you're on the network with us you can see the system being built and getting better in real time. Bug fixes and new features appear on your ship constantly. The community is actively planning the future of the system _using the system itself_. At Tlon, we have the unparalleled pleasure of working on the system, _on the system_. This feels great, but for those of you who aren't on the network, it can look as if we've disappeared.

Right now, Urbit is not for my non-technical friends. But everyone can tell that mainstream apps are getting worse and most feel a desire for change. We want Urbit to be as easy to use as a conventional service. Or, at least as easy to use as Signal. And we're getting pretty close to that.

In this post I'll cover the progress we've made since releasing OS 1 so those who aren't on the network can get a sense of what we've been up to and where we're going. We've built a great communication tool called Landscape, we are improving Urbit's ease of onboarding, and we're launching an entire software distribution system. We have a lot of work on our plate.

Okay, let's talk about where we currently stand and where we're heading.

**Arc**

Let's start at the top: we're working to build a new network and operating system for everyday cloud computing. We think everyone deserves to control and shape the tools they use to communicate and collaborate.

Or, to put it another way: the apps and services we have today are confusing, annoying, and overly complicated. The only way out is to start at the foundation by building a new software stack. Once we have a cloud computing stack that an individual can own and completely control, the old hope that computers can be tools of freedom will return. We haven't forgotten the original vision of software as a fun, free, flexible everyday tool.

This is a hilariously ambitious thing to try to do, we know. This is what makes it fun. So far, we just try to move step-by-step without overhyping what we're doing. Building a new platform for networked computing is both a technical and social problem. The technology has to work exceptionally well and the community has to care for it and move it forward.

Our first step was simply to build a prototype, then to refine it into something that could plausibly work. Then, most recently, take that plausible prototype and build a user experience we liked enough to depend on it from day-to-day.

In the last eighteen months we've done exactly that. We depend on Urbit day-to-day and have shipped a tool that has become a home for numerous cultures and communities who are invested in moving the system forward. We first called that tool OS 1 but now it's known as Landscape.

First, let's talk about the general arc of OS 1 → Landscape, both the successes and challenges. Then we'll talk about our next step, which is to create an independent and community supported software ecosystem.

**OS 1 → Landscape**

The tools we use shape the way we think. So how could we build better tools with old broken ones? We needed to cut our reliance on old tools that couldn't care less about how people actually work and live. The only thing they maximized was distraction and dependence. We needed something that was fundamentally private, durable, and flexible. Above all, we needed something that actually belonged to us.

Building Urbit involves a lot of communication and collaboration. In order to move Urbit forward we knew that we needed a place to converse and connect, and we knew that place had to be on Urbit itself. We didn't need a Slack or a Discord or a Google Drive or a Reddit. We needed all of those things, in one place, that actually belonged to us.

We experimented, built things, threw them away, and then eventually built and [launched OS 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ViyftPkGk).

OS 1, now Landscape, is a simple tool for bringing groups together to communicate and stay connected. When a real physical community goes online they immediately become fragmented between various apps. Perhaps a Slack channel coupled with some Notion notebooks and a Telegram channel works for some people. It's easy to imagine other permutations, and you probably are already in at least two or three. These duct-taped stacks are not only ugly and confusing, but your day to day computing is spread thin and remains in the control of companies—not you.

Urbit is a decentralized network but Landscape is for re-centralizing your communication. Users can form groups which share a set of channels; each channel can be either a chat, a notebook or a collection of links. This means groups can communicate flexibly, exactly how they want. And since Landscape is built on Urbit, each group is private and peer to peer; data is only shared between people in the group; each community on Landscape is completely independent. Communities own their data and last as long as they need to.

This combination of a flexible unified interface on a decentralized platform you can trust feels really good.

When OS 1 was first released, it was slow, buggy, and frustrating—but we loved it and wanted it to be better. We spent the next nine months making sweeping changes to take it from releasable prototype to pretty-nice first version. We rewrote the frontend completely, massively improved the performance of Urbit OS itself, and overhauled the interface. It was an enormous collective effort.

By the end of 2020 we had renamed OS 1 to Landscape and the user experience was far better. We [announced our hosting service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qKe_WZr50) and onboarded close friends to help us test the system. I [wrote a little](&lt;[https://tlon.io/news/landscape-now/](https://tlon.io/news/landscape-now/)&gt;) about using Landscape from day-to-day around that time.

Landscape wasn't just a useful tool for us, but it was something that other communities were starting to use in earnest. It seemed like Landscape could be a great place for people to grow new private communities, so long as we could onboard new users effectively. Hosting is a huge piece of the puzzle, since we need non-technical people to be able to use this wonderful platform as easily as its mainstream competitors.

At this point (early this year), we encountered some pretty serious hurdles.

To use Urbit, you need an Urbit ID. Each one of these is an NFT (something that no one cared about when we first launched Urbit ID). The basic idea is that an ID should cost something so that they aren't used abusively. But, in late 2020 the combination of a crypto bull market and congestion on the Ethereum network caused the transaction fee for buying an Urbit ID to increase from ~$1-2 to ~$100. An Urbit ID should cost _something_, but \&gt;$100 is too much of a barrier for entry. We knew that this could happen and started researching solutions late last year, ultimately deciding to [implement a solution ourselves](https://urbit.org/blog/rollups/).

The tough part about having an identity verified on the blockchain is that you become vulnerable to unpredictable volatility. We saw a period of painfully high prices, followed by a dip, followed by another stretch of extremely high prices. We opted to continue releasing Landscape updates and moving the system forward despite the fact that it became prohibitively expensive to onboard people. Luckily, our solution to this problem should go live this summer, and will reduce the cost of onboarding about 60x. The best part is that it is a permanent solution so we'll never have to face this problem again.

The other challenge to scaling the onboarding process is hosting.

We have a functional hosting structure but we want it to be fully automated and featured. We've been able to onboard friends and enthusiasts which has taught us a lot about how the system should work. But hosting has to be easy for anyone to join and get online quickly. Without an automated invite flow and it's not ready for prime time.

We've made great progress on this front. We are currently testing improvements internally and aim to have a final version ready simultaneously with lower planet fees. Then, at long last, we can comfortably invite friends to get on the network without ever leaving the browser.

It's worth mentioning that hosting is very much a Tlon Corporation project. Urbit is a platform owned, maintained, and developed by the people that use it (along with the nascent Urbit Foundation). Tlon, while also contributing to the Urbit project, ultimately wants to produce applications and services on Urbit. Hosting is one of those projects. Hosting makes Urbit easy, approachable, and usable without the compromises involved in using a conventional service. Since we'll be one of many Urbit-related providers, Tlon won't be the only host. There are already a few others (like [UrbitHost](https://urbithost.com/)) getting off the ground, which is fantastic.

**Landscape → Grid**

As the world has become more physically distributed we rely on our digital tools to keep our communities connected. The rise of DAOs, collectives, squads, and alternative community governance structures underscores the importance of tools like Landscape that communities can actually own and control.

Our first goal was to find out if we could build something really good on top of Urbit. We did that. And we're continuing to lower the barrier to entry. We've also got an Urbit 'messenger' iOS app in the works that's really nice.

Landscape is great, but in the long run Urbit is meant to be a platform for anyone to build on top of. Urbit is a computer, not just a single communications app like Landscape. The whole point of Urbit is to make it easy for an individual to run their own general-purpose computer in the cloud. Your Urbit isn't just meant to run Landscape it's meant to run any sort of application. And that's where we're going next.

Grid is a holistic interface for interacting with your Urbit node. Landscape, as it's known today, will become one of many apps that can be launched. Perhaps most importantly, Grid will have peer-to-peer software distribution over the network. This means you can, as a developer, build something, let a friend sync it over the network, and never have to run a dedicated distribution server. Or, as an everyday user, you can run software on your private Urbit node without the developer ever being involved.

Urbit isn't an OS in the traditional sense—it's an 'overlay' OS. It has to run on top of something else. But Urbit _is_ an OS in the sense that it's general-purpose. And our goal in building interfaces for Urbit is to deliver that feeling of openness and flexibility to the user. Grid is a major step toward that goal.

Not only should a community own their communication tools, they should be able to run and host their own cloud software. They shouldn't need to rely on providers to store their data, run the application, and determine how their digital life will function.

Grid will surely go through the same process that Landscape did. It'll start as a working first version that will inspire us to refine and make it better. But, unlike Landscape, Grid opens up an entirely new frontier for what can be done on Urbit.

We're putting together our first conference on Oct 15-17th to inaugurate Urbit as an integrated platform and distribution system for new applications. [Tickets for Assembly 2021 are already available](https://checkout.eventcreate.com/assembly2021/select-buy). Tlon is going to Austin!

**Closing**

Urbit is a deeply optimistic project. Although the digital world seems more broken than ever, we're confident that something else is possible. We have already created software that people use everyday. We want everyone to have the experience that we do, and we want that experience to continue to get better. Beautiful, reliable infrastructure that communities can build on will have a significant impact on the world. The end game of connected computers doesn't have to be dystopian.

For those of you who aren't directly involved with the project, I hope this gives you a snapshot of where we are. If we were on an Antarctic expedition the postcard would read something like 'Team is well-fed, healthy and motivated. Making great progress.'

With that, I'll get back to work.

 Jolocom bringt im ONCE Projekt hoheitliche Identitäten sowie SSI in eine Wallet. 



<p>Jolocom arbeitet im Project “ONCE – Online einfach anmelden” gemeinsam mit renommierten Partnern daran, die digitalen Identitäten von Bürgern und Bürgerinnen ganzheitlich auf das Smartphone zu bringen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Das Projekt ist Teil des Innovationswettbewerbs „Schaufenster Sichere Digitale Identitäten”, gefördert durch das Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie (BMWi), und eines von insgesamt vier Projekten, die es in die dreijährige Umsetzungsphase geschafft haben. Die Jolocom GmbH wird ihre Expertise in der Entwicklung von Wallet-basierten Digitalen Identitäten auf Basis des Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) Ansatzes in insgesamt drei der Umsetzungsprojekte einbringen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nach einjähriger Vorbereitung im Rahmen der ersten Wettbewerbsphase hat die Umsetzungsphase für das Projekt ONCE im Mai 2021 begonnen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In der Anfangsphase liegt der Fokus noch stark auf der Entwicklung, Implementierung und Integration der technischen Komponenten. Bald wird allerdings die Umsetzung von Anwendungsfällen aus den Bereichen Öffentliche Verwaltung, Mobilität und Tourismus in den Vordergrund treten. Die Lösungen des ONCE-Ökosystems werden dann insbesondere in der Region Hessen, sowie in Partnerstädten in Bayern und Nordrhein-Westfalen pilotiert und in Umlauf gebracht. Ab diesem Zeitpunkt werden die praktischen Ergebnisse von ONCE&nbsp; im Alltag durch Anwohner und Bürger der Regionen erprobt.</p>



<p>Das ONCE-Ökosystem besteht aus einer Reihe von aufeinander abgestimmten Komponenten, die langfristig als eine Referenzimplementierung für ein offenes Identitätsökosystem dienen sollen. Aus diesem Grund wird bei den zu entwickelnden Komponenten von “ONCE-konformen” Lösungen gesprochen.</p>



<p>In seiner Funktionalität ist das Ökosystem darauf ausgelegt sowohl hoheitliche Identitäten und Nachweise zu bedienen (eID, mDL, iKfz), als auch Identitätsmerkmale, die nach den Prinzipien der selbstbestimmten Identität (Self-sovereign Identity) herausgegeben und verwendet werden. Das ONCE-Projekt berücksichtigt auch derzeitige Entwicklungen rund um die europäische eIDAS-Verordnung, mit dem klaren Ziel zukunftsfähige Lösungen zum Thema Digitale Identitäten für deutsche und EU-Bürger bereitzustellen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jolocom ist im ONCE-Projekt für die Entwicklung der ONCE-konformen Wallet zuständig, welche auf der Jolocom Smart-Wallet aufbaut und die gemeinsam mit den Projektpartnern in den kommenden zwei Jahren um weitere Module und Funktionen ergänzt werden wird.&nbsp;</p>

 Jolocom puts sovereign identities, as well as SSI into a single wallet as part of the ONCE project. 



<p>Jolocom is currently working on the project “ONCE – Online einfach anmelden” (simply register online – ONCE) alongside a number of prestigious partners, with the aim to bring the digital identity of any citizen onto their smartphone.</p>



<p>The project is part of the competitive innovation programme “Showcase Secure Digital Identities” (SSDI) funded by Germany’s Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) and one of four projects that qualified for the implementation phase.</p>



<p>Jolocom is a partner in three of the four SDI implementation projects, to which it will lend its expertise in self-sovereign identity and years of experience in developing digital identity wallets.</p>



<p>ONCE is the first of these projects to launch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After a year’s preparation during the initial competition phase, the implementation phase of the ONCE project started in May 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, the focus is on the development and application of the technical components. Soon, however, a large number of use cases from the public administration, mobility and tourism sectors will be piloted in the Hesse region and in partner cities in Bavaria and North Rhine-Westphalia. It is at this stage that the ONCE ecosystem will be tested by ordinary citizens.</p>



<p>The ONCE ecosystem consists of a number of inter-dependent and well coordinated components that are intended to serve as a reference point for a long-lasting open identity ecosystem in Germany. As such, components developed in the project have been dubbed ONCE-compliant solutions.</p>



<p>In terms of its functionality, the ecosystem is designed to serve officially issued, so-called sovereign identities and proofs (eID, mDL, iKfz), as well as digital identity credentials issued and used according to the principles of self-sovereign identity. The ONCE project is also taking recent developments in the European eIDAS regulation into consideration, with the aim of providing future-proof solutions for digital identities to German and EU citizens.</p>



<p>Within the ONCE project, Jolocom is responsible for the development of the ONCE-compliant wallet. This will be based on Jolocom’s existing SmartWallet and will, with the aid of the project partners, be supplemented with additional modules and functions over the next two years.</p>



 Publicly funded project partners 



<p>Bundesdruckerei GmbH (Lead coordinatior of the consortium), AKDB, Behle Hochheide GmbH &amp; Co.KG, Deutsche Telekom Security GmbH, ekom21 – KGRZ Hessen, Fraunhofer-Institute für Angewandte und Integrierte Sicherheit (AISEC) und für Arbeitswirtschaft und Organisation (IAO), Giesecke+Devrient Mobile Security GmbH, Governikus KG, HelloGuest Solutions GmbH, Jolocom GmbH, regio iT GmbH, Robert Bosch GmbH, Stadt Fürth, Vodafone GmbH.</p>



<p>A further 24 companies are associated partners of the project, supporting the consortium work without public funding for their expenses.</p>

 ML Ops — a TPM’s guide on how to get&nbsp;started <p>First things first — Why am I writing this&nbsp;article?</p><p>I had my first experience working on deploying a new machine learning model to a live production system two years ago when I joined a high profile project said to be game-changing for our business (no pressure!). We had a tight timeline and high expectations to positively impact key business metrics. As a technical program manager (TPM) I was responsible for driving the successful delivery of the research-ready model to production in the requested time frame and ensuring we realise the expected business impact. Spoiler alert — it didn’t go so smoothly!</p><p>While working on this project I identified numerous gaps in our machine learning development and delivery infrastructure and processes. After highlighting these gaps to our leadership, I was tasked with founding our machine learning operations team. In this article, I will share a framework for founding and growing an ML Ops team within an organisation.</p><p>When starting in the field, I found that it was pretty difficult to find resources on how to start, organise and run an ML Ops function and team in an organisation. There was a lot of information on different tools that take care of parts of the ML pipeline but that was about it. For a newbie to the problem space, I found that I largely had to depend and draw on my skills and prior experience as a TPM and take it from&nbsp;there.</p><p>Here I will reflect on some of my experience working in ML Ops and will discuss the background, fundamentals and how to get started. I hope it will be useful to those just starting their ML Ops&nbsp;journey.</p><p>ML Ops Background</p><p>As the popularity of machine learning models grew, machine learning platforms were required to support the development, delivery and maintenance of many models in a live production system at scale. Particularly, the need for machine learning platforms began to rise several years ago after companies developing and using ML models in their products started to realise that deploying ML models came with added complexities compared to traditional code. Whilst deploying the model itself can be relatively easy, it’s the ongoing operations and maintenance once the model goes to production that was difficult to&nbsp;manage.</p><p>One of the most prominent papers that first highlighted this problem came in 2014 from a group of Google researchers titled “Machine Learning: The High-Interest Credit Card of Technical Debt”. In the paper, the authors alluded to a growing and often ignored problem, namely the operational complexities of maintaining a machine learning system in production.</p><p>The paper highlighted that ‘Using the framework of technical debt, we note that it is remarkably easy to incur massive ongoing maintenance costs at the system level when applying machine learning.’ [D. Sculley, Gary Holt,&nbsp;etc]</p><p>The paper also sparked awareness and interest in the problem field of operations and maintenance of machine learning models in production. In response, many companies started investing and forming ML Ops functions to develop and manage their machine learning platforms and the full machine learning lifecycle.</p><p>This brings us to two main questions:</p>  What is ML&nbsp;Ops?  What is the full machine learning lifecycle?  <p>What is ML&nbsp;Ops?</p><p>There are a few definitions of the ML Ops function and team responsibilities but, at its core, the team’s purpose is to ‘help simplify the management, logistics, and deployment of machine learning models between operations and engineering teams and machine learning researchers’. Most commonly, as intuited by the name, ML Ops is compared to DevOps or cloud infrastructure teams but applied to the field of machine learning. The goals of the two functions are very similar. Much like DevOps, the goal of ML Ops is to create a continuous development pipeline for machine learning models. A pipeline that quickly allows data scientists and machine learning engineers to deploy, test and monitor their models, ensuring they continue to act in the way they are expected&nbsp;to.</p><p>In practice, this means that ML Ops must manage a much wider range of responsibilities than would normally be expected from DevOps. Unlike DevOps, ML Ops typically requires additional considerations including data verification, model analysis, metadata management, feature engineering, code and data versioning along with the ML code&nbsp;itself.</p><p>Besides DevOps, ML Ops also works very closely with data/applied scientists and software engineers. The diagram below visualises the scope of the ML Ops team and its function.</p><p>From my personal experience, there are two key benefits of ML Ops in an organisation. The first is to provide tooling and infrastructure by working closely together with DevOps and Engineering. The second is to bring data/applied scientists and software engineers closer together and to foster collaboration and best practices, thereby streamlining the model development, productionisation and maintenance.</p><p>The ML Pipeline and the ML Lifecycle</p><p>Often, the ML Lifecycle is described as having the following stages:</p><p>However, in a modern organisation that builds AI-powered products, the above diagram covers only half of the ML lifecycle. For truly successful ML-powered products, additional stages need to be&nbsp;added.</p><p>Using the extended ML lifecycle model we can look into what a typical ML Pipeline looks&nbsp;like.</p><p>The above pipeline also nicely depicts the scope of work of an ML Ops&nbsp;team.</p><p>Is ML Ops worth&nbsp;it?</p><p>Increasingly, organisations are adopting machine learning to help improve their performance, business decision making, and to reduce costs. When deployed successfully, AI and ML could help drive up to 20% of companies’ earnings (McKinsey 2020).</p><p>To get to a place where your machine learning models are adding real value to your business, you not only have to build the right models but also need to effectively deploy, monitor, update and govern these&nbsp;models.</p><p>The key learning here is that machine learning can provide great value to your bottom line, but only if implemented and maintained correctly. In the context of a growing business, scaling ML can be difficult to achieve without a solid framework. This is where ML Ops comes&nbsp;in.</p><p>How to get&nbsp;started?</p><p>After your organisation agrees that investing in ML Ops is valuable, you need to decide how to start your ML Ops journey. As the ML Ops function is relatively new there is a lot of fluidity and flexibility around what’s in scope for the team and how it’s organised. This can also differ from company to&nbsp;company.</p><p>At my company, we started our journey one and a half years ago with an MVP (minimum viable product) ML Ops team. The newly formed team had three members — a technical program manager (me), a software engineer and a DevOps engineer.</p><p>We started by identifying our stakeholders. This step is often missed but I believe it is crucial to take the time to do this as it helps define the scope of the team. Conventional wisdom tells us that ML Ops’ stakeholders are data and applied scientists. While I agree that these are some of the main stakeholders, I strongly believe that a successful ML Ops team and function has many stakeholders in the organisation whose needs need to be understood and&nbsp;met.</p><p>Our stakeholder list looked like&nbsp;this:</p>  Applied science team. It’s important to recognise that this team has two groups with aligned but different needs and requirements. These two groups are individual contributors and managers.  Product teams utilising the ML models — especially the software engineers working together with applied scientists on deploying models.  Data scientists and product&nbsp;analysts  Security team  Compliance team  Legal team  Senior company leadership  <p>After identifying our stakeholders, we conducted interviews with all of them asking “What is the hardest thing for their function with respect to ML?” and “What do they need in order to go faster and do&nbsp;better?”</p><p>You can get a lot of interesting insights by asking different people the same question. The answers from our applied scientists and software engineers somewhat surprised us with the breadth of issues they discussed.</p><p>Our business stakeholders and engineering managers complained about projects taking too long. Specifically, they complained that getting the first versions of a model to production took surprisingly long (a problem most organisations using ML in their products suffer&nbsp;from).</p><p>Our applied scientists complained about data access, data labelling and overall data management. They struggled with version control of their code, data, models, dependencies and parameters. Additionally, thorough testing was difficult and time-consuming.</p><p>Our software engineers and applied scientists alike complained about collaboration and communication and struggled to work effectively and efficiently together. For example, we saw applied scientists incorporating modern off-the-shelf ML libraries but, unfortunately, we witnessed various issues caused by these libraries when they got included as dependencies in production workflows.</p><p>For our security team, the balance between data security and operational efficiency was a real challenge and one that is difficult to strike and maintain.</p><p>Our legal and compliance teams had increasing requirements with respect to AI governance and model explainability.</p><p>Mapping the pain points from all stakeholders looked a bit like&nbsp;this.</p><p>The tip of the iceberg shows the concerns of our main stakeholders while the hidden part of the iceberg depicts the needs of the secondary stakeholders. The whole iceberg depicts the needs of the ML-powered organisation as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p>Regarding our main stakeholders: as we expected, we discovered some technical gaps and realised that most of the things that our scientists needed to do were, in theory, technically possible but nothing was easy enough. Common operations were tedious and time-consuming, lacking process support. Standardisation was minimal and we realised we were in a situation which we called ‘The Wild West of&nbsp;models’.</p><p>A ‘‘Wild West of models’ situation is characterised by:</p>  Lack of consistency in working practices and processes.  Basic tooling to supporting some of the stages of the ML lifecycle but lack of extensive pipelines supporting the entire ML lifecycle.  High compute costs which are difficult to explain and&nbsp;manage.  Work is done in silos and there is little and sporadic documentation.  Model deployment takes ‘surprisingly’ long.  <p>While these are some of the main signs, this is by no means an exhaustive list (but you get the idea!) If you are in a similar situation, operational efficiency and a quick machine learning deployment cycle, while meeting security and regulatory requirements, seems a distant&nbsp;dream.</p><p>Alongside working on understanding the current state of ML Ops and stakeholders’ pain points we also worked on a vision for the team and an ideal future state. We stated our mission as ‘To enable our organisation to efficiently develop and ship ML-powered features throughout the product.’</p><p>It’s intentional that this statement focuses on the efficient delivery of ML-powered products from an organisational perspective. I believe that ML Ops, like any other successful team or function in an organisation, needs to support the delivery of business value and it’s important to capture this in the mission statement of the team. It is for this same reason (laser focus on delivering organisational value) that having a clear understanding of your team’s stakeholders and extended ML lifecycle is so&nbsp;crucial.</p><p>The next step is to take these pain points and develop a roadmap that will take the infrastructure and operations from the current status to your North Star. The roadmap should focus not only on building infrastructure and tools but also recognise the need to improve processes and practices alongside to fully realise the benefits of the developed infrastructure and tools. Failing to evolve processes, practices and culture alongside the technical infrastructure and tooling is a common organisational issue and one that is important to avoid in the context of ML&nbsp;Ops.</p><p>Once you have all these foundational pieces in place all that is left is to get to&nbsp;work!</p><p>Fast forward to today and, amongst other things, we have managed&nbsp;to:</p>  Perform a security audit of tools and practices to identify gaps and close&nbsp;them.  Build a new data pipeline making data sourcing and management significantly easier and&nbsp;faster.  Improve the development experience by streamlining the number of tools used and their&nbsp;setup.  Hold training with our applied scientists to help improve their python and general coding&nbsp;skills.  Reduce costs by 20% while increasing the number of jobs run by 30% through better resource management.  Reduce overall time from an ML PoC (machine learning proof of concept) to production by&nbsp;20%.  <p>By keeping laser-focused on what matters and relentlessly demonstrating the business impact of the team’s work I was able to build the case to double the team early this year with plans to quadruple by the end of the&nbsp;year.</p><p>So what is next for us? Our next goal is to reduce cycle time from data collection, training and testing the corresponding model in production safely down to 48 hours. For mission-critical systems like ours, this is very ambitious but we are up for the challenge!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech/ml-ops-a-tpms-guide-on-how-to-get-started-652c115c02a6">ML Ops — a TPM’s guide on how to get started</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech">Onfido Tech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>TechTimes: This article is putting in the spotlight the real-world usability of crypto projects and cryptocurrencies. And, while the author admits there is still a long way for cryptocurrencies to become widely used,&nbsp;he is also showing some real-world projects helping to make blockchain technology more "mainstream" than ever.&nbsp; Places among the notable examples have found three Ardor and Ignis based projects -&nbsp;HotCity,&nbsp;which identifies micro-sources of waste heat for recycling,&nbsp;TreeCycle&nbsp;- which invites investors to purchase security tokens representing a share in a reforestation and timber sustainability initiative in Paraguay; and&nbsp;Triffic&nbsp;- which promotes local economies by offering users a geocaching game where they can collect rewards when out and about in their local areas.</p>

<p>Cryptomode: The high energy consumption and expensive hardware requirements of Bitcoin and other proof-of-work networks are no secret to anybody. In that regard we are proud to have pioneered the first pure proof-of-stake blockchain - Nxt, in 2013 and the first multi-chain network - Ardor, in 2018. Both of them use a 100% proof-of-stake consensus algorithm and their energy consumption is extremely low - a fact that's been recognized many times and once again lately by this article. We can only add that Nxt and Ardor are not only very energy-efficient but they can easily work on any desktop or&nbsp;mobile device.</p>

<p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI) is an emerging philosophy that puts you in complete control over your data. In this framework, you get to store your data and share it with just the entities you&nbsp;want.</p><p>This relatively new concept of digital identity management has three essential pillars and they are the issuer, the holder, and the verifier. Together, these three pillars or entities constitute what’s called the trust triangle.</p><p>Let’s start with understanding what these three pillars&nbsp;are.</p> Who are&nbsp;Issuers? <p>An issuer is an entity that is authorized to issue a credential. These issuers are typically government organizations, healthcare centers, banks and financial institutions, schools and universities, and possibly even organizations and startups that verify a piece of information and issue a credential attesting that information.</p><p>For example, the Department of Motor Vehicles is an issuer that is authorized to issue a driver’s license credential that contains the license number of an individual. Similarly, SafeTravel is a startup company that verifies whether an individual has taken his or her COVID vaccination and accordingly, issues a credential to attest&nbsp;it.</p> Who are&nbsp;Holders? <p>A holder is the owner of the credential and has complete control over how it can be managed, with whom these credentials can be shared, or revoked. Holders can be individuals or organizations.</p><p>Since the holder is the owner of the credential, this entity can create a verifiable presentation consisting of one or more <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credentials</a>, and this presentation is shared with verifiers who will use this information to authenticate the user or validate the shared information.</p> Who are Verifiers? <p>A verifier is an entity that verifies a credential and ensures that it comes from a competent issuer, is tamper-proof, and is still relevant (not expired or revoked). A verifier takes the verifiable presentation from the holder to determine its authenticity.</p><p>Verifiers are entities that need specific information about a holder for authentication, so its services can be offered to the holder. A good example is an alcohol store that has to verify the age of the buyer before selling alcohol to him or&nbsp;her.</p> Why are they Called the Trust Triangle? <p>The relationship between the issuers, holders, and verifiers is called the trust triangle simply because you need an element of trust among these entities for them to work together. Also, this term is typically used to convey human relationships in the digital&nbsp;world.</p><p>When an issuer issues a credential, the holder is willing to trust the issuer. The same applies to the verifiable presentation shared by the holder to the verifier and when the verifier verifies the issuer’s credential.</p><p>While this does not mean that there is a legal partnership or understanding between the entities involved, it does mean that each of the entities is willing to examine the credibility of the other, and this implicit trust is what constitutes this&nbsp;term.</p> Real-world Examples <p>Here are some real-world examples of how the issuer, holder, and verifier come together to create a transaction.</p> Employment <p>Some companies like GoodWorker verify the profiles of workers and issue <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/on-demand-employment-endorsements-a-use-case-for-verifiable-credentials-d19d263a0fbb">employment credentials</a> to authenticate their past employment. Thus, they are the&nbsp;issuers.</p><p>The holders are the workers themselves on whom the credential is issued while verifiers are those to whom the holder shares the credential issued by the&nbsp;issuer.</p> Opening a Bank&nbsp;Account <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">Verifiable credentials</a> can come in handy for opening a bank account. Here, the issuer can be a startup company that collates all the government-issued documents and stores them in the form of a verifiable credential. A good example would be DigiLocker from the Government of India that provides access to authentic digital documents to citizen’s digital document&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>The holder is an individual/company/entity looking to open a bank account while the verifier is the bank where the holder wants to open an&nbsp;account.</p> Verifying Age at a&nbsp;Bar <p>Another example is when a holder shares a date of birth verifiable credential with the bar manager to prove that he is over 18 years of&nbsp;age.</p><p>Here, the issuer is a government entity or a startup that has verified the holder’s records while the verifier is the restaurant manager.</p><p>As you can see, there is an element of trust involved in the relationship between all three&nbsp;parties.</p><p>Here are more <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">use cases</a> and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-proof-of-concept-poc-for-verifiable-credentials-edf684b592f2">PoCs</a> for you to understand the relationship between an issuer, holder, and a verifier.</p><p>Affinidi provides building blocks for an open and interoperable Self-Sovereign Identity ecosystem.

<p>First of all, I want to publicly say that I’ve struggled with obsessive-compulsive disorder for most of my life. This is Dev Pulse 102 and I'm talking about Holochain v0.0.103. Those numbers differ by one, and that really annoys me. But I’ve found that one of the best remedies for OCD is to laugh at myself. So I’m going to have a little chuckle, delight in the mismatch, and move on to the exciting news for this release!</p> Countersigning <p>[Editor's note: this section was modified on August 23rd, 2021, at 04:30 UTC, after I received feedback from the core devs. It's meant to be a gentle introduction to countersigning, not a comprehensive guide. It'll make it into the Core Concepts soon though. In the meantime, <a href="https://forum.holochain.org/t/countersigning-has-landed-in-holochain-v0-0-103/6739">join this forum thread</a> to share your questions, use cases, and other thoughts related to countersigning.]</p><p>This is the big news in Holochain v0.0.103. Many of you who follow Holochain come from the cryptocurrency world, so naturally you’re probably interested in Holochain as a platform for building new cryptocurrencies. But you probably also know that they <a href="https://medium.com/holochain/beyond-blockchain-simple-scalable-cryptocurrencies-1eb7aebac6ae">won’t work like traditional cryptocurrencies</a>.</p><p>So how will they work?</p><p>Using a technique called countersigning. Because every participant in a hApp has their own source chain, every transaction is a bit like a cross-chain <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atomic-swaps.asp">atomic swap</a> (not exactly, but close enough).</p><p>Here’s what countersigning looks like, in rough terms. Although it can be used for any sort of interaction where multiple parties come to agreement, we’ll use a currency transaction because everyone is familiar with that. (Other use cases we've seen include legal contracts, ownership transfers (also known as <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/nfts-on-holochain-easy-as-passing-the-ball-2/">NFTs</a>), and even <a href="https://youtu.be/AQ6-_QsuLIw">chess</a> player <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">ranking</a>.)</p><p>Alice owes Bob 100 credits for a bicycle purchase. She sends Bob the details of the transaction and Bob acknowledges that it’s the correct amount. This is the human part, where Alice and Bob are interacting with their app UIs.</p><p>Now that the transaction details are agreed upon, Alice and Bob’s hApps start an automated process to countersign and commit the transaction to their own source chains. It's meant to happen quickly, when both parties are online. Once it’s done, each person will have a copy of the transaction on their own source chain, signed by both themselves and the other party, and published to the DHT.</p><p>(Note: From here on in, ‘Alice and Bob’ actually mean Alice and Bob’s computers.)</p><p>Alice creates a proposal that she and Bob come to ‘local consensus’ on the states of their source chains. This is called a <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.103/hdk/prelude/countersigning/struct.PreflightRequest.html">preflight request</a>. It specifies who’s involved (her and Bob), the hash of the proposed transaction, and the time window for action. Once she’s created it, she sends it to Bob.</p><p>Bob sends Alice his signature on the preflight request, along with his current source chain state. This is called a <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.103/hdk/prelude/struct.PreflightResponse.html">preflight response</a>. His source chain is now ‘locked’ at this state until the transaction succeeds or fails. In the meantime, Alice signs the preflight request too.</p><p>Now Alice creates a <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.103/hdk/prelude/struct.CounterSigningSessionData.html">countersigning session</a>, containing the preflight request, along with her and Bob’s signatures and source chain states. Once again, she sends it off to Bob.</p><p>Alice and Bob both try to commit a <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.103/hdk/prelude/enum.Entry.html#variant.CounterSign">countersigned entry</a>, including both the countersigning session and the transaction data, to their source chains.</p><p>This is where they both have the chance to back out if something goes wrong — their entry gets passed through a validation function which double-checks that Alice still has sufficient balance. Alice and Bob both run the validation function twice — once from their perspective and once from the other’s perspective — just to make sure it’s valid for both source chains.</p><p>If all goes well in validation, it’s ready to commit — almost. First, Alice and Bob publish the entry and their own headers to a certain part of the DHT, the entry’s neighbourhood, where it gets validated by third parties.</p><p>Once the neighbourhood collects both Alice and Bob’s headers, they send a copy of both headers to both of them.</p><p>Now that Alice and Bob have seen that the other has signed the entry, the transaction is almost complete. There’s one last step: they finally commit the entry to their source chains and publish their headers to two more parts of the DHT, their own neighbourhoods. This allows future counterparties to check for <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/doublespending.asp">double-spend attempts</a>.</p><p>Now the money is transferred, Alice and Bob’s source chains are unlocked, and Bob gives Alice her bike.</p><p>If this sounds complicated, it’s because it is. The good news is that most of this stuff is handled by the Holochain conductor. As a developer, you just need to know about <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.103/hdk/prelude/countersigning/struct.PreflightRequest.html">preflight requests</a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.103/hdk/prelude/struct.PreflightResponse.html">preflight response</a> signing, <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.103/hdk/prelude/struct.CounterSigningSessionData.html">countersigning sessions</a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.103/hdk/prelude/enum.Entry.html#variant.CounterSign">countersigned entries</a>, and the new <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.103/hdk/countersigning/fn.accept_countersigning_preflight_request.html">accept_countersigning_preflight_request</a></code> host function which does most of the heavy lifting for you. The rest is flexible; you can create, distribute, and collect these things in whatever way works for you. And any app entry type that you define can be part of a countersigned transaction, in both <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/6_crud_actions/#simulating-mutability">create and update flavours</a>.</p><blockquote>Note: Countersigning isn't related to 'chain fork detection', which catches the dreaded double-spend attack, so it doesn't have the power to prevent it. That's the job of the DHT, which <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/#a-cloud-of-witnesses">collects all the evidence</a> needed to detect a fork and eject the bad actor after the fact. Our core devs are also working on a possible preventative solution; watch the Dev Pulse in the coming months for more details.</blockquote> Parallel network functions <p>Network functions, like DHT gets, remote calls, and remote signals, are blocking calls — that is, they stop execution of your code until they’re done. If you have to retrieve a lot of DHT data or call the same function on a lot of peers’ devices, that means you have to loop over everything you wanted to do and do each call in serial. This can take a lot of time.</p><p>There’s been a change to many network functions; now you can specify multiple DHT hashes for <code>get</code>, <code>get_details</code>, <code>get_links</code>, and <code>get_link_details</code>, and multiple agent IDs for <code>call_remote</code>. Holochain then does the work in parallel, returning a list of successes and failures all at once.</p> Fixes and breaking changes   Breaking: A header timestamp will always be newer than its previous header’s timestamp. Previously it was always newer than or equal to.  Breaking: Conductor configs now <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.103/CHANGELOG.md#holochain_conductor_api-003">require a <code>passphrase_service</code> directive</a>.  Breaking: <code>sys_time</code> returns a <code>Timestamp</code> instead of a <code>Duration</code>.  Bugfix: DNAs can now be <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/881">installed in parallel</a>.  Holochain now uses Lair 0.0.3, which stores entries in SQLite and encrypts them using a supplied passphrase. This is why conductor configs now require a passphrase service directive.  <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.103/CHANGELOG.md#20210817185301">Read the full changelog</a> for more details.</p> Two more releases coming soon! <p>Over the next two or three weeks, the core dev team will release Holochain v0.0.104 and v0.0.105. These changes are scheduled to include:</p>  DHT sharding (yay!)  Fixes and speed improvements for gossiping and publishing  HDK improvements  <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/932">‘Relaxed’ concurrent source chain writes</a>  Binary releases for Linux  <p>I’m away on holiday next week, so I might be late announcing one of these releases.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/hegde">Raj Hegde</a></p><p>
Carsten Stöcker, co-founder and CEO at Spherity is to deliver a presentation on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4692/1" title="Identity Is the New Blue"> How an Entire Industry Adopts Digital Enterprise Identity </a>on Wednesday, September 15 starting at 3:30 pm at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2021" title="European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021">EIC 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Carsten some questions about his planned presentation.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p>How would you describe the current state of the digital identity sector? </p>
<p>
The current state is determined by industry players and governments that are realizing the importance of digital identity. It's a part of digital identity for interactions on the internet for digital transformations and for digitalization of public services. And this is not only happening here in Germany - the European Union, for example, is pushing very hard for the so-called EU digital identity wallet. There's a large movement in the government to put this in place to stay competitive. It's digitalization of our societies and industries, but it's also happening in the US and in Asia.  A lot of governments and enterprises have realized the importance and are now starting to adopt technology to push this into a field test to experiment with regulatory frameworks, to get these technologies into production.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Why are secure digital identities so important in today's economy? </p>
<p>
Yeah, it's not just important. It's also mandatory. And if you look at the sheer numbers, so I, as a corporate, or as a government have terabytes and terabytes of data in my IT systems, but today I don't have any instruments to check the authenticity of the data. So who provided the data, which citizen, which customer, which IoT device, which business partner provides the data? I don't have any instruments. And I also don't have enough instruments to check the integrity of the data. And that's now changing with digital identity technology built upon public key infrastructure. I suddenly have some tools to check the authenticity, integrity, provenance of my data. I can trust my data even more and especially in use cases where I have to interact with a lot of previously unknown supply chain actors. So this is a must-have capability for the circular economy.   </p>
<p>Think about supplier onboarding. Can I trust if my supplier is real or fake? What credentials do they have are they compliant with environment, health and safety standards?  Do I trust the IoT device? I cannot answer these questions today, but with digital identity digital signatures, I get all the instruments to bring digitization to the next step. And, not only to improve the business policies, regulatory requirements, but also improve cybersecurity quite a bit. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Where are you experiencing the adoption of digital identities? What role do you specifically play?</p>
<p>
So we experienced most adoption in ecosystems that have a clear problem to be solved, especially when it's regulatory problems, regulatory requirements where I must do something, I must prove something, I must verify something, and we are experiencing a lot of adoption when there is a government push. Um, for example, in Europe, in Germany, governments want to keep up with digitization and have understood digital identities and their core capabilities. They really push hard to build entire ecosystems. And that's of fundamental importance because this technology is not just for one company, It's for entire ecosystems. It needs to be adopted by a lot of supply chain and value chain actors and ecosystem actors. And that's so crucial. So crucial role as a government to push hard, to get the entire ecosystems in place and even help out with some regulatory requirements and regulatory requirement amendments. And there we are experiencing the biggest adoption when it comes to early productive systems and productive field tests. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You will be speaking at EIC about how an entire industry adopts digital enterprise identity. Could you give us a sneak peek about your talk?  </p>
<p>
Yeah, sure. I will talk about the so-called the US drug supply chain security act, and there's one requirement that's the authorized trading partner requirement. What problem does it solve? It basically solves the problem that previously unknown supply chain actors, such as the manufacturer and the wholesalers they’ve never met before, but they would like to exchange data. Then the law says you must authorize and authenticate your supply chain partner, which means I, as a wholesaler, when I'm interacting with the manufacturer, I must check, is this the real manufacturer and ask the manufacturer if they have a state license to manufacture pharmaceutical products. I must check the state license. Today, that's a manual process. The process takes a long time and with digital identity and verifiable signatures - this can be fully digitized. In addition, what we also speak at EIC. So we talk about role of partnerships, strong partnerships to build an entire ecosystem and to drive full adoption of an entire industry domain, um, because only if the full adoption could be achieved, then this is a massively scalable technology. And yeah, interested in this use case, learn more at the EIC and join our talk. </p>

<p>Whatever your KYC needs are, AutoIdent has got you covered.</p>
 What is IDnow AutoIdent? 
<p>AutoIdent is IDnow’s AI-powered automated identity verification solution. Its automation offers an easy and convenient onboarding process without compromise to security.</p>
<p>IDnow AutoIdent leverages modern AI and machine learning, trained on millions of data sets and backed by the expertise of a network of top identity and fraud specialists. The outcome is the best of both worlds, convenient and secure.</p>
 What makes IDnow AutoIdent so versatile? 
<p>What sets IDnow AutoIdent apart is its ability to adjust to your use case and regulatory needs. No matter how high your security requirements are — IDnow AutoIdent has got you covered. Multiple modules such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/qualified-electronic-signature-qes/">Qualified Electronic Signatures</a> (QES) or Bank Transfer allow you to customize AutoIdent to your needs.</p>
<p>Because of this versatility, IDnow AutoIdent is one of the first identity verification solutions compliant with the German AML Act that operates as an automated process and meets high-security requirements.</p>
 Why are there different levels of security? 
<p>Not every country, industry, or use case has the exact security requirements for identity verification. Therefore, different use cases require different levels of security.</p>
<p>For example, verifying the validity of your driving license for your favorite mobility app requires less security than verifying your identity to open a bank account. The same applies when you need to verify your age on an online gambling website, compared to opening an account at the newest cryptocurrency exchange. Furthermore, when looking at geographical differences, opening a bank account in the UK is regulated less than in France or Germany.</p>
 From the UK FCA, over EU eIDAS to the German BaFin, AutoIdent covers it all. 
 UK post Brexit. 
<p>IDnow AutoIdent is also fully compliant with the UK AML regulation and the FCA post Brexit. As the UK recognizes automated remote identity verification solutions for opening bank accounts and other financial services, the standard version of IDnow AutoIdent is sufficient to meet the regulatory requirements.</p>
 European eIDAS. 
<p>Based on European eIDAS regulation, article 24(1)d, IDnow AutoIdent can be used to identify a person in combination with a QES (Qualified Electronic Signature), as long as the procedure is accepted at the national level. In conformity with eIDAS, IDnow AutoIdent is compliant for bank account opening in most European countries, such as France and Italy.</p>
<p>However, some markets, such as Germany, go beyond European standards and have unique country-specific regulatory requirements that require the combination of identity verification with a QES and bank transfer for GwG-compliance. We discuss this in further detail in the next section.</p>
 One of the first automated solutions to comply with the German GwG. 
<p>The German GwG regulation is often considered the holy grail of AML and KYC regulations and, therefore, a benchmark in the industry. IDnow, originating from Munich, sees the German market as its home turf and strives to be a leader in GwG compliant identity verification solutions.</p>
<p>To comply with the German GwG requirements, IDnow AutoIdent can be coupled with QES and Bank Transfer modules. In combination with these modules, IDnow provides a fully compliant remote onboarding solution in accordance with the German AML Act, the Geldwäschegesetz (GwG), under Section §12 sentence 1 No 3.</p>
<p>After starting the automated identity verification process, an extra level of assurance is initiated. By combining the security features of a Qualified Electronic Signature and an existing online bank account, AutoIdent complies with the German GwG requirements. This approach simplifies opening additional German bank accounts tremendously.</p>
  
 How do the different modules work? 
 QES (Qualified Electronic Signature). 
<p>A QES is not necessarily a signature in the traditional sense. You can better compare it to a digital security certificate that certifies the validity of a piece of information. According to the European eIDAS regulation, a QES can only be issued by a Trust Service Provider (TSP).</p>
<p>In the majority of cases, a QES is being used to sign contracts digitally. However, in the case of AutoIdent, we are using the QES to add another level of assurance and verify the identity.</p>
<p>Instead of signing a contractual document, a document with the identity information is signed. The good news is, IDnow AutoIdent, including QES, is certified by a conformity assessment body and is approved by an EU Member State National Regulator for issuing QES (Qualified Electronic Signature) according to eIDAS Regulation Article 24 (1) d).</p>
 Bank Transfer (as small as 1 Euro Cent). 
<p>At first sight, you might ask yourself, “How can a bank transfer improve my KYC process?”. However, the logic behind the process is straightforward.</p>
<p>The prerequisite is that somebody who has already opened a bank account in the same country or regulatory environment before, at the same time, has performed the required KYC and identity verification as well. Consequently, a reference transaction from a qualified bank account is considered a valid form of identity verification.</p>
<p>In practice, the process requires the customer to make a transfer, as small as one Euro Cent, which is being reimbursed, from their existing bank account to IDnow. This approach simplifies the process of opening additional bank accounts.</p>
 Use IDnow AutoIdent plus eSign to sign important contracts. 
<p>Depending on the customer’s needs, the onboarding process offers total flexibility, with the possible of additional components of the IDnow platform added, e.g., <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/esign/">eSign</a>. The add-on for the digital contract signing opens up additional use cases such as taking out a consumer loan. In that case, the QES is being used to sign a contractual document while also validating the identity verification and validating the identity verification.</p>
<p>Use IDnow AutoIdent plus eSign to offer your customers a convenient and secure way to sign important contracts. eSign can be used to sign loan agreements, insurance contracts, employment contracts, or any other form of agreement.</p>

  <p>Even if you’ve never heard of the OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant, formerly known as the Device Flow, you’ve probably seen it in action on a smart TV or other streaming device. The Device Authorization Grant is commonly used on devices with limited keyboard input ability. The process allows you to log in to an account more easily via a separate browser on your laptop, mobile phone, or other companion rich-input device.</p>

<p>For instance, if AtkoTV is launching a streaming service, its streaming Apple TV app might present you with something like the sign-in screen below. Instead of struggling to input anything on your TV, you’d log in on your laptop or mobile phone to complete the sign-in process.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Back in 2019, <a>Aaron Parecki</a> showed <a>how to support the OAuth 2.0 Device Grant</a>, but it required you to deploy a proxy. Fast forward a couple years, and today we’re happy to let you know that the Okta platform has officially introduced native Device Authorization, and it’s available now as an early access feature. This post will show you how to enable the Device Flow process in your Okta account, and how to use it in a real application.</p>

 The OAuth 2.0 Device Grant Interaction 

<p>The <a href="https://oauth.net/2/device-flow/">OAuth 2.0 specification</a> defines the Device Grant as  “an OAuth 2.0 extension that enables devices with no browser or limited input capability to obtain an access token.” The official <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8628">RFC</a> describes the interaction in detail, as you can also see in the following flow diagram.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Let’s take a look at the code. In the command line, we can perform the first authorization step as follows:</p>

   <code>curl -X POST \
  --url https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/v1/device/authorize \
  --data 'client_id=0oa15wulqt5yqD9FP5d7&amp;scope=openid profile offline_access'
</code>   

<p>We will get back a response:</p>

   <code>{
  "device_code": "df1b060b-4e36-4bbe-98aa-5dcb11909f5f",
  "user_code": "DRTDNTJC",
  "verification_uri": "https://dev-133337.okta.com/activate",
  "verification_uri_complete": "https://dev-133337.okta.com/activate?user_code=DRTDNTJC",
  "expires_in": 600,
  "interval": 5
}
</code>   

<p>In the second step, to poll for the access token, we issue the following command:</p>

   <code>curl -X POST \
  --url https://dev-133337.com/oauth2/v1/token \
  --data 'device_code=df1b060b-4e36-4bbe-98aa-5dcb11909f5f&amp;grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code&amp;client_id=0oa15wulqt5yqD9FP5d7'
</code>   

<p>If the user has not logged in, the response looks like this:</p>

   <code>{
  "error": "authorization_pending",
  "error_description": "The device authorization is pending. Please try again later."
}
</code>   

<p>Otherwise, we’ll get a response back with the <code>access_token</code>, <code>refresh_token</code> and <code>id_token</code>.</p>

   <code>{
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "access_token": "....",
  "scope": "openid profile offline_access",
  "refresh_token": "....",
  "id_token": "...."
}
</code>   

 How to Enable the Device Grant in Okta 



<p>The Device Grant is an Early Availability feature on the Okta platform. First, you’ll need to enable the feature from your org dashboard. From the left navigation pane in the Admin Console, go to Settings -&gt; Features, locate the OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant slider, and slide to enable.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Follow these steps to add a new app that supports the Device Grant.</p>

 
   
    <p>In Applications-&gt;Applications, click Create App Integration. In the pop-up, choose OIDC - OpenID Connect, then Native Application. The Device Grant is only available for Native Applications.</p>

    <p></p>
   
   
    <p>In the next step, check Device Authorization in the Grant type section.</p>

    <p></p>

    <p>If you want to use a custom Authorization Server, you also need to accept the grant type in the authorization server’s policy interface:</p>

     
       Go to Security-&gt;API 
       Select the authorization server you want to use (for example, default). 
       Click the Access Policies tab, and edit the rule for your policy.  Make sure to select the Device Authorization checkbox. 
     

    <p></p>
   
 

 How to Enable an SSH Server with Device Authorization 

<p>We’ve identified many use cases for the Device Authorization Grant beyond TV apps, as it can be used to authenticate a variety of devices. In this use case, we share an example of SSH login with the Device Authorization Grant on Okta.</p>

<p>When accessing servers, we typically use SSH. While SSH supports strong security, it has a couple of limitations:</p>

 
   SSH works well for a single user, but it’s harder to manage in an enterprise where multiple users log in to the same server. SSH stores the public key for each allowed user on the server, so the server must be able to update the keys when the permissions list changes (for example, when a new user is granted access). 
   Lack of two-factor authentication: SSH only supports password and private key authentication natively. Adding stronger user authentication, such as SMS verification, requires extra work. 
 

<p>The following example enables the Device Authorization Grant on an Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS server, but the instructions should work for any flavor of Linux server. The end-user login experience looks like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>On a Linux server, the SSH daemon uses PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) to enable an authentication extension. First, let’s edit the PAM configuration. In <code>/etc/pam.d/sshd</code>, we look for <code>@include common-auth</code>. Then we’ll comment it out to disable the normal authentication method, such as password or private key check. Then we’ll add a line of code directly below to enable Device Authorization.  <code>deviceflow.so</code> is the PAM module that follows.</p>

   <code># @include common-auth             # Disable password authentication
auth    required    deviceflow.so  # register custom authentication module
</code>   

<p>Next we’ll edit the <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> file to make sure that challenge-response authentication is enabled, using PAM.  You’ll see a line starting with <code>ChallengeResponseAuthentication</code>. The default is <code>no</code>. Change this to <code>yes</code>:</p>

   <code>ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes
</code>   

<p>Later on in the same file, make sure that “UsePAM” is set to yes (it is the default) as follows:</p>

   <code>UsePAM yes
</code>   

<p>Next we’ll develop the authentication module. To make sure the necessary libraries are installed, we run the following commands:</p>

   <code>apt-get update
apt-get install build-essential libpam0g-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libqrencode-dev libssl-dev
</code>   

<p>The full source code for the PAM module is available on <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-ssh-oauth-example">GitHub</a>. For a PAM module, we need to define two interfaces:</p>

   <code>PAM_EXTERN int pam_sm_setcred( pam_handle_t *pamh, int flags, int argc, const char **argv)
PAM_EXTERN int pam_sm_authenticate( pam_handle_t *pamh, int flags,int argc, const char **argv )
</code>   

<p>The second interface handles the authentication flow, which holds all our authentication logic. The code is self-explanatory, so we’ll only cover the high-level steps:</p>

 
   
    <p>First, plug in your org’s URLs in <code>deviceflow.c</code>. Change the URL based on your org name and whether you are using the org Authentication Server or a custom Authentication Server. Also, define the client ID for the Native App where you’ve enabled the Device Authorization grant type.</p>

       <code>#define DEVICE_AUTHORIZE_URL  "https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/v1/device/authorize"
#define TOKEN_URL "https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/v1/token"
#define CLIENT_ID "0oa15wulqt5yqD9FP5d7"
</code>       
   
   
    <p>We first issue a POST call to our <code>authorize</code> endpoint on the Authorization Server. From the POST result, we can extract the <code>device_code</code> and <code>user_code</code>. The POST call is abstracted away as a call to a helper function <code>issuePost</code>, which takes the URL as the first parameter and the POST data as the second parameter:</p>

       <code>sprintf(postData, "client_id=%s&amp;scope=openid profile offline_access", CLIENT_ID);
issuePost(DEVICE_AUTHORIZE_URL, postData);
</code>       

    <p>The helper function uses libcurl to send the POST request:</p>

       <code>void issuePost(char * url, char * data) {
   /* send all data to this callback function  */
   curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION, WriteMemoryCallback);
   /* we pass our 'chunk' struct to the callback function */
   curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_WRITEDATA, (void *)&amp;chunk);
      
   curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, url ) ;
   curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_POST, 1);  /* this is a POST */
   curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, data);
   int res = curl_easy_perform( curl ) ;
}
</code>       

    <p>The <code>WriteMemoryCallback</code> function saves the callback results in a <code>chunk</code> buffer. Then, we use a helper function <code>getValueForKey</code> to extract the value fields for keys <code>user_code</code>, <code>device_code</code>, and <code>verification_uri_complete</code>.</p>
   
   
    <p>We then prompt the user to login to the activate endpoint. For a more pleasant user experience, we incorporate the URL inside a QRCode. We use the value field for <code>verification_uri_complete</code>, which includes <code>user_code</code> as part of the query parameters, so that a user does not have to type in the code manually. We leveraged the code from <a href="https://github.com/Y2Z/qr">Y2Z/qr</a> to generate ASCII output so that it will output properly in the command shell.</p>

       <code> char * qrc = getQR(activateUrl);
 sprintf(prompt_message, 
   "\n\nPlease login at %s or scan the QRCode below:\n\n%s", 
   activateUrl, qrc);
 free(qrc);
 sendPAMMessage(pamh, prompt_message);
</code>       

    <p>Since this is a PAM module, we cannot just print to screen directly. The <code>sendPAMMessage</code> helper function uses the PAM module’s interface function to send messages to the user:</p>

       <code>void
sendPAMMessage(pam_handle_t *pamh, char * prompt_message) {
   int retval;
      
   struct pam_message msg[1],*pmsg[1];
   struct pam_response *resp;
   struct pam_conv *conv ;
      
   pmsg[0] = &amp;msg[0] ;
   msg[0].msg_style = PAM_TEXT_INFO ; 
   msg[0].msg = prompt_message;
      
   resp = NULL ;
      
   retval = pam_get_item( pamh, PAM_CONV, (const void **) &amp;conv ) ;  
   if( retval==PAM_SUCCESS ) {
      retval = conv-&gt;conv( 1, (const struct pam_message **) pmsg, &amp;resp,  conv-&gt;appdata_ptr ) ; 
   }
   if( resp ) {
      free( resp );
   }
}
</code>       

    <p>In the above, we set the communication type to <code>PAM_TEXT_INFO</code> to indicate that we want to send a message to the user. In the <code>pam_get_item</code> call, we retrieve the PAM conversation module <code>conv</code>, and in the following line, we just invoke the <code>conv</code> module, which writes the message to the user console.</p>
   
   
    <p>We periodically issue a POST call to the token endpoint. If the POST result gives a token back, we return <code>PAM_SUCCESS</code> to allow the user to log in, or eventually, we return <code>PAM_AUTH_ERR</code> to signal authentication failure and deny user access.</p>

       <code>sprintf(postData, "device_code=%s&amp;grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code&amp;client_id=%s", devicecode, CLIENT_ID);

while (waitingForActivate) {
   issuePost(TOKEN_URL, postData);
   // ...
}
</code>       
   
   
    <p>The POST return includes various JWT tokens. From the <code>id_token</code>, we know exactly who logged in, and we optionally print a customized welcome message.</p>
   
 

<p>To compile all our code (<code>deviceflow.c</code> and <code>qr.c</code>), we run:</p>

   <code>gcc -fPIC -c deviceflow.c qr.c
sudo ld -x --shared -o /lib/security/deviceflow.so deviceflow.o qr.o \
        -lm -lqrencode -lcurl -lssl -lcrypto
</code>   

<p>The second command installs the compiled PAM module under <code>/lib/security</code>, which is where PAM looks for additional plugin modules.</p>

<p>Then we restart SSHD daemon to make sure the new PAM module is invoked:</p>

   <code>sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart
</code>   

<p>In the repo, we’ve also included a <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-ssh-oauth-example/blob/master/Dockerfile"><code>Dockerfile</code></a>, so you’ll have a local Ubuntu container in which to try out the new SSH sign-in flow.</p>

 SSH Login in the Cloud with Okta 

<p>Although we’ve only added a couple hundred lines of C code, this fundamental change in SSH login using the Device Grant empowers you to do more with Okta.</p>

 
   Move your SSH management to the cloud, and avoid the hassle of local management. With this new feature, there’s no need to manage SSH passwords or public keys locally. 
   You now have the full power of Okta at your disposal! Leverage Okta policies, enable multi-factor authentication, add sign-on policies and multiple IdPs (Identity Providers). 
 

 Other Uses for the Device Authorization Grant 

<p>In this post, we’ve demonstrated how to implement the Device Grant for SSH login. Using the information returned from the tokens—including the user’s profile information contained in the ID token—we can go even further. We can easily create a separate Linux account in the PAM module and set up the permissions correctly, so a user can sign in to their individual account. You may be trying to connect to a root account via <code>ssh root@server.com</code>. Instead, the PAM module can log you in as <code>user@server.com</code>—a less privileged account—by learning who you are from the ID token.</p>

<p>Token-based permissions give you finer granularity in access control. For example, it’s easy to implement time-limited access control. The access token can be set up to expire within a given time span. If the time limit for access is exceeded, the access token renewal will fail, and the server can revoke permission right away. In addition to enabling time-limited access, you can also customize scopes and claims to further fine-tune the access model.</p>

<p>While this app demonstrates how to enable SSH login, we believe there are many other applications for the Device Flow. We’re eager to hear from you with feature requests and new use cases.

<p>Since we’ve been learning a lot from the Close-up Magic meetups, we’ve decided to start writing a recap at the end of every event. We hope that these recaps will help you in your career development. Enjoy!</p><p>For our latest Close-up Magic meetup, we welcomed <a href="https://twitter.com/praveenweb">Praveen Durairaju</a>, Senior Developer Advocate at <a href="https://hasura.io/">Hasura</a> to talk&nbsp;about:</p>  The early days of&nbsp;Hasura  What it’s like to build a backend from scratch vs. with&nbsp;Hasura  His journey from Software Engineering to Developer Advocacy  <p>Here are a few of our favorite takeaways.</p> Key Takeaways  Developer feedback is key to success&nbsp;🔑 <p>The road to Hasura was one that was filled with many paths. Hasura initially tried to solve multiple problems for developers, such as the need for better DevOps tooling, and also the need for a faster way to build apps with a data&nbsp;layer.</p><p>By collecting feedback, Hasura was able to find that data access was the biggest pain point developers faced. With this golden insight, the company pivoted to what is now known as Hasura, a Jamstack tool used and loved by large enterprises and exciting startups such as Philips Healthcare and&nbsp;Netlify.</p> Choose Hasura for a backend in minutes, rather than days&nbsp;👏 <p>There are a lot of moving parts involved when setting up a GraphQL-powered app from scratch. You have to set up a GraphQL server that describes your data, a client that specifies how you ask for the data, and then you need to connect the GraphQL server with a database you’ve&nbsp;built.</p><p>For those who are new to backend development, the thought process involved in optimizing data fetching, handling errors and caching with GraphQL becomes slightly more complicated than when using the well-known alternative, Rest API. This is because you’re pretty much reinventing the wheel of Rest API with&nbsp;GraphQL.</p><p>If you don’t have the time to dig into the GraphQL or your chosen database’s documentation, try Hasura. Like us, your mind will be blown away by just how easy Hasura makes it for us to build a backend with a readily available API.</p> Developer Advocacy is all about Developer empathy&nbsp;❤️ <p>Praveen’s journey from Engineering to Developer Advocacy felt inevitable.</p><p>As an early engineer at Hasura, he started helping developers solve a few of the pain points they faced with their tool. Pretty soon, he was helping improve Hasura’s docs and writing content to support developers in their integration phase.</p><blockquote>“I believe in the product and love using the product as well. So there’s a natural progression that happened where I was helping out devs with documentation, finding out their pain points on using the product. And I think that’s where I started writing content, some documentation, some guides and tutorials to fix their pain&nbsp;points.”</blockquote><p>Praveen thoroughly enjoyed doing all of this because he was passionate about using Hasura, and he couldn’t help but to evangelize the product to other developers.</p><p>As it turns out, these are the ingredients needed to become a Developer Advocate. You have to be sold on the value of the product. You have to be able to get into the shoes of a developer and understand their pain points. And you have to be passionate about solving their pain points in any way possible, whether that be answering their questions, improving the documentation or creating tutorials, or communicating the feedback internally.</p> Q&amp;A Session <p>At the end of the talk, we received a great question from one of our listeners.</p><blockquote>“What were some of the most challenging things about the development process of building Hasura from the beginning?”</blockquote><p>Curious to know Praveen’s answer?

			 José Navalon is Full Stack Developer at Tokeny Solutions.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p></p>
<p>My name is Jose Navalon, I currently live with my wife and my son in Geldrop, a little town in the Netherlands. I was born and raised in Valencia, a sunny city on the east coast of Spain. I graduated as an engineer (ing/MSc) from the Polytechnical University of Valencia.</p>
<p>During my professional career, I have developed software solutions for both big companies and startups. Outside of work, I enjoy traveling, cooking, reading books and of course spending time with my family and friends.</p>
 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>After I finished a big project for my previous company, I was looking for a permanent remote position and I got an offer from Tokeny. After interviewing with some team members, I was impressed by the work being done in Tokeny. Tokeny is up to speed with the latest technologies and always works with the leading technologies of the moment. Also, Tokeny’s product vision on blockchain is sure to be a success. So it was clear for me to join Tokeny 🙂</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>All people are really skilled and it is a pleasure working with them. Tokeny gives us full freedom at work, in my case I’m working remotely not only due to the Covid. The honesty and transparency of each member of the team makes you really integrated in the company.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>I like traveling a lot with my family and friends. Knowing new places, new cultures, new food, other ways of life…</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>I have many, but the most important one is “Mankind beats the Corona”, of course we can make it, be optimistic! xD</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>Too many things to be changed 😀 but for example I’d love to see all people, not only nations, working together to solve global problems such as poverty, child education, global warming, ….</p>

<p>CoinPost: The article highlights the key aspects of NFT Magic, the clean, affordable, and complete NFT marketplace on Ardor blockchain. Anyone can publish a wide variety of digital productions, buy and sell NFTs with very low fees, and rely on a secure environment thanks to the SIGBRO app integration. SIGBRO functions as a crypto wallet and secure digital ID authentication to upload and trade NFTs on NFTMagic, or for other services on the Ardor platform. In addition, several Ardor-based NFT-related products and games are in advanced stages, as Bridge Champ, Mythical Beings, and Triffic, which will launch soon GeoMorfs, the revenue-generating NFTs.</p>
