<p>Identity forms the foundation of the modern workplace. Nearly every task depends on the ability to securely access systems using valid digital credentials linked to verified employees. Identity and access management (IAM) must constantly balance between security on one hand, and convenience and productivity on the other.</p> 
<p>The increasing interconnectedness and decentralization of systems, together with the surge in digital identities, are placing tremendous strain on these IAM processes, and attackers have been quick to take advantage. The past year saw regular reports of identity-related breaches, with increasingly severe consequences. Take the <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/lessons-from-the-mgm-attack">2023 hack of MGM Resorts</a> — their systems were down for ten days after hackers impersonated an employee and tricked service desk personnel into granting them access.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In order to better understand what we can expect in 2024, the research team at Vanson Bourne surveyed IAM security leaders across the United States about the current identity security practices and pain points in their organization.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
 Key Findings  
 Identity Challenges Abound  
<p>Our research shows that all organizations still struggle when it comes to securing their workers’ identities. The top pain point, cited by 40%, is employee <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/best-practices-for-identity-proofing-in-the-workplace">identity proofing</a>/verification. Many organizations use a series of manual processes that are disconnected from their primary identity systems. Authentication comes in at a close second challenge, with 37% admitting that their authentication processes are vulnerable to phishing and credential attacks. Other top challenges include implementing continuous risk assessment and reducing authentication application sprawl, both named by 35% of organizations.&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
 Organizations Contend With Frequent Identity Risks  
<p>The findings show that employees engage in risky activities on a regular basis. Around seven in ten organizations (71%) report detecting risky user behavior or unexpected changes in the risk environment multiple times each week; nearly a quarter experience daily risks.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Moreover, In all likelihood, these risk figures skew much higher. Organizations admit their visibility into identity risks remains incomplete. On average, they monitor fewer than half (49%) of their employees’ identities on a daily basis for risk or indications of compromise. This potentially leaves a large swath taking risky actions that go undetected.</p> 
<p></p> 
 Organizations Find It Difficult To Verify Employees in Real Time  
<p>More than ⅔ of organizations spend over two hours performing identity verification checks when an employee needs to replace a device, when a risk is flagged by security systems or when employees change roles. In some cases the average time spent is much higher. For example it takes an average of 8.52 hours to verify identity when an employee changes roles.</p> 
 Identity Fraud Is Rampant and Costly  
<p>The widespread reliance on insecure identity security solutions is leaving the door wide open to security threats, with undeniable consequences. Identity fraud is so prolific among organizations that over three quarters (77%) report falling victim multiple times within the last 12 months.</p> 
<p>Organizations are feeling the impact in their balance sheets. On average, identity fraud cost organizations an average of $4.33 million in the last 12 months.</p> 
<p></p>

				  2024 will be a huge year for verifiable data. As the industry continues to develop, our team wanted to call some interesting trends to your attention and put together some predictions for what we think will happen this year.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Ken Ebert</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</p>
<p>AI technology exploded in 2023, with <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai-in-2023-generative-ais-breakout-year">60% of organizations</a> reportedly using generative AI in some capacity. Two major categories of AI use cases are when an AI does things on a human’s behalf—such as an <a href="https://indicio.tech/a-trusted-copilot-using-decentralized-identity-to-manage-an-ai-virtual-assistant/">AI assistant</a>—and when a human uses a generative AI to create things—such as <a href="https://chat.openai.com/auth/login">ChatGPT</a>, which can create written documents or images. Our team believes that as AI grows in popularity, particularly in business deployments, the need for identity integrations for both of these categories will grow with it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to acting as an assistant and doing things on a user’s behalf, AI will need to be able to prove that it is authorized by a human to act on their behalf. It’s very usefulness as an assistant&nbsp; is tied to whether you can trust it with your secure information. For example, an AI that you can ask to play music for you is useful — but an AI you can trust with your credit card and ask to buy groceries, pay a bill, or even book a vacation? That is what people will pay for. To achieve this level of trust in a robot will require more security than passwords have proven they can provide; it will need mutual authentication and verifiable identity from both the user and the AI.</p>
<p>Generative AI has already caused quite a stir, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2023/12/30/ai-generated-art-was-a-mistake-and-heres-why/?sh=cc26b683fef3">particularly from artists</a> whose work these platforms have been trained on. While the internet has always been somewhat murky on the origins of work, the ability to give a&nbsp; computer a series of prompts and some guidelines and have it generate a visually-believable image or a plausibly correct article creates a whole new level of skepticism. This problem can also be solved by using verifiable credentials at the point of creation to record a digital “signature” that will allow anyone to check with certainty where a piece originates from and if it has been altered since that creation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Multi-Credential Systems</p>
<p>Recently, organizations have realized that there is no one “golden” credential type that fits every use case. In fact, our team has seen several platforms moving to support combinations of JSON-LD, SD-JWT, and AnonCred credentials as projects using multiple credential types gain traction. As ecosystems grow and begin to overlap, we will continue to see multiple credential types being used due to their unique benefits, not just due to competing ideas and organizations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials Will Be Folded into Existing Systems</p>
<p>Businesses have begun and will continue focusing on combining verifiable credentials with their existing systems, rather than approaching decentralized identity as an independent technology. Verifiable credentials almost always need to be paired with existing workflows to unlock the value of verified data — once you are certain of the data, then you need to do something with it. In addition, once you have established a trusted digital relationship using the inbuilt secure, bi-directional communication features, a series of other powerful use cases become possible. Some examples include mutually authenticated chat (confirm it’s a real Nigerian prince before you engage with him), faster, more secure interactions with organizations such as your bank, and a better way for employers to manage access for employees.</p>
<p>One real world application that Indicio has been working on in partnership with SITA and the Government of Aruba is verifiable credentials for travel. Using verifiable credentials as the underlying means of data transfer and authentication, travelers can store all the information they need to get through the airport quickly and efficiently, including their passports, VISAs, and boarding passes. Any of these credentials can be stored and verified with a single scan, resulting in a much faster experience at various touch points in a travel journey. And because these credentials draw on the information embedded in an official document, they eliminate the errors that inevitably occur when people are asked to fill in paper forms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While credentials are an integral part of the equation, many travelers will never think twice about them, and may not even realize they are using decentralized technology.&nbsp; We see this simplicity and speed driving adoption in many other industries, as they realize the time and cost savings to be gained.</p>
<p>Better Awareness of Full Ecosystems</p>
<p>Our team predicts that, as we move through 2024, more people will realize the idea of credential ecosystems as ways to unlock all the benefits&nbsp; of decentralized identity. Being able to verify the integrity of a credential is a huge step forward, but equally important is being able to verify the issuer. For example, if you have a digital driver’s license and you use it as proof of identity to take out a loan, the bank would need to trust that your driver’s license hasn’t been tampered with AND know which authority issued it. From there the bank can make the human decision of whether or not we trust that source. As we continue to build this technology, more people will realize that without a mechanism to decide if you can trust the issuer, a credential alone is insufficient</p>
<p>Organizations Will Learn That They Can Go to Production with What They Have Now</p>
<p>Many organizations have been hesitant to openly adopt this technology or go to market for a&nbsp; variety of reasons, including a feeling that the technology isn’t ready or complete and concerns about needing permission to proceed or authorization from central gatekeepers, such as governments or standards bodies. But this technology is ready right now, and is already in use today. It doesn’t require a huge lift and shift, can be rolled out at whatever scale comfortable with to start, and most importantly, it provides a better way for organizations to manage their tremendously valuable data and implement the governance of their ecosystems. In 2024 our team sees many realizing that they can move forward without the need to wait for others to solve root trust issues or grant them permission to manage their own ecosystem.</p>
<p>Overall 2024 will certainly be one to watch for decentralized identity!</p>

 Prague Land Ownership Mapping — Unearthing the Foundations of Affordability Crisis  Charting a Course for Equitable Urban Development through Data Transparency <p>This blog post on urban land ownership in Prague is the 3rd article in the <a href="https://medium.com/urban-land-ownership-mapping?source=post_page-----eb13bfbbded1--------------------------------">series</a>. The collaboration between <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> and the <a href="https://www.ihrb.org/">Institute of Human Rights and Business</a> (IHRB) resulted previously in <a href="https://medium.com/urban-land-ownership-mapping/urban-land-ownership-mapping-in-copenhagen-eb13bfbbded1">mapping of Copenhagen</a> and aims to continue its investigation further in Athens and&nbsp;Lisbon.</p><p>Through findings in this blog, we aim to question the importance of ownership data protection rules in the context of Europe’s rising costs of living crisis. The difficulty of access paralyses the research arena and informed public discourse on distribution of wealth and social responsibility (incl. involvement of journalists, academics, city administrations, etc.) further jeopardizing spatial justice. Ultimately, this hinders facilitation of adequate policy, law enforcement and action against exploitative practices such as property flipping, foreign investments, tax avoidance, money laundering and future responses to climate&nbsp;impacts.</p> Introduction <p>Across Czechia, housing prices rose by more than 130% between 2015–2021 (<a href="https://vdb.czso.cz/vdbvo2/faces/en/index.jsf?page=vystup-objekt&amp;pvo=CEN15A1&amp;z=T&amp;f=TABULKA&amp;skupId=86&amp;katalog=31782&amp;pvo=CEN15A1&amp;str=v136&amp;c=v136~8__RP2021">Czech Statistical Office</a>) and continue to do so. The average gross income, on the other hand, only grew by 40%.

In <a href="https://denikreferendum.cz/clanek/35777-priciny-krize-bydleni-zacinaji-uz-u-vlastnictvi-pozemku">her article</a>, the author rightly points out that while the majority of attention in housing crisis debates focuses on the lack of apartments on the market for purchase or rent, “what lies beneath” is the fundamental factor shaping our cities: i.e. land ownership. This hypothesis was also a starting point for the objectives of IHRB’s <a href="https://www.ihrb.org/focus-areas/built-environment/building-for-today-and-the-future">Building for Today and the future</a>&nbsp;project.</p> Blog structure <p>In Prague, as in other cities, land ownership is foundational to this state of affairs, and issues around it guide the structure of this&nbsp;blog:</p>  Data Access &amp; Transparency Review  Prague’s largest land&nbsp;owners  Why is housing in Prague unaffordable?

The application makes it possible to obtain selected data on plots, buildings, units (apartments or non-residential premises) and building rights, registered in the real estate cadastre, as well as information on the status of proceedings for the purposes of registering ownership and other rights of authorised entities to real estate in Czechia, or for the purpose of confirming geometric plans.</p><blockquote>Ownership data can be viewed for free plot by plot (CAPTCHA)</blockquote><p><a href="https://nahlizenidokn.cuzk.cz/Napoveda/index.htm?id=idh_FAQ">Viewing the real estate cadastre</a> (CN) does not require any registration and is free. The application is intended exclusively for data viewing (plot by plot), as any acquisition or extraction of data by automated means is not&nbsp;allowed.</p><blockquote>Core institutions have limited&nbsp;access</blockquote><p>Our investigation revealed that the <a href="https://iprpraha.cz/o-nas">Institute of Planning and Development of the Capital City Prague</a> (IPR Praha) — Prague’s main policy-making unit for urban architecture, planning, development, design, and administration — as well as the City of Prague itself only has partial access to the cadastral registry of land ownership.</p><p>This is because the cadastre aims to disseminate data for smaller areas, a common demand.

Large quantities of data can be acquired, with pricing per plot ranging between 50 Kč to 100 Kč (2–4 euro depending on level of information provided). For a dataset covering the entire city of Prague, we were quoted a figure of 931 928 Kč (ca. 38.200 EUR), a figure prohibitive for this project, but also for many researchers, journalists, and the general&nbsp;public.</p><blockquote>Prevention against automated data harvesting methods is in&nbsp;place</blockquote><p>As the <a href="https://www.cuzk.cz/">State Administration of Surveying and Cadastre</a> prohibits any form of automated data scraping we chose not to engage with this method. We, however, performed a test to what extent such an option would be technically possible. Our test revealed that data is hard to access this way, but that it is possible to check plot ownership one by one through <a href="https://nahlizenidokn.cuzk.cz/VyberParcelu/Parcela/InformaceO">this website</a>.&nbsp;Example:</p>  Katastrální území Název/kód katastrálního území: 73012, and&nbsp;then  Parcelní číslo:&nbsp;2415/1  <p>After solving CAPTCHA which aims to prevent scraping, a list of owners should appear — in the example above we chose a site of Bubny Development.</p><p>We attempted to utilize the cadaster office’s API, developing a script with the Puppeteer JavaScript library.

However, the lack of supply and increased demand only tell part of the&nbsp;story.</p><p>As cheap mortgages were available for years, housing became a popular investment product resulting, for example, in ca 220,000 investment flats in Prague, mostly in the historical centre.

As a consequence, the right to land, and housing are further undermined.</p><p>Unfortunately, the European Court of Justice recently declared that the public access of registers containing information about beneficial owners of businesses breaches the right to privacy. Consequently, not just Luxembourg but also the Netherlands has restricted access to the registry of real owners following the verdict.

<p>When it comes to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-security">data security</a>, the ancient art of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cryptography">cryptography</a> has become a critical cornerstone of today’s digital age. From top-secret government intelligence to everyday personal messages, cryptography makes it possible to obscure our most sensitive information from unwanted onlookers. Whether shopping online or saving valuable trade secrets to disk, we can thank cryptography for any semblance of privacy we may have.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main principles of cryptography establish trust when conducting business online. They include the following:</p>



 
 Confidentiality: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/encryption">Encrypted information</a> can only be accessed by the person for whom it is intended and no one else.&nbsp; 



 Integrity: Encrypted information cannot be modified in storage or in transit between the sender and the intended receiver without any alterations being detected. 



 Non-repudiation: The creator/sender of encrypted information cannot deny their intention to send the information. 



 Authentication: The identities of the sender and receiver—as well as the origin and destination of the information—are confirmed. 



 Key management: The keys used in encrypting and decrypting data and associated tasks like key length, distribution, generation, rotation, etc. are kept secure. 
 



<p>Before diving into cryptography’s many use cases, let’s review the basics of cryptography.</p>



 Understanding cryptography basics 



<p>Throughout history, cryptologists have used various methods for encoding private information and creating encrypted messages. While modern <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/cryptography-types/">cryptographic algorithms</a> are far more advanced, the fundamental steps remain very similar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Basic cryptology takes the original, unencoded information (known as plaintext) and encodes it into a scrambled code (known as ciphertext) with the aid of a secret key or keys, which can also be used to decode the ciphertext back into plaintext.&nbsp;</p>



 Cryptographic algorithms 



<p>Cryptographic algorithms are the mathematical formulas used to encrypt and decrypt data. These algorithms create secret keys to determine how data is transformed from its original plaintext into ciphertext and vice versa. Some well-known cryptographic algorithms include <a href="https://community.ibm.com/community/user/ibmz-and-linuxone/blogs/subhasish-sarkar1/2020/06/23/understanding-the-rsa-asymmetric-encryption-system">RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.1.0?topic=encryption-what-is-des-aes">AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cryptography">ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At a basic level, most cryptographic algorithms create keys by multiplying large prime numbers. While multiplication is easy for modern computers, factoring large numbers back into two large primes requires so much computing power, it’s practically impossible. Cryptosystems that use smaller keys can be reverse-engineered rather easily, but even the fastest supercomputers would require hundreds to hundreds of thousands of years to brute-force attack today’s stronger cryptographic algorithms. Elliptic curve cryptography adds an additional level of security by using random numbers to create much stronger keys that even next-generation quantum computers can’t break.&nbsp;</p>



 Key management 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.2?topic=cryptography-cryptographic-services-key-management">Key management</a> is an integral part of cryptography; every cryptosystem uses keys to both encrypt and decrypt data. Key management involves securely generating, storing and distributing encryption keys between users. Proper key management is crucial for maintaining the security of encrypted data, as weak or stolen keys can create critical vulnerabilities in any cryptosystem. Key sizes, randomness and storage are all crucial functions of key management.&nbsp;</p>



 Symmetric encryption 



<p>Also known as private-key cryptography or secret-key cryptography, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ztpf/2020?topic=concepts-symmetric-cryptography">symmetrical cryptosystems</a> use only one key for both encryption and decrypting. For these types of systems to work, each user must already have access to the same private key. Private keys might be shared either through a previously established trusted communication channel (such as a private courier or secured line) or, more practically, a secure key exchange method (such as the <a href="https://community.ibm.com/community/user/ibmz-and-linuxone/blogs/subhasish-sarkar1/2020/07/09/understanding-diffiehellman-key-exchange-method">Diffie-Hellman key agreement</a>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite vulnerabilities created by the use of only a single key, this type of encryption is faster and more efficient than alternative methods. Popular symmetric encryption algorithms include <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.1.0?topic=encryption-what-is-des-aes">DES (Data Encryption Standard)</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/3.1.0?topic=operation-triple-des-encryption">3DES (Triple DES)</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.1.0?topic=encryption-what-is-des-aes">AES</a>.</p>



 Asymmetric encryption 



<p><a href="https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/course/practical-introduction-to-quantum-safe-cryptography/asymmetric-key-cryptography">Asymmetric encryption</a>, also known as public-key encryption, uses a pair of keys—a public key and a private key. The public key is used for encryption, the private key is used for decryption and each user has their own key pair. The two encryption keys used in public-key cryptography add an additional layer of security, but this added protection comes at the cost of decreased efficiency. RSA, ECC and the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/flashsystem-9x00/8.3.x?topic=interface-setting-up-ssh-client">Secure Shell Protocol (SSH)</a> are common asymmetric cryptography algorithms.</p>



 Cryptography use cases 



 Secure communication&nbsp; 



<p>One of the most common use cases of cryptography is providing secure communication over the internet. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/bg/zos/3.1.0?topic=protocols-tls-ssl">Transport Layer Security (TLS)</a> and its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), use cryptographic protocols to establish protected connections between web browsers and servers. This secure channel ensures that data shared between a user’s browser and a website remains private and cannot be intercepted by malicious actors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cryptography is also used for common messaging applications like email and WhatsApp to provide <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/end-to-end-encryption">end-to-end encryption (E2EE)</a> and maintain the privacy of users’ conversations. With E2EE, only the sender and intended recipient can decrypt and read their messages, making it nearly impossible for third parties—including users’ own service providers—to access the content.</p>



 Data encryption 



<p>Data encryption is a widely used form of cryptography that protects sensitive information stored on various devices, such as hard drives, smartphones and cloud storage services. Strong encryption algorithms like AES effectively transform plaintext into ciphertext, ensuring that even if an unauthorized party gains access, they won’t be able to decrypt sensitive data without access to the authorized users’ encryption key.&nbsp;</p>



 Data integrity 



<p>Cryptography is also used to ensure the integrity of data. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.1.0?topic=cryptography-hashing-algorithms">Hash functions</a> are a type of cryptographic algorithm that generate fixed-size hashes (also known as digests) of data–essentially transforming a set of data into a unique numerical hash number. These hashes are so unique that changing even a single character or space within the plaintext would produce a totally different numerical value. Recipients, applications or websites can verify data integrity by comparing the hash of received data to the expected hash, and they can confirm that data has not been altered during transmission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hash functions are also frequently used to verify user passwords without needing to create a vulnerable client-side database of private passwords. Instead, services like online banking portals will only collect and store the hashes of user passwords. Even if such a database was stolen, a malicious actor would not be able to deduce any user’s password from their hash alone.&nbsp;</p>



 Authentication 



<p>Verifying the authenticity of sent and received information is a critical function of cryptography used for conducting all manners of business, made possible by the use of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/b2badv-communication/1.0.0?topic=overview-digital-signature">digital signatures</a>. Through asymmetric cryptography, documents can be amended with digital signatures, which can only be generated with the use of a private key. Recipients of digitally signed documents can use the sender’s public key to verify the signature’s authenticity and confirm that the document has not been tampered with during transmission.&nbsp;</p>



 Non-repudiation 



<p>Non-repudiation is a legal concept that ensures the authenticity of received messages and prevents a sender from potentially denying the validity of any given sent message. Digital signatures are a critical component of non-repudiation, as they prove that the sender, and no one else, signed the message or document. Cryptography-enabled non-repudiation, as established by data integrity protocols and digital signatures, provides a viable framework for verifying lawfully binding negotiations, contracts, and other types of legal dealings and business.</p>



 Key exchange&nbsp; 



<p>A major component of secure communication, key exchange is a critical aspect of establishing a secure connection, especially in asymmetric cryptosystems. Cryptography plays a valuable role in this preliminary step, as well. A landmark in the development of public-key cryptography, the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm allows two parties to securely exchange encryption keys over an insecure channel. This method ensures that even if an eavesdropper intercepts the key exchange dialogue, they cannot decipher the encryption keys being exchanged. Through cryptography, algorithms like the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol allow parties to establish secure connections through public-key encryption, without the need for a previously established and potentially vulnerable alternative key exchange.&nbsp;</p>



 Securing API communication 



<p>A hallmark of Web 2.0 (and beyond), cooperative inter-app operability allows for various applications and web services to pull data from within their respected walled virtual ecosystems, enabling massively expanded functionality of all sorts of apps—from embedding social media posts into news articles to sharing critical systems analytics into advanced operational dashboards.</p>



<p>Known as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/api">application programming interfaces (APIs)</a>, these systems are designed to facilitate cross-program communication, and cryptography ensures that this sensitive data remains protected from intrusive eavesdropping or tampering, ensuring that only authorized parties can access the information. API keys and tokens are often used alongside encryption to protect sensitive data exchanged between applications, especially in situations where security is most critical, such as public works and infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>



 Quantum computing cybersecurity 



<p>The rise of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/quantum-computing">quantum computing</a> poses a significant threat to existing encryption methodologies and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cybersecurity">cybersecurity</a> systems. Most modern cryptosystems are designed to withstand the potential computing power of traditional computers, which would simply require hundreds to hundreds of thousands of years to successfully brute-force attack today’s cryptographic algorithms. Quantum computers, however, could potentially increase the power of today’s computers by orders of magnitude, reducing the time it would take to crack even the strongest cryptographic keys from thousands of years to mere seconds.<br><br>While most modern cryptographic algorithms won’t be able to withstand theoretical quantum computer attacks, cryptologists are responding to these vulnerabilities with the development of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/quantum-safe-cryptography">quantum-resistant cryptography</a> techniques. The use cases for quantum-resistant and post-quantum cryptography are as numerous as the cryptography use cases are in general. Although quantum computing is still considered to be in the prototyping stages at best, most computer scientists agree major breakthroughs within the next 10 to 50 years will make the development of quantum-resistant cryptography as critical as quantum computing itself.</p>



 Blockchain security 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/blockchain">Blockchain technology</a> relies heavily on cryptography to ensure the security and immutability of all on-chain transactions and updates. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin use cryptographic algorithms to mine and mint new coins, while cryptographic hash functions secure the integrity of blocks in the chain. When making transactions, public-key cryptography is used to create and verify digital signatures. Encompassing most of cryptography’s core tenets, blockchain technology uses encryption to create a trustless ecosystem where all actions can be easily authenticated and verified.</p>

Towards that, we’ve been eating our own dogfood: running our own predictoor bots &amp; trader bots, and improving things based on our own experience. Most of these improvements come to Predictoor’s backend: the pdr-backend repo.</p><p>We’ve evolved it a lot lately! Where it mandates the first big release since launch (yet still pre-v1). That’s what this blog post describes.</p><p>The rest of this post is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the prior release (pdr-backend v0.1), and section 3 its challenges. Section 4 describes the new release (pdr-backend v0.2), focusing on its key features of CLI and YAML file, which help usability in running bots. Section 5 describes how v0.2 addresses the challenges of v0.1. Section 6 concludes.</p> 2. About pdr-backend v0.1&nbsp;Flows <p>We released <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend">pdr-backend</a> when we launched Predictoor in September 2023, and have been continually improving it since then: fixing bugs, reducing onboarding friction, and adding more capabilities (eg simulation flow).</p><p>The first official release was <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/releases/tag/v0.1.0">v0.1.0</a> on November 20, 2023; with subsequent v0.1.x releases. It is licensed under <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/LICENSE">Apache V2</a>, a highly permissive open-source license.</p><p>In the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/e93c4becafcf1bf3f81e8f7e4689754c9231ae85/READMEs/predictoor.md">last v0.1 predictoor bot README</a>, the flow had you do simulation, then run a bot on testnet, then run a bot on mainnet. Let’s elaborate.</p><p>Simulation. You’d start simulation with a call like: python pdr_backend/simulation/runtrade.py. It grabs historical data, builds models, predicts, does simulated trades, then repeats, all on historical data. It logs and plots progress in real time. It would run according to default settings: what price feeds to use for AI model inputs, how much training data, etc. Those settings were hardcoded in the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/e93c4becafcf1bf3f81e8f7e4689754c9231ae85/pdr_backend/simulation/runtrade.py">runtrade.py</a> script. To change settings, you’d have to change the script itself, or support&nbsp;code.</p>A snippet of parameters from v0.1 <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/e93c4becafcf1bf3f81e8f7e4689754c9231ae85/pdr_backend/simulation/runtrade.py">runtrade.py</a> script<p>Run a bot on testnet. First, you’d specify envvars via the terminal: your private key, envvars for network (e.g. RPC_URL), and envvars to specify feeds (PAIR_FILTER,TIMEFRAME_FILTER, SOURCE_FILTER). Then you’d run the bot with a call like:python pdr_backend/predictoor/main.py 3. It would run according to default settings. The 3meant predictoor approach #3: dynamic model building. To change predictoor settings, you’d have to change&nbsp;code.</p>Setting envvars in&nbsp;v0.1<p>Run a bot on mainnet. This was like testnet, except specifying different envvars for network and perhaps private&nbsp;key.</p><p>Any further configurations, such as what CEX data sources to use in modeling, would be hardcoded in the script. To use different values, you’d have to modify those in your local copy of the&nbsp;code.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/e93c4becafcf1bf3f81e8f7e4689754c9231ae85/READMEs/trader.md">last v0.1 trader bot README</a> had a similar flow to the v0.1 predictoor bot&nbsp;README.</p> 3. Challenges in pdr-backend v0.1&nbsp;Flows <p>We were — and are — proud of the v0.1 predictoor bot &amp; trader bot flows. We’d streamlined them fairly well: one could get going quickly, and accomplish what they needed to. To go further and modify parameters, one would have to jump into Python code. At first glance this might have thought this a problem; however target users (and actual users) are data scientists or developers, who have no trouble modifying code.</p><p>Yet there were a few issues. First, it was annoying to manually change code to change parameters.</p>  We could have written higher-level code that looped, and modified the parameters code at each loop iteration; however code that changes code is error-prone and can be dangerous.  Trader bots and predictoor bots had the same issue, and worse: the py code for parameter changes was scattered in a few places. Even if the scattering was fixed, the core issue would&nbsp;remain.  <p>Second, envvars didn’t have enough fidelity, and adding more would have led to an unusably high number of&nbsp;envvars.</p>  Recall that we used envvars to specify feeds (PAIR_FILTER, etc). This wasn’t enough detail for all our needs. For example, in running a predictoor bot, one couldn’t use envvars to specify the model output feed (what feed to predict) and model input price feeds, let alone non-price feeds for model&nbsp;inputs.  And, putting it into envvars would be sloppy and error-prone; if we weren’t careful, we’d have a crazy number of&nbsp;envvars.  <p>Third, a messy CLI was organically emerging.</p>  Recall, one would run a predictoor bot with a custom call directly to the script, such as:python pdr_backend/predictoor/main.py 3, where 3meant approach 3. Similar for simulation or trader&nbsp;flows.  Support for CLI-level parameters was pretty basic, only lightly tested, and was implemented on a per-script basis. Then, from our own runs of predictoor bots we were starting to do basic analytics, and a new&nbsp;./scripts/directory emerged, with each script having its own custom CLI call. Things were getting messier&nbsp;yet.  <p>Finally, we wanted to extend pdr-backend functionality, and doing it in v0.1 code would explode complexity.</p>  We have big plans for our “make $” experiments, and for these, we saw the need to extend functionality by a&nbsp;lot.  We wanted to build out a proper analytics app. We wanted to professionalize and operationalize the data pipeline, for use by simulation, the bots, and the analytics app.  We wanted to extend simulation, into a flow that supported experiments on realtime data and with the possibility of live trading. Doing this would have means even more parameters and flows; if we kept the v0.1 parameter-setting and messy CLI then complexity would become unwieldy. We needed a cleaner base before we could&nbsp;proceed.   4. Introducing pdr-backend v0.2 <p>We’re pleased to announce the release of <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/releases/tag/v0.2.0">pdr-backend v0.2</a>. It solves the issues above 🎉 via a good CLI, and a YAML file to set parameters. It’s live now in the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend">pdr-backend repo</a>.</p><p>The rest of this section describes the heavily-updated CLI, the YAML file, and changes to the pdr-backend architecture for a good data pipeline and analytics.</p> 4.1 Updated&nbsp;CLI <p>You get started with Predictoor like&nbsp;before:</p> git clone https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend<br>cd pdr-backend<br>python -m venv venv # create &amp; activate virtual env't<br>source venv/bin/activate<br>pip install -r requirements.txt # install modules<br>export PATH=$PATH:. # add pwd to path <p>Then, you can type pdr to see the interface at the command-line:</p> $ pdr<br>Predictoor tool<br><br>Usage: pdr xpmt|predictoor|trader|..<br><br>Main tools:<br>  pdr xpmt PPSS_FILE<br>  pdr predictoor APPROACH PPSS_FILE NETWORK<br>  pdr trader APPROACH PPSS_FILE NETWORK<br>  pdr lake PPSS_FILE NETWORK<br>  pdr claim_OCEAN PPSS_FILE<br>  pdr claim_ROSE PPSS_FILE<br><br>Utilities:<br>  pdr help<br>  pdr &lt;cmd&gt; -h<br>  pdr get_predictoors_info ST END PQDIR PPSS_FILE NETWORK --PDRS<br>  pdr get_predictions_info ST END PQDIR PPSS_FILE NETWORK --FEEDS<br>  pdr get_traction_info ST END PQDIR PPSS_FILE NETWORK --FEEDS<br>  pdr check_network PPSS_FILE NETWORK --LOOKBACK_HOURS<br><br>Transactions are signed with envvar 'PRIVATE_KEY`.<br><br>Tools for core team:<br>  pdr trueval PPSS_FILE NETWORK<br>  pdr dfbuyer PPSS_FILE NETWORK<br>  pdr publisher PPSS_FILE NETWORK<br>  pdr topup PPSS_FILE NETWORK<br>  pytest, black, mypy, pylint, .. <p>There are commands to run experiments / simulation (pdr xpmt), predictoor bot (pdr predictoor), trader bot (pdr trader), and for people running predictoor bots to claim rewards (pdr claim_OCEAN, pdr claim_ROSE).</p><p>There’s a new command to fill the data lake (pdr lake), and several new analytics-related commands (pdr get_predictoors_info&nbsp;,&nbsp;…, pdr check_network ). Remaining commands are typically for use by the core&nbsp;team.</p><p>To get help for a given command, just type the command without any argument&nbsp;values.</p> 4.2 New: YAML&nbsp;file <p>The default file is <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/ppss.yaml">ppss.yaml</a>. Most CLI commands take PPSS_FILE (YAML file) as an input argument. Therefore users can make their own copy from the default ppss.yaml, and modify at&nbsp;will.</p><p>The YAML file holds most parameters; the CLI specifies which YAML file and network, and sometimes commonly-updated parameters.</p>  To minimize confusion, there are no envvars. All parameters are in the YAML file or the CLI. One exception: PRIVATE_KEY envvar is retained because putting it in a file would have reduced security.  <p>The YAML file has a sub-section for each bot: a predictoor_ss section, a trader_ss section, etc. The web3_pp section holds info for all networks.</p><p>Below is an an example of the predictoor_ss section in the YAML file. Note how it specifies a feed to predict (predict_feed), as well as input feeds for AI modeling (aimodel_ss.input_feeds).</p> predictoor_ss:<br>  predict_feed: binance BTC/USDT c 1h<br>  bot_only:<br>    s_until_epoch_end: 60 # in s. Start predicting if there's &gt; this time left<br>    stake_amount: 1 # stake this amount with each prediction. In OCEAN<br>  aimodel_ss:<br>    input_feeds:<br>      - binance BTC/USDT c 1h<br>#      - binance BTC/USDT ETH/USDT BNB/USDT XRP/USDT ADA/USDT DOGE/USDT SOL/USDT LTC/USDT TRX/USDT DOT/USDT ohlcv 1h<br>#      - kraken BTC/USDT 1h<br>    max_n_train: 5000 # no. epochs to train model on<br>    autoregressive_n : 10 # no. epochs that model looks back, to predict next<br>    approach: LIN <p>Most CLI commands take NETWORK as an input argument. The YAML file holds RPC_URL and other network parameters for each network. Combining this, the NETWORK CLI argument selects from them. Therefore to wants to use a different network (e.g. testnet → mainnet), then one only needs to change the network name in the CLI. Compare this to v0.1 where several envvars needed changing. A bonus: the new setup allows convenient storage of many different network configurations (in the YAML&nbsp;file).</p><p>When the whole YAML file is read, it creates a <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/pdr_backend/ppss/ppss.py">PPSS</a> object. That object has attributes corresponding to each bot: a predictoor_ss object (of class <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/pdr_backend/ppss/predictoor_ss.py">PredictoorSS</a>), a trader_ss object (of class <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/pdr_backend/ppss/trader_ss.py">TraderSS</a>), etc. It also holds network info in its web3_pp object (of class&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/pdr_backend/ppss/web3_pp.py">Web3PP</a>).</p> 4.3 New: Good data&nbsp;pipeline <p>We refined pdr-backend architecture to have a proper data pipeline, in new directory /lake/. It’s centered around a data lake with tiers from raw → refined. We’ve moved from storing raw price data as csv files, to <a href="https://www.databricks.com/glossary/what-is-parquet#:~:text=What%20is%20Parquet%3F,handle%20complex%20data%20in%20bulk.">parquet</a> files, because parquet supports querying without needing to have a special database layer on top (!), among other benefits.</p><p>In conjunction, we’ve moved from <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> dataframes to <a href="https://pola.rs/">Polars</a> dataframes, because Polars scales better and plays well with parquet. (We are already seeing intensive data management and expect our data needs to grow by several orders of magnitude.)</p> 4.4 New: Space to grow analytics <p>We’ve also updated pdr-backend analytics support, in the new directory /analytics/&nbsp;. First, what used to be ad-hoc scripts for analytics tools now has proper CLI support:pdr get_predictoors_info&nbsp;,&nbsp;…, pdr check_network. These analytics tools now use data from the lake, and continue to be evolved. Furthermore, we are building towards a more powerful analytics app that uses python-style plotting in the browser, via streamlit.</p> 5. How pdr-backend v0.2 Fixes v0.1&nbsp;Issues <p>Here’s how v0.2 fixes each of the four issues raised&nbsp;above.</p>  Issue: Annoying to manually change code to change parameters  v0.2 fix: use YAML file &amp; CLI for all parameters. The YAML file holds most parameters; the CLI specifies which YAML file and network, and sometimes commonly-updated parameters. The YAML file holds parameters that were previously envvars, or somewhere in code. <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/ppss.yaml">Here’s</a> the default YAML&nbsp;file.  Issue: envvars didn’t have enough&nbsp;fidelity  v0.2 fix: use YAML file &amp; CLI for all parameters. In the YAML file, each bot gets its own subsection, including which feeds to work with. The YAML has far more fidelity because it also includes variables that were previously in&nbsp;code.  Issue: a messy CLI was organically emerging  v0.2 fix: now we have a clean CLI. Previous calls to scripts for simulation, predictoor bot, trader bot, and various analytics are all now folded into the CLI. The CLI is implemented in new directory /cli/; its core modules <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/pdr_backend/cli/cli_arguments.py">cli_arguments.py</a> and <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/pdr_backend/cli/cli_module.py">cli_module.py</a> use argparse, the best-practices CLI library for Python. The CLI has <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/tree/main/pdr_backend/cli/test">unit tests and system&nbsp;tests</a>.  Issue: we wanted to extend pdr-backend functionality, and doing it in v0.1 code would explode complexity.  v0.2 fix: YAML &amp; clean CLI give a less-complex, more flexible foundation to build from. And we’re now nicely along in our progress: as we were building v0.2, we have also refined its architecture to have a proper data pipeline (in /lake/), the beginnings of a more powerful analytics app (in /analytics/), and are about to upgrade the simulation engine for more flexible and powerful experiments.   6. Conclusion <p>With Ocean Predictoor, you can run AI-powered prediction bots or trading bots on crypto price feeds to earn $.

<p>London, January 17, 2024 – <a href="http://www.zorrzcards.com">ZORRZ</a>, a London-based fintech startup focused on empowering financial inclusivity and security, has announced its partnership with IDnow, a leading European identity verification platform provider, to revolutionize customer onboarding for their innovative credit solution, the BlueAccess Card.</p>



<p>Aiming to democratize access to credit, ZORRZ is set to launch the BlueAccess Card, a hybrid credit card specifically designed for immigrants, individuals with past credit challenges, students, those with learning or physical disabilities, and other groups currently excluded from main stream credit. The card features integrated Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) functionality, providing consumers greater financial flexibility to split payments for purchases. ZORRZ also offers an AI-powered Application Programming Interface (API) generating a comprehensive Financial Health Score, an alternative to conventional credit scores.</p>



<p>“The mission of ZORRZ is to provide responsible and seamless access to credit, fostering financial inclusivity through secure and innovative solutions,” says Priyesh V. Mistry, Managing Director at ZORRZ. “Our collaboration with IDnow signifies our commitment to combating fraud while ensuring a frictionless experience for our customers. IDnow’s cutting-edge AI-driven identity verification aligns perfectly with our ethos of delivering both security and a smooth onboarding journey.” </p>



 Real-time responses, robust fraud protection, and seamless customer verification 



<p>By harnessing IDnow’s <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/">advanced AI-based KYC (Know Your Customer) solution</a>, ZORRZ aims to comply with FCA regulations, ensuring real-time responses, robust fraud protection, and seamless customer verification. IDnow’s automated document verification, including a face biometric comparison with liveness detection, will empower ZORRZ to streamline customer onboarding securely and efficiently.</p>



<p>Doug Pollock, Vice President Customer Success at IDnow, comments, “We are thrilled to collaborate with ZORRZ in redefining customer onboarding experiences in the UK. Our AI-powered, automated identity verification solutions are designed to make KYC and Anti-Money-Laundering processes an enabler rather than a barrier for innovative ventures like ZORRZ. This partnership is an excellent foundation for future expansions, leveraging our expertise in multi-jurisdiction compliance and our extensive European presence.”</p>



<p>In a bid to break down the barriers of bias in AI-powered facial verification, IDnow is participating in the <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101070285">MAMMOth project</a>, collaborating with 12 European partners, including academic institutions, associations, and private companies. Funded by the European Research Executive Agency <a>[1]</a>, the three-year long project aims to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ai-bias-facial-verification/">study and mitigate biases in AI algorithms</a>, particularly in areas such as assessment of loan applications, academic evaluation, and face verification applied to identity verification. This initiative underscores IDnow’s commitment to ensuring fair and reliable algorithms, promoting inclusivity, and addressing concerns of underrepresented groups affected by biases in identity verification processes.</p>



<p>The partnership between ZORRZ and IDnow signifies a leap forward in revolutionizing credit accessibility, combining ZORRZ’s commitment to inclusive financial products with IDnow’s expertise in secure and seamless identity verification. This collaboration promises to pave the way for a more inclusive, secure, and accessible financial landscape for all consumers.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/chatbots">chatbot</a> is a program or script designed to interact and respond to humans in real-time conversation. Different organizations and individuals employ chatbots for a variety of different uses and business functions. Broadly, chatbots provide pre-written responses and information to handle basic requests or to get enough information from customers to connect them to a live agent for better and more specific service. More advanced chatbots use <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/technology/generative-ai">generative AI</a> technology to generate real-time responses based on user input. Chatbots have become a sort of Swiss-Army-knife for many organizations, one tool that fulfills many business needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chatbots have been around for a long time; the first program that could be defined as a chatbot was created in 1966 with Joseph Weizenbaum’s Eliza. In 1988, British-born programmer Rollo Carpenter created a “chatterbot” named Jabberwocky, among the first “conversational AI” to learn new responses instead of simply serving pre-written language.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In that time, chatbots have come a long way and are better than ever at holding a conversation. The primary chatbot use case for most businesses is to ease communication between the organization and the customers. Still, they’re imperfect and even the best chatbot can’t successfully imitate a human indefinitely, but despite their occasional clumsiness, customers now expect organizations to have a customer support messenger chatbot to help them self-serve or troubleshoot issues before escalating to a live agent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two types of chatbots, rule-based and AI-powered. Rule-based chatbots use pre-defined rules and scripts to respond to specific keywords or phrases. They offer limited flexibility but are quick and efficient tools for simple tasks. AI-powered bots leverage machine learning and NLP (<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing">natural language processing</a>) to understand prompts and context. They can learn from past interactions and improve over time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most chatbots, even sophisticated ones, rely on a combination of critical elements. It starts with user input, where a user asks questions or prompts the chatbot through SMS, voice or some other interface. The chatbot then instantly analyzes the request using NLP techniques like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx-as-a-service?topic=models-tokens">tokenization</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/stemming-lemmatization">stemming and lemmatization</a> to understand the meaning behind the request.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on the NLP analysis, the bot will identify the goal or purpose of the query–is the user just chatting, do they want to book a flight or do they want to track an order? The bot will use intent recognition to decide and its internal logic and algorithms will determine the appropriate response based on the recognized intent. Sometimes this involves accessing a knowledge base, searching for relevant information or generating a creative response.&nbsp;</p>



 How organizations use chatbots&nbsp; 



<p>By and large, chatbots have become the go-to method for organizations to provide around-the-clock customer service. Customers expect 24/7 service and rapid resolution of issues. Chatbots give businesses an always-on channel to render service or support to customers and potential customers. They allow the organizations to qualify leads in real time and can help guide prospects directly to the products, services or information they’re looking for. Chatbots are also assisting organizations in improving user retention by providing immediate responses to customer inquiries and reducing wait times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Advanced chatbots deliver personalized experiences by remembering past interactions and preferences, a personal touch that makes customers feel valued and understood. In addition, many organizations also employ proactive chatbots that initiate conversations, upsell, offer help or suggest products or services a customer might not be familiar with.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, there are a few drawbacks. When an organization decides to employ a chatbot, the onus is on them to ensure that it provides valuable customer service and is customized for that purpose. A confusing or unhelpful chatbot may drive a customer away and damage an organization’s brand reputation. Also, organizations that don’t provide a connection to a live agent and rely solely on conversational chatbot technology might face adversity as customers become frustrated with their inability to speak with a person.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The wide array of chatbots in the market today showcases the versatility and efficiency these tools bring to different industries. Lyro, for instance, is revolutionizing customer service with its deep learning capabilities, handling up to 80% of common inquiries and improving response times significantly. Kuki, available on Facebook Messenger, and Google’s Meena, set new standards in daily interaction and open-domain conversation with advanced language processing and context understanding. Ada, developed by ServiceNow offers a friendly and personal approach, often using emojis and GIFs to express empathy and humor. The variety of use extends to specialized bots like Domino’s Messenger Bot, simplifying food orders; Insomnobot 3000, providing quirky nighttime companionship; real estate chatbots that enhance property browsing; a slew of banking chatbots help users pay bills, check account balances and stay on top of their finances; Woebot, offering mental health support; and Buoy, aiding in medical triage. These use cases illustrate chatbots’ growing role in improving user experience, streamlining operations and providing support across sectors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the benefits extend far beyond automation. Chatbots are quickly becoming co-workers for human agents, pre-populating necessary information and highlighting urgent issues so agents can focus on solving complex problems and emotionally charged situations. With global reach and 24/7 availability, chatbots can break down language barriers and provide instant support, building trust and satisfaction at all levels. By combining AI insights with sentiment analysis, companies more quickly understand the customer journey, identify customer pain points, improve offerings and predict needs before they arise.&nbsp;</p>



 Best chatbot examples for enterprise businesses&nbsp; 



 Customer service&nbsp; 



<p>Customer service chatbots provide a seamless experience and enhance customer and employee satisfaction. These AI-driven assistants offer support across web and mobile platforms, making them readily accessible to most people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chatbots also play a crucial role in gathering customer feedback automatically, a vital aspect of service improvement. Furthermore, they help customers track orders and check on their shipped items, adding transparency and trust to the buying process. Online sellers like Amazon have extended chatbot automation to refund and exchange processes, streamlining operations and reducing manual intervention throughout the sales journey.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Standard chatbots, AI-powered chatbots and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/virtual-agent">virtual assistants</a> are becoming increasingly crucial for enterprises in enhancing customer service and business operations. Their popularity stems from the ability to engage customers quickly with website content and self-service support options, reducing the need for face-to-face interaction with service representatives. This capability allows customers to solve problems on demand and reduces the workload on service teams, enabling companies to expand their customer support team’s bandwidth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some organizations use chatbots to proactively engage customers and inform them about available help, offering immediate support upon a user’s site visit and guiding users through the site, tailoring the customer experience to their needs. Some businesses integrate their chatbots with a knowledge base for efficient support query handling, while others use chatbots to determine customer needs before routing complex issues to their support team and human agents.&nbsp;</p>



 Employee enhancement&nbsp; 



<p>Internally, virtual assistants and AI tools assist with employee support, answering queries and providing timely information. Chatbots liberate customer service reps from the time-consuming task of answering basic questions, which typically consume 70-80% of their workday. By automating these tasks, chatbots enable faster customer responses and free up reps for more proactive support roles. This efficiency improves customer satisfaction and presents a cost-effective pricing solution for understaffed service teams, as chatbots do not require salaries like real-life human agents.&nbsp;</p>



 Sales and marketing&nbsp; 



<p>Chatbots are helpful in automating lead generation in sales, enabling robust marketing campaigns and ensuring a consistent flow of potential customers by collecting information from website visitors or mobile app users upfront and converting anonymous site visitors into leads. They nurture these leads effectively, providing timely and relevant information to guide them through the sales funnel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chatbots facilitate easy booking and scheduling appointments, simplifying the interaction between the business and the customer. Moreover, they offer personalized recommendations that enable customers to purchase online at their convenience, increasing conversion rates and aligning with the growing e-commerce trend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chatbots offer enhanced customer engagement for marketing efforts, creating interactive and personalized experiences. They are increasingly used for automated news aggregation, helping businesses stay ahead of global news and trends, which is crucial for timely and relevant marketing strategies. Additionally, e-commerce chatbots provide automated product recommendations based on users’ interests, improving the overall shopping experience and boosting sales.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chatbots have become central in the domain of social media engagement and messaging platforms. They form the backbone of business messaging, facilitating efficient and effective communication both internally within organizations and externally with customers.</p>



 Human resources&nbsp; 



<p>In human resources, chatbots streamline recruitment through automated pre-screening, efficiently filtering candidates and saving time. They offer conversational onboarding and interactive FAQs, providing instant answers to common questions and customer queries, thereby enhancing the candidate and employee experience. Moreover, chatbots provide automated progress updates, keeping candidates informed and engaged throughout the recruitment process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall, chatbots are transforming various aspects of business operations, offering efficiency, enhancing customer and employee experiences and contributing significantly to the digital transformation of enterprises.</p>



 How to best implement a chatbot for your business&nbsp; 



<p>Implementing a chatbot within an organization requires careful planning and consideration. What follows are best practices an organization should consider when implementing a chatbot successfully.&nbsp;</p>



<p>1. Define your goals and objectives: Be clear about what your organization wants the chatbot to achieve. Is it for customer service, employee assistance, internal information retrieval or something else? Having well-defined goals will guide your development and implementation process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. Identify your target audience: Understand who will interact with the chatbot. What are their needs, expectations and preferred communication styles? Tailoring the chatbot’s tone and capabilities to your audience is crucial for user adoption and satisfaction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>3. Choose the right chatbot platform: Research different platforms and tools based on the organization’s needs, budget and technical expertise. Consider factors like scalability, security, integrations and ease of use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>4. Design the chatbot experience: Plan the flow of your chatbot’s conversation. Create user stories and map out potential scenarios to ensure intuitive interaction and efficient resolution of user queries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>5. Develop the chatbot: This can involve building a knowledge base, scripting dialogues and training the AI model (if using a machine learning chatbot). Make sure the chatbot’s language is clear, concise and error-free.&nbsp;</p>



<p>6. Testing and refinement: Rigorously test the chatbot before deployment. Identify and address any bugs or inconsistencies. Gather user feedback and refine the chatbot based on their experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>7. Launch and promotion: Develop a communication plan to introduce the chatbot to your target audience. Provide users with clear instructions on how to access and interact with it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>8. Monitor and maintain: Monitor the chatbot’s performance and gather user feedback. Analyze data to identify areas for improvement and update the chatbot’s knowledge base and responses as needed.&nbsp;</p>



 Additional important chatbot considerations 



 
 Data privacy and security: Ensure your chatbot adheres to privacy regulations and securely protects user information.&nbsp; 



 Accessibility: Make your chatbot accessible to users with disabilities.&nbsp; 



 Human oversight: Remember, chatbots are not a replacement for human interaction. Ensure you have human support agents who can handle complex issues or situations where the chatbot struggles.&nbsp; 
 



<p>By utilizing these resources and frameworks, organizations can confidently integrate chatbots into their operations and unlock tangible improvements in communication channels between customers and businesses.

<p>Beyond the traditional challenges of today’s markets, many organizations must also address the challenges of real estate and facilities management. These issues include managing rising real estate costs, increasing lease rates, new sustainability goals and under-utilized hybrid work environments. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Successfully managing your facilities can directly impact employee productivity and customer satisfaction. Facilities management plays a role in the ongoing cost of the operation of your facility, its lifespan and its energy consumption, as well as how you optimize the use of your facility.</p>



<p>Too many businesses look at facilities from individual silos. Operations is concerned with facility maintenance, finance evaluates buildings from a cost perspective and business management fixates on employee productivity. But who in your organization is responsible for breaking down silos across teams and looking at your facilities from a more holistic viewpoint?</p>



<p>Individual solutions have advantages. They’re smaller to implement, don’t require consensus, are generally lower in acquisition cost and are usually easier to understand because they address only one problem. But point solutions don’t leverage common data or connect across your entire business operation, let alone produce a company-wide, easily digestible report on the state of your facility.</p>



<p>Building your own integrated environment with custom linkages between individual solutions presents new challenges. Developing and maintaining custom linkages often comes with a high price tag and usually doesn’t provide competitive benefits. In some cases, it even limits your ability to leverage any new capabilities that may be offered by your solution providers.</p>



<p>Successful organizations want the best of both: an integrated solution they can buy (not build) that can be implemented in logical phases to address their most pressing challenges and then grow over time. They want to treat their facilities as more of a strategic investment rather than just a necessary expense. So, there has been a growing adoption of more holistic real estate and facility management solutions. This approach not only enables successful facilities management processes but also builds an extensive single source of truth for your &nbsp;real estate and facilities portfolio. This data repository is &nbsp;invaluable for audits, acquisitions and divestitures, capital planning, lease management and evaluations.</p>



<p>IBM TRIRIGA Essential offerings provide a best-of-breed, focused solution that is part of the holistic architecture of TRIRIGA. This solution includes space management and reservations, capital planning and Facility Condition Assessment (FCA), or service and workorder management. These Essential packages offer the entry price of a focused solution with the capability to expand seamless management across the entire facility lifecycle.</p>



<p>These TRIRIGA Essential offerings enable your company to start with a ‘point like’ solution based on a holistic foundation. These solutions can easily be extended to other areas of facilities management while leveraging and expanding the shared facilities management data repository.</p>

<p>To remain competitive in today’s relentlessly paced and ever-expanding marketplace, companies must think carefully about what products they’re developing and how they’re developing them, continuously iterating their processes to maintain a competitive edge. A finely tuned <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/product-development">product development</a> strategy is a holistic, cross-collaborative endeavor with the capacity to help any organization weather unforeseen events or market changes.</p>



 Why is a strong product development strategy important? 



<p>Consumers have access to more information than ever to compare products and brands. The relentless pace of technological advances can mean even the most innovative start-up finds a once-successful product suddenly out-performed or obsolete. And for legacy institutions with strong brand loyalty, existing products might not be enough to remain competitive over the long term.</p>



<p>With new markets and functionalities appearing almost overnight, product development can’t be a blind process. Successful companies fuse product development practices with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/business-strategy-types/">overarching business strategies</a> to ensure sustainable innovations that will resonate efficiently and sustainably with customers—both in existing markets and among new target audiences.</p>



<p>A successful product development strategy can:</p>



 
 Diversify a product portfolio 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/customer-experience">Enhance customer experience</a> 



 Improve sales and return-on-investment 



 Support a growth strategy 



 Support transitions into new markets 
 



<p>Traditionally, there have been three distinct ways for a business to grow through product development:</p>



 
 Create an entirely new offering 



 Tweak an existing product to cater to its target market 



 Enhance a product for introduction to new markets 
 



<p>But offering a better product, or manufacturing one at a lower cost, is only a small part of a successful product development strategy. Today, as many as half of all companies—and 70% of top-performing companies—<a href="https://ibm.co/seven-bets">use software developed internally</a> to differentiate themselves in crowded markets. As more businesses become software businesses, a long-term development strategy that prioritizes continuous feedback and core organizational value is key to success.</p>



 Seven stages of a product development strategy 



<p>While individual organizations may use slightly different templates, and there is certainly no universal strategy to guarantee the successful commercialization of an idea, there are seven common steps in the product development process.</p>



<p>Typically, these measures should be undertaken by a dedicated development team or through a product development partnership with an experienced and specialized consultancy. The goal is to systematize the development process from brainstorming to launch, outlining critical benchmarks and allowing collaboration across departments as well as review from multiple stakeholders. These seven stages of product development are:</p>



 1. Idea generation 



<p>Prioritizing the long-term strategic goals and core competencies outlined, a business should brainstorm new initiatives, product ideas, or product features. During this phase, cross-collaborative efforts should focus on ideation and iteration. Considering customer needs and the business’ strengths, the product team generates product concepts. Taking cues from multiple departments and business leaders, those ideas are then screened to ensure only those ideas most aligned with the organization’s goals move forward.</p>



 2. Research 



<p>During this phase, the new product idea is placed within the context of the current market. Firms might conduct market research related to their new feature or product line, solicit customer feedback, or engage focus groups. During this process, a business should extensively research similar products and fully investigate the new product’s competitive advantage over other offerings to forecast an accurate future market share. All this effort culminates in the validation of the new idea, which helps business leaders identify how the product will perform.</p>



 3. Planning 



<p>Once the idea has been validated, the planning stage of the new product development process begins. This will likely involve collaboration between the product design team, project management, sales, and other departments as the business creates a detailed roadmap for how the new product will be built and deployed. This might include plans for integrating the new idea with current products or existing business structures. Depending on the product, this phase may also involve wire-framing and modeling as well as costing the price of materials or server space.</p>



 4. Prototype 



<p>A <a href="https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/think/build-prototypes/">prototype</a> is a crucial step in the product development process. Often, companies will build several prototypes and make significant changes to their original plans as they assemble a model of their eventual product. Occasionally, it might be necessary to build a handful of variations with different features, material or capabilities.</p>



<p>The end goal should be to create what’s referred to as a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/think/practice_minimum_viable_product/">minimum viable product</a> (MVP). The MVP is the most basic version of the new product without most of the extensive integrations or features that might be added over the time. This will become the sample as materials and vendors are sourced for mass production. In software applications, it may be important to test the prototype with end users to ensure an adequate user experience.</p>



 5. Sourcing and manufacturing 



<p>During this phase, a business gathers materials and contracts with partners, if applicable, to create a detailed plan for actual production. Depending on the scope and nature of the product, this could be as simple as hiring additional engineers and as complex as implementing new supply chain processes across the organization.</p>



<p>This is where a product management team becomes increasingly important, as sourcing can require extensive collaboration between vendors and across multiple processes. In cases of complex global sourcing and manufacturing needs, a business may elect to use software or databases <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/enterprise-resource-planning">specifically built for the task.</a></p>



 6. Costing 



<p>During this final phase before launch, a business should calculate the total cost of its product over a pre-determined product life cycle to verify the retail price and gross margin of its new initiative. The detailed consideration of business value, customer value and product value should help guide and simplify the costing phase, as they’ve helped facilitate an accurate estimation of return-on-investment.</p>



 7. Commercialization 



<p>After a lengthy design process, it’s time for the product launch. Before launch and during the planning process, a marketing strategy will have been developed to ensure target customers have access to the new product and appropriate distribution channels have been engaged.</p>



 Development process vs. development strategy: Thinking holistically for long-term success 



<p>Good product development prioritizes on-time and on-budget production or deployment. Great product development prioritizes value-based outcomes over a product’s entire lifespan.</p>



<p>Before considering how to implement the product development process, it’s important to step back and evaluate a business’ core competencies and potential long-term needs.</p>



 
 What are the organization’s essential advantages and skills? 



 How do those competencies work together in a unique way? 



 What competencies might be needed in the future? 



 How do those competencies align with an organization’s long-term strategic business plans? 
 



<p>It may be useful to rank these advantages—for example, the ability to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/software-development">deploy software quickly</a> or strong strategic sourcing—to capture a deeper sense of where the business stands. Some researchers <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/a-capabilities-strategy-for-successful-product-development">recommend</a> plotting these variables on a simple graph according to how strategically important they are and how strong their current position in the company.</p>



<p>As the early phases of the product development process begin, organizations should weigh how their product roadmaps will respond to and measure three crucial types of value:</p>



 
 Customer value: This metric describes the measurable impact when a customer uses a product, which essentially amounts to a basic value proposition. Will the proposed product or feature meet an unmet need? 



 Business value: This measures product outcomes within the context of key performance indicators (KPIs) and the broader business strategy. Will a product or feature drive specific and measurable business value? 



 Product value: This metric evaluates how much a product or service will be used against the resources required to build and maintain it. Will the benefit of a product or feature improve engagement and outweigh the resources expended? 
 



<p>Tracking these metrics can help an organization make a systematic plan to prioritize products and features. Even the most popular products won’t succeed over the long-term if they drain resources or fail to align with the business’ broader goals. These three value indicators are as important after a product is released as during initial brainstorming sessions. Testing a product and carefully evaluating its success should be a continuous and ongoing outcome rather than the final step in its development.</p>



 Testing as a process, not a final phase 



<p>Historically, testing new product development strategies may have been the final phase of a project. But in today’s landscape smart business leaders iterate to provide continuous, value-based testing over a product’s lifespan.</p>



<p>The final phase of a successful product development strategy is open-ended. It involves the regular collection of data to analyze how products reflect an organization’s broader business goals. This may include soliciting user feedback over social media, tracking retention internally as customers use the new product, or periodically auditing the product to ensure it is capturing the best possible value for consumers and the business alike.</p>



 Product development and IBM 



<p>Today’s business leaders need to rethink competencies, operations, designing and sequencing workflows end-to-end with a way that unlocks, connects, and uses data where it is most effective.</p>



<p>IBM Engineering Lifecycle Management (ELM) is a comprehensive end-to-end engineering solution that stands at the forefront of the market, seamlessly guiding you from requirements to systems design, workflow, and test management, extending the functionality of ALM tools for better complex-systems development. By adopting an end-to-end view across the entire product lifecycle, enabling a digital foundation for data traceability, you can more easily track changes to minimize risk and reduce costs.</p>

<p>The start of 2024 brings forth many questions as to what we can expect in the year ahead, especially in the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/financial-services">financial services</a> industry, where technological advances have skyrocketed and added complexities to an already turbulent landscape. While high interest rates and inflation concerns are carrying over into the new year, financial services trends <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/financial-planning-analysis">signal to prepare</a> for major changes in real-time by staying up-to-date on all financial services-related matters, including in banking and capital markets sectors.</p>



<p>This coming year, emerging technologies, such as automation and efficiency, are expected to come to the forefront. While the Covid-19 pandemic is mostly behind us, the landscape of work in the financial services industry is still in a hybrid environment. Therefore, organizations have continued to invest in remote and in-person work, and this is continuing in 2024.</p>



<p>Generative AI <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/accelerating-ai-innovation-the-future-of-banking-depends-on-core-modernization/">is expected</a> to be the most influential trend permeating the entire financial services sector of 2024. From reshaping the customer experience to bringing forth wealth management tools, the financial services sector will be at the helm of managing the lasting impact <a href="https://www.ibm.com/industries/banking-financial-markets">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) will have on organizations and people. In this blog we’ll breakdown trends likely to come out of these major technological advancements plus other trends including sustainability, cybersecurity and the return of crypto.</p>



<p><a href="https://listen.casted.us/public/95/The-Art-of-AI-7315085b/5f48f839">Listen: The Art of AI featuring a Financial Industry perspective with Citigroup</a></p>



 Trend: Generative AI 



<p>One of the, if not the, biggest technological advancements made in 2023 was generative AI. The advancements made in tech since the pandemic have boomed and ultimately changed the financial sector. This is something we’re likely to see more of this year. Specifically, the influence <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/fintechs-turn-to-ai-and-cloud-as-steadfast-forces-for-innovation/">on fintech</a> and the application of generative AI on chatbots is expected to grow this year through banking technology, such as apps and other online money services, which could produce new revenue streams.</p>



<p>What generative AI has done is open a new world of innovations that can help personalize financial planning and investment management. One example of this is in insurance. Since AI has an ability to find trends in data, AI helps insurers create personalized products which could lead to more accurate risk assessments and ease insurance costs for individuals. This is one of the key financial services trends of the year and will very likely be the driving force of change throughout the industry. &nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/financial-services">New technology</a> can be exciting, but it brings forth new challenges as well, especially when it comes to regulations and compliance. Tools such as cloud computing are likely to be more and more popular as we get further into the year and more organizations see the benefits of a having access to infrastructure, applications, servers and more on-demand via the internet. New technology and the growth of AI bring into question personal data and privacy concerns, which will ultimately change the regulatory requirements in financial services.</p>



<p>More organizations will likely be transitioning to hybrid cloud models for their workloads and to further manage and conduct compliance tasks. It’s important to recognize that hybrid cloud by default is different than hybrid cloud by design. Happening upon a hybrid cloud infrastructure doesn’t mean an organization is getting the greatest in efficiency, functionality or scalability. &nbsp;Therefore, financial institutions need to keep an eye on digital transformations and the integrations needed to support growth and competitiveness in a curated hybrid cloud environment.</p>

 Trend: Cybersecurity risk management 



<p>AI brings about more challenges, especially when it comes to cyber risks. There have been and will likely continue to be cyber threats that are only getting more and more complex as technological advancements continue. Mitigation efforts and having the proper risk management tools will be vitally important as threats increase. An investment in the tools and infrastructure to combat such threats is likely to occur in 2024. The need for increased fraud detection will also be important to watch in the coming year as more and more financial institutions try generative AI.</p>



 Trend: Sustainability 



<p>A key trend likely this year is a greater focus by financial institutions on sustainability efforts and ESG consideration. Organizations within the financial services industry will be nudged to support the investment in green initiatives more than ever before. Renewable resources, recycling and reducing the carbon footprint are among the initiatives organizations are expected to prioritize.</p>



<p>Separately, providers are more drawn towards partnerships with sustainable financial products as customers put more thought into where their money is being used.</p>



 Trend: Customer experience 



<p>One true benefit of AI-powered technology is the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/customer-experience">customer experience</a>, or CX. Now, customer experience is also often referred to as customer experience management (CXM) as strategies and technologies to improve business results emerge. An example is <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-assistant/banking">watsonx Assistant,</a> which uses natural language processing (NLP) to help with digital transformation and build AI-powered chatbots. New technology can analyze almost every detail of a customer’s interactions, which can enhance customer loyalty and increase satisfaction over time. Financial service providers are now capable of increasing functionality and leveling customer expectations thanks to these new technologies.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-assistant/banking">Explore how IBM watsonx Assistant helps transform digital banking experience</a>s</p>



 Trend: Open banking 



<p>The premise of open banking is it provides secure access to a customer’s financial data from traditional banks and other financial institutions using application programming interfaces, also known as APIs.</p>



<p>The use of open banking is expected to increase as customers seek to take control of who has access to their data. APIs may likely become the preferred method to help banks connect technologies to their internal systems and streamline processes.</p>



 Trend: Digital currencies 



<p>Generative AI and the hype around it knocked cryptocurrencies out of the limelight, but crypto is expected to make its return in 2024. The financial services sector has seen a major shift to online banking methods and managing assets, like credit cards, all in an online setting.</p>



<p>Separately, blockchain is also likely to come back into the picture. The shared system of record will become more important to managing confidential information and transactions.</p>



 Embracing financial services trends with IBM Consulting 



<p>Financial institutions that used to compete based on back-office efficiencies are now competing based on front-office customer experiences. IBM Financial Services Consulting helps clients respond rather than react to this inversion of the traditional financial services industry business model.</p>



<p>Our expertise in modernizing digital core systems for banking has helped our clients realize cost-to-income (C/I) ratio improvements greater than 14% and total cost of operations (TCO) savings averaging 20-30%. IBM Consulting’s deep industry and technology expertise generates outcomes critical for healthy financial performance focused on three core client imperatives: growth, efficiency and compliance.</p>



<p>Essential to the modernization of financial services companies, our world-class IBM Payments Center provides end-to-end payment solutions to enable the agility, security and scalability needed in an ever-growing, partner-centric payment ecosystem.</p>

<p>IBM believes in the power of technology and innovation to drive climate solutions, especially for the communities and organizations most impacted by climate change and environmental challenges. At the center of this work is also a commitment to volunteerism, allowing inspired IBMers to combine their talent and skills with passion and purpose.</p>



<p>Through the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/impact/initiatives/ibm-sustainability-accelerator">IBM Sustainability Accelerator</a>, a pro-bono social impact program, IBM volunteers donate their time, energy and expertise to help create lasting impact in communities around the world. And Takahito Motonaga is one IBMer making a difference in the community where he grew up: Miyakojima City, Okinawa, Japan.</p>


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/ibmers-fighting-climate-change/">Learn about 5 IBMer volunteers who are tackling climate change</a>



 Making a difference in a remote community 



<p>Miyakojima City is located southwest of Okinawa, Japan, on the Miyako Islands, far from the mainland. In October 2022, this remote community became the focus of an IBM Sustainability Accelerator clean energy project aimed at addressing the complex energy challenges it faces.</p>



<p>The community relies on external sources for most of its energy supply, which could result in an increased costs to residents. Additionally, Miyakojima lies directly in the path of intense typhoons every year. These extreme and unpredictable weather events can topple the island’s utility infrastructure, resulting in damaging power outages, financial impacts and property loss.</p>



<p>Born and raised on Miyako Island, IBMer Takahito Motonaga lived in Miyakojima City for 18 years. Takahito can vividly remember a typhoon that had an impact on his childhood.</p>



<p>“I suffered a power outage caused by a large typhoon for about a week when I was in elementary school,” he says. “The strong winds toppled utility poles, trees and parked cars all over the island. Various facilities were without power, and supplies from outside the island were also cut off, so we were unable to buy food. As electricity and gas were not available at home, we spent about a week using candles and taking cold showers. When I experienced the inconvenience of living without things that I normally take for granted, I realized that our lives heavily depend on energy and other infrastructure.”</p>



<p></p> 



<p>As a result, Takahito focuses on how he can help address similar problems. “This may be influenced by my background of growing up on an island,” he says. “Through my work, I would like to contribute to solving such issues in local communities.”</p>



<p>Takahito is an IT specialist with IBM Systems Engineering, with a primary focus on designing and developing web applications. He joined IBM in 2015. Today, he also serves as the squad leader for the IBM Sustainability Accelerator’s clean energy project in Miyakojima City, where the team is working to develop an energy forecasting model. This model aims to improve the community’s self-sufficiency in clean, renewable energy.</p>



<p>“My role is to bring individuals with various specialized skills from IBM’s Technology, Consulting, Systems Engineering and Digital Services divisions to form a team, set goals to work toward, and lead the team” Takahito says. “I believed it would give me a unique opportunity to use IT skills I have obtained through my work and tackle challenges in the community where I was born and raised. I felt this was a great mission for me to fulfill.”</p>



 An opportunity to engage 



<p>Through the IBM Sustainability Accelerator, Takahito works closely with the community where he grew up, using local perspectives to strengthen his team’s approach to the project. The Miyakojima Island project team frequently engages with local stakeholders who, like Takahito, deeply understand the energy issues facing the island.</p>



<p>“Sustainability issues are often complex, created by a variety of factors,” he says, yet he recalls “the importance of understanding various aspects of an area and considering the heart of issues.” Working with colleagues, local citizens and officials from around the world is an important opportunity for IBMer volunteers to hone their cultural and marketplace literacy, deepening their societal engagement and possibly a career trajectory.</p>



<p>Discussing highlights of the Miyakojima Island project so far, Takahito says, “I realized that among IBM employees, there are many highly motivated people who are willing to volunteer and actively participate in volunteer activities to solve social issues. I am very happy to have been able to work with them as a team.</p>



<p>“Many of the members voluntarily identify necessary tasks and proactively take actions, considering what must be done to solve the energy issues and what they can do by leveraging their expertise. Many of them are very ambitious and have high aspirations to work on the island. Being able to work with such highly motivated and talented people is my favorite part of this project.”</p>



 Part of a lasting legacy 



<p>At IBM, volunteering and giving are core values. Today, IBM has a goal to deliver 4 million volunteer hours by 2025, and IBM is proud to keep connecting enthusiastic employees with opportunities to get involved in their communities and pursue their own passions and purpose through the Sustainability Accelerator.</p>



<p>“I believe that it is socially meaningful for a large company with a long history like IBM to volunteer through a program like the Sustainability Accelerator, because it allows us to help those who really need it,” says Takahito. “These efforts contribute to the relief and development of society, and strengthen ties with the community, allowing employees who participate in the program to grow—and that is very valuable. Continuously making such efforts is important in a society where sustainability perspectives are also becoming increasingly important.”</p>



<p>Like many IBMer volunteers, Takahito encourages colleagues to get involved. “The IBM Sustainability Accelerator is an activity in which you can use your skills and experience to solve local issues and contribute to society. You will have the opportunity to collaborate with employees with diverse knowledge and skills in other units within the company and gain a broader perspective on social issues,” he says.</p>



<p><a href="https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/ibm-sustainability-accelerator">IBM volunteers will be invited</a> to participate in the next cohort of the IBM Sustainability Accelerator, following a new RFP to be announced in 2024. </p>

  <p>There’s a plethora of data connectors for Microsoft Sentinel, from Microsoft and Azure services to third party sources and custom logs. This data is only as good as the analytical value it brings. During investigations – both proactive and reactive – visualizing data in different formats offers value into finding anomalies, patterns, and insights difficult to spot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When working with data which includes geographic related information such as Microsoft Entra sign-in logs, visualizing the data through a proper medium is essential to making the most use of the data. This is where using interactive maps for Sentinel and Log Analytics workspace comes into play. As of the writing of this blog article, it’s not possible to use the interactive map directly within the Logs section of Sentinel or Log Analytics workspace. Instead, the Azure Data Explorer web app or <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/tools/kusto-explorer">Kusto Explorer desktop app</a> must be used. This article will use Azure Data Explorer for all examples. The setup required for this is simple and only takes a few minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Setup and configuration 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first step is to go to the <a href="https://dataexplorer.azure.com/">Azure Data Explorer</a> web app and click on Add in the top left of the screen, and then select Connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1 Adding connection to Azure Data Explorer (ADX)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point, a window will appear asking for a connection. To connect to a Sentinel instance (it’s actually the Log Analytics workspace), the following information is required:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Subscription ID 
 Resource group name – this is the resource group where the Log Analytics workspace is in 
 Log Analytics workspace name 
 
<p>All of these can be found simply by clicking on Settings in the Sentinel menu and then clicking Workspace settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 2 Workspace settings of the Sentinel instance</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After clicking on Workspace settings, the information required will be available on the screen as shown below. This is also true if you’re connecting to a Log Analytics workspace without Sentinel. By going to the Log Analytics workspace’s page, the page below will open.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 3 Workspace settings of the Sentinel instance</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The connection URI needs to be in the following format:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://ade.loganalytics.io/subscriptions/&lt;subscription-id&gt;/resourcegroups/&lt;resource-group-name&gt;/providers/microsoft.operationalinsights/workspaces/&lt;workspace-name&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the connection URI has been updated with the required values, it can be added to the section in Azure Data Explorer, and once a display name has been entered click Add. Ensure that the Log Analytics workspace configured in the connection URI is in the tenant shown at the bottom of the window. If the Log Analytics workspace is in a tenant other than the one signed in as in Azure Data Explorer, the tenant can be switched on this screen as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 4 Adding the connection URI to Azure Data Explorer (ADX)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the connection has been set up, it should be viewable under Connections in the left menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 5 A table from the newly configured connection</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To query the tables, select the workspace and enter the query as you would normally do in the Sentinel Logs screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 6 Running a query in ADX</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Using the interactive map 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To use the interactive map, the data must contain longitude and latitude data. Mapping based on country, state, or city names will not work. The format of the longitude and latitude should be in decimal degrees. This means that 41.40338 and 2.17403 will work but 41°24'12.2"N and 2°10'26.5"E will not work. Most tables in Sentinel will have geographical data in the correct format already.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The render operator must be used followed by “scatterchart with (kind=map)” to generate the interactive map. There is documentation about parameters which affect <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/geospatial-visualizations">geospatial data visualizations</a>. One rule is the first two columns of the query output must be the longitude and latitude values, in that order. While the specific columns for longitude and latitude can be selected manually after running the query, it adds an extra step that’s easily skipped by ensuring the proper order of columns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The query below will take count of Entra sign ins from each location and then visualize it on an interactive map.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(7d)
| where isnotempty(LocationDetails.geoCoordinates)
| extend Latitude = toreal(LocationDetails.geoCoordinates["latitude"])
| extend Longitude = toreal(LocationDetails.geoCoordinates["longitude"])
| summarize Count = count() by Longitude, Latitude
| project Longitude, Latitude, Count
| render scatterchart with (kind=map)
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 7 Interactive map result of query</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the map is interactive, you can zoom in and move around freely. Clicking on the objects will show the values based on the query output. In the query example above, the number of sign ins from that location were being calculated and therefore this is shown when clicked on the object.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 8 Interactive map result of query</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After running the query in the Azure Data Explorer page, a menu will appear to the right of the results. This section will allow you to change settings of the visualization of the query results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 9 Settings options on the right which allows you to configure which outputs will affect size on interactive map</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s possible to set the circle sizes proportional to the number of sign ins (or any other numerical value that may exist in the query output). To do this, the Size section needs to be turned on by toggling the Hide toggle and then the column which will determine the size can be selected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The effect of configuring the Size section can be seen below. Note how the circle sizes are now different.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 10 Ability to select which output determines the size of the items on the map</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 11 Interactive map result of query with point sizes based on output values</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Visualizing geographical data can give insights that may be difficult to find when using other visualization methods. Once a connection has been setup from Azure Data Explorer Sentinel logs such as Entra ID, sign-in logs can be queried and visualized on an interactive map, making investigations much more effective.</p>

<p>In 2024, the ongoing process of digitalization further enhances the efficiency of government programs and the effectiveness of policies, as detailed in a previous <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/NK0J1VEN">white paper</a>. Two critical elements driving this digital transformation are data and artificial intelligence (AI). AI plays a pivotal role in unlocking value from data and gaining deeper insights into the extensive information that governments collect to serve their citizens.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the demand for generative AI is expected to grow this year, it becomes imperative for the public sector to embrace responsible use of this technology. Only by doing so can governments establish themselves as trustworthy stewards.&nbsp;</p>



 The differences between generative AI and traditional AI&nbsp; 



<p>To understand the unique challenges that are posed by generative AI compared to traditional AI, it helps to understand their fundamental differences. Traditional AI primarily relies on algorithms and extensive labeled data sets to train models through machine learning. These models can provide recommendations or identify certain behaviors by recognizing patterns and adhering to predefined rules. For instance, traditional AI is used to improve the effectiveness of spam email filtering, enhance movie or product recommendations for consumers and enable virtual assistants to help individuals in seeking information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Generative AI is emerging as a valuable solution for automating and improving routine administrative and repetitive tasks. This technology excels at applying foundation models, which are large neural networks trained on extensive unlabeled data and fine-tuned for various tasks. It can effectively identify, summarize, convert, predict and generate content from large data sets. Implementing this technology in the public sector can significantly improve efficiency, enabling organizations to complete their daily tasks with a fraction of the resources.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Generative AI presents an unprecedented opportunity to enhance various aspects of government operations and improve services for citizens. It can empower government workers with more powerful tools for answering questions and conducting research. Tasks such as contract writing and management, which are both&nbsp;time-consuming and crucial, might greatly benefit from the application of generative AI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last year, the US Department of State sought feedback on the challenges and security considerations of introducing generative and natural language processing AI into its network. A June request for information from the State Department revealed their aim to improve worker efficiency and accuracy in repetitive tasks related to market research and acquisition planning for contract writing. Machine learning-trained generative AI might help in drafting new contracts based on this research.&nbsp;</p>



 Implementing generative AI responsibly&nbsp; 



<p>The remarkable generative capabilities of this emerging AI technology raise questions about its responsible use in the public sector. For example, contract managers need to know that the original research is faithfully converted into a legally binding contract for two or more parties. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The public recently encountered generative AI primarily through tools that use pre-existing text, images, videos and audio to create customized content on demand. However, the level of detail regarding the training of some of these models <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02366-2">might be insufficient</a>, especially for large enterprises or highly regulated industries reliant on public trust.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To develop responsible AI, government leaders must carefully <a href="https://www.government-transformation.com/data/unleashing-the-full-potential-of-ai-in-the-public-sector">prepare their internal data</a> to harness the full potential of both AI and generative AI. Setting responsible standards is a crucial government role, requiring the integration of responsibility from the start, rather than as an afterthought. This includes maintaining human oversight to help ensure AI-generated content accuracy and prevent biases, among other considerations.&nbsp;</p>



 Key pillars for responsible AI in government&nbsp; 



<p>IBM’s AI development centers around 5 fundamental pillars to help ensure trustworthy AI. Government leaders should prioritize these pillars when considering the responsible development, training and deployment of&nbsp;AI: &nbsp;</p>



 
 Fairness in an AI system refers to its ability to treat individuals or groups equitably, depending on the context in which the AI system is used. That means countering biases and preventing discrimination that is related to protected characteristics, such as gender, race, age and veteran status.&nbsp; 



 Privacy pertains to an AI system’s ability to prioritize and safeguard consumers’ privacy and data rights while complying with existing regulations related to data collection, storage, access and disclosure.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Explainability is important because an AI system must be able to provide a human-interpretable explanation for its predictions and insights in a way that does not hide behind technical jargon.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Transparency means that an AI system must include and share information on how it was designed and developed and the data or data sources used to feed the system.&nbsp; 



 Robustness is an AI system’s ability to effectively handle exceptional conditions, such as abnormalities in input. It helps to ensure consistent outputs.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/watsonx?utm_content=SRCWW&amp;p1=Search&amp;p4=43700076341632478&amp;p5=e&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw6KunBhDxARIsAKFUGs8UPvG6yjVBf59Xv_mfwxww7py7ifT_JDr6wifywtjKCH8Ai4xMTmAaApgIEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">IBM watsonx™</a>, an integrated AI, data and governance platform, embodies these principles by offering a seamless, efficient and responsible approach to AI development across various environments. More specifically, the recent launch of <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-11-14-IBM-Unveils-watsonx-governance-to-Help-Businesses-Governments-Govern-and-Build-Trust-in-Generative-AI">IBM® watsonx.governance™</a> helps public sector teams automate and address these areas, enabling them to direct, manage and monitor their organization’s AI activities. This tool facilitates clear processes so organizations can proactively detect and mitigate risks while supporting their compliance programs for internal AI policies and industry standards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the public sector continues to embrace AI and automation to solve problems and improve efficiency, it is crucial to maintain trust and transparency in any AI solution. Teams should have the ability to comprehend and manage the AI lifecycle effectively. Proactively adopting responsible AI practices is an opportunity for all of us to improve.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>One of the best practices for securing your organization's data is to follow the principle of least privilege, which means granting users the minimum level of permissions they need to perform their tasks. Microsoft Entra ID helps you apply this principle by offering a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference">wide range of built-in roles</a> as well as allowing you to create custom roles and assign them to users or groups based on their responsibilities and access needs. You can also use Entra ID to review and revoke any role assignments that are no longer needed or appropriate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It can be easy to lose track of role assignments if admin activities are not carefully audited and monitored. Routine checks of role assignments and generating alerts on new role assignments are one way to track and manage privileged role assignment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chances are that when a user with privileged roles is approached, they’ll say they need the role. This may be true; however, many times users will unknowingly say they need those permissions to carry out certain tasks when they could be assigned a role with lower permissions. For example, a user will be able to reset user passwords as a Global Administrator, but that does not mean they can’t do that with another role with far less permissions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Defining privileged permissions 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/privileged-roles-permissions?tabs=admin-center#terminology">Privileged permissions in Entra ID</a> can be defined as “permissions that can be used to delegate management of directory resources to other users, modify credentials, authentication or authorization policies, or access restricted data.” Entra ID roles each have a list of permissions defined to them. When an identity is granted the role, the identity also inherits the permissions defined in the role.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s important to check the permissions of these roles. The permissions defined in all built-in roles can be found <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference">here</a>. For example, there are a few permissions that are different for the Privileged Authentication Administrator role than the Authentication Administrator role, giving the former more permissions in Entra ID. The differences between the authentication roles can be viewed <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/privileged-roles-permissions?tabs=admin-center#compare-authentication-roles">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another example of having differences between similar roles is for the end user administration roles. The differences and nuances between these roles are outlined in detail <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/privileged-roles-permissions?tabs=admin-center#who-can-reset-passwords">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Auditing activity 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To decide if a user really needs a role, it’s crucial to monitor their activities and find the role with the least privilege that allows them to carry out their work. You’ll need Entra ID audit logs for this. Entra ID audit logs can either be sent to a Log Analytics Workspace or connected to a Sentinel instance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two methods that can be used to get the events of carried out by admin accounts. The first will make use of the IdentityInfo table, which is only available in Sentinel after enabling User and Entity Behavior Analytics (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/enable-entity-behavior-analytics">UEBA</a>). If you aren’t using UEBA in Sentinel or if you’re querying a Log Analytics Workspace, then you'll need to use the second method in the next heading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Using Microsoft Sentinel 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To ingest Entra ID audit logs into Microsoft Sentinel, the Microsoft Entra ID data connector must be enabled, and the Audit Logs must be ticked as seen below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1 Entra ID data connector in Sentinel with Audit logs enabled&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The IdentityInfo table stores user information gathered by UEBA. Therefore, it also includes the Entra ID roles a user has been assigned. This makes it very simple to get a list of accounts that have been assigned privileged roles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The query below will give a unique list of activities an account has taken, as well as which roles the account has been assigned:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
AuditLogs 
| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(90d) 
| extend ActorName = iif( 
                         isnotempty(tostring(InitiatedBy["user"])),  
                         tostring(InitiatedBy["user"]["userPrincipalName"]), 
                         tostring(InitiatedBy["app"]["displayName"]) 
                     ) 
| extend ActorID = iif( 
                       isnotempty(tostring(InitiatedBy["user"])),  
                       tostring(InitiatedBy["user"]["id"]), 
                       tostring(InitiatedBy["app"]["id"]) 
                   ) 
| where isnotempty(ActorName) 
| join kind=inner (IdentityInfo 
    | where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(7d) 
    | where strlen(tostring(AssignedRoles)) &gt; 2 
    | summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by AccountUPN 
    | project AccountObjectId, AssignedRoles) 
    on $left.ActorID == $right.AccountObjectId 
| summarize Operations = make_set(OperationName) by ActorName, ActorID, Identity, tostring(AssignedRoles) 
| extend OperationsCount = array_length(Operations) 
| project ActorName, AssignedRoles, Operations, OperationsCount, ActorID, Identity 
| sort by OperationsCount desc 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will give results for all accounts that carried out tasks in Entra ID and may generate too many operations that were not privileged. To filter for specific Entra ID roles, the following query can be run where the roles are defined in a list. Three roles have been added as examples, but this list can and should be expanded to include more roles:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
let PrivilegedRoles = dynamic(["Global Administrator", 
                               "Security Administrator", 
                               "Compliance Administrator" 
                              ]); 
AuditLogs 
| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(90d) 
| extend ActorName = iif( 
                         isnotempty(tostring(InitiatedBy["user"])),  
                         tostring(InitiatedBy["user"]["userPrincipalName"]), 
                         tostring(InitiatedBy["app"]["displayName"]) 
                     ) 
| extend ActorID = iif( 
                       isnotempty(tostring(InitiatedBy["user"])),  
                       tostring(InitiatedBy["user"]["id"]), 
                       tostring(InitiatedBy["app"]["id"]) 
                   ) 
| where isnotempty(ActorName) 
| join kind=inner (IdentityInfo 
    | where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(7d) 
    | where strlen(tostring(AssignedRoles)) &gt; 2 
    | summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by AccountUPN 
    | project AccountObjectId, AssignedRoles) 
    on $left.ActorID == $right.AccountObjectId 
| where AssignedRoles has_any (PrivilegedRoles) 
| summarize Operations = make_set(OperationName) by ActorName, ActorID, Identity, tostring(AssignedRoles) 
| extend OperationsCount = array_length(Operations) 
| project ActorName, AssignedRoles, Operations, OperationsCount, ActorID, Identity 
| sort by OperationsCount desc 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the query is run, the results will give insights into the activities performed in your Entra ID tenant and what roles those accounts have. In the example below, the top two results don’t pose any problems. However, the third row contains a user that has the Global Administrator role and has created a service principal. The permissions needed to create a service principal can be found in roles less privileged than the Global Administrator role. Therefore, this user can be given a less privileged role. To find out which role can be granted, check <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/delegate-by-task">this list</a>, which contains the least privileged role required to carry out specific tasks in Entra ID.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because there is no table that contains the roles an identity has been granted, you’ll need to add the list of users to the query and filter them. There are multiple ways to get a list of users who have been assigned a specific Entra ID role. A quick way to do this is to go to Entra ID and then select Roles and administrators. From there, select the role and export the identities that have been assigned to it. It’s important to have the User Principal Names (UPNs) of the privileged users. You’ll need to add these UPNs, along with the roles the user has, to the query. Some examples have been given in the query itself. If the user has more than one role, then all roles must be added to the query.</p>

]

        | extend ActorName = iif( 
                                isnotempty(tostring(InitiatedBy["user"])),  
                                tostring(InitiatedBy["user"]["userPrincipalName"]), 
                                tostring(InitiatedBy["app"]["displayName"]) 
                            ) 
        | extend ActorID = iif( 
                            isnotempty(tostring(InitiatedBy["user"])),  
                            tostring(InitiatedBy["user"]["id"]), 
                            tostring(InitiatedBy["app"]["id"]) 
                        ) 
        | where isnotempty(ActorName) ) on $left.UserPrincipalName == $right.ActorName 
| summarize Operations = make_set(OperationName) by ActorName, ActorID, tostring(Roles) 
| extend OperationsCount = array_length(Operations) 
| project ActorName, Operations, OperationsCount, Roles, ActorID 
| sort by OperationsCount desc 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you run the query, the results will give insights into the activities performed in your Entra ID tenant by the users you have filtered for. In the example below, the top two results can cause problems. Both have the Global Administrator role, but their operations don’t necessitate to have that role. The permissions needed for these operations can be found in roles less privileged than the Global Administrator role. Therefore, these users can be given a less privileged role. To find out which role can be granted, check <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/delegate-by-task">this list</a>, which contains the least privileged role required to carry out specific tasks in Entra ID.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 4 Actions taken by users in Entra ID</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this user still requires the Global Administrator role then the Security Administrator role will become redundant as the Global Administrator contains more permissions than the Security Administrator role.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keeping accounts with privileges that are not required is keeping your attack surface greater than it needs to be. By ingesting Entra ID Audit logs, you can query and identify users who have unnecessary and over-privileged roles. You can then find a suitable alternative role for them.&nbsp;</p>

			 What is a digital signature and how does it work? 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>In the form of a coded message, a digital signature securely links a signer to a document in a recorded transaction. Digital signatures employ a standardized and widely accepted format known as Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to ensure the utmost levels of security and universal acceptance. PKI entails the use of a digital certificate for identity verification.</p>						 
				 
				 
				 
			 How do digital signature works? 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>Digital signatures, similar to handwritten signatures, are unique to each signer. Providers of digital signature solutions, such as InfoCert, adhere to a specific protocol known as Public Key Infrastructure, or PKI. PKI mandates that the provider utilizes a mathematical algorithm to generate two long numbers, referred to as keys. One key is public, and the other is private.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When a signer electronically signs a document, the signature is formed using the signer’s private key, which is securely held by the signer. The mathematical algorithm functions as a cipher, creating data that matches the signed document, known as a hash, and encrypting that data. The resulting encrypted data constitutes the digital signature. Additionally, the signature is timestamped with the time of document signing. If the document undergoes changes after signing, the digital signature becomes invalid.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, John signs an agreement to sell a timeshare using her private key. The buyer receives the document along with a copy of John’s public key. If the public key cannot decrypt the signature (via the cipher used to generate the keys), it indicates that the signature either does not belong to John or has been altered since it was signed. In such cases, the signature is deemed invalid.</p><p>To uphold the integrity of the signature, PKI mandates that the keys be created, managed, and stored securely. This often involves the services of a reputable Certificate Authority (CA). Digital signature providers, like InfoCert, comply with PKI requirements to ensure secure digital signing.</p>						 
				 
				 
				 
			 What’s the difference between an electronic signature and a digital signature? 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>A digital signature is a form of electronic signature that demands a higher level of identity verification through digital certificates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The broader category of electronic signatures (e-signatures) encompasses various types of electronic signatures. This category includes digital signatures, which represent a specific technological implementation of electronic signatures. Both digital signatures and other e-signature solutions enable the signing of documents and authentication of the signer. However, distinctions exist in terms of purpose, technical implementation, geographical usage, and the legal and cultural acceptance of digital signatures compared to other types of e-signatures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, the utilization of digital signature technology for e-signatures varies significantly between countries following open, technology-neutral e-signature laws, such as the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, and those adopting tiered eSignature models favoring locally defined standards based on digital signature technology. This includes many countries in the European Union, South America, and Asia. In the European Union, governed by the eIDAS regulation, two levels of digital signatures exist: Advanced Electronic Signature (AES) and Qualified Electronic Signature (QES).</p><p>Furthermore, certain industries also endorse specific standards rooted in digital signature technology</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p> Navigating the Digital Identity Landscape 
<p>While eIDAS 2.0 centers on fostering interoperability and setting standards for digital identity, the EUDI Wallet serves as a tangible tool for users, thereby contributing to the development of a comprehensive digital identity ecosystem.</p>
<p>The Electronic IDentification and trust Services Regulation, more commonly known as eIDAS, aims to create a unified digital identity framework, promoting interoperability and trust in cross-border interactions. eIDAS 2.0 represents a paradigm shift, addressing key challenges that hindered the initial eIDAS regulation's widespread adoption. Its revision was triggered by low implementation of eIDAS by European Union (EU) member states. The revised eIDAS 2.0 plans to provide private individuals a trusted and secure means of sharing verified identity and data attributes with not just public but also private services.</p>
<p>Key to the eIDAS regulation is the digital wallet, with each member state responsible for providing a digital identity wallet to every citizen who wants one. With the ambitious goal of <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EPRS_BRI(2022)699491">80% of EU residents using a digital identity by 2030</a>, the idea is to provide all citizens and residents across the EU with highly secure and privacy preserving digital wallets that can be used to manage various digital credentials. As a result, a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_5651">final agreement</a> on eID was reached by the European Parliament and the Council on November 8, 2023.</p>
 Things to consider 
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/kuppingercole-analysts-predict-verified-identitys-market-/">KuppingerCole market sizing research</a> indicates that the financial, government, and health care sectors already see the highest use of a verified digital identity to remotely onboard and enroll users. While these may be the most frequent users of verified digital identity, other industries are rapidly showing interest. This expected growth is in line with the overall growth of this segment, marked by increasing maturity of technologies, increasing adoption across a wider range of industries, and an increased use of eIDs and digital wallets. However, the true potential lies not in restricting these technologies to specific use cases but in embracing their capacity to simplify a multitude of interactions.</p>
<p>Far from being a mere tool, the EUDI Wallet could serve as a means for the adoption of digital services by providing a unified approach to identity management. From e-commerce to government processes and beyond, the EUDI Wallet and eIDAS 2.0 have the potential to integrate decentralized identity principles into existing applications and build new digital services that benefit from them. Nevertheless, ensuring security and interoperability will be challenging - especially at the massive scale of users and use cases the EU is targeting.</p>
<p>In addition, the digital identity issuance and applicability must not just be for one organization or use case – if a user has access to a verified, digital identity, they must be able to use it for many different purposes, with many different service providers in disparate industries, and even with public institutions. Therefore, solutions must be flexible and extensible: flexible to provide adjustable levels of assurance to each use case or flow, and extensible to address the increasingly complex interoperability needs and security considerations.</p>
 Reaping the benefits 
<p>The wallet's full potential extends far beyond specific use cases, encompassing its applicability in e-commerce, organizational and enterprise settings, government interactions, and more. Key components to consider when selecting the right technology mix for a digital identity solution will include high functionality with exceptional user experience. The crucial factor here is the widespread acceptance of the EUDI Wallet, which hinges on its user-friendliness, security, and global functionality. Achieving acceptance becomes feasible when the system is easier to use and seamlessly works on a global scale.</p>
<p>Done right, the economy stands to gain significantly from the simplification brought about by the EUDI Wallet. One of the primary benefits is a reduction in drop-off rates, as the streamlined and user-friendly nature of the wallet ensures a smoother process, preventing potential users from abandoning digital interactions midway. Additionally, the simplification enabled by the wallet helps reduce overall process costs. Eliminating unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles and reducing in the time required for various transactions further bolster the economic benefits.</p>
<p>In essence, the key to unlocking the full potential of the EUDI Wallet lies not only in its technical capabilities, but equally in the investments made to educate users, promote transparency, and cultivate a user base that recognizes the transformative impact of digital wallets on both the personal and economic landscape. Emphasizing the versatility of the EUDI Wallet in various economic facets is critical for user adoption, which ultimately leads to a more efficient and connected economy. User education will therefore be an important part of success, as will an iterative approach.</p>

<p>Safety is core to social media. Transparency is essential to building trust in moderation efforts, and the data we are providing here is a first step towards full transparency reports. We hope these early disclosures provide some visibility into our behind the scenes operations, and we intend to deliver more granular data and reporting in the future. Given the transparent nature of the network, independent researchers also already have direct access to relatively rich data on labeling and moderation interventions.</p>
 High-Level Overview 
<p>Over the past year, the Bluesky app has grown from a handful of friends and developers to over 3 million registered accounts. We have hired and trained a full-time team of moderators, launched and iterated on several community and individual moderation features, developed and refined policies both public and internal, designed and redesigned product features to reduce abuse, and built several infrastructure components from scratch to support our Trust and Safety work.</p>
<p>We’ve made a lot of progress, and we know we still have a long way to go to deliver on the vision we set out — including <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/4-13-2023-moderation">composable moderation</a>, mute words, temporary account deactivation, and collaborative programs to combat misinformation (such as Community Notes). We will have more to share in coming weeks! But first here is an overview of 2023.</p>
 Reporting By The Numbers 
<p>One of the most obvious and visible forms of moderation on Bluesky is the report-and-review feedback loop. Any user can report content such as posts, accounts, or lists through the app. We then review reported content and behavior against both the <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/support/community-guidelines">Community Guidelines</a> and <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/support/tos">Terms of Service</a>, and take action when appropriate.</p>
<p>Our team of proactive and very-much-appreciated full-time moderators have provided around-the-clock coverage since spring. We’re doing things differently than a lot of social media sites, and hired our moderators directly, rather than relying on a third-party vendor. While we might use automated tools to handle reports in the future, right now every single report filed has been reviewed by humans, with no automated resolution. In 2023 we reviewed 358,165 individual reports.</p>

The report categories in this graph&nbsp; are based on the `com.atproto.moderation.defs#reasonType` schema. Currently, these categories do not clearly align with the in-app copy for reports. The categories shown in-app will be updated and harmonized soon. <a>Download the raw data as a TSV file here</a>.
<p>A relatively small fraction of accounts was responsible for creating the majority of reports, and separately a small fraction of accounts received the majority of reports. In total 76,699 individual accounts (5.6% of our active users) created one or more reports, and 45,861 individual accounts (3.4% of our active users) received one or more reports (either on the overall account, or on a piece of content created by the account). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we take action on a report, our interventions have ranged from sending warning emails, to labeling, to takedowns of content or entire accounts. Takedowns can be either temporary suspensions or take effect permanently. While we used all of our interventions over the course of 2023, this post only includes a breakdown of takedowns: 4,667 accounts taken down, and an additional 1,817 individual pieces of content taken down.</p>
<p>In addition to reports from the community, we have a number of automated tools to proactively detect suspicious or harmful conduct without a user first reporting it to the moderation team, such as slurs in handles and spam accounts. Some of these tools take direct action on visual content by applying labels like "gore" to violent imagery, while others simply file automated reports for human review. Users can appeal labels applied to their account through the same in-app reporting flow, which the moderation team will then take another look at. The numbers above do not include the large volume of reports created by our own automated systems.</p>
<p>Child sexual abuse and exploitation, including the distribution of child sexual abuse material (CSAM), is obviously unacceptable anywhere on the Internet, including Bluesky. We built AT Protocol and Bluesky to ensure we can rapidly identify and remove this content anywhere it appears on our network, even when federation becomes available in the future. To help proactively detect, take down, review, and report CSAM to the applicable authorities (including NCMEC in the United States), we partnered with an established non-profit vendor who provides both hash matching APIs and specialist web apps for review and reporting. While any instance of this behavior is dangerous and warrants prompt action, to date we have thankfully not yet encountered a significant volume of such content in the network. However, our systems proactively identified four instances of potential CSAM, of which two were statistical false-positives, and two were confirmed to meet reporting requirements and were reported to NCMEC.</p>
<p>For this report, we are not yet including counts of legal requests and the fraction of requests serviced, nor are all of our moderation actions (such as labels) fully represented in the numbers we’ve shared here. We look forward to providing more granular data and reporting in the future. Given the transparent nature of the network, independent researchers also already have direct access to relatively rich data on labeling and moderation interventions.</p>
 Interaction Controls 
<p>No amount of reactive moderation will help if the base design of a product rewards abuse or inflames inter-community conflict. In 2023, we added a number of app and protocol features that give individuals and groups more control over their interactions in the network, with the aim of building safety options into the design of Bluesky itself.</p>
<p>Moderation lists can be used for muting and blocking. Individuals can maintain curated lists of accounts for an entire community, reducing duplicated efforts. Lists themselves are always public, and the behaviors of lists match the privacy of individual-level actions: blocking a list is public, while muting a list is private. Like all technical safety features, lists have both advantages and disadvantages as a moderation primitive. They can be a vector for harassment and abuse (and thus themselves require moderation), become difficult to maintain at larger scale, and have no built-in affordances for collaborative control or accountability. On the other hand, they are relatively familiar and easy to understand, have a low barrier to adoption, and integrate easily with everyday use of the app.</p>
<p>Self-labeling of individual posts lets authors ensure appropriate content warnings are in place for viewers. This feature is currently limited to posts with visual images and adult content, but there is a clear path to expanding the scope to more labels.</p>

  
  
    The self-labeling feature.

<p>Reply controls give authors choice over who can interact in their threads, including the ability to close all replies to a post.</p>

  
  
  
      The reply controls feature.

<p>There are several more basic interaction controls in development or on the horizon. The ability to hide individual posts and to appeal labeling decisions on your own posts are both available now as beta-quality features. We are also tracking requests for the ability to mute keywords, and for users to be able to temporarily deactivate their own account. We’ll share more about these planned features in the coming months.</p>
 Supporting Tools and Infrastructure 
<p>Trust and safety efforts rely on tooling — and a lot of our work has been building the supporting tooling and infrastructure for this work from scratch. We’ve made a lot of progress in 2023 behind the scenes to support our moderation teams and policies.</p>
<p>Our moderation review tools have gone through major refactors and workflow improvements over the year, based on feedback from our moderators and policy experts. What started as a minimal admin interface can now handle tiered review queues, templated email workflows, moderation event timelines, and more. From a technical perspective, the APIs driving this system, both reporting and review, are defined the same way as other atproto endpoints, which supports interoperability with other alternative clients and workflow systems. We named the front-end interface of the moderation review system Ozone, and we plan to open-source it soon. We’re also in the process of pulling out the moderation back-end as a standalone service that other organizations can self-host.</p>

Screenshot of the Ozone web interface, from a development environment.
<p>Lastly, we have developed a rule-based automod framework to augment our moderation team when battling spam, and to proactively flag unacceptable content before it gets seen and reported by human users. This has helped identify some patterns of engagement farming and spam, and we will continue to develop and refine abuse detectors as we move towards open federation and growing the network.</p>

 Proactive Cyber Security needs TDIR 
 
<p>Organizations and society in general have become more and more dependent on IT delivered services.&nbsp; This has increased the potential impact of risks from cyber-attacks.&nbsp; Cybersecurity needs to meet this challenge by moving beyond the traditional approach of protection, detection, and response.</p>
 Limit Attacker Free Time 
 
<p>The old model of a risk arising from a largely static threat exploiting a known vulnerability to cause damage is no longer adequate for today’s cyber environment.&nbsp; The cyber “<a href="http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/corporate/documents/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf">Kill Chain</a>” explains how threat actors are active within the cyber infrastructure well before a vulnerability is exploited.&nbsp; Therefore, it is not sufficient simply to remove known vulnerabilities - it is essential to detect cyber threat activity prior to the attack to actively prevent this from succeeding.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1: TDIR to Limit Attacker Free Time</p>
<p>The level of risk from cyber-attacks such as ransomware is now so high that it is a question of when not if a cyber-attack on your organization’s business critical cyber infrastructure will succeed.&nbsp; However, while most organizations have invested heavily in cyber prevention, surveys reveal that they are less well prepared to recover from a cyber-attack.</p>
<p>Authorities around the world have recognized these challenges and are imposing stricter requirements on organizations that their populations rely on for a wide range of essential services, which includes a wide and growing number of private companies that should be preparing now to meet their new obligations.</p>
<p>Notably the EU issued the&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/1148/oj">Network and Information Systems (NIS) Directive in 2016</a>&nbsp;and the US saw the introduction of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">Executive Order 14028</a>&nbsp;on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity in 2021. But European authorities are now seeking to go even further with an update to the NIS Directive, known as NIS2, which is expected to go into force by the second half of 2024.</p>
<p>Unlike its predecessor, NIS2 has a much wider scope, going beyond the traditional critical national infrastructure providers to include a range of organizations that are essential for the normal functioning of society, which include both EU and non-EU organizations that will have to ensure their compliance in future.</p>
 Threat Detection and Incident Response 
<p>All these factors taken together have led to a growing market in Threat detection and Incident Response tools and services.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/wp80959/getting-ahead-of-the-cybercriminals-understanding-the-external-threat-landscape">Threat intelligence</a> – the threat actors reuse and repurpose the techniques, tools, and processes (TTPs) that they use. This makes it vital that where these are identified, this information can be securely shared amongst potential victim organizations. This information Information about threats, TTPs, and devices that adversaries employ; the systems and information that they target; and any other threat-related information that provides greater situational awareness.</p>
<p>Organizations should join the cyber threat intelligence networks relevant to their industry and location. They should also make sure that their cyber-security teams or service providers receive and share cyber threat intelligence from trusted suppliers.</p>
<p>Threat Detection – there is <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an80845/architecting-your-soc-to-defend-against-today-s-attack-vectors">a wide range of tools</a> that are intended to help to detect abnormal activity within and around the organizational systems. These include Security Event Information Monitoring (SIEM), Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR), Endpoint Protection Detection &amp; Response (EPDR), Network Detection and Response (NDR), and Extended Detection and Response (XDR).&nbsp; In general, these tools ingest the vast amount of data logged by the various sensors around the IT infrastructure and provide capabilities to filter and analyze this data to detect anomalies.&nbsp; The challenges are the sheer volume of data and avoiding false positive overload.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations should implement or outsource these activities in a way that is integrated with relevant threat intelligence.&nbsp; Look for the application of Machine Learning (ML) / Artificial Intelligence (AI) based approaches to improve the detection of actual threats. Look for integration with attack path analysis and to help to prioritize the actions needed on threats detected.</p>
<p>Attack Surface Management – business applications and the cyber infrastructure upon which they depend will contain vulnerabilities or weaknesses that could be exploited by cyber adversaries.&nbsp; Many of these will already be known and documented as Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) for which there are patches or workarounds to remove them. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc81218/attack-surface-management">Attack Surface Management tools</a> help organizations to find these vulnerabilities and together with attack path analysis tools to prioritize and close them.</p>
<p>Organizations should implement a continuous vulnerability detection and assessment process to remove known vulnerabilities. They should subscribe to and act on feeds providing newly discovered vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Data Resilience – <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/data-resilience-is-key">data is the most important asset of the modern organization</a>, and it needs to be protected against ransomware as well as loss. Cyber adversaries use various techniques to infiltrate an organization’s IT systems and make changes that prevent the organization from accessing their data and using their IT services. Cloud services create challenges and cloud infrastructure is data defined.&nbsp; Organizations can misunderstand the shared responsibility model and believe data protection is the sole responsibility of the cloud provider.&nbsp; In addition, Big Data and massive data lakes held in cloud services create additional data resilience challenges.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80804/cloud-backup-for-ransomware-protection">Backup and Disaster Recovery tools</a> provide important controls that are needed to recover data and restore services following cyber-attacks. Organizations need to implement and regularly these tools as part of their Business Continuity processes.</p>
<p>Incident Response - <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lb80209/responding-to-cyber-incidents">Organizations need a plan for managing incidents</a> and this must be prepared and tested in advance of an incident occurring. When a major incident is suspected there must be a clear process for invoking a major incident response. The key elements of this are having an incident response team who know what their roles are and that can be assembled when needed. A command structure with a clear chain of command and definition of responsibilities. A communications plan to manage communications with all those involved when and incident occurs. Recovery and restoration – the process for removing the vulnerabilities, restoring the affected systems and data, and then safely resuming their normal operation. Notification – the process for meeting your organization’s statutory obligations for notifying regulators and customers about the incident.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/hacked-72-hours-of-a-ciso-nightmare-cre23">Organizations should retest this plan at regular intervals</a>.</p>
 Dynamic Cyber Security 
<p>Cybersecurity spending will never be able to grow as fast as attacks increase. Just trying to defend is not sufficient – organizations must get ahead of the cybercriminals and move beyond current approaches to cybersecurity by understanding the external threat landscape. Cybersecurity needs to keep up with this rapid pace of change by taking their focus beyond the traditional approach of protection, detection, and response, to become proactive.</p>

   The blog post delves further into the complexity of verifiable credentials, addressing the challenges of understanding the landscape. It covers digital credentials, issuance and presentation formats, protocols, data serialization formats, and digital signatures. I emphasize the ongoing evolution and fragmentation in the field, advocating for constructive engagement. The post aims to aid readers in

<p>In writing the <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/01/03/verifiable-credentials-and-mdocs-a-tale-of-two-protocols/">recent blog post</a> on W3C Verifiable Credentials and ISO mdocs, I found a rat’s nest of options and choices that made understanding the landscape ridiculously challenging. When talking about verifiable credentials, you’re actually talking about a collection of format and protocol specifications that sometimes overlap. In order to understand the space, I needed to sort out several points:</p>



 
 What is a digital credential? 



 What is the difference between a format and a protocol? 



 What are the formats and protocols that are most relevant when talking about verifiable credentials? 



 How does someone decide what technology to pursue, and where do they find out more? 
 



<p>Because of the competing use cases, siloed focus, and general market politics, some of the concepts below are more of a continuum than clear distinctions from one area to the next. And that is part of why the space is so confusing. As there is no single<a href="https://dictionary.reverso.net/english-cobuild/arbiter+of+good+taste"> arbiter of good taste</a> when it comes to how the Internet functions, all this confusion only gets sorted out through years of discussion, debate, testing, adoption, and evolution.</p>



 Digital Credentials 



<blockquote>
<p>A digital credential conveys data that is an authentic representation of information held in a registry at the time of issuance.</p>
Andrew Hughes and Dr. Torsten Lodderstedt</blockquote>



<p>To understand everything else in the world of verifiable credentials, first, you need to know what a digital credential is. Andrew Hughes and Dr. Torsten Lodderstedt described it in their <a href="https://pages.scmagazine.com/rs/188-UNZ-660/images/Identiverse%202023%20-%20Verifiable%20Digital%20Credentials%20Comparison%20and%20Analysis%20of%20Emerging%20Issuance%20Protocol%20Standards%20-%206.01.pdf">Identiverse 2023 presentation</a>: “A digital credential conveys data that is an authentic representation of information held in a registry at the time of issuance.” So many important words there! My translation is that a digital credential is a collection of information about a person or thing (in more generic terms, a subject) that has been packaged based on what was in a particular repository at a single point in time. How trustworthy the data is, how secure it is against tampering, all that is actually out of scope for what it is. A digital credential is the keystone to building an ecosystem; it isn’t all that interesting until we figure out how to use it.</p>



 Credential Issuance Formats and Protocols 



<blockquote>
<p>A format is a the structure of the data.</p>



<p>A protocol is how you move that data around.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you have a digital credential in a format, but you haven’t issued it to the entity that needs it, what good is it? This is where issuance formats and protocols start making verifiable credentials usable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking to the W3C’s specifications, issuance and presentation formats are all contained within the W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model, described in more detail later in this post.</p>



<p><a href="https://openid.github.io/OpenID4VCI/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-wg-draft.html">OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance</a> (OpenID4VCI, which is barely shorter than the name of the specification), is an issuance protocol. This issuance format can be used with just about any issuance format. ISO’s mdoc, W3C’s Verifiable Credentials, it’s open to most everything. The purpose of the protocol is to make sure that the credentials are transported in a standardized way. OpenID4VCI is still in draft, so it is something of a moving target for anyone not deeply embedded in the space already.</p>



<p>But OpenID4VCI isn’t the only issuance protocol under development. The&nbsp; ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 17 committee is working on <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/86783.html">23220-3</a> – Cards and security devices for personal identification – Building blocks for identity management via mobile devices – Part 3: Protocols and services for issuing phase. My expectation is that this work will align more closely with the mdoc/mDL work and its more restricted underlying assumptions, but I am not closely tied to the ISO efforts.</p>



<p>If you want to truly dig into the rabbit hole of comparing credential formats, the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X93ptJcmfX1NZEo5E7ElnqJ-knDS4Dj6JOYSJ_2PsUw/edit#gid=1084392809">Credential Format Matrix</a> is the place to start.</p>



 Credential Presentation Formats and Protocols 



<p>Now we have the concept of a digital credential, it’s been issued, and we want to use it. That means putting it in a machine-readable format to present to something else and defining the protocols to use to get it there. There are a variety of requirements and constraints that influence what that format needs to be for any given use case.&nbsp;</p>



 W3C Verifiable Credential Data Model 



<p>The W3C wants to create credential issuance and presentation formats for the web. The use cases this model supports are intended to allow for All The Things. From uber-secure data like government-issued credentials to meh-secure data like movie tickets, the W3C Verifiable Credential specification “provides a standard way to express <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#dfn-credential">credentials</a> on the Web in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy respecting, and machine-verifiable.” They came out with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">official version</a> of their data model in 2022. However, specifications of this level of complexity rarely survive contact with reality. And so, people within the W3C are working on a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/">new version</a> that will include breaking changes from the first version.</p>



<p>My “ahHA” moment when researching this came from a conversation with <a href="https://self-issued.info/">Mike Jones</a> when I asked if the W3C Verifiable Credential Data Model was a credential presentation format or credential issuance format. He said, “The issuance format is called a Verifiable Credential.&nbsp; The presentation format is called a Verifiable Presentation.”</p>



<p>The format for a W3C Verifiable Presentation credential consists of three major parts: the metadata about the credential (e.g., who issued it, when it was issued, etc.), the claims that make up the credential (the details of the entity being described), and one or more proofs (see ‘digital signatures’ below).</p>



 Selective Disclosure JSON Web Token-based Verifiable Credentials (SD-JWT VC) 



<p>According to the IETF Internet-Draft abstract, the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc/">SD-JWT VC draft specification</a> “describes data formats as well as validation and processing rules to express Verifiable Credentials with JSON payloads based on the Selective Disclosure for JWTs (SD-JWT) format.”</p>



<p>A few things make SD-JWT VC’s format different from the W3C’s Verifiable Credential format. First and foremost is its <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc-01.html#section-1.2-6">explicit mention</a> that it does not use the W3C’s data format in v1, v1.1, or the draft v2. While both are general-purpose credential formats, the W3C requires the use of JSON-LD (described below in the section on data serialization). The SD-JWT VCs, on the other hand, focus on regular JSON payloads and the SD-JWT format. Some people find the restriction of JSON-LD too much to bear, which makes the SD-JWT VC format a more appropriate option for them.</p>



 ISO mdoc 



<p>As <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@aniltj/111692855215449887">Anil John</a> noted in a Mastodon thread, “The starting point for the W3C VC work and the ISO mDL work were radically different; the mDL work was directly focused on in-person use cases while the W3C work was focused on remote/online use cases. Both are trying to address the other at present, but the starting point has influenced the design choices that are inherent in both standards.” mdoc uses the Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL), a language that can be used either the CBOR or JSON data serialization formats. mdoc is standardized in ISO/IEC’s 18013-5, a specification on the in-person presentation of mobile driving licenses (mDL). There is a very readable description of mdocs and mDLs in ENISA’s <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/digital-identity-standards/@@download/fullReport">Digital Identity Standards</a> write-up from July 2023.</p>



<p>While this format can be used for other digital credentials, its standardization in the mDL specification results in people (like me) conflating mdoc and mDL regularly. It’s hard to pinpoint <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/download/attachments/17167105/20211005_ISO_IEC_18013_5_INTRO_W3C_CCG.pdf?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1633559852634&amp;api=v2">when standardization started</a> for mdoc; probably the best one to point to is 2014, when ISO/IEC kicked off the task force, resulting in ISO publishing 18013-5 in 2021. There is still plenty of work to do, particularly around how you’d take this credential presentation format and use it in a remote (rather than in-person) setting. That’s being covered in ISO/IEC 18013-7, still a work in progress.</p>



 Data Serialization Formats 



<p>You have a digital credential. You understand the choices you must make to decide what format it needs to be in. Now, you need the best way to transmit it to the thing that will consume it. That’s where data serialization formats come in. In the digital credential space, there are a handful that most people talk about.</p>



<p>If we’re talking more about tiny devices and digital credentials about things, then using something that focuses on keeping the format really, really efficient is critical. That’s something that the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8152/">Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)</a> exists for. If that level of efficiency isn’t necessary and more features are required, then <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7165/">JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)</a> is probably better. Whether you find <a href="https://json.nlohmann.me/features/binary_formats/cbor/">one better than the other</a>, from an outside but still geeky perspective, is like arguing between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war">emacs and vi</a>. If you’d like something more structured and optimized for an environment where the data pieces are related to each other (for example, all parts of a single schema), then <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/">JSON for Linked Data (JSON-LD)</a> is a great choice. Complicated, or so I’m told, but great.</p>



<p>But wait, there’s more! Continuing with the JSON theme, work is underway within the IETF that focuses on the selective disclosure (rather than all-or-nothing disclosure) of data in a JSON structure. That’s the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/">Selective Disclosure for JSON Web Tokens </a>(SD-JWT) draft. If you’re more interested in work being developed within the European Union, the European Commission’s European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) project’s <a href="https://code.europa.eu/ebsi/ecosystem/-/blob/3f2d4283e5756c2cb0fe51119e00e496755dd0d9/drafts/sd-jws.md">EBSI Improvement Proposal (EBIP) on selective disclosure</a> might be a fit, even though it refers back to SD-JWT.</p>



<p>As individuals focus on their core use cases and the best formats to support them, they will drift apart in terms of the functionality supported and the terminology used. That, in turn, creates complications for people and organizations that need to support more than one use case that brings in more than one credential presentation format. Every additional format involves support overhead to maintain it. Wouldn’t it be better if we just … picked one?</p>



 Digital Signatures + Credentials 



<p>Now, let’s consider the security of all this. Looking at the fundamentals of security, confidentiality, integrity, and availability, what is the best way to secure the presentation and transmission of a digital credential? That’s where digital signatures come in. TechTarget has an excellent article explaining digital signatures. The tl;dr of it is that digital signatures are a way to cryptographically secure one or more pieces of data such that someone (or something) can look at it later and say, “Yep, that was signed and sent by who I expected and hasn’t been changed since it was sent.”</p>



<p>That’s important information, but now there are choices to make. What exactly should be signed when it comes to digital credentials? Do you include the signature in what you’re presenting so it’s a core part of the credential, or do you put a wrapper around it like an envelope? Or both? The answer to that is, as with so many things, it depends. Do you expect all the devices to be able to handle this kind of cryptography on the fly, possibly without access to the Internet? Are the devices powerful enough to handle all the math?</p>



<p>Taking this down a slightly different dependency path, depending on what data serialization format you’re using, you’ll have another set of specifications to learn about that tells you how to sign, encrypt, and decrypt the different possible formats.</p>



<p>The IETF created the JSON-based building blocks of JSON Web Token (JWT), JSON Web Signature (JWS), JSON Web Encryption (JWE), JSON Web Key (JWK), and JSON Web Algorithms (JWA). <a href="https://www.loginradius.com/blog/engineering/guest-post/what-are-jwt-jws-jwe-jwk-jwa/">LoginRadius</a> has a great article describing each of these and, at a high level, how they fit together.</p>



<p>Similarly, the IETF is working on similar building blocks based on CBOR, including the CBOR Web Token (CWT) rather than JSON. For those organizations more committed to a CBOR-based model, the COSE working group is where to learn more.</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>So much of this work is either still in draft or very early deployment. That means it is all subject to change. The descriptions of the technologies above may be lacking in several ways. My hope is that this post will help you understand where the debates are happening and the work is still in progress. If you think any of these efforts are going in the wrong direction, please engage in the conversation rather than creating Yet Another specification effort. The fragmentation in the space is not helping move this work forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is probably the least SEO-friendly post I’ve written in ages! Thanks for getting through it, and I hope it was as helpful to you as it is to me in understanding how all these parts are supposed to fit together. I encourage those more deeply involved in specification writing than I am to offer their feedback, either agreement or correction, in the post comments! It will help me learn and possibly help others as well.</p>

<p>It’s the start of another year and as I’m preparing for our annual sales kick off event it’s a great time to reflect on 2023 and look forward to where we are going in 2024.</p>
<p>Globally, I think it’s safe to say that 2023 was not the year that was hoped for, knock on effects from the war in Ukraine have seen inflation and interest rates rise. Beyond that we’ve seen large reductions in force across the IT sector as organisations correct their hypergrowth bets. Given all that as the backdrop we’ve had a great year in 2023, our growth continues on the same trajectory currently sitting at &gt;6x in 5 years, that certainly helps to keep our shareholders happy. &nbsp;Our profits continue to rise allowing us to power more growth in 2024.</p>
 The Organisation Identity Landscape 
<p>We’ve seen some disruption in the organisation identity landscape this year with the exit of GMEI as an accredited Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) Issuer. This has settled down reasonably quickly and we’ve been quick to assist our customers in the consolidation of their LEI portfolios, simplifying their management and providing a more cost effective solution.</p>
<p>We have also maintained our position as number 1 in LEI Issuance and in December ‘23 we issued 28% of all new LEIs. This is a great testament to the team we have and the ‘platform’ they have created, which allows us to give best value to our LEI partners and customers.</p>
 Combining Organisation Identity &amp; Individual Identity 
<p>While we continue our mission to champion organisation identity as described by our shared vision for the future of digital identity:</p>
<blockquote><p>Combining highly assured organisation identity with strongly authenticated individual identity to show who you are, who you represent and the rights you have when representing them.</p></blockquote>
<p>As I explored in my last blog, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/general/the-value-of-identity-context/" title="The Value of Identity Context">The Value of Identity Context</a>, identity is contextual and it is critical to understand that context in a dynamic, fine-grained manner to ensure security, privacy accountability. It was great to see Gartner starting to embrace organisation identity as a discrete identity class at the 2023 IAM summit in London. We will continue discussing this important topic at the upcoming Gartner 2024 IAM summit, where we will be joined on stage by the Global LEI Foundation (GLEIF).</p>
<p>Our development team launched many new features into the IAM platform, both the on-premise and cloud deployments, throughout 2023. As a result we have seen a number of great successes and the growth of our existing customers. It’s a privilege to be working with them as they transition from national to international players in their respective areas. The continuing benefit and the globalisation assistance that is afforded by digital identity is clear to see.</p>
 The growing importance of Verifiable Credentials 
<p>2023 has seen an increasing awareness of the need to verify identity statements and correspondingly the increasing maturity of verifiable credentials is providing a framework to that end. We’ve seen this in our involvement in both EU Digital Identity (EUDI) and GLEIF verifiable LEI projects. vLEI especially, although early stage, is showing great potential with some significant interest from large regulators. We are seeing wider recognition of the underlying technology layer, a maturing of that layer and an increasing eco-system of supporting tooling and technology. I’d like to think we have played our part in this as we progress towards becoming a Qualified vLEI Issuer in 2024. The requirement on legal entities of having and being able to present a verifiable organisation identity will be a growing requirement by business and regulators.</p>
 Looking forward 
<p>Like everyone else, we are hopeful that the macro-economic situation will improve during 2024, we’ll know that when we see the interest rates start to drop, fingers crossed for H2-24. In the meantime, we will charge on regardless, growing our LEI footprint, becoming a qualified vLEI Issuer delivering the next evolution required to progress towards a universal implementation of our vision for the future of digital identity.</p>
<p>As we all look to increase security, reduce fraud, and simplify business interactions, having the correct rights for the context you are in, driven by the organisation you are representing will become a fundamental requirement.</p>

  The FATF Travel Rule has been active in the US since&nbsp;2013.  The minimum threshold at which the Crypto Travel Rule comes into force in the US is&nbsp;$3000.  To comply with the FATF Travel Rule, US VASPs must verify and share customer identities, ensuring compliance with AML and CFT standards.  <p>About <a href="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/crypto-adoption-index-statistics/">33.7 million Americans</a> own cryptocurrencies in the US, whereas the crypto ownership rate in the country is 13%. Another <a href="https://www.security.org/digital-security/cryptocurrency-annual-consumer-report/">study</a> reveals that 40% of American adults now own crypto, up from 30% in&nbsp;2023.</p><p>Even more interesting is the fact that about 63% of current crypto owners want to obtain more crypto, with 21% of non-owners saying the first Bitcoin ETF, which was finally approved in the US on Jan 10, 2024, makes them more likely to invest in cryptocurrency.</p><p>In light of the growing crypto adoption in the country, it is imperative to understand the regulatory aspect, especially the Crypto Travel Rule US. So, let’s get&nbsp;started!</p> Background of the Crypto Regulations &amp; the FATF Travel Rule in the&nbsp;US <p>In the US, there is no formal regulation surrounding crypto as of yet, but they are the focus of both the state and federal governments.</p><p>The Treasury Department treats Bitcoin as a currency while the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) generally treats crypto assets as securities, and the CFTC refers to Bitcoin as a commodity. For federal income tax purposes, crypto is classified as property.</p><p>When it comes to crypto exchanges, they must adhere to the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and have to register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), and comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and terrorist financing (CFT) policies.</p><p>Then, there is the <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule">Crypto Travel Rule</a>, which was introduced in June 2019 by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global financial watchdog. The FATF brought cryptocurrencies under the scope of Recommendations 10 to 21 and, most importantly, Recommendation 16 — the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>It’s not as if the Travel Rule itself was conceptualized in 2019, as it has been in existence for many decades as part of the US Bank Secrecy Act to strengthen financial rules and establish communications between traditional financial institutions and law enforcement across borders. In 2012, the FATF included it as one of its Recommendations, and soon, the rest of the world also adopted the FinCEN Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p> Key Features of the Travel Rule in the&nbsp;US <p>Initially, the FinCEN Travel Rule only applied to banks and required financial institutions to share information about their customers and report any suspicious activities. Then, in June 2019, it was also applied to the crypto industry to prevent illicit activities and ensure compliance with AML policies.</p><p>While the FATF doesn’t clearly explain just how virtual asset service providers (VASPs) should comply with the Travel Rule, the agency does provide general requirements.</p><p>Under the Crypto Travel Rule US, VASPs, including crypto exchanges, OTC traders, hosted wallets, crypto custodial solutions, banks, and other financial bodies, are required to share the identities of their users who are involved in virtual asset transfers exceeding a certain threshold. VASPs must obtain and verify customer identification as well as share it with one&nbsp;another.</p><p>A VASP is defined as a legal person who transfers, exchanges, or stores virtual assets or participates in or provides financial services related to virtual&nbsp;assets.</p><p>The user information that a VASP has to share while processing crypto transactions depends on the transaction value. The Fincen Travel Rule requirements for a value below the $3,000 threshold include:</p>  The name of the sender, i.e., originator, and the recipient, i.e., beneficiary  Both the sender and recipient’s virtual asset wallet address or a unique transaction reference number  <p>If the value of virtual asset transfer exceeds $3,000, VASPs must&nbsp;collect:</p>  Originator’s name, date and place of birth, wallet address, physical address, national identity number, or customer identification number  Beneficiary’s name and wallet&nbsp;address  <p>VASPs must also carry out a counterparty VASP check to confirm that they are dealing with a registered/licensed VASP and that they have sufficient AML/CFT supervision. Moreover, VASPs also have to constantly monitor transactions in order to report any suspicious activity as part of a risk-based approach to AML and&nbsp;CTF.</p><p>VASPs must be licensed and registered in their jurisdiction. Additionally, they are required to screen customer wallets and to share any blacklists with other VASPs and relevant&nbsp;parties.</p> Impact on Cryptocurrency Exchanges and&nbsp;Wallets <p>Through the Crypto Travel Rule, VASPs prevent malicious individuals and entities from using cryptocurrencies for their elaborate money laundering and terrorist financing plans.</p><p>This is achieved by requiring cryptocurrency businesses to collect and share customer information without exposing it to cybersecurity attackers while navigating its varied implementation from country to country. VASPs must also perform due diligence on beneficiary VASPs, maintain records, and report to relevant authorities.</p><p>However, the major challenge with the Crypto Travel Rule is that FATF only provides recommendations, which means it’s up to the member countries to decide whether to implement the rules and how, resulting in varying regulations.</p><p>For example, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/comprehensive-guide-to-crypto-regulations-and-fatf-travel-rule-in-singapore">the United States</a> and Canada have been among the relatively early adopters of the Crypto Travel Rule, while <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-united-kingdom">the United Kingdom</a> only recently put the rule into&nbsp;effect.</p><p>Not only has the enforcement of the Crypto Travel Rule been at varying rates in different jurisdictions, but it is also interpreted differently and requires different information. Also, the threshold for affected transactions is different, with the FATF recommending $1,000, lower than $3,000 in the&nbsp;US.</p> Country <p>Implementation Year — Transaction Threshold</p> United States <p>2013 — $3,000</p> United Kingdom <p>2023 — No minimum threshold. More information is required for transactions over&nbsp;£1,000.</p> Singapore <p>2020 — No minimum threshold. More information is required for transactions over SGD&nbsp;1,500.</p> Japan <p>2023 — ¥100,000</p><p>To address these challenges, it’s crucial for VASPs to adopt a flexible and comprehensive approach, such as a fully automated Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Travel Rule solution like <a href="https://www.shyft.network/veriscope">Veriscope</a>. This solution can adapt to the diverse regulatory requirements of different jurisdictions while ensuring compliance. Veriscope can provide a unified platform that simplifies the process of collecting, verifying, and sharing customer information securely across&nbsp;borders.</p><p>By implementing such technology, VASPs can effectively navigate the complex landscape of international regulations like the FATF Travel Rule, maintain high standards of customer privacy and data security, and ensure compliance with the varying thresholds and requirements set by different countries.</p> Global Context and Comparisons <p>As crypto adoption continues to grow globally, countries around the world have been ramping up their efforts to regulate the&nbsp;sector.</p><p>In 2023, over 40 countries engaged in myriad initiatives to develop crypto-focused regulations and legislation — targeting licensing and listing guidance, stablecoin regulation, Travel Rule compliance, and crypto framework development.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/new-ventures/cryptocurrency-assets/pwc-global-crypto-regulation-report-2023.pdf">a PwC report</a>, the vast majority of jurisdictions are discussing the FATF’s Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>Besides the Travel Rule, regulators are taking a range of approaches to regulate crypto with varying degrees of strictness. Some common approaches adopted include licensing and registration requirements, AML/CTF regulations, consumer protection measures, and determining the appropriate tax treatment.</p><p>In 2023, the US enforced most penalties and took strong legal action against major crypto players, including Binance and Coinbase. This is despite the fact that the country still lacks a comprehensive regulatory framework and has taken the ‘regulation by enforcement’ approach. However, a lot of legislative progress is being made on crypto laws, though there remains a lack of guidance from US regulators.</p><p>This has resulted in a fragmented regulatory landscape in the US, where the SEC regards crypto as securities while the CFTC regulates crypto derivatives, and FinCEN sets the <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">AML</a> and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/what-is-kyc-in-crypto-and-why-do-crypto-exchanges-require-it">KYC</a> requirements for crypto businesses.</p><p>The European Union is all set to apply its unified regulatory framework, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/mica-paving-the-way-from-liability-to-transparency">Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA)</a>, to ensure financial stability, market integrity, and investor protection. The law came into force in June 2023 and is expected to apply by 2024-end.

<p>Businesses are increasingly embracing data-intensive workloads, including high-performance computing, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). These technologies drive innovation on their hybrid, multicloud journeys while focusing on resilience, performance, security and compliance. Companies are also striving to balance this innovation with growing environmental, social and governance (ESG) regulations. For most organizations, IT operations and modernization form a part of their ESG objective, and according to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/5VPNPQG6">a recent Foundry survey</a>, about 60% of organizations seek service providers specializing in green technology areas.</p>



<p>As carbon emissions reporting becomes common worldwide, IBM is committed to assisting its clients in making informed decisions that can help address their energy demands and associated carbon impact while reducing costs. To aid in building more sustainable IT estates, IBM has partnered up with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to facilitate sustainable cloud modernization journeys.</p>



<p>As companies fast-track their IT modernization to accelerate digital transformation and gain business advantage, a significant opportunity emerges. This opportunity involves rearchitecting IT environments and application portfolios toward greener, more sustainable designs. Such an approach not only drives cost efficiencies but also contributes to broader corporate sustainability goals.</p>



 Understanding carbon emissions from digital technology 



<p>All business applications that IBM builds and runs, whether for external or internal customers, come with a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/report/it-sustainability">carbon cost</a>, which is primarily due to electricity consumption. Regardless of the technology that IBM used to develop these applications or services, operating them requires hardware that consumes power.<br>The carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions produced by grid electricity vary based on the generation methods. Fossil fuels such as coal and gas emit significant amounts of carbon, whereas renewable sources such as wind or solar emit negligible amounts. Thus, each kilowatt (kW) of electricity consumed directly contributes to a specific amount of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) released into the atmosphere. </p>



<p>Therefore, reducing electricity consumption directly leads to lower carbon emissions.</p>



 Carbon footprint in practice 



<p>Compute, storage and networking are the essential tech resources that consume energy in the process of building applications and services. Their activity requires active cooling and management of the data center spaces that they operate in. As custodians of sustainable IT practices, we must consider how we can reduce the consumption of resources through our daily activities.</p>



Figure 1: Data centers require electricity to power core IT resources such as compute, storage and networking



<p>Data centers draw power from the grid that supplies their operational region. This power runs various IT equipment such as servers, network switches and storage, which in turn support applications and services for customers. This power also operates ancillary systems such as heating, ventilation and air conditioning or cooling, which are essential for maintaining an environment that keeps the hardware within operational limits.</p>



 A way forward to decarbonization 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/application-modernization">Modernizing applications</a> is becoming pivotal for driving innovation and transforming businesses. IBM Consulting® applies the AWS Well-Architected framework to create a Custom Lens for Sustainability to perform workload assessments for applications both on premises and on AWS Cloud. To read about other key scenarios and entry points of IBM Consulting® Custom Lens for Sustainability, check out the blog post: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/sustainable-app-modernization-using-aws-cloud">Sustainable App Modernization Using AWS Cloud</a>.</p>



<p>In this blog post, we delve into an in-depth analysis to assess, implement recommendations on, and analyze the carbon emission effects of a monolithic application running on AWS through a sustainability lens.</p>



 Green IT Analyzer: A comprehensive IT decarbonization platform 



<p>The Green IT Analyzer platform enables clients to transform their traditional IT into more energy-efficient, sustainable green IT. Serving as a one-stop shop, it measures, reports, creates baselines and provides a unified dashboard view of the carbon footprint across the hybrid cloud environment—including private data centers, public cloud and user devices. The platform can measure the carbon footprint of the IT estate at both a granular and virtual machine (VM) level. It helps identify energy or carbon hotspots to develop an optimization roadmap. The carbon assessment technique that it uses aligns with <a href="https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards/ghg-protocol-revised.pdf">greenhouse gas (GHG)</a> principles for the information and communication technology sector.</p>



Figure 2: Green IT Analyzer platform, an IBM asset available on AWS Cloud



 Location-based methodology 



<p>Understanding the carbon emissions from IT workloads requires familiarity with several key concepts and metrics. Here’s a high-level overview:</p>



Figure 3: Methodology to distribute energy from physical to logical layer



 
 Carbon footprint (CFP): The concept of carbon footprint is central to our analysis. CFP represents the total amount of CO2 and equivalent GHG emissions associated with powering a data center, starting from a baseline measurement of CFP greater than or equal to zero. It’s a crucial metric for gauging the environmental impact of data center operations. 



 Power usage effectiveness (PUE): Another critical metric is power usage effectiveness. PUE measures the energy efficiency of a data center, calculated by dividing total facility energy by the energy consumed by IT equipment. This division yields a ratio that indicates efficiency: a PUE close to 1 (one) signifies high efficiency, while higher values suggest greater energy waste.<br>Formula: PUE = (total facility energy)/(energy consumed by IT equipment) 



 Carbon intensity (CI): Lastly, we consider carbon intensity. CI measures the carbon emissions in grams per kilowatt-hour (g/kWh) of grid power generation that powers the data center. This metric varies based on the energy source. Coal-powered grids can have a CI that is greater than 1,000 g/kWh while grids powered by renewable sources such as wind and solar should have a CI closer to zero. (Solar panels have some embodied CFP but have much less compared to fossil fuels.) 
 



Figure 4: Distribution of energy consumed from electricity grid to physical equipment and then virtualized layer



<p>Let’s consider a major client challenge. Every organization is committed to achieving net-zero emissions, and IT plays a crucial role in achieving the sustainability agenda. This can involve reducing the carbon footprint of the IT estate itself—especially relevant for financial customers with high IT-driven emissions—or creating a sustainable platform that runs on green IT.</p>



<p>Older monolithic applications, typically running on VM-based platforms in either on-prem data centers or public clouds, are a key focus area. A crucial question arises: how can we reduce IT resource consumption from these older monolithic applications, which generally hold 20–30% of the entire IT portfolio? It is more energy-efficient to move from VM-based monolithic applications toward a more energy-efficient, microservice-based architecture running on a container platform. However, it’s essential to evaluate each case individually, as a one-size-fits-all approach is not always effective.</p>



<p>This criteria can be used to select application transformation candidates:</p>



 
 Applications with more than 70%–80% CPU utilization 
 



 
 Applications experiencing seasonal spikes in transactions, such as around Christmas Eve, Diwali and other public holidays 
 



 
 Applications with daily spikes in transactions at specific times, such as airline onboarding in the early morning or night 
 



 
 Some business components within monolithic applications that exhibit usage spikes 
 



 As-is state analysis of monolithic apps 



<p>Consider the example of a simple e-Store application running on AWS in an Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) VM. This application, an e-CART, experiences seasonal workloads and has been rehosted (lift-and-shift) from on premises to an AWS EC2 instance. Monolithic applications like this package all business functions into a single deployable unit.</p>



Figure 5: Monolithic e-CART application architecture&nbsp;



<p>The following table describes the key characteristics of e-Store legacy applications.</p>

<p>The carbon emissions of a workload are directly linked to the consumption of resources such as computing, storage and network, with computing often being the most significant contributor. This varies based on workload characteristics; for instance, in the media or streaming industry, data transmission over the network and storing large unstructured data sets consume considerable energy.</p>



<p>The graph shows the utilization pattern of the CPU when minimal user activity is happening on the monolithic application running in a single EC2 instance.</p>



Figure 6: CPU utilization of VMs with minimum transactions over a period of time



<p>We used the Green IT Analyzer platform to conduct a carbon accounting of the as-is state of the monolithic application, comparing it to the target state of the same application when rearchitected into a microservice architecture running on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/">Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Services (EKS)</a> platform.</p>



 Step 1: Comprehensive carbon footprint analysis of monolithic applications 



<p>First, we focus on examining the current carbon footprint of a monolithic workload under various operating conditions. This provides us with a baseline for identifying areas for improvement.</p>



<p>Let’s calculate the estimated carbon footprint for our monolithic workload when we have minimal user transactions and 45% of CPU utilization:</p>



 
 PUE of US east 1d AZ: 1.2 



 CI: 415.755 grams of CO2/kWh 
 



 A. Estimated carbon calculation when there is no user activity: 



 
 Energy consumed: 9.76 g/W @ 45% utilization 



 Hours of running the same workload: 300 hours 



 Estimated carbon emissions for 300 hours = PUE × CI × energy consumed by workload  



 = [(1.2 × 415.755 × 9.76) × 300] ÷ 1,000 = 1,460.79 grams of CO2e 
 



 B. Estimated carbon emission with concurrent 500 users: 



<p>In a scenario where peak-level transactions were created as per non-functional requirements (NFR) to test the system’s ability to support daily peaks, CPU utilization surged to 80% during concurrent user activity. This situation triggered an auto-scaling rule set to activate at 80% CPU utilization. The rule provisions extra VMs to help ensure that the load on each VM remains below 60%. The load balancer then efficiently distributes the load among both the existing and new VMs.</p>



<p>Due to the auto-scaling of the new EC2 instances, an additional t2.large VM became available, which led to a drop in the average utilization to 40%.</p>



 
 Estimated carbon emissions for this scenario, with both identical VMs running for 300 hours = PUE × CI × energy consumed by workload 



 = {[(1.2 × 415.755 × 9.76) × 300] × 2} ÷ 1,000 = 2,921.59 grams of CO2e 
 



 Step 2: Implementing sustainability recommendations 



<p>This step explores a range of sustainability recommendations and their practical implementation for the monolithic application. We use the Custom Lens assessment for Sustainability to guide these recommendations.</p>



<p>First, we consider decomposing monolithic applications into action-based reactive microservices. This approach is tailored to the application’s seasonal behavior and varying usage patterns, which is particularly useful during peak periods such as festive seasons when traffic surges and a focus on browsing artifacts over backend transactions is observed.</p>



<p>Second, the plan involves reducing energy consumption by scheduling batch processing during idle periods, especially when the data center grid operates on green energy. This approach aims to conserve power by minimizing the duration of long-running transactions.</p>



<p>Finally, the strategy emphasizes the importance of choosing a flexible platform, such as AWS EKS or Red Hat® OpenShift® on AWS (ROSA), that is capable of dynamically scaling resources based on network traffic. Such a platform choice helps ensure optimized resource allocation and is beneficial for hosting the action-based reactive microservices.</p>



<p>In summary, the proposed strategies include microservice decomposition aligned with usage patterns, energy-conscious transaction scheduling, and a flexible platform choice to enhance application efficiency and resource utilization.</p>



<p>The application refactored into microservices is shown in the image:</p>



Figure 7: Monolithic application decomposed into 4 microservices



<p>Now let’s calculate the carbon emission after transforming the monolithic application to microservices-based architecture following sustainable design principles while refactoring the application under the umbrella of sustainable modernization.</p>



 A. Estimated carbon accounting with no or few loads: 



 
 Worker node: 2 × t2.medium 



 Utilization: 10% (when there is no load on the application) 



 Energy consumed: 6 g/W at 5% utilization 



 PUE (1.2) and CI (415.755 grams of CO2/kWh) remain the same because we are continuing to use the same availability zone. 



 Hours: 300 



 Estimated carbon emissions for 300 hours = PUE × CI × energy consumed by workload 



 = [(1.2 × 415.755 × 6) × 300] ÷ 1,000 = 1,796 grams of CO2e 
 



<p>Observations: When there is no load on the system, an application running on a VM is more carbon efficient than microservices running on an EKS cluster.</p>



 B. Estimated carbon accounting during peak load: 



<p>Similar to the load testing of monolithic applications, we onboarded 500 users and triggered concurrent transactions to meet the NFR requirements in the microservices that we built.</p>



 
 Worker node: 2 × t2.medium 



 Increased utilization due to load: 10% to 20% 



 Energy consumed: 7.4 g/W at 20% utilization 



 PUE and CI remain the same. 



 Hours: 300 



 Estimated carbon emissions for 300 hours = PUE × CI × energy consumed by workload 



 = [(1.2 × 415.755 × 7.4) × 300] ÷ 1,000 = 2,215.14 grams of CO2e 
 



<p>Here, autoscaling of pods occurred for UI services, but cart services did not require more resources to scale up. In monolithic applications, scaling up the entire platform is necessary regardless of which business functions or services require more resources, leading to increased utilization of 20%.</p>



<p>Observations: Let’s compare both scenarios.</p>



 
 When the system is idle or has a steady load profile across the clock: When there is almost no load, monolithic applications consume fewer resources and emit nearly 18% less carbon than microservices-based applications hosted in the EKS cluster. 



 When the system is on full load or varying load: When the system is on full load, there is a 24% reduction in CO2 emissions on the Kubernetes platform compared to a VM-based workload. This is due to the use of fewer cores and lower utilization. We can move more workloads in the same cluster and free up more cores from other applications to get more significant benefits. 
 



Figure 8: Carbon emissions pattern of different architectural styles



<p>This scenario is an example of how IBM®&nbsp;Custom Lens assessment for Sustainability on AWS workload helps to design your sustainable modernization path and reduce the total carbon footprint of your IT estate.</p>



 Action guide 



<p>For organizations that value sustainability, responsible computing and green IT are not just vital; they are entirely feasible. IT leaders can achieve these goals by pursuing environmentally friendly activities that encompass IT strategy, operations and platforms.</p>



 
 Greening your IT platforms: Use refactoring to migrate applications to the public cloud. Migrating workloads to the public cloud without optimizing them for this environment can increase operating costs and reduce sustainability. Instead, enhance workloads to be more cloud-native by refactoring applications based on factors such as their lifecycle, update and deployment frequency, and business criticality. 



 Optimizing idle VM capacity and other unused cloud resources: Enable infrastructure-level observability to identify idle VMs across your IT estate. Implement rules-based automation to take corrective actions, such as deleting idle VMs and associated resources that no longer serve business functions. Additionally, optimize VM sizing based on network traffic through auto-scaling. 



 Creating resources when needed: Although cloud resources are elastic, you gain limited efficiency benefits if you deploy workloads to fixed resources that run continuously, regardless of usage. Identify opportunities to provision and delete resources as needed, such as using VM scheduling or elastic features within cloud services. 



 Containerizing workloads: By using a container platform instead of a traditional VM environment, you can reduce annual infrastructure costs by up to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/POANK8YE">75%</a>. Container platforms allow for efficient scheduling of containers across a cluster of VMs based on their resourcing requirements. 



 Modernizing your monolithic applications to microservices-based architecture: Select reactive microservices based on your needs: reactive microservices for event-based invocation to optimize resource utilization, event-driven microservices for asynchronous invocation, or serverless microservices for need-based execution of a single function. 
 



<p>The IBM Consulting Green IT Transformation framework, Custom Lens for Sustainability, and the Green IT Analyzer platform collectively help clients on their decarbonization journey. Both frameworks help assess workloads, identify optimization levers that can lower energy consumption, and create an application modernization roadmap that enables you to achieve your sustainability goals.</p>

Here’s the latest from our development efforts.  SpruceIDSpruce    </a><p>At SpruceID, we’re letting users control their identity and data across the web. Here’s the latest from our development efforts:</p> Product Updates <p>Our development efforts have been primarily focused on building new features for Credible, our credential issuance and lifecycle management platform. We have exciting developments underway for Credible and the associated Reference Wallet, which we will share more on as they get closer to public launch.<br></p> Open-Source Library Updates (SpruceKit) <p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/introducing-sprucekit/">SpruceKit</a> is a collection of libraries that power your application to accept digital credentials from users on their terms, originate trusted information for users, and interact with user data vaults. SpruceKit consists of the following open-source libraries:</p>  Sign-in with Ethereum  Increased the version of various dependencies and allowed newer versions of eth-account, eth-typing and eth-utils (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-py/pull/55?ref=blog.spruceid.com">siwe-py#55</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-go/pull/26?ref=blog.spruceid.com">siwe-go#26</a>)    OpenID and Reference Wallet&nbsp;  Support for Pushed Authorization Request was introduced (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/oid4vci-rs/pull/12?ref=blog.spruceid.com">oid4vci-rs#12</a>)    TreeLDR  The following updates were released:  We've refined and formalized the definition of <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/blob/v0.2/layouts/README.md?ref=blog.spruceid.com">TreeLDR's layouts</a>, simplifying their definition and how developers can interact with them.  We are working on the <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/tree/v0.2/layouts/book?ref=blog.spruceid.com">layout book</a>, containing an overview and formal specification of TreeLDR's layouts.  We've extracted the RDF handling part of TreeLDR's layout compiler into a separate project, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/inferdf-rs?ref=blog.spruceid.com">InfeRDF</a>. This "RDF engine" is dedicated to the inference and interpretation of RDF datasets so TreeLDR can entirely focus on its main feature: the layouts.      <p>This update introduces a lot of breaking changes for the better. We are still working on reintroducing previous TreeLDR features: the DSL and generators. The Rust code generator will be the <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/162?ref=blog.spruceid.com">first reintroduced</a>.</p><p></p> <p></p><p>About SpruceID: SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

				  It’s only a matter of time before generative AI renders current methods of identity verification for financial transactions useless.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>As the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/increasing_threats_of_deepfake_identities_0.pdf">paper</a>, “Increasing Threat of DeepFake Identities,” published by United States Homeland Security put it:</p>
<p>[People have a] “natural inclination to believe what they see, and as a result deepfakes and synthetic media do not need to be particularly advanced or believable in order to be effective in spreading mis/disinformation.”</p>
<p>This paper was written two years before the long, 2023 reveal of exponential advances in commercially available generative AI technologies. The ability to deepfake reality is now spectacularly believable and the tools to do so are all easily available.</p>
<p>While the problem space for deepfakes in 2021 was the threat of political malfeasance and misrepresentation—how you could make a politician, expert or celebrity say something prejudicial or wrong—now, that space has metastasized to incorporate the daily business of “knowing your customer” —&nbsp;aka KYC.</p>
<p>KYC is critical to trust in digital banking and finance. Selfies and liveness checks using facial biometrics are used to onboard customers remotely for accounts, approvals, and transactions without the customer having to show up in person to be verified.</p>
<p>But, as TechCrunch’s Kyle Wiggers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/08/gen-ai-could-make-kyc-effectively-useless/?guccounter=2">recently noted</a>, an attacker using generative AI “could download a selfie of a person, edit it with generative AI tools and use the manipulated ID image to pass a KYC test.”</p>
<p>While Wiggers points out that it hasn’t happened yet (but to the best of his knowledge—right?), the article details emerging capacities that threaten to disrupt an entire layer of advanced identity and data verification tools based on images, facial biometrics, voice, and video.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://medium.com/@harishhacker3010/bypassing-kyc-using-deepfake-e11f0722c722">a recent post</a> on Medium, security researcher and masters student Harish SG claims to&nbsp; bypassed “multiple liveness detection and deepfake detection APIs used in several applications.”</p>
<p>At best, innovation in AI will create an arms race, with the advantage seesawing between fraud and fraud detection.</p>
<p>If images, liveness, and voice checks can all be faked with easily available tools and the right digital skill set, the impact on business, government, and social trust is potentially vast. Consider how reliant the IRS is on ID.me performing liveness checks on U.S. taxpayers. How long will it be before we see a generative AI, KYC-related scandal that will make global headlines? Given the innovation we’ve seen in 2023, it is reasonable to think in terms of months rather than years.</p>
<p>Decentralized identity, verifiable credentials, and KYC</p>
<p>The capacity to deepfake a liveness check completely disrupts any verification process dependent on a liveness check. One of the weakest targets is remote KYC, which will&nbsp; send customer account creation back to the pre-internet era.</p>
<p>But there is a simple fix: portable, reusable KYC — a simple, unfakeable way to prove you are who you say you are over and over again. Relying on math rather than imagery, this KYC&nbsp; can be easily shared with, and verified by, any organization that needs to know that you are who you say you are. In short, a KYC credential.¹</p>
<p>A trusted, local organization such as a bank would undertake an in-person liveness check (or a full KYC) and then issue a verifiable credential to that person attesting to having verified their identity. This credential is unique to the person and can be thought of as a container for&nbsp; holding any kind of data, including biometric data. The person can’t add to or change the data in the container without breaking the container. The container is linked to the organization that created it, and this link cannot be altered due to the use of cryptographic keys. Anyone with the right software is able to verify the origin and integrity of the container.</p>
<p>When the person needs to do KYC remotely, the organization contacted can verify that the container came from the issuing organization before interacting, and they can verify the information hasn’t been altered.</p>
<p>Of course, a local bank or financial institution can also do a full KYC on their customers and issue “full” KYC credentials with all the relevant data needed for interaction with other businesses or organizations. In addition to mitigating fraud, this also saves institutions and organizations from having to do complex KYC over and over again.</p>
<p>In both cases, device binding and biometric checks bind the credential to the person’s mobile device and wallet software, preventing misuse by others, and the verifiable credential could then be used, anywhere, and in conjunction with further liveness checks to facilitate remote KYC.</p>
<p>The result is seamless identity verification and immediately actionable data. A customer can simply and quickly prove that they are who they are and wherever they are. And they get privacy-preserving features and the capacity to provide the continuous verification needed by zero trust approaches to security².</p>
<p>The inevitable threat of generative AI can only be met by adding verifiable credentials. But the good news is that verifiable credential technology is easy and quick to add to existing systems. Indicio provides a complete, award-winning solution — Indicio Proven® — including a <a href="https://indicio.tech/know-your-customer/">KYC credential</a>.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials will also be essential to releasing the full value from using AI agents to simplify and manage interactions and transactions involving analysis of personal data and integrated payments. For more on this, see our position paper, <a href="https://indicio.tech/library/ai-position-paper/">A Trusted Copilot</a>, on using decentralized identity to manage an AI virtual assistant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 1) Verifiable credentials are a form of decentralized identity. They enable you to verify the source of any data (using decentralized identifiers) and whether it has been tampered with (digital signatures) without having to check in with the source of the data or check in with a third-party identity provider. 
 2) For a more expansive explanation, see our <a href="https://indicio.tech/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/A-beginners-guide-to-decentralized-identity-July-25-2023.pdf">Beginner’s Guide to Decentralized Identity</a>.

Generated by Microsoft Bing<p>The Tenth of January saw a landmark for the crypto industry, with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving 11 US-listed exchange-traded funds (ETF) that track Bitcoin. While the SEC appears to have been rather grudging about this, primly pointing out that they remained skeptical about cryptocurrencies, it nonetheless represents a major step forward for crypto and is a sign of a maturing ecosystem, which Mattereum can only&nbsp;welcome.</p><p>So, why is this so important? Well, for a start, it is the first time in ages that the SEC has done anything remotely positive towards crypto, but more than that, it represents a further step into the financial mainstream for cryptocurrency. <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a> is based on the belief that there is more to the blockchain than an opportunity for grift, hype, bubbles and get-rich-quick scams; that the underlying infrastructure is sound and has huge potential for being the basis for international trade in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>The ETF ruling is important because what an ETF does is allow people to invest in assets or groups of assets without having to directly purchase the assets themselves. For Bitcoin, what this means is that instead of needing to have your own digital wallet, or an account on a crypto trading platform you can invest in an ETF based on Bitcoin, run by an investment fund. This immediately widens the market to people who like the potential returns of Bitcoin investment, but who have been put off so far by either the technical requirements of buying Bitcoin themselves, or the appalling reputation for instability and outright fraud that crypto exchanges have earned. ETFs mean that people can now invest in crypto through established fund managers like Fidelity and BlackRock, plus funds can easily trade ETFs on stock exchanges, which has not been possible for crypto&nbsp;before.</p><p>While this is great, investment analysts are voicing concern about crypto ETFs. They believe these could put too much risk and volatility into Americans’ retirement accounts, given that the price of bitcoin is prone to wild fluctuations, often without warning and for reasons that are not immediately clear. Yiannis Giokas, senior director of Moody’s Analytics has been quoted as saying “The notorious price volatility of bitcoin&nbsp;… could expose mainstream investors to a less familiar spectrum of investment risks”. This is a weakness of pure crypto as an investment vehicle, but fortunately there are other options on the&nbsp;horizon.</p><p>It has been clear for some time that the mature use case for the blockchain is for trading real world assets (RWA), not for running a limited currency. Bitcoin chose <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/be-realistic-demand-the-incorruptible-fa15d6401b0e">not to evolve</a> into a system that could run smart contracts, so Ethereum (ETH) was developed to meet that need. On ETH and similar chains it is possible to tokenize and fractionize RWAs and trade them on chain. While Bitcoin ETF are definitely a step forward, they are a relatively small one in the grander scheme of things, it is on chain RWA that have the greatest potential for the future. Starting with high value assets like gold and real estate, tokenization increases liquidity and hugely simplifies what are currently complex and lengthy transactions, which will open the market in such things to far more people than the relatively niche Bitcoin ETF will. RWA have the potential to hugely smooth and accelerate international trade, which will have a far greater impact in the long term. Ultimately, I would suggest, it is investment in RWA and in tokens issued by key RWA players that will have the biggest effect over time. It is good to see Bitcoin ETF bringing crypto into the mainstream, but it will be the RWA that follow that enable the blockchain to revolutionise business going&nbsp;forward.</p><p>Mattereum has worked hard and invested millions in developing unique and innovative lawtech solutions to make that possible. The <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/at-the-turning-point-how-crypto-interacts-with-real-world-assets-b4bf3c4b217c">Perez Cycle</a> maps the development of new technologies, and shows that they go through a period of rapid growth driven by hype and often disreputable actors that creates a bubble, and when this bursts, the technology goes through a period of being seen as radioactively disreputable before any underlying functionality is adopted by mature users and put to work for successful, unflashy, purposes that finally generate real value. We have seen the blockchain go through hype, boom and bust and the ETF approval is one of the first major signs that we are now moving into the next phase, where we see it being taken up by more sober users and taking its place in the financial mainstream. Mattereum sees itself as one of those&nbsp;users.</p><p>To this end, <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a>’s innovations are specifically designed to reinforce the value of RWAs by providing the missing link in the system — a means to legally tie the on-chain token representing the RWA to the physical asset itself, so that ownership can be defended in court in 172 jurisdictions worldwide. With this, almost any asset, physical or virtual, can be traded on chain, with both parties secure in the knowledge that ownership is clear and uncontestable. This is the revolution that is coming, and Bitcoin’s new-found respectability is paving the&nbsp;way.</p><p>The Bitcoin ETH ruling is great — but it is just a taste of what is to come with&nbsp;RWA.</p><p>The Bitcoin ETF takes crypto assets and dresses them in the clothes of tradfi financial assets: shares in a fund, where the fund owns a bunch of bitcoin. The fund shares then trade on an exchange: it’s literally an Exchange Traded&nbsp;Fund.</p><p>But in the reverse direction, Mattereum will take real world assets like gold bars and apartments — tradfi assets if you will — and dresses them in the clothes of defi financial assets: NFTs and ERC20 fractional ownership tokens.</p><p>This two way traffic between the tradfi and defi world can only benefit both worlds. Defi needs the sheer volume of the real world assets. Tradfi desperately needs transparency, openness, efficiency, and above all innovation, to better finance the world’s need for goods and services.</p><p>As defi and tradfi learn how to work together we can build a new system with the best features of&nbsp;both.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-bitcoin-etf-ruling-opens-the-doors-for-the-mainstream-blockchain-667a3d5bd403">THE BITCOIN ETF RULING OPENS THE DOORS FOR THE MAINSTREAM BLOCKCHAIN</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>While digital transformation has been a trend for some years, emerging technologies have made this movement even more important. Companies are rethinking their business models to become more digital and competitive. They face an ever-increasing cadre of startups and established organizations, all of whom are also trying to keep up to date on digital transformation trends to achieve a competitive edge.</p>



<p>Digital transformations also enable organizations to pause and identify which strategic approaches are worthwhile in today’s environment and where they should direct their energies. For instance, organizations that are struggling to build their own IT services can assess whether some internal legacy tech should be replaced with technologies from software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers.</p>



<p>Digital transformation is an important component of a modern organization’s business operations. But some organizations that have begun digital transformation journeys have struggled to unlock value from it, according to McKinsey. A recent study found that McKinsey <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/rewired-to-outcompete">research shows</a> that organizations that “launched some flavor of digital transformation,” have only experienced a third of the expected revenue benefits on average.</p>



<p>Digital transformations encompass culture and organizations as well as the latest technologies. Chief information officers (CIOs) must work directly with CEOs and other business leaders to align on the cultural changes needed to make a digital transformation successful.</p>



<p>And while no one digital transformation strategy will be like any other, here are some recurring trends that help organizations engage in successful digital transformation initiatives.</p>



 Digital transformation trends that drive a competitive advantage 



 Trend: Artificial intelligence and machine learning 



<p>We’re entering year two of widespread adoption of generative AI tools. As such, organizations are increasingly interested in seeing how they can apply the whole suite of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a> (ML) technologies to improve their business processes. A recent <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/business-trends-2024">IBM Institute for Business Value survey</a> found that three out of four CEOs say competitive advantage depends on who has the most advanced generative AI.</p>



<p>It is increasingly apparent that in the coming years, AI will demonstrate many use cases where it augments human activities and streamline tasks versus eliminating large swaths of the workforce. For example, generative AI as a prompt engine will improve efficiency by dramatically reducing the time humans take to create outlines, come up with ideas and learn important information. It will also create smarter chatbots that can tackle simple questions, which will improve the customer experience while freeing up customer service reps to take on larger-order problems.</p>



<p>Also, machine learning will be an incredibly powerful tool for data-driven organizations looking to take better advantage of their data analytics practices. For example, applied ML will help organizations that depend on the supply chain engage in better decision making, in real time. This will enable them to effectively deal with environmental and market conditions that could slow delivery of raw materials, finished goods, or both. But organizations still need humans to decide what actions to take based on what the ML-analyzed data shows.</p>



 Trend: Automation 



<p>Like AI and ML, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/automation">automation</a> will be a huge driver of human productivity. Organizations undergoing digital transformations are likely to uncover wide swaths of manual work that can and should be automated. For example, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/rpa">robotic process automation (RPA)</a> can automate e-commerce activities such as order processing, inventory management and customer issue resolution.</p>



 Trend: Cloud computing 



<p>Organizations have spent the past few years migrating to the cloud. Whether they use the public cloud, private cloud or multicloud environment, they are removing the onerous step of maintaining their own data centers. cloud service providers use cloud technologies to maintain uptime and security, so organizations can focus on their core businesses.</p>



 Trend: Cybersecurity 



<p>By virtue of moving many services online, organizations are at greater risk of digital attacks. It is likely that an organization’s existing security posture built for legacy systems for a less distributed workforce will struggle in the modern environment. One way organizations are taking cybersecurity head-on is through the adoption of the ‘shift-left’ movement. This approach involves moving cybersecurity considerations to the beginning of the development cycle, embedding them more directly in the code.</p>



<p>Another way organizations are experimenting with advanced security measures is through the blockchain, which can enhance data integrity and secure transactions.</p>



 Trend: Edge computing and the Internet of Things 



<p>More distributed devices will require increased interconnectedness to drive value. The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/internet-of-things">Internet of Things</a> (IoT) enables technologies to connect and communicate with each other. For instance, manufacturers can use IoT in their factories to know when their machines need repairing, known as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-preventive-maintenance">preventive maintenance</a>.<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/edge-computing"> Edge computing</a> makes IoT more efficient and powerful by bringing enterprise applications closer to data sources such as IoT devices or local edge servers.</p>



 Trend: Industry-wide transformations 



<p>Digital transformations affect different industries in unique ways. For instance, hospitals and healthcare providers used the pandemic to rethink their entire practices. They diverted money and resources to establish powerful tele-health services like video conferencing and enhance patient access to health records. But doing so required a significant investment in data protection and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cybersecurity">cybersecurity</a> enhancements as a data breach containing sensitive medical information could be catastrophic. </p>



<p>Financial services providers increased their usage of APIs to be able to tap into greater ecosystems and connect with more partners. And consumer organizations have found ways to extend the customer experience digitally, like when<a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/all-england-lawn-tennis-club-ibm-ix"> Wimbledon</a> created AI-generated spoken commentary on video clips on the Wimbledon app and website.</p>



 Trend: Low-code or no-code 



<p>Digital transformation is completely changing technology development through the advent of more visual coding approaches. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/low-code">Low-code</a> helps the DevOps team by simplifying some aspects of coding and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/low-code">no-code</a> can introduce non-developers into the development process. This approach exemplifies how digital transformation combines technology advancements, like creating visually oriented coding, with cultural changes. This shift makes development more accessible to non-technologists, breaking down silos and encouraging everyone to participate in building products and solutions.</p>



 Trend: Remote work 



<p>The move towards a distributed workforce was already happening before the pandemic. While some companies are ordering workers to return to the office full-time, plenty are opting for hybrid work or fully remote workplaces. As such, they need to rethink their workflows, how they track elements like productivity and attendance, as well as how they implement the digital technologies needed to do their jobs. For example, organizations may need to set up a more robust and powerful virtual private network (VPN) to enable employees to log in and access sensitive documents.</p>



 Make digital transformation trends work for you 



<p>While every digital transformation journey will be different, there are several emerging technologies and organizational approaches that will have an outsized impact on nearly all of them. Conducting a digital transformation takes time and resources and is never truly finished. So, organizations should try to approach them with the latest trends and tools in mind to avoid costly and unnecessary alterations further down the road.</p>



<p>While digital transformations require investment and ultimately change how an organization conducts its business, there are many benefits if done correctly. Those organizations that succeed at digital transformations will stay ahead of the competition, drive better relationships with employees and customers and be better prepared for what may come.</p>



<p>Emerging technology and social forces are creating new customer experiences that result in changing expectations and demands and disrupt business models. IBM Consulting’s professional services for business help organizations navigate an increasingly dynamic, complex and competitive world. We help them align digital transformation with their business strategy to create competitive advantage and a clear focus on business impact.</p>

 Stakers can claim DF71 rewards. DF72 runs Jan 11 — Jan 18,&nbsp;2024  1. Overview <p>Data Farming Round 71 (DF71) has completed. 150K OCEAN + 20K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am Jan 4, 2024 and ended 12:01am Jan 11. You can claim rewards at the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards"> DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>“<a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">DF Main is Here”</a> is a self-contained description of DF. It’s up-to-date with weekly OCEAN budget allocations and how rewards are computed.</p><p>“<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa">Predictoor Data Farming</a>” is a new Ocean incentives program that amplifies predictoors’ earnings, via 37.5K OCEAN + 20K ROSE (≈$20.5K USD) in weekly extra sales to Predictoor data feeds [1]. This higher baseline sales also makes Volume DF and Passive DF more attractive.</p><p>DF72 is live today, Jan 11. It concludes on Jan 18. 150K OCEAN and 20k ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF72   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF72 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 20k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  You can read the details for how Predictoor DF Reward Amounts work&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa#58d9">here</a>.  Read how to optimize Predictoor rewards&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/rewards-mechanisms-of-ocean-predictoor-6f76c942baf7?source=collection_home---4------0-----------------------">here</a>.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Notes <p>[1] Source of the $20.5K USD&nbsp;number:</p>  CoinGecko prices on Jan 4, 2024: $0.4785 / <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ocean-protocol">OCEAN</a> and $0.1279 /&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/oasis-network">ROSE</a>  $0.4785 / OCEAN * 37,500 OCEAN = $17,944&nbsp;USD  $0.1279 / ROSE * 20,000 ROSE = $2,558&nbsp;USD  Total: $17,944 + $2,558 = $20,502 ≈ $20.5K&nbsp;USD   Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>Ah, January! The month of fresh starts, new resolutions, and doubling down on our best behaviors. This is the perfect time for Google Workspace Super Admins to do a check to ensure they’re following <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/tips-for-building-effective-iam-processes-at-your-startup/">best practices when it comes to identity and access management</a>.</p>
<p>Unsure where to start? Here are three things you can do today.</p>
 1. Audit all apps and limit scopes where needed 
<p>OAuth is a widely used protocol for granting access to resources. OAuth also represents one of the largest surface areas for data to be unknowingly leaked is through <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/navigating-the-oauth-maze-in-smb-identity-management/">an unmanaged application through OAuth in Google Workspace</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a user grants an application access to their Google Workspace data through OAuth, they may not be fully aware of the scope of access they are giving to the application, and the application may have access to more data than the user intended. This issue becomes particularly critical when applications with extensive permissions retain this access for prolonged periods.</p>
<p>To mitigate risks like unauthorized access, data exposure, and account takeover, it’s essential for leaders to proactively manage and monitor these OAuth grants. Regular reviews and audits of the grant validity periods are key practices in ensuring these permissions are necessary and relevant, and in maintaining the overall security and integrity of your organization’s data.</p>
<p>One way to do this is by <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/7281227?hl=en#zippy=%2Cgmail-high-risk-oauth-scopes%2Cdrive-high-risk-oauth-scopes">using your Google Workspace console</a> and navigating the following path: Security &gt; Access and Data &gt; API Controls &gt; Manage third party app access &gt; View list. There, you can view apps with access, revoke access if needed, and just get a general view of what’s going on in your app environment. Check out the video below, where I walk you through it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On the other hand, you can also easily track this information with YeshID. Our intuitive dashboards present <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/new-from-yeshid-data-visualization-for-google-workspace-access/">a comprehensive overview of app licenses, showcasing the interconnected web of permissions across different applications</a>. This helps leaders easily identify which apps or services have broad access to sensitive data and understand the potential risks associated with each OAuth grant.</p>
 2. Review your authentication settings 
<p>Reviewing your authentication settings to ensure they align with internal policies is paramount. We recommend you use one of these two approaches:</p>
 The traditional 2FA and strong password approach 
<p>First, enforce strong passwords that contain a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, and are at least 12 characters long. Using a unique password for each account is important because if a hacker gains access to one password, they will not be able to use it to access your other accounts. You can do this through Google Workspace Admin console <a href="https://admin.google.com/ac/security/passwordmanagement?journey=62">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, turn on two-factor authentication (2FA) to add an extra layer of security to your online accounts by requiring a second form of verification in addition to your password (usually a code sent to your phone, a biometric scan, or a physical token). 2FA makes it much harder for someone to gain unauthorized access to your accounts: Even if they have your password, they also need to have access to your second form of authentication in order to log in. You can do this through Google Workspace Admin console <a href="https://admin.google.com/ac/security/2sv?journey=32">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
 The more modern passwordless approach 
<p>A more secure (and easier to use) choice is to adopt the passwordless setting. It has several benefits:</p>
 
 You stop using the vulnerable password 
 You handle the two-factor requirement with a simpler user experience 
 
<p>Turn on <a href="https://admin.google.com/ac/managedsettings/352555445522/passwordless">Google’s passwordless beta</a> or try <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">YeshID’s simple passwordless approach</a>.</p>
 3. Streamline your onboarding/offboarding process&nbsp; 
<p>If you’re still onboarding new users manually in Google Workspace the old way, it might be time to think about updating your process. Fortunately, that doesn’t have to mean putting weeks into procuring a tool or hiring an employee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By augmenting Workspace’s hard-to-navigate console with a user-friendly dashboard and enhanced controls, YeshID <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/stepping-lightly-a-guide-to-avoiding-onboarding-and-offboarding-missteps/">makes streamlining onboarding and offboarding a breeze</a>. Scheduled workflows, flexible controls, and customizable templates help automate onboarding/offboarding and provisioning tasks, ensuring the right users have the right access at the right time.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Schedule onboarding: YeshID allows you to schedule onboarding tasks. An email is automatically sent to the user on their start date, and their account is provisioned immediately to kickstart the application license process. 
 Create templates for departments: Create templates for different departments to automate the assignment of groups and orgs, reducing manual work. 
 Manage application provisioning: Manage the application provisioning process through YeshID’s task management system. Assign administrators for each application, and they’ll receive notifications for when to provision access. 
 Compliance management: YeshID serves as a central source of truth for access management, making it easy to demonstrate compliance when needed. 
 
 It’s your year!

 The Real Politics of the Blockchain <p>One of the arguments for why Octopuses have not managed to make the jump to high technology in the past few million years is that, despite being spookily intelligent, their young are free floating little sea creatures rather than being raised by parents. No way to build culture. EVERY GENERATION STARTS FROM&nbsp;ZERO.</p><blockquote>Humans can’t start from zero — we need to learn from previous generations.</blockquote><p>Today’s younger generations are as adrift on the internet, on the infinite seas of the information environment, as baby octopuses are in the vast depths of the open ocean. The only things which are stable reference points are archaic (religion) or capitalised (product-based identities). Equally&nbsp;abyssal.</p><p>But Humans can’t start from zero — we need to learn from previous generations. Some say cave paintings were used to teach younger people how to hunt! We have been at this a&nbsp;while.</p><a href="https://smarthistory.org/bhimbetka-cave-paintings-2/">https://smarthistory.org/bhimbetka-cave-paintings-2/</a><p>So I’m thinking again about how to handle the political disenfranchisement of young people through the blockchain, building on something <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-blockchain-sleep-of-reason-b28f3bd3f83b">I wrote a while back</a>. The hopes and dreams of a better world where people have individual agency and great collective power are deep-rooted in blockchain culture. Can we deliver that&nbsp;dream?</p><p>I believe we can but it needs some careful cultural thinking about how young people got so screwed over by the economy and socially atomized, and what might be needed to fix it. It’s all about “frontier” and getting away from incumbents to places where it’s genuinely possible to create something.</p><p>Also humans live a really, really long time which means you can have me — a Gen X “90s kid” — tell you what I think about the situation. In contrast Octopuses only live about five years so their elders are pre-school. But in the 1990s we had almost exactly the same obsessions that the current generation has and my hope is that we can help you find a way&nbsp;fowards.</p><p>Does any of this look familiar? Hell we’re even fighting the same companies.</p><p><a href="https://www.trippingly.net/burning-man-musings/burning-man-1996">Burning Man 1996: Helco - Trippingly</a></p><p>Can we deliver the&nbsp;dream?</p><p>I was part of an internet community in the early 1990s. People all over the world. Our symbol? A simple “@“ because nobody else had a cultural identity as an email&nbsp;user.</p><p>Just think about that for a second. You’re driving around in some suburb looking for your friend’s house, that you only know from the internet, and you pass a mailbox with an “@“ symbol printed on a piece of paper and taped to the outside of the mailbox. “Internet People Here”. It’s like seeing the Bitcoin logo on a shop, or the Ethereum logo on a conference.</p><p>You know that in this place you’re part of The&nbsp;Network.</p><p>Go back to the age of rail and there were <a href="https://popularmechanics.com/technology/a25174860/hobo-code/">Hobo Code symbols</a>. The “@“ symbol was our technomad code. “Internet People&nbsp;Here”.</p><p>That’s 30 years ago. It’s as distant from 2023 as the 1960s were for us in the 1990s. It’s an entire world&nbsp;away.</p><p>Fashion used to play the same role. Subcultural branding and tagging and identity all woven together. You’ve seen these guys? London in the 1980s had one of the most extreme fashion subcultures ever seen. That version of punk was expensive in money and opportunity costs. Social&nbsp;proof!</p><p>The people that paid that cost were in it together against the world — out-in&nbsp;group.</p><p>Of course, with those people it&nbsp;was:</p><p>Today, by and large, young people are not responding like this; it is notable that in the 21st century the thriving ferment of street subcultures has largely died out except as nostalgia trends (although, even then, no one has brought back<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/jul/30/big-quiffs-zombies-and-dead-crows-the-wild-world-of-psychobilly"> psychobilly</a> — no one should bring back psychobilly).</p><p>So now everybody’s on the internet. Young people who skipped college are sitting around at home trading crypto in their teens, and then moving to Singapore for tax reasons in their 20s (or whatever). In an <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=petals+on+a+wet+black+bough+ezra+pound&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiR187jpNODAxVTpycCHZNtAngQ2-cCegQIABAA&amp;oq=petals+on+a+wet+black+bough+ezra+pound&amp;gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzoECCMQJ1C5A1iHCmD1C2gAcAB4AIABY4gBngSSAQE2mAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWfAAQE&amp;sclient=img&amp;ei=AsyeZZHOKNPOnsEPk9uJwAc&amp;bih=751&amp;biw=1314&amp;client=safari">infinite sea of faces</a>, who are your people? Who do you invest in knowing? And I do mean “<a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a19712238/how-many-hours-best-friends/">invest in knowing</a>” — relationship building takes time, and young people invest in it very, very,&nbsp;hard.</p><blockquote>Who do you invest in&nbsp;knowing?</blockquote><p>Today, while young people still deal with this through <a href="https://youtu.be/ti4PGYISY44?si=6l0tcL5F96xQLu9G">aesthetics</a>, these are wider ranging and more diffuse than just clothing, and they do it through social media. Let’s talk social media’s “aesthetic” obsession. From <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Cottagecore">Cottagecore</a> to <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Academia">Dark Academia</a>, what does social media’s obsession with creating aesthetics say about us? And why is it such a problem? The aesthetic subcultures folks follow “alpha” (information) flows, and you need money to buy in. You become a “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti4PGYISY44&amp;t=89s">VSCO girl</a>” or go “Cottagecore” and it costs you a few dozen hours of analysis and a few thousand dollars of purchases. Now you look like Those Other People. Outside of college campuses etc. the Cottagecore Community doesn’t really meet in reality. This is all online. It’s much the same economic cost as buying into a mid-price NFT project. It’s almost like we’re all trying to anchor in the enormous full emptiness of the internet.</p><p>You can see the same thing in the photography “community” — all the Fuji buyers making “film like” into a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKk3MlP9ypk">thing</a>, while the Nikon buyers are showing off their P1000 shots of birds feeding their babies 4.5km away with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/sM7882GmuRg">superzoom</a> goodness. It’s markets being used as community mediums. Buy this product to find your&nbsp;people.</p><p>Other people anchor through economics. I think that the heavy slant of the blockchain space towards libertarianism, autism, Asperger’s, Nerd Culture, and the general social blunting that comes with working with machines (I could hardly talk when I was a computer graphics engineer) is partly responsible for this. Crypto-socio-economics — binding people together with economically shared incentives through things like NFTs or DAOs is a nerd response to living in an atomized society. — with people for whom aesthetics don’t appeal, economics may do the job of bringing people together.</p><blockquote>Other people anchor through economics</blockquote><p>So I think what’s happening in the NFT space, and to a limited degree in stuff like L2 chains or crappy little L1s, is a similar kind of social anchoring. “You’ve got $20,000 of Dogecoin? Well we’re 100% on the same team. Go Doge!” Because otherwise people just drift away online. There’s no cost to leaving the community so people do, often silently.</p><p>The only way we know how to answer the question of “who are you?” Is socially.</p><p>Family names. “John of Sudbury”. “Joe Baker”. Given names. I travelled all over America in the 1990s on “@“. The story of “who am I?” was tightly coupled to the social technology of the day: email lists. I don’t think nearly enough work has been done on the “economic sociology” of crypto projects, particularly DAOs and NFT communities. Now that I’m seeing this head-on, it all makes so much more sense. A single framework with aesthetic and “<a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/core-words-cottagecore/">-core</a>” cultures, NFTs and DAOs together. This also neatly explains the early adopter communities on Twitter, Instagram and, earlier than that, Flickr (really the first social network for people that made images rather than writing as a way of expressing their identity) — influencers as social leaders: reference point organisers. In ancient times this was one of the functions of soap operas: people who worked in the same office but lived in different communities could gossip about people they both “knew” outside of the workplace, those being the cast of Friends etc — Yes, I know this sounds incredibly dumb. But 30 years ago (!) there were academic publications as people discovered this phenomena!</p><a href="https://www.dhi.ac.uk/san/waysofbeing/data/communication-zangana-baym-1993.pdf">https://www.dhi.ac.uk/san/waysofbeing/data/communication-zangana-baym-1993.pdf</a> Who’s writing the equivalent paper today about&nbsp;NFTs?<p>I don’t think nearly enough work has been done on the “economic sociology” of crypto&nbsp;projects</p><p>So the idea that what we have is <a href="https://www.ica.coop/en/history-co-operative-movement#:~:text=In%201844%20the%20Rochdale%20Pioneers,surplus%20to%20benefit%20the%20community.">economic responses to social atomization</a> is not a new one but I’m seeing it in a new way because I’ve got it from two sides right now: “aesthetic” culture from YouTube etc. and NFT/DAO from&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>This is almost gendered, women and men.&nbsp;Almost.</p><p>As we have transformed our physical and social environment further and further from the environment that we evolved in, it becomes harder and harder for us to find the true happiness which is harmony between our own nature and nature itself. We love dogs and BBQs beside water. No form of happiness is more universal than a few families and friends gathering to grill food on a beach or by a lake. That’s where we evolved. That’s our native environment at its&nbsp;best.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@leashless/friends-dogs-and-faint-wood-smoke-e596fe387427">Food, fire and friends beside&nbsp;water.</a></p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@leashless/friends-dogs-and-faint-wood-smoke-e596fe387427">Friends, dogs, and faint wood smoke</a></p><p>Ape Utopia.</p><p>That’s what people are seeking in these internet cultures, but are they finding&nbsp;it?</p><p>Once, in the ’90s, when the internet was young, we did this with mailing lists and newsgroups, we had little social communities where like-minded people found each other and generated whole new friendship groups that didn’t rely on geography or finding the right pub. There’s even an archived list of all the “<a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/ezines/kr5hou2zh4qtebqk.onion/UXU/UXU-148.TXT">cyberpunk</a>” email lists from the 1990s. Isn’t that amazing? It was all DIY and profoundly uncommercial. but this was basically commodified and destroyed by social media that first co-opted it, then corrupted it by filtering the messages and monetising the interactions, so the groups no longer felt like&nbsp;“home”.</p><blockquote>This was commodified and destroyed by social&nbsp;media</blockquote><p>You can see why an entire generation of innovators latched on to crypto because it seemed like it could, in theory, reinvent that uncommercial sense of online community by owning the commercial aspects collectively, and then offer social solidarity at the “tribal” and potentially even the “municipal” level through larger projects like Ethereum.</p><p>Ethereum Nation.</p><p>But it’s all stretched. We can’t actually live inside of the metaverse. The people who own the same NFTs as you do might be too far away and too alien to babysit your kids. The core biological reality of our lives is only very slightly improved by online community. Life still happens in the real world and this is what’s producing the crazy addictive (often life damaging) effects: it doesn’t matter how much you drink wine if what you need is coffee. The strongest online communities are still only reflections and shadows of “food, fire and friends beside water.” Social media does not give people what they actually need. That’s why we keep scrolling.</p><blockquote>We can’t actually live inside of the metaverse</blockquote><p>People are growing up untethered: fashion doesn’t indicate identity when you can drop $200 at Shein and walk out with an entirely new wardrobe. There’s no social cost to weird hair. There’s no geographic binding after high school really. The idea that what we have is a set of broad pathologies based on the conditions of internet atomization resulting in community inclusion being mediated by products, in other words you have to buy your friends, is fucking brutal. I’ve heard it before, but only understood it for myself now; it is a desperate position for a social monkey to find itself&nbsp;in.</p><blockquote>Community inclusion being mediated by products is fucking&nbsp;brutal</blockquote><p>This is not the utopia you are seeking — it’s “pay to play tribalism”. This is unfortunate. You can see the perfect opportunity for people being exploited: you want to join a tribe and get to know people. You want to make money. The two impulses are joined in the DAO structure: a community you buy into. It’s a little bit like having a cult with elected leadership, or a multi-level marketing scheme which is owned by the members. The social dynamics are very similar to both cults and MLMs. The social dynamics fuse capitalism and society in a new and probably kinda dangerous way.</p><blockquote>It’s “pay to play tribalism”</blockquote><p>Clearly there’s a social binding force — but with that come problems. The combination of social solidarity and commerce is unsafe. We cannot make an atomized population powerful with either shallow social organisation or technology. To save the world — and here I’m thinking climate change — we need the most profound de-atomization imaginable (or maybe geoengineering).</p><p>We’re in a&nbsp;maze.</p><p>We’re building technologies without the end goal in sight. What people want at a shallow advertising-driven level and what people need at a “my life is whole and makes sense to me” level are way different. Instagram does not substitute for a better relationship with your sister. And this is the fundamental challenge of the “real world assets” phase of Ethereum. OK, now we can handle real estate on the blockchain in tokenized form. We really can:<a href="http://mattereum.com/land"> http://mattereum.com/land</a> is a real deal and there’s <a href="https://swarm.com/swarm-partners-with-mattereum-to-securitise-real-world-assets-on-chain/">way more</a>&nbsp;coming.</p><blockquote>Instagram does not substitute for a better relationship with your&nbsp;sister</blockquote><p>But can we solve the social problems too? We’re already seeing the broad outlines of this attempt: Network States are “crypto communities do real estate” with kinda strange Silicon Valley logic&nbsp;applied.</p><p>Once you tease out the projects that are the Silicon Valley equivalent of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_citizen_movement">Sovereign Citizen</a> play (i.e. opting out of existing nation state structures to avoid tax and law, while still physically living in the state) what they are is electronic communities organised around money rather than community: the people grew up atomized: never felt community. We get regular pings from people with ambitions of doing community land projects and building physical settlements with crypto finance as an integral part of the start up plan, often with community governance done using DAOs or other crypto voting&nbsp;methods.</p><p>People are reaching.</p><p>This is really the&nbsp;key.</p><p>If we’re going to ship large-scale community-oriented real estate development projects that actually deliver “food, fire and friends beside water” at scale we’re going to need to figure out the sociological issues which have made modern community so hard. Winding up a Network State that failed is going to be much harder than winding up a company or shuttering a community.</p><p>People think they want tokenized real estate. They need community. They won’t be happy with tokenized real estate unless it delivers community.</p><p>That is part of why there is so much interest in DAOs and Network States. People want to be reconnected to each other. That’s the fundamental human drive at the heart of all of this. Yes, professional real estate clients want faster transactions and so on. Yes, Mattereum can deliver that. But their clients want community. The enormous cultural push towards de-atomizing society and returning to interconnected forms is unstoppable: it is human nature returning to being human after centuries of industrial oppression.</p><p>Post-industrial society is like post-war society: an attempt to return to&nbsp;peace.</p><blockquote>Professional real estate clients want faster transactions but their clients want community</blockquote><p>As we move down the pathway towards tokenized community real estate projects, whether they be Network States or start-up villages or just plain old electronic communes, we’re going to wind up having to try and bring wisdom about community, not just the <a href="http://mattereum.com">Mattereum</a> legals.</p><p>It’s not like I haven’t lived in communities and studied them in detail for more than 30&nbsp;years.</p><p>I do have grounded opinions about how to do this, and I think if we invested in researchers and worked closely with clients we could actually deliver functional community templates. And that is, after all, probably the highest good that <a href="http://mattereum.com">Mattereum</a> can deliver to retail customers: better arrangements for buying their houses and managing shared assets with their neighbours.</p><blockquote>The highest good that Mattereum can deliver: better arrangements for buying houses and managing shared&nbsp;assets</blockquote><p>Professional finance needs precision and efficiency. But homeowners need warm relations. Bad governance and bad finance produce stone cold grinding poverty: Homeowners Associations and sharecropping. If we actually go into this tokenized real estate thing with a clear sense of the end goals in mind it might be a lot easier than we think: nobody’s tried with lawyers. “Good fences make good neighbours”, and a contract is nothing but a fence of written words. The legal structures are all there: there’s no reason for Homeowners Associations to be terrible.</p><p>There’s no reason shared ownership has to be predatory. Societies do not have to be the way they are; we can change&nbsp;them.</p><p>So — what does this all mean? Well, my parents’ generation were part of the post-war economic boom. The economy was buoyant and everyone, whatever their income was, floated up on the tide. Until, basically, the 1980s; Thatcher, Reagan and neo-liberal economics, which, as a matter of policy, was “every person for themselves” — there’s no such thing as society. Those who had money were able to leverage more at the expense of those with less, because money translates to power, allowing them to become obscenely rich while everyone else’s income stagnated. We weren’t going to do better than our parents, the first generation in a century to say&nbsp;that.</p>see also <a href="https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/">https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/</a><p>For my parents, stability and community was home, family, the workplace. Young people today are priced out of owning a house, or even stably renting one, there’s no expectation of long-term jobs or even a single career through your working life, let alone staying in the same place. But they still want “food, fire and friends beside water” (and also cats) and where they are looking for it is online, but the neo-liberals got there first and have commodified, monetized and corrupted the will for online community, so they end up basically with “pay-to-play” friends. Is it any wonder people are starting to have romantic relationships with AI Chatbots? The blockchain offers a way round that, a means to create a self-generated trusted community, to build structures that are egalitarian, supportive and nurturing through DAOs and similar. To do this needs more than good will, it needs law, it needs appropriate fences to keep out the thieves, scammers and profiteers. The current global operating system is broken, its head has been severed and it is running on reflexes, not quite aware it is dead yet. Politicians pull the levers and wonder why they no longer work, resorting to “dead cat” distractions to hide the fact they have no functioning policies.</p><p>Nettles need to be grasped and the <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43290/the-second-coming">rough beast slouching towards Bethlehem</a> needs to take&nbsp;form.</p><p>There are ways forward.

<p>ID Document Verification was introduced to solve many of the issues that raise from services that require higher levels of authentication. Certain services require more reliable authentication methods, which offers higher assurance of the user’s identity. However, this can cause issues, especially for users of different nationalities. Lower-level authentication methods can often be used by all users regardless of their country of origin, whereas in the case of higher-level methods, it is not always the case. However, with the use of ID Document Verification it becomes easier for all users to prove their identity. In this blog, I will explore the basics surrounding ID Document Verification and some of the main features that support these solutions.</p>
 What is ID Document Verification? 
<p>The basic concept is that – instead of using a &nbsp;user ID and password to sign into an eService, I identify myself by scanning my identity document and taking a selfie or a video clip to prove who I am. I can scan the document by taking a picture of it according to instructions given by the service provider. The service uses different highly sophisticated AI (Artificial Intelligence) driven technologies to verify that the person in the picture or a video matches the one shown in the document.</p>
<p>There are several ID Document Verification service providers in the markets and as you can imagine there are some differences in the principles of how these services function. You might be interested to know how many different countries are supported by the solution, which ID documents are accepted, whether is there a need to install an app, is ID Document chip scanning supported, where is the ID document information stored, what type of fraud detection systems the solution uses and what is the price per authentication transaction, especially during the initial registration.</p>
<p>The most common ID documents accepted by these services are driver’s licenses, national ID cards and passports but depending on the country I am from there can be over ten different documents including residence permits and work permits among others that I can use to prove my identity. Depending on the service provider I can scan the identity documents using a web browser-based or app-based user interface. The result is the same, after the initial ID document scanning procedure I get access to the eService. But what happens when I want to access the same eService again?</p>
<p>The benefit of a browser-based version is that I don’t have to install a new app on my smart device. Generally, it can be a good solution for a one-time authentication. However, if the goal is to reuse my identity again without re-registration, then my ID document information must be sent to the service provider’s servers. Even though the information is stored in an encrypted format, many users do not necessarily like the idea that non-governmental 3rd party operator stores this kind of information in their servers.</p>
<p>The benefit of an app-based solution is that it provides me with the possibility to store the scanned identity document information in an encrypted format on my smart device. I have the option to remove this information at any point I want. However, many eService providers do not want to ask their customers to install additional apps on their smart devices.</p>
 How reliable is the ID Document Verification? 
<p>Can ID Document Verification methods be considered strong authentication methods? Often, strong authentication methods utilise at least two factors from the list of something the user knows (e.g. password, pin code, answer to a security question), something the user has (e.g. security token, digital certificate, an ID card, a &nbsp;phone with a built-in hardware token, software token), and something the user is (e.g. typically biometrics such as fingerprint, iris scan, vein scan etc.).</p>
<p>ID Document Verification uses a variety of AI-driven fraud detection mechanisms, such as face matching to confirm that the person who took the selfie or a video is the same as on the document. Texture analysis makes sure that the pictures or videos are genuine and not copies. In addition, features such as audio processing, face tracking and mouth tracking – where they have to say some specific words, turn my head, blink my eyes etc. – can be utilised to further verify that we have the right person trying to access the service. And if the algorithm is still not sure if it is the right person, some solutions provide an option to ask a trained employee to verify the user and make the final decision. From this perspective, we can say that ID Document Verification Authentication methods can provide strong authentication.</p>
<p>However, as an example, in Finland the official strong authentication methods include BankID, national ID cards (requires a card reader) and Mobile PKI (Mobiilivarmenne in Finnish). These methods have gone through a complex certification process to prove the maturity of the solution. This is indicated by using a Level of Assurance (LoA) levels. LoA levels use the international 4-step scale and the EU 3-step scale in parallel in the following way:</p>



International scale
EU scale
Notes


LoA 1
Not used
(EU uses 3-step scale)


LoA 2
eIDAS Low



LoA 3
eIDAS Substantial
BankID, Mobile PKI


LoA 4
eIDAS High
National Identity Card



<p>eIDAS = Electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services</p>
<p>Since ID Document Verification method vendors are private companies, they do not have such LoA certifications. From a security point of view, it is important to make sure that the vendor follows the latest developments in the standards and technology used to identify fraudulent documents.</p>
<p>Also, it is good to notice that in some European countries, it is possible to open a bank account online using ID Document Verification authentication, indicating that these banks trust their selected vendor’s solution – which is a noteworthy seal of approval.</p>
<p>One way to improve the reliability of the scanning procedure is to scan the microchip in the ID Document. The chips inside of passports and national ID cards include user-specific certificates that are very difficult to forge, thus they can be used to increase the reliability of the document verification procedure. To do this, I have to make sure I have an NFC (Near-Field Communication) chip in my smart device. In addition, some solutions can run backend queries to external databases to validate documents’ ID attributes and execute fraud evaluation against fraud databases.</p>
 Which services can use Identity Document Verification? 
<p>While ID Document Verification authentication methods have often been used in banking services, there are also many other services where they are very useful. This is especially useful where the eService requires a higher assurance of identity verification but the users cannot use the official strong authentication methods of the given country.</p>
<p>One good example of this is the universities. Very often these educational institutes have foreign students and teachers who need to authenticate themselves to access the university eServices to attend online lectures, examinations etc. Username and password methods are just not strong enough in these cases, but reliable online authentication methods are not available. This type of issue can be solved with ID Document Verification Authentication. Notice that the new European Digital Identity (EUDI), which is a part of the eIDAS regulation will allow EU-level cross-border strong authentication services. It will solve this issue for people who have EU-level digital identities. Read more about it here: <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/standards/introducing-european-digital-identity-eudi/" title="https://www.ubisecure.com/standards/introducing-european-digital-identity-eudi/">https://www.ubisecure.com/standards/introducing-european-digital-identity-eudi/</a></p>
<p>In addition, several other eServices can use ID Document Verification for more convenient, passwordless authentication. Instead of writing my username and password I can just take a selfie (biometric facial recognition) or scan a QR code to access the service. Also, if the service has a password, I could reset it by taking a selfie.</p>
<p>Integrating an ID Document Verification Authentication service with a CIAM (Customer Identity and Access Management) solution such as Ubisecure’s Identity Platform makes the onboarding of new users frictionless. This type of solution can utilise the registration form autofill feature during the initial phase of the procedure. Many of the required attributes can be scanned directly from the ID document, thus users do not have to type them in manually.</p>
<p>The integration procedure can be established using the tools provided by the CIAM system. If the ID Document Verification Authentication service supports standard authentication protocols, such as SAML or OIDC, then it is a very straightforward procedure. If the service uses proprietary APIs, then a separate adapter needs to be created to establish communication between the CIAM and the service. This type of solution allows you to easily take the ID Document Verification Authentication service to use for all of your eServices with just a few mouse clicks.</p>
 Pros and cons of ID Document Verification 
<p>Below, I have listed some positives and negatives of the ID Document Verification Authentication services. It is good to remember that the solutions vary between different vendors. So, depending on your needs you can choose a vendor that fulfils your requirements.</p>



Positives
Negatives


+ International authentication method, not limited to one national ID
– Chip scanning requires a phone with NFC functionality


+ Passwordless authentication utilising:<p></p>
<p>+ QR-codes</p>
<p>+ Selfies</p>
<p>+ Videos</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
– Initial registration can sometimes be cumbersome


+ Difficult to forge (especially the methods based on chip scanning)<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
– Not all countries have centralised registries for attribute verification<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


+ Possibility to confirm scanned information from external registries<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
– Cannot cover 100% of customers. Some manual customer service processes still required for certain users<p></p>
<p>– The service can cover a maximum of just over 200 countries at best (depending on the service&nbsp; provider)</p>
<p>– Not all users have the smart devices required available</p>
<p>– Not everyone has the documents required</p>
<p>– Not everyone has the know-how to complete the registration process</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


+ The possibility of doing a password reset using a recheck of a selfie or a video<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
– Initial authentication can be a bit expensive (for the eService provider)<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


+ Frictionless onboarding of new customers with registration form auto-filling when combined with CIAM<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
– Some solutions require the user’s ID Document information to be stored in an external DBs<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


+ Good for services that are subject to stringent KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti Money Laundering) requirements.
– There can be differing levels of accuracy different skin tones, genders and ages, enquire with your vendor about bias mitigation.

<p>As we have seen, the official strong authentication methods are usually national-level solutions. Even with the EUDI service, we can offer only EU-level solutions for the problem. The ID Document Verification Authentication services can offer an option for strong authentication for global users. In addition, it can simplify the onboarding processes and provide passwordless sign-in to eServices. Its AI-powered biometric identification engines for facial recognition and anti-spoofing technologies make it a safe option for a variety of eServices.</p>

<p>Indicio is a fully remote company and does not have an office. Our team is spread out across US and European time zones, and our clients are located all around the world. As you’ll work remotely, you must be self-motivated, a demonstrated team-player, and have outstanding communication skills.</p>
<p>We do not conduct live coding interviews, but we do like to talk about your favorite projects and may ask for code samples if you are shortlisted.</p>
<p>Responsibilities</p>
 
 Be a part of the team process to design and scope features 
 Work with other team members to schedule work and coordinate code delivery 
 Write (and learn to write) high quality software

<p>Requirements</p>

 Working with urgency without direct supervision, taking initiative, and asking lots of questions 
 Strong team working skills including empathy, always assuming the best intent, kindness, collaboration, and a desire to create impact 
 Proficiency with the following tools is preferred, but familiarity with similar tools is just fine: 
 
 Google Suite, JIRA, Git, GitHub, and Slack 
 
 Must live in and be legally able to work in the US; we cannot sponsor work visas at this time 
 
<p>We highly encourage candidates of all backgrounds to apply to work with us – we recruit based on more than just&nbsp; official qualifications, including experience and curiosity. As a Public Benefit Corporation, a women-owned business, and WSOB certified, Indicio is committed to advancing decentralized identity as a public good that enables all people to control their online identities and share their data by consent. We aim to create a welcoming environment for our employees, clients, and partners and ensure a diverse, inclusive, and equitable environment.</p>

<p>Warm or cold, good or bad, global climate constantly changes in various ways. This data challenge used carbon emission rates sorted by each country to prove or debunk common climate change assumptions with data science. Understanding trends of the past and simulating future outcomes through available data seeks to lead to better awareness, business intelligence, and policy shaping in years to&nbsp;come.</p> Introduction <p>This Data Challenge ran from November 23 to December 12, 2023, and was the last challenge of the 2023 championship season. The purpose of was challenge was to dissect carbon emission statistics and rates by each country, and then develop predictive models for future emission rates on a continental scale.</p><p>The Carbon Emissions data challenge gave a stepping stone to understanding emission rates for intensive purposes of the data challenge experiment. Later R&amp;D on this subject routes to dynamic analytics, data-informed decision-making, and stride to mitigate asymmetric facts and truth about climate&nbsp;change.</p><p>To execute, the Ocean Protocol Data Science team and the challenge participants used the provided data made available by the European Commission <a href="https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/report_2023">EDGAR — Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research</a>. Two Data Sets were used to weigh carbon emission rates under two different metrics: Co2 (Carbon Dioxide) and GHG (Green House Gases). Each data set weighed its metric at the country level, sector-specific data, per GDP, and Per Capita emission&nbsp;rates.</p><p>The key objectives of this data science competition were to analyze the influence of different industry sectors and countries, exercise statistical and machine learning models to derive assumptions, and forecast what the short-term future may look&nbsp;like.</p> Winners <p>Participants were tasked with analyzing trends and patterns in the historical data and identifying key drivers of emissions per country per industry sector, per capita, and per GDP. Then, apply these findings to indicators by continent. Beyond the data set provided, participants were encouraged to assess the impact of different sectors and economic activities on emission levels. 13 reports were entered, and 3 have earned podium finishes for USDC prizes and points accrued to their standing in the <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/earn/data-challenges">Ocean Protocol Data Challenge Championship &amp; Leaderboard.</a></p><p>Podium finishers are as&nbsp;follows:</p><p>1st — Andrey Bessalov — $2500&nbsp;USDC</p><p>This report is available on the Ocean Market for Consumption <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:a08d2b52d21ad4660db8da92536f930ba88accc917eca95721f9c70d6ccad96f">here</a>.</p><p>Andrey’s report was the best prepared and thorough. The key conclusion was that Asia is the most polluting continent, with recent emission levels reaching approximately 33 Gt GHG and 25 Gt CO2 per year, constituting about two-thirds of the total global emissions. Conversely, Australia is identified as the least polluting continent. This highlights a significant disparity in emission levels across continents, underscoring the crucial role of regional factors in global emission&nbsp;trends.</p><p>2nd — Elisa Anderson — $1500&nbsp;USDC</p><p>A key standout in the proposal made by Elisa was the development and application of a sophisticated predictive model. This model, based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network architecture, is designed to forecast CO2 and GHG emissions by continent. The model demonstrates varying levels of predictive accuracy across different regions, highlighting the unique factors influencing emissions in each&nbsp;area.</p><p>3rd — Colin Chan — $1000&nbsp;USDC</p><p>This report is available on the Ocean Market for Consumption <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:64b4f1ff8b085b3acaf6772b7ba6334c750c85f43761f8314a876fc6c51de3b3">here</a></p><p>The most interesting takeaway from Colin Chan’s report, “Forecasting Carbon Emissions Across Continents,” is the discovery that Africa has experienced the greatest surge in CO2 emissions, nearly tripling over the observed time period (30 Years). This sharp increase is attributed to the continent’s industrialization and rising demand for transportation services, driven by urbanization and population growth. Conversely, Europe has shown a decrease in CO2 emissions, thanks to investments in renewable energy, strict environmental regulations, and the implementation of the European Union Emissions Trading System. This contrast illustrates the diverse paths of development and environmental impact across different regions.</p> Results <p>Global warming is the long-term increase in the Earth’s average surface temperature. Since the pre-industrial period (1850–1900), the Earth’s average surface temperature has increased by about 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit). <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)</a> has concluded that it is extremely likely that human activity is the main cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. One noteworthy insight derived from this challenge found in this data challenge, that goes against common perception, is that CO2 emissions in Europe have been only declining for the last 30 years, whilst CO2 emissions in Asia for the last 30 years have steadily increased.</p><p>Through this exercise, we were able to assume a few key metrics that influence carbon emission rates via Co2 and GHG and define these assumptions before further&nbsp;reading:</p><p>The main source of carbon emissions and increased rates globally is burning fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Fossil fuels are used to generate electricity, power cars and trucks, and heat homes and businesses. Other sources of carbon emissions include deforestation, waste management, alternative energy production, industrial processes, urbanization &amp; population growth, and agriculture.</p><p>Global warming is already having several negative effects on the&nbsp;planet.</p><p>These effects are expected to become more severe in the future. Some of the most serious effects of global warming include rising sea levels, more extreme weather events, changes in animal and plant life, and soil health &amp; erosion. Here we use data science to diagnose the issues and propose better practices to treat our planet better than the last 30&nbsp;years.</p> Exploratory Data Analysis&nbsp;(EDA) <p>In Asia, the surge in CO2 and GHG emissions is closely linked to rapid population growth, industrialization, and the rise of emerging economies. This region’s dynamic economic development, often driven by energy-intensive industries and expanding urban centers, has significantly increased its carbon footprint.</p><p>Meanwhile, continents like Oceania, Europe, and North America have witnessed a decline in emissions, largely attributable to effective environmental policies and a shift towards cleaner energy sources. This contrast highlights the varying trajectories of different regions in addressing climate change, underscoring the need for tailored solutions that consider economic and social contexts.</p><p>The same phenomenon is reflected in GHG emissions with Europe improving in its environmental efforts while the rest of the world continues to increase its emissions as&nbsp;Africa</p><p>leads the rise. Europe contributed 26.44% of total GHG emissions in 2022, down from 37.40% in 1970. On the other hand, Africa’s contribution rose from 12.70% in 1970 to 20.65%. This dichotomy is largely reflected and expected based on the aforementioned analysis of CO2 emissions.</p> Co2 vs GHG correlation <p>The heatmap indicates a strong positive correlation between CO2 emissions and overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with a correlation coefficient of&nbsp;0.99.</p><p>This suggests that in the dataset analyzed, as CO2 emissions increase or decrease, GHG emissions tend to follow very closely. Given that CO2 is a major component of GHG emissions, this high correlation is expected.</p> Industry Sector Contribution Correlation The trend of Co2 Emission Rates by Sector&nbsp;GloballyTrends of GHG &amp; Co2 Emission Rates by Industry&nbsp;Sector<p>The graphs below show the absolute values of sectoral CO2 and GHG emissions expressed in Mt CO2/yr on the left, and the shares of these values from the total contribution on the&nbsp;right.</p><p>The most polluting sector is the Power Industry (generating energy). In recent years, the value of CO2 emissions has reached 30 Gt per year, which is approximately 30% of total GHG emissions, and 40% of total CO2 emissions. The least polluting sector in terms of GHG emissions is&nbsp;Waste.</p><p>- The agriculture sector is a significant contributor globally, necessitating sustainable farming practices.</p><p>- The building and fuel exploitation sectors call for energy-efficient construction and cleaner energy&nbsp;sources.</p><p>- Industrial combustion and the power industry sectors require enhanced regulations and adoption of cleaner technologies.</p><p>- Increased waste sector demands improved waste management sustainability globally.</p><p>- The transportation sector emphasizes the urgency of sustainable mobility solutions.</p><p>Following Per Capita and Per GDP metrics, it was recognized that global average CO2 emissions per capita decreasing from 1990 to 2022 indicates a positive trend towards lower individual carbon footprints. Because GDP and Per Capita benchmarks are continuously increasing, further reasoning for a decrease in correlation could mean several things: Improved energy efficiency, introduction of renewable energy, increased awareness, and policy measures.</p> Temporal Analysis <p>In Temporal analysis, research was tasked with Examining the temporal trends in CO2 and GHG emissions across continents. Then, scoring was made on the ability to identify notable patterns or shifts over time, pinpointing periods marked by significant increases or decreases in emissions. Explain these trends, considering policy changes, economic shifts, technological advancements, or natural events that might have influenced the observed patterns. The summary to solve this question is briefed based on averages of the submitted reports.</p><p>Over time, all continents recorded a rise in CO2 emissions except for Europe. In the meanwhile, Africa led the pack with the greatest surge in CO2 emissions, nearly tripling throughout the time. This can be possibly explained by the industrialization of Africa as the amount of CO2 emissions from transport rose dramatically in the continent. These include railways, buses, and ferries as the countries experience urbanization and population growth, increasing the demand for transportation services. These signs of economic development often go in tandem with trade and business activities, necessitating transportation services to move goods and people. Furthermore, as Africa’s GDP gradually increases, this enhances the affordability of citizens in the region to purchase vehicles, leading to elevated emissions.</p><p>However, with the lack of government policies and public awareness, it fails to sufficiently curb these emission activities and promote sustainable emissions.</p><p>As for sectoral composition, agriculture led the greatest fall (23.10% to 19.59%) in contributions to total GHG emissions while Processes contributed the largest rise (10.94% to&nbsp;14.64%).</p><p>Livestock, especially cattle, contribute significantly to methane emissions. The implementation of improved livestock management practices, such as dietary changes and methane capture technologies could contribute to lower emissions from the agriculture sector. As for processes, this could be plausibly explained by the changes in consumer demand and trade patterns which shifted to more energy-intensive manufacturing techniques such as computer parts and electronic equipment, due to the rise in income per&nbsp;capita.</p> Prediction Model <p>For predictions, two different approaches were exercised by challenge participants. Drawn between 1) Time Series Analysis, by analyzing historical trends and patterns in the data, time series models like ARIMA and ARIMAX can be employed to predict future emission levels. And 2) Machine Learning by the vehicle of algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and Neural Networks was trained on the provided data to learn complex relationships and patterns.</p><p>For one example, this linear regression model is described here to forecast future global CO2 and GHG emission rates based solely on historical emissions data. The model utilizes the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method from the Statsmodels library in Python. The dataset used for training and prediction consists of two columns: ‘Year’ and ‘Emission’, where ‘Year’ represents the respective year, and ‘Emission’ denotes the total CO2 or GHG emissions for that year. The objective was to develop a predictive model that can estimate future total global CO2 emissions based on historical data.</p> Understanding Emission Rates, Climate Change, &amp; What to Do About&nbsp;It <p>The “Forecasting Carbon Emissions Across Continents” challenge has been a pivotal journey in understanding the complex dynamics of CO2 and GHG emissions globally. Through meticulous data analysis and advanced modeling, we’ve uncovered distinct emission trends across continents and the substantial impact of various sectors on these emissions. Our models have forecasted emissions for the upcoming three years, providing a crucial tool for policymakers and Environmentalists.</p><p>The analysis paints a world where geography and economy intertwine with emissions. While Asia grapples with the environmental costs of rapid growth, the West shows the feasibility of stabilizing emissions. Africa’s trajectory points towards a need for sustainable development models. The insights call for a global response, balancing economic needs with environmental sustainability.</p><p>This was the last data challenge of 2023.

 In IDnow’s latest webinar, experts gathered to discuss the challenges of preventing fraud, and the crucial role of identity verification services in the fraud capital of Europe. 



 



<p>If we are ever to tackle the scourge of fraud in the UK (which currently claims the dubious honor of being fraud capital of Europe), then more must be done to educate the public of the real harm, according to participants of IDnow’s recent <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/fraud-digital-identity-verification-uk/">webinar, ‘The future of fraud and identity verification in the UK.’</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The panel discussion, which is available now on-demand, gathered an eclectic bunch of experts, including Philipp Mind, Director Digital Technology and Innovation at UK Finance, Francisco Martins, Regional Senior Sales Manager at IDnow, Tony Sales, ex-fraudster and current Chief Product Officer at We Fight Fraud, and Paul Stratton, ex-police officer and current Founder and Lead Trainer at The Fraud Nerd.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Philipp, who was the moderator for the session, started by setting the scene, which included sharing some startling statistics of just how dire the problem of fraud is in the UK. (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy/">Read more about the UK’s problem with fraud here</a>.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>It then seemed only fitting to begin by speaking with the once dubbed “Britain’s greatest fraud star” to give his opinion on the state of fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Criminals have now got more tools and data streams available to them than ever before. When I was a criminal, getting someone’s information was quite difficult, it wasn’t the process that it is now with Telegram, and the dark web, and all these places where criminals can harvest information, so it’s a lot easier to commit than it ever was before.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tony added that the cost-of-living crisis has a part to play in people committing fraud, as does the role of social media in creating unobtainable lifestyles that persuade people to “get involved in deetsing [acquiring funds from account details].&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>They don’t even realize the consequences of their actions. They just want to get that item that they see others have. I think that’s a massive part of why we see the numbers [of fraud] we do nowadays.</p>Tony Sales, ex-fraudster and current Chief Product Officer at We Fight Fraud</blockquote>



<p>Paul, who has been historically at the opposite end of the interview table throughout his career, agreed with Tony, but also added that it was the ‘white collar’ perception of fraud that had a damaging impact on its prevalence, and often had the police deprioritize investigations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Fraud is still seen as just a business crime by a lot of senior officers, but fraud is also about the emotional harm as well as the financial crime. However, some police divisions like Merseyside Police [where Paul worked] are moving away from solely focusing on the financial harm.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Paul believes that it is this perception, or misperception, that is key, citing how police divisions will invariably prioritize more ‘serious’ crimes like burglaries or murders, for example, as the harm is clear, and the public outrage if such crimes weren’t investigated, would be massive. Paul did say that times were slowly changing, though, and that the days of police fraud teams only taking on fraud cases if over a million pounds had been lost, are (in most areas) coming to an end…&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>As a police force, and a society, if we can move toward acknowledging the actual harm that fraud causes, and not just see the financial element, then I think that will make a big difference.</p>Paul Stratton, ex-police officer and current Founder and Lead Trainer at The Fraud Nerd</blockquote>



 The effect of KYC: A blessing and a curse.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>It’s clear that technology and especially AI has facilitated an increase in new types of fraud (eg: deepfakes) in the UK. Thankfully, other types of technology like digital identity verification and eKYC were helping massively in the fight against fraud. However, while it’s important to be aware of new fraud trends, it’s also important to not forget the basics. For many organizations that means ensuring they have a robust and comprehensive KYC (Know Your Customer) process. For Tony, however, that acronym means something completely different.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We do it differently at We Fight Fraud; we call it Know Your Criminal. From a criminal’s perspective, if an organization does have a thorough KYC process in place, then they will often abandon the onboarding, and just go to a company that doesn’t have such a robust KYC process.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, companies that comply with the bare minimum of KYC and AML requirements (in order to onboard customers quicker or offer a more attractive customer experience) are not only putting their business at risk, but also their customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There’s some great technology out there, especially in some of the banking apps, such as liveness scan functionality. When it’s configured correctly and working as part of comprehensive process, it’s great, but sometimes the drive to onboard customers means some businesses skip steps,” explains Tony.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A few years ago, we (We Fight Fraud) tested some organizations’ onboarding processes, and I was able to onboard my face with my colleague’s ID, and then we reversed it and used my ID document with her face. We even tried and succeeded wearing a bright yellow balaclava and were able to onboard with all three accounts, and deposit and withdraw money. It was a really easy process because the process hadn’t been configured properly or the liveness check wasn’t working in the way it should have been, and everyone’s worried about deepfakes! Let me make it clear, this was not IDnow!”&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Biometrics, as Tony said, is very important. Identity verification vendors need to ensure the same face cannot be onboarded twice and the same document cannot be onboarded with another face, and most identity verification vendors cannot do that. You need risk analysis. You need heavy checks, what we call document and selfie checks, but it needs to be a holistic approach.</p>Francisco Martins, Regional Senior Sales Manager at IDnow</blockquote>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Oscar Santolalla: This week I am joined by Craig Ramsay from Omada, here to discuss the importance of identity governance and how it is helping to solve problems in real-world. Stay tuned to find out more.</p>
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar: Hello, for today’s episode about Identity Governance and Administration, mostly known as IGA, we have invited a super interesting guest who is Craig Ramsay. He is a Senior Solution Architect at Omada. He’s from Edinburgh, Scotland. He has worked for Omada for three years and has previously worked at RSA Security and different financial services organisations in the United Kingdom within their identity functions. Outside of work, Craig’s main interests are hiking and travelling. Hello, Craig.</p>
<p>Craig Ramsay: Hey, Oscar. How are you doing?</p>
<p>Oscar: Very good. Nice talking with you.</p>
<p>Craig: Thank you, you too.</p>
<p>Oscar: So, let’s talk about digital identity. As usual, we want to hear more about our guests. Please tell us about yourself and your journey to this world of identity.</p>
<p>Craig: Sure. So, I mean, thank you for the introduction. And I guess, in terms of my journey into identity, it was a little bit by fluke rather than by design. I studied Computer Science and when I graduated, I joined an operational IT graduate scheme. They had recently started a new IAM project, because I think back in 2008, identity and access management, identity governance wasn’t as mature as it is now. It was still kind of seen as an operational IT project rather than an information security principle. So, the drivers there were more about the efficiency, automated provisioning and stuff. But yeah, they were looking for a graduate on that project. That was me.</p>
<p>And apart from a few years where I decided to try what it was like being a policeman, I have worked in identity ever since either for, as you said, financial services organisations doing the work at the coalface or for vendors, either in project delivery or, and you know pre-sales in my solution architect role.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. So, let’s go first with the basics. We have not talked about IGA yet in this podcast, have not focused on that. So, tell us, what is that? What is Identity Governance and Administration, IGA? What is important?</p>
<p>Craig: Sure. So, I mean, identity governance, when you focus on it, at its core, it’s a solution that will ensure the right individuals have the right access for the right reasons at the right time in your organisation. So, it’s protecting the authorisations or the resource assignments within your organisation. And that’s often policy-driven to ensure that all of, and I think the important distinction here when we talk about IGA, that’s traditionally your internal identities, maybe your third parties and contractors.</p>
<p>And then in terms of the overall importance of identity governance, as I said, it’s evolved over the years from being primarily driving and focusing, looking at the provisioning element of things. But as governance has become more and more important, as we start to take a more holistic view at identity, when you look at the adjacent technologies; privileged access management, cloud infrastructure and tailored management, user endpoint, behaviour analytics, identity governance is now really being seen as the kind of control plane across that identity fabric. So, I think it is becoming crucial. And there’s a lot of visibility on the importance of identity now, right up to C-level and maybe wasn’t 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Oscar: You mentioned this concept about identity fabric. Could you also explain a bit more about that in this context?</p>
<p>Craig: Yeah, sure. So, I mean, identity fabric is a term that’s been coined in the last maybe few years by a lot of industry analysts out there. It’s maybe a new phrase, but I think the concept isn’t necessarily that new. So, I think we also hear people calling it an enriched security ecosystem. So, it’s where you look at these solutions in the PAM space, UEBA, your SIEM solutions, etc.</p>
<p>Those traditionally have worked in perhaps a bit more of a siloed manner. And the integrations have been maybe limited and not as seamless. Whereas now, I think this concept of that enriched security ecosystem, that fabric is that these things should be joined up and they should be – the convergence of intelligence and data between those solutions, I think is becoming more and more important so that you can take a holistic approach to reducing your identity-related risk.</p>
<p>Oscar: It is very important, as you said, because there will be anyway, other solutions working together with IGA. Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>What are the main problems, just – I’m sure there are many, but what are the top main problems that IGA solves?</p>
<p>Craig: Yeah, so from a business problem or business challenge perspective, I think the main thing that we always focus on when we’re helping people build their IGA business case, is that we focus on security, compliance and efficiency. So, it’s looking to increase the efficiency and productivity of your end users and their experience, all whilst ensuring that you’ve got increased compliance, increased security and reduced risk.</p>
<p>So, when we look at that, some of those common challenges and problems within that would be reducing the attack surface in the organisation. So, removing unneeded access, adhering to the principle of least privilege, making sure that your identities only have the access they should. I mean, combining those two things is going to reduce the likelihood and the impact of a potential breach in the organisation. It provides you with a unified view of access across the organisation, which a lot of people often haven’t had previously. So, understanding who has what access.</p>
<p>And then there’s the automation around identity lifecycle management. So that’s reducing the time taken to provision your joiners, your movers, your leavers. You’re putting governance and auditing around all of these processes too. So, when people are requesting access, you’re ensuring they’re getting it for the right reasons with the appropriate approval. And you’re cutting down on things like rogue IT administration and stuff like that.</p>
<p>So that’s high level, there is more obviously, but I think those are the high-level ones that we see frequently when we’re speaking to prospects out there in the market.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s a security compliance, and efficiency. Yeah, we’d like to talk about this. But before actually it will be interesting to – so people can understand the broader concept, how we try to imagine in their minds.</p>
<p>If you can see in a real-world example, how work for a typical corporation that uses IGA. So, tell us what are these main processes that you say, mostly employees, right? What are these main processes? Let’s say a new employee goes from beginning until the end.</p>
<p>Craig: Yes. I mean, if we’re going to talk – the phrase we kind of, is from hire to retire. So, when I try and explain this to my friends, maybe aren’t so technically minded when they ask what I do, I sort of give them an example. I say, OK, you join an organisation, and you are working in their HR department. So, from day one, you should have access to be able to log into the network, an email account, access to various file shares to do with HR to enable you to be productive from day one.</p>
<p>So, the IGA solution will help you identify the policies to automate that process, to make sure that you are productive and also make sure that you’ve only got access to what you should. So, if you’re joining HR, you shouldn’t be getting access to any file shares to do with finance, R and D, anything like that. And then as you move around the organisation or your needs change, you should be able to request access that goes through the appropriate channels.</p>
<p>It should be reviewed regularly to make sure that it is still appropriate as you go through your life cycle as an identity in the organisation. If you are promoted or changed departments, that should change automatically in line with those policies too. And if you either leave the organisation, be it permanently or temporary for maternity leave, garden leave, that kind of thing, your IGA solution should then disable or provision that access in a timely manner too, to make sure you’re reducing risk.</p>
<p>So, I mean, those are kind of some of the high-level things that it’s that right access for the right people at the right time for the right reasons is kind of trying to, in a nutshell.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed, that was in a nutshell, very, very easy to understand. Thank you for that. Some of these at least main problems and how these are being solved. But IGA, let’s start with security as you put security first, how IGA is helping with security?</p>
<p>Craig: So, in terms of how it contributes to, you know, maybe security and risk management, I think, it’s providing stronger access control. So, it’s starting to limit access to your sensitive and privileged information. So, when you start to look at either personal identifiable information, financially sensitive information, or privileged access, so this is when you start to look at integrations with adjacent technologies in the PAM space, you’re ensuring that the access control is limiting that access.</p>
<p>Reducing risk. I already talked about the fact that that principle of least privilege means that if there is a breach in the organisation, the identity of the account that’s breached should have only the access needed to do the job that it can, and it shouldn’t have any elevated permissions permanently. The ability to traverse the network or to have a much more impact on that breach should be reduced. You’re also reducing the likelihood by integrating with identity providers to perform strong authentication. And those unneeded accounts or unwanted accounts or unused accounts have been removed over time as well. So that should be helping you reduce the risk and then improve your security posture.</p>
<p>In combination with that as well, if you look at some of the real-time monitoring and identity incidents or detection and prevention you’re starting to see integration with abnormal access patterns, maybe you know impossible logons, for example, we integrate with the Azure identity risk subscription so that’s looking at – user logged on from Edinburgh one minute and they’re trying to log on from Beijing the next. That’s impossible, so that may be an indication of compromise. And then your IGA solution could lock down that account.</p>
<p>So, there’s many ways you could do that and it’s obviously a maturity journey, you need to crawl before you can walk before you can run. But it’s a maturity journey you go on to take a holistic view in reducing your identity related risk.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed. From basic essential functionalities of security to much more advanced like some of the ones you described.</p>
<p>The second one is, of course, we’re interested about compliance is very common that someone comes, start to ask someone from Omada, or from another company even Ubisecure, we also do identity access management and one of the key drivers for them is compliance especially in some industries, it’s more important that. So, tell us about compliance.</p>
<p>Craig: Yeah. So, I mean, when you go out there in the market and you’re speaking to organisations like more and more and more we are speaking to organisations that operate on a global basis. So, you’ve got country or region-specific things like GDPR, SOCS, HIPAA, PCI, DSS etc that are external regulatory compliance frameworks that you must comply with. And you know we keep a track on with things like Schrems II as well. We’re always keeping an eye on that to ensure that the solution we provide is compliant with those things.</p>
<p>But then we’re also helping our customers comply with how they are storing, processing and managing the data in relation to those things. So, if you look at what I often say is that an identity governance solution is a technical translation of your business processes. I think you always have to look at making sure your people process and technology are working in harmony with each other. Technology alone will not resolve your problems. So, I think as part of a wider identity information security strategy you should ensure that your internal policies and standards are created in such a way that it will help you comply with those external regulations if they apply to you.</p>
<p>But you should always look, I think it’s a healthy thing for any organisation across any vertical to have these well-defined policies and standards and ensure that they can comply with those. And as I said that’s where identity governance comes in, because it helps you comply with those things by defining policies that can detect when you’re non-compliant, you’ve got that audit trail. So, it offers – you’ve got transparent auditing for your internal and external users to prove compliance. You will go through regular recertification, attestation, reviews, whatever you want to call it. But that also ensures that you’re demonstrating regular compliance.</p>
<p>And then we already talked about risk management as well, but compliance and risk often do overlap each other. So, you’re identifying and mitigating compliance risks through the definition and enforcement of these policies as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed. So, there is some reports that can be directly created, right, from the IGA system. And that can be directly taken by the compliance officer or whoever requires it, right?</p>
<p>Craig: Yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: The other you mentioned there was the operational efficiency, right? So, as you mentioned, it’s one of the three main problems. Let’s – I’d like to hear more about that as well, how IGA helps.</p>
<p>Craig: Yeah. And I think that’s one of the things that I think separates IGA and the information security market sometimes. That it’s not always focusing on risk reduction and things that are maybe potentially seen as negative. So, you talk about fear and certainty and doubt within the sales process, etc. When you’re doing that, it can often be quite a hard sell because it’s hard to quantify the risk. We can’t help with that. There are formulas out there of calculating the impact of a risk based on, you know, and the likelihood, the cost of the actual breach, etc.</p>
<p>But to bring it back to what you actually asked about from an efficiency perspective, if you look at – if organisations are still heavily manual in their provisioning and their processes, there’s a huge cost to that from areas like your service desk, your operational IT administrators. And often it leads you to the potential for human error as well. So, if you start to automate those things, you see a reduction in numbers of calls to the desk, a number of manually created events and things that are being done. And you can put a pound, euro, dollar sign against that clearly from an efficiency and a cost reduction perspective.</p>
<p>From an end user perspective as well, I mean, it’s always, I think there’s – we’re still trying to shake off the thing that security is a barrier to efficiency. There’s an old adage that I keep using for it regularly that ‘efficiency is insecure, but security is inefficient’. And I don’t think that’s true anymore. I think if you correctly apply your policies in a way that apply the appropriate level of risk, your users – to them, it should be seamless pretty much all the time. They shouldn’t see these processes as an action. They should see it as; they request the access they need, it gets granted to them in a timely manner. When they move around the organisation, a lot of that should happen automatically.</p>
<p>Overall, you should see an increase in productivity. Your line managers aren’t getting frustrated when people join the organisation and they’re having to submit 10 different requests to get them functioning from day one. So, it’s overall operational efficiency and cost reduction. But the productivity. And end user experience of it as a result of a well-delivered IGA program, I think is clear to see as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, cost reduction is clear and is a great reason to buy a product like IGA. Absolutely. Well, if you quantify that to a buyer, it’s like, wow, you can convince him or her very easily. Yeah.</p>
<p>At Ubisecure, we are working with CIAM, and I experienced directly that sometimes requests come from potential customers, and they are looking for identity and access management. And when we review closely, we see that sometimes what they need is IGA or what they need is both IGA and customer identity and access management. So, and in those cases, the customer will need to deal with these two types of system, right? The IGA and CIAM.</p>
<p>So, what is your perspective from your experience working integrating these two types of tools? What are the main things that a buyer bought from business and technical perspective should know at least?</p>
<p>Craig: Yeah, so, I mean, funnily enough, I have worked on a couple of opportunities where Omada and Ubisecure have been working together on those kinds of joint proposals where people are looking for IGA and CIAM. And I think it’s interesting because you can make a very strong case about where the overlap is, but you can also equally make a very strong case about why they should be separate because of the nature of the requirements.</p>
<p>From a CIAM perspective, you’re looking for that seamless, really quick response for all your consumers. And then you should be able to deal with high demand periods when you’re very, very busy, when your consumers are consuming your services. And from an IGA perspective, you’re very much looking at the internal and the control and the level of these privileges that we’re talking about. And there are similarities in the capabilities in terms of, you know, being able to provision in a timely manner, deprovision in a timely manner, ensuring that it’s the level of appropriateness.</p>
<p>So, if you look at it from an integration perspective, a unified management of the identities, I think, could be important whilst treating them differently. I think your end user experience again should be important. So, you’re balancing security and efficiency for your internal and external customers. And then you should be able to have that from a scalability perspective by seeing those things integrate well with each other as well.</p>
<p>I think what is important when you’re speaking to people, understanding their requirements is crucial. So, when they’re talking about, you know, B2B or B2C capabilities and requirements, it’s OK, well, how do you manage your B2B and B2C use cases? Because I think if you take software or technical organisation where their consumers consume their services in a far, far different way to maybe a retail bank or a supermarket. The requirements for end users from that perspective, they’re opening up a loyalty card in a store and you’re processing their personal data in that manner is very, very different to maybe a software company where people are having accounts created and consuming those services.</p>
<p>So, as you can probably tell, not an absolute expert in the CIAM space, but I think whenever those opportunities arise, I think the first important question is why? To understand what it is exactly they’re trying to achieve. And then you map the use cases to the functionality in each of the appropriate solutions to make sure that it’s well matched. There will be overlap in some cases. But as I said, there’s a strong case for when there’s similarities and when they should be managed separately. But ultimately, it’s part of that wider identity fabric we mentioned earlier that it’s kind of all identity in the end, I guess.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. Indeed. As you say, you put it very clear, the importance of really knowing very well the requirements because in a conversation, they might tell you we need this one, two, three, five things and can be also in a written Excel file or whatever. But then you have to go deeply to understand what they meant by saying this B2B or anything, right? So, yeah. Indeed. Thank you for sharing that.</p>
<p>Looking now at the present and future, let’s say, because IGA, as many other types of products have been evolving, are evolving all the time because there are different needs. So what customers are asking today when they are clear that they need an IGA software? What they’re asking today and what are these new problems that need to be solved, are being solved now and need to be solved if they are not solved today?</p>
<p>Craig: Yeah. So, it’s a very timely question. To be fair, we recently released a <a href="https://omadaidentity.com/resources/analyst-reports/state-of-iga/">State of IGA for 2024 report</a> at Omada and we did a webinar discussing the findings of it and it did exactly that it looked at how seriously people were taking identity. And then as you said what are they looking for currently and what are they looking ahead at as well. So, and we just talked about the why and the use cases, so I think, number one that we still see is that the solution they’re looking at adapts and meets to their changing business needs. So, the requirements they have now and the requirements they think they’ll see in the future, it’s the core capabilities must adapt and must comply with that.</p>
<p>We’re seeing an increased importance being put on the ability for the solution to integrate as part of that security ecosystem we talked about. So being able to play nicely with the adjacent technologies across the identity fabric. And then from a connectivity perspective, I mean I talked earlier about a unified view of access across the board, the nature of organisations has changed massively in terms of on-premises systems to a lot more cloud services being consumed. So the ability to extend and integrate with a growing list of different target systems is important for them.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, we do see AI and Machine Learning coming up again and again. And I think when we see that it’s important to take those as separate things. So, from ML perspective, you know, if you look at kind of the role mining capabilities that have been there for some time, recommendations during reviews, recommendations for decisions or decision support for approvals, that stuff has been around for a little while.</p>
<p>From an AI perspective, I mean there’s a huge buzz around what’s happening in AI. Just now Google just released their Gemini Chatbot to rival Chat GPT and that the generative AI stuff and the practical uses of that are going to start to be seen. So, you know integrating generative AI, we have stuff where it’s looking at… you can ask questions about the documentation. So, like what is this object in Omada and like what’s the difference and it’s starting to respond to that so we’re in the process of testing and releasing that.</p>
<p>And then looking further down the line, it’ll be generative AI within the solution. So, user logs in and it says, “What are you trying to do today?” “I need the same access as my colleague Allison.” And it’ll say, “OK she’s got this, this and this. Maybe this is what you need to request.” Or it’s becoming more mature and more complex or sophisticated in what it can do.</p>
<p>So, I think ultimately what people are looking for is ensuring that the solution they have can do what they need to do today and can do it well, it’s scalable, it’s easy to upgrade, it’s easy to maintain. They’re reducing the complexity of management of it so they’re simplifying it from that perspective. But looking ahead they’re needing that generic connectivity that can allow them to connect to any of the systems they have now and ones they want in the future. And then being able to take advantage of the advances in the AI and ML space to improve end user experience and also the maintenance and administration of the system itself for their administrative users.</p>
<p>Oscar: So, you believe that machine learning and the other what we call artificial intelligence is going to be used. It’s to be solving those problems that today customers are bringing up.</p>
<p>Craig: I think it’ll augment, and I think – because that’s the thing people get worried about AI replacing us and whatnot. And maybe somebody using AI more efficiently than you might replace what you’re doing but AI itself can’t and I think any algorithm that – it does do in the output of it still needs human validation particularly in a field like IGA where OK it’s taken a huge amount of data, provided this output and most that might look OK. There’s probably some human context in terms of exactly what that business does that’s needed to say, “Yes I’m still OK with that.” Because ultimately the human’s going to have to be accountable for the decision that’s made. I don’t think and I don’t think we’re going to see algorithms being fined or sent to jail for data breaches you know, I mean.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, a human will go to jail anyway. Hopefully not. Hopefully that doesn’t happen.</p>
<p>Craig: No, hopefully not that’s what we’re trying to prevent. You’re right, we’re trying to prevent that but yes.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly, exactly. Yeah, yeah definitely. Also, one thing you mentioned, it comes back to what we discussed earlier these identity fabrics. Yeah, the way to coexist all this all these tools, IGA, PAM, CIAM all together that’s also, as you say, it’s something that is becoming more important because the environments are getting more complexes.</p>
<p>Final question for you, Craig. For all business leaders listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Craig: So not to spoil the magic of the podcast but we’re recording this just before Christmas towards the end of the year and I don’t know when it’s going to be released but that’s always a time for reflection and looking at where you’re at and where you want to be going. And I think for any business leader right now, I think conducting an identity maturity assessment is something that you can do actionably right now. So, look at where you’re at from an identity maturity perspective and identify gaps that you need to start filling, or priorities looking ahead and aligning that with your business goals, your business risks to ensure that your information security strategy, your policies and standards support your overall business objectives.</p>
<p>And then from that, building a plan of continuous improvement, some milestones as well. And I think any well-delivered IGA project should be doing that. It shouldn’t be looking to boil the ocean or deliver everything at once at big bang. It should be continuous improvement and continuous demonstration of value.</p>
<p>So, I appreciate that might be – that’s not something cutting edge or brand new or innovative, but I think it is really something actionably you can do now to take a step back, assess exactly where you’re at and then build that plan and start to try an action that. Do that at the end of the year, at the start of the year. There’s never a bad time to take a step back and reflect and put that plan in place. But I think that’s definitely something actionable that they could put on their agenda right now to do from today.</p>
<p>Oscar: I couldn’t agree more an assessment, absolutely. It’s something needed. Yeah, it takes time. And it’s very actionable, as you said. Yeah, thank you very much, Craig, for having this very interesting conversation about IGA and other topics, related topics.</p>
<p>So, let us know for people who would like to continue this conversation with you, or follow you, or find out more about what you do, what are the best ways for that?</p>
<p>Craig: Yeah, absolutely. So, you can find me on LinkedIn, Craig, I think my username is Craig86. Obviously, I work at Omada Identity, but that’s, again, if you search for Omada, you’ll find us there. I mentioned our <a href="https://omadaidentity.com/resources/analyst-reports/state-of-iga/">State of IGA 2024 report</a>, you can download that free from omadaidentity.com. And there’s also an on-demand webinar where myself and Rod Simmons, our VP of Product Strategy, discuss that report in-depth.</p>
<p>But yeah, please do feel free to reach out and connect. If you want to chat about all things identity or just want to know a bit more about Omada or myself. But yeah, it’s been a pleasure talking to you, Oscar, as well. Thank you.</p>
<p>Oscar: My pleasure as well. Well, all the best. Happy New Year. Now, this coming the new year, 2024, I wish you all the best for you, Craig, Omada, and everybody who is doing all this great job in the identity space. Thank you. All the best.</p>

<p>In the fast-paced digital era, recent revelations, as stated in <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/moitra-admits-she-gave-login-password-to-hiranandani-denies-taking-cash-9002703/#:~:text=Trinamool%20Congress%20MP%20Mahua%20Moitra,the%20Central%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation.">the report</a>, surrounding the sharing of login credentials by a distinguished Member of Parliament illuminate the pressing need for advanced identity management systems. Traditional methods of securing parliamentary access, such as relying on usernames and passwords, have proven susceptible to human error, phishing attacks, and unintended information sharing. This discourse delves into the transformative capabilities of decentralized identity or Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), and verifiable credentials, underscoring their pivotal role in averting unauthorized access and fortifying the safeguarding of sensitive information.</p><blockquote>This blog explores the potential paradigm shift from traditional security models to the transformative power of passwordless authentication in mitigating security&nbsp;lapses.</blockquote><p>The Limitations of Traditional Authentication</p><p>The traditional reliance on usernames and passwords has proven to be a weak link in the security chain, leaving online systems (parliamentary systems in this case) vulnerable to a spectrum of threats. As technology advances, so do the tactics of malicious actors. Phishing attacks, inadvertent credential sharing, and the complexities of managing multiple intricate passwords have underscored the need for a paradigm shift in authentication methods.</p><p>Unleashing the Potential of Passwordless Authentication</p><p>To address these challenges and fortify security, the adoption of passwordless authentication is a transformative step. Passwordless authentication (combined further with MFA — Multi Factor Authentication) eliminates the need for users to carry physical IDs and remember intricate passwords. Instead, it relies on advanced technologies that enhance security while simplifying the user experience.</p><p>1. Passkey Authentication:</p><p>Passkey authentication stands as a pinnacle of precision and security, utilizing unique physiological markers to verify users. It provides an advanced and secure alternative to traditional passwords, especially when accessing digital systems, ensuring a seamless and highly secure means of&nbsp;access.</p>  More accurate Precision: Passkeys can be dynamically generated using a variety of methods, ranging from advanced cryptographic algorithms to unique user-specific patterns. These passkeys serve as a highly secure substitute for traditional passwords, significantly enhancing the overall security posture of the authentication process.  Elimination of Password Dependency: By eliminating the need for passwords, passkey authentication eradicates vulnerabilities associated with password-based systems, offering a more secure and user-friendly experience.  Resistance to Impersonation: Passkeys exhibit inherent resistance to impersonation, making them a formidable defense against unauthorized access. Even if someone attempts to intercept your passkey, it rapidly becomes useless, making it exceptionally challenging for anyone to gain unauthorized access to your account. This level of security is crucial, especially in the face of continually evolving phishing attacks that aim to trick individuals.  <p>2. Mobile-Based Authentication:</p><p>Mobile-based authentication solutions represent a harmonious convergence of convenience and security. Through dedicated authentication apps, users can seamlessly navigate secure access without the need for traditional passwords.</p>  Consent-based Authentication: Control of Authentication is shifted in the hands of the individual.  Push Notifications: Authentication apps leverage push notifications to deliver secure, real-time authentication requests directly to users’ mobile&nbsp;devices.  <p>3. Hardware&nbsp;Tokens:</p><p>Hardware tokens introduce a tangible and secure element to the passwordless authentication landscape. By leveraging physical devices such as USB tokens or smart cards, parliamentary members can further enhance the robustness of their authentication process.</p>  Secure Authentication Codes: These devices generate secure authentication codes, adding an extra dimension of complexity that enhances the overall security of parliamentary systems&nbsp;access.  Reduced Vulnerability to Cyber Threats: Unlike purely digital authentication methods, hardware tokens are less susceptible to certain cyber threats, providing a resilient defense against various forms of online&nbsp;attacks.  <p>4. Decentralized Identity and Verifiable Credentials:</p><p><a href="https://ayanworks.com/">Decentralized identity</a> and verifiable credentials herald a paradigm shift by empowering individuals, including parliamentarians, with control over their digital identities. This goes beyond the limitations of traditional credentials.</p>  User-Centric Identity: Users gain control over their digital identities, reducing dependence on central authorities and introducing a user-centric approach to identity management.  Selective Personal Privacy Information Disclosure: Verifiable credentials enable selective disclosure of information, ensuring that only necessary details are shared, enhancing privacy and compliance with data protection regulations.<br>Example: Imagine you’re registering for an online platform that requires your age and address. In a traditional setup, you might have to provide your complete identification, including information like your full address. With verifiable credentials, you can share only the necessary details for the registration process. You present a credential confirming you are over 18 without disclosing your address. This way, you selectively share information, maintaining your privacy while fulfilling the platform’s requirements.  Enhanced Security: By reducing reliance on traditional credentials and introducing cryptographic verification, decentralized identity and <a href="https://ayanworks.com/services/decentralized-digital-identity-and-verifiable-credentials">verifiable credentials</a> enhance the overall security posture of parliamentary access.  <p>Advantages of Passwordless Authentication</p><p>1.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Anne Bailey</a></p> Reality and Digital Reality 
<p>Navigating these two worlds isn't always seamless, especially when it involves translating our physical identity documents into the digital sphere. Just recall the last time you witnessed your passport being scanned for digital records when opening a bank account. Going from physical to digital is usually not the most secure or smooth process. Particularly for identity documents, it's a challenge to ensure they maintain their trustworthiness and verifiability in the transfer.</p>
<p>Going from physical to digital has been a bumpy ride, which is why a digital “wallet” populated with digital credentials that are shared in both digital and physical ways is a game changer for individuals and organizations.</p>
 The Game-Changer 
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80803/reusable-verified-identity">reusable verified IDs</a>—a game-changer in seamlessly navigating our digital and physical worlds. A verified identity refers to digital identities that have been verified to describe a real-world identity in digital form, and that the verification remains valid throughout the identity lifecycle. Reuse means that the verified identity can be used in multiple contexts. This ranges from being used by the issuing organization multiple times – like using a verified attribute like facial biometrics as an authentication factor – to enabling the verified identity to be reused by organizations independent of the issuing organization – like an employer accepting a verified education credential for a new hire.</p>
<p>Reusable verified IDs give an opportunity to leap the hurdle posed by the evolving landscape of a multi-reality, multi-wallet, and multi-credential world. Reusable verified identities are held by the individual that it describes, allowing them to travel with the individual through different applications – be it in virtual interactions or in person.</p>
 Interoperability: Critical for Success 
<p>This individually-held verified ID presents a valuable opportunity for organizations to securely and smoothly identify their customers, employees, partners, or things, but requires interoperability across multiple dimensions: with an organization’s own systems, and with other reusable verified identity solutions. The reusable identity community is unique in that from very early on it accepted that in order to achieve mass adoption of the method, it must adhere to commonly agreed upon standards. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> specification is one of the foundations that is being used to ensure interoperability between otherwise competing reusable verified identity solutions.</p>
<p>As technology advances and standards for secure digital identities evolve, the potential for a smoother, safer, and more efficient exchange between our physical and digital identities becomes increasingly tangible. It's a transformative step towards harmonizing our existence across both realms, promising a future where our identities move with ease, irrespective of the world they inhabit.</p>
<p>At the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">EIC</a>, we will be discussing the role that reusable verified identities play for the enterprise, along with many supporting technologies, like <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/insights/decentralized-identity">decentralized identity</a> and identity verification. Join us in Berlin this June!</p>

 The World of Web 3 



<p>Web 3 represents a revolutionary convergence between the physical and digital worlds, triggering an unprecedented cultural, technological and mindset transformation. This new digital era not only redefines our interaction with technology, but also reshapes our perception of digital identity, ownership, security and community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By integrating advanced technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence and augmented reality, Web 3 facilitates immersive and personalized experiences, expanding the scope of our digital existence and redefining the structure of our social and economic relationships. This innovative fusion of the physical and digital not only enhances our daily lives, but also drives a mindset shift towards greater interconnectedness and global collaboration.</p>



<p>Having said that, the distinction between Verifiable Information and Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) is extremely important for Web 3. While SSI focuses on the self-management of personal digital identity, allowing users to control and distribute their own information, Verifiable Information has a broader scope. This concept extends to areas such as records, customs, security and contracts, where authenticity and verification are critical. Here, Verifiable Information is not limited to personal identity, but encompasses any data or information that can be used to verify the authenticity of a person’s identity.</p>



<p>In other words, SSI is a very relevant use case within the immense potential of Verifiable Information.</p>



Digital Identity in Web3



<p>Both systems ensure greater efficiency and speed in processes such as data verification, thus reducing operational costs. They also improve security and trust in digital transactions, which is essential in an increasingly interconnected and technology-dependent world. In short, these technologies – properly implemented – offer greater value and a better experience at a lower cost in a world that is already embracing these technological innovations in various sectors.</p>



 “Digital self-sovereignty,” “Decentralized Identity,” “Blockchain Identity?” 



<p>Defining the concept of “sovereignty” in the context of SSI presents a particular complexity in addressing human and non-human identities. Inspired by politics, sovereignty implies control and power over others. By exploring the notion of “self-sovereignty” and “autonomy” in these identities, it is intended to go beyond mere individual data management.</p>



<p>While terms such as “decentralized identity” or “blockchain identity” are used, self-sovereignty implies the autonomous issuance of identities while ensuring their portability and verification independently of specific networks or blockchains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although other concepts, such as “self-managed data,” might apply in certain contexts, none fully captures the duality of being self-issued and, at the same time, globally portable and verifiable.</p>



<p>Whether using terms such as “self-sovereignty,” “autonomy,” “decentralized identity,” or “blockchain identity,” the essence is quite similar: the aspiration is to decentralize, protect, and empower users by granting them full control over their identities. Autonomy of issuance, combined with portability and independent verifiability, represents our fundamental commitment to providing a more secure and empowering approach to managing identities, both human and non-human.</p>



 SSI Use Cases 



<p>The following use cases demonstrate the versatility and positive impact that Verifiable Information and SSI can have in a variety of industries, driving significant advancement in efficiency, security and user experience.</p>



 
 Customs: streamlining identity verification processes for the clearance of goods, improving security and reducing waiting time. 



 Contracts: facilitates authentication of the parties involved, ensuring the validity and transparency of agreements. 



 Medical and legal records: enables secure and controlled access to sensitive information, maintaining privacy and confidentiality. 



 Banking: improves security in financial transactions, reducing fraud, high cybersecurity costs and identity theft. 



 Enterprises: optimizes employee and customer identity management, improving operational efficiency. 



 Security and cybersecurity: strengthens authentication and authorization mechanisms, protecting against unauthorized access. 



 Identity recognition: applied in access control and customer verification, improving user experience and security. 



 Public and private services: Simplifies registration processes and access to services, guaranteeing the integrity of user data. 
 







 As a conclusion 



<p>This article has explored the immense potential of Web 3 in merging the physical and the digital. We have differentiated between <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Information</a> and SSI, highlighting their varied use cases. We also clarified concepts such as “decentralized identity” and “sovereignty” in the <a href="https://extrimian.io/resources/blog/the-global-decentralized-id-self-sovereign-identity-journey/">context of SSI</a>.</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 24th December to 7th&nbsp;January <p>Welcome to our first 2024 overview of the regulatory landscape worldwide. In this Veriscope Regulatory Recap edition, we focus on a number of key developments — from Nigeria’s policy turnaround to the UAE’s stringent AML&nbsp;updates.</p><p>Let’s dive&nbsp;in!</p> Global Crypto Regulatory Developments <p>As the world of digital assets continues to evolve, regulatory landscapes are shifting in response. From Nigeria’s reversal of crypto bans to the UAE’s new AML regulations, nations are acknowledging the significance of these emerging&nbsp;markets.</p><p>Nigeria’s Regulatory Reversal: In a notable policy shift, Nigeria’s Central Bank has lifted its ban on cryptocurrency transactions. This move aligns with efforts by the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission to establish a digital asset framework. Banks and financial institutions are now authorized to provide services to crypto firms under stringent regulatory adherence, marking a significant change from the February 2021 prohibition.</p><p>Indonesia’s Exchange Mandate: Indonesia is steering its crypto exchanges towards a centralized bourse, the Commodity Future Exchange (CFX). The move aims to streamline crypto transactions for tax purposes and improve market oversight. With a burgeoning number of crypto traders surpassing stock traders, this mandate could reshape Indonesia’s digital asset landscape.</p><p>China’s Call for Global Crypto Cooperation: China’s Central Bank has proposed a six-point blueprint for DeFi security, emphasizing global collaboration. Through this initiative, the Chinese Central Bank seeks to target insider trading and volatility risks, proposing enhanced supervisory measures and regulatory harmonization.</p><p>UAE Adopts FATF Travel Rule: The UAE is fortifying its anti-money laundering efforts by incorporating the FATF Travel Rule in digital asset transactions. With this approach, the UAE aims to enhance transaction transparency and combat illicit activities, signaling the UAE’s commitment to a stringent regulatory environment.</p><p>These developments reflect a global trend towards integrating digital assets into formal economic structures. As nations grapple with the challenges and opportunities presented by cryptocurrencies, the global financial community watches keenly. This period of regulatory recalibration and adaptation will likely shape the future trajectory of the digital asset industry.</p> Indonesia Imposes New Bourse Registration Directive on Crypto Exchanges <p>Indonesia marks a significant shift in its cryptocurrency framework by introducing a mandatory registration requirement for all crypto exchanges with the newly established national bourse, the Commodity Future Exchange (CFX). This directive aims to address the rapidly growing interest in cryptocurrency within the country, where the number of crypto traders surpasses that of stock&nbsp;traders.</p><p>The impact of this move on the crypto ecosystem is multifaceted. Positively, it could enhance investor confidence by fostering a more regulated and secure trading environment. This structure potentially increases global investor interest and legitimizes the crypto market in Indonesia.</p><p>On the downside, the requirement for registration and adherence to new guidelines might pose challenges for smaller exchanges and startups, possibly hindering innovation and competition in the sector. Furthermore, the focus on transaction tracking for tax purposes raises concerns about privacy among crypto enthusiasts.</p> UAE Tightens Crypto Oversight with New AML and Travel Rule Adherence <p>The UAE’s Financial Services Regulatory Authority <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-uae">has updated its Anti-Money Laundering rules</a>, incorporating provisions for digital assets.

 The Commission for the Protection of Minors in the Media (KJM) confirms that IDCheck.io, the AI-based identity verification solution, is suitable for age verification in accordance with the youth protection treaty in Germany 



<p>Munich, January 9, 2024 – IDnow, a leading identity verification platform provider in Europe, today announces that its fully automated, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/">AI-based solution IDCheck.io</a> has been positively assessed by the German Commission for the Protection of Minors in the Media (<a href="https://www.kjm-online.de/">Kommission für Jugendmedienschutz, KJM</a>) for the use of age verification. With this latest confirmation, IDcheck.io joins the extensive list of IDnow solutions already rated as positive by the KJM for age verification. Previously, the videochat-based VideoIdent, AutoIdent, IDnow eID and the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">IDnow Wallet</a> were among the solutions approved for age verification by the Commission.</p>



<p>Protection of minors via age verification systems</p>



<p>The German Interstate Treaty on the Protection of Minors in the Media (Jugendmedienschutz-Staatsvertrag, JMStV) stipulates that certain unsuitable content, such as AO-rated video and browser games, gambling offers or pornography, may only be distributed online if the provider ensures that it is only available for adult user groups. In order to ensure such closed, adult-only user groups, age verification systems (AV systems) are used. The KJM publishes a list of evaluated age verification systems which fulfil the legal requirements to provide legal and planning security for providers and operators of such content.</p>



<p>“There are corners of the internet that contain content best unseen by child or adolescent eyes. However, curious young minds will often go searching for these, so there needs to be a method of gatekeeping on these websites that goes beyond asking a user to simply click a button to confirm or deny their adult status, which is what the KJM stands for in Germany. With IDCheck.io, IDnow is pleased to offer yet another solution for online age verification, which has been rated positively by the KJM. With our broad range of identity verification methods, IDnow remains a strong partner for the protection of minors, especially in the gaming and gambling space,“ says Rayissa Armata, Director Global Regulatory &amp; Government Affairs at IDnow.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>With employee identity risk and fraud on the rise — to the point that the <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA220628">FBI has issued a public warning</a> — it’s crucial to ensure that employees are who they say they are. Is the person you interviewed the same person you actually hired? Is the person logging in a legitimate employee? Is the person requesting a credential reset in fact the owner of those credentials? Robust identity proofing helps you answer those questions.&nbsp;</p>  
 Understanding Identity Proofing and Why It’s Needed  
<p>What is identity proofing? Identity proofing is the process of verifying and validating the identity of individuals accessing digital systems. It ensures that the identity exists and that the person claiming the identity is the real owner. Employee identity proofing is a fundamental aspect of safeguarding sensitive information, intellectual property and overall organizational integrity. It addresses one of the major security weaknesses in most IAM systems — the fact that authentication only validates that the credentials being used to access systems are valid. It cannot ensure that the person using those credentials is the legitimate holder, and further that the legitimate holder is actually who they claim to be.</p> 
 Workplace Identity Fraud Escalating  
<p>The rise of remote work and the increase in attacks on identity processes underscore the critical need for reliable methods of verifying and validating employee identities. Using credentials obtained by brute force attacks, phishing, AitM attacks, social engineering and other methods,&nbsp; cybercriminals can readily gain unauthorized access to systems and networks. Sometimes the attacks aren’t particularly sophisticated, but exploit gaps in verification processes to perpetrate identity fraud.</p> 
<p>Consider the case of the <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/lessons-from-the-mgm-attack">attack on MGM resorts</a>. Armed with publicly available details, attackers impersonated an employee and convinced the IT help desk to provide them with credential access to the corporate IAM service. From there they could wreak havoc, stealing sensitive data and deploying ransomware that shut down operations for over a week.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>MGM Resorts attack flow</p> 
<p>By implementing stringent identity proofing protocols, organizations can ensure regulatory compliance and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and other malicious activities.</p> 
 Key Components of Identity Proofing for the Workforce  
<p>Worker identity proofing should include multiple verification methods to increase the security of the proofing process. The methods used will depend on the situation and context. Ideally all components are connected both to each other and to your other <a href="https://www.hypr.com/solutions/workforce-identity-assurance">workforce identity security</a> tools and systems.</p> 
 Document Verification  
<p>Document verification determines whether a document — such as a passport, driver’s license or other official document — is authentic or not. This can be done either in person or digitally. Your document verification process should include technology that is able to detect forgeries or alterations.</p> 
 Location Detection  
<p>Location detection is an important aspect of online identity proofing. Is the employee in the geolocation you expect them to be? If not, this may require further investigation. It’s important, however, that your location detection adheres to global regulations.</p> 
 Facial Recognition With Liveness Detection  
<p>Facial recognition uses facial biometrics to determine if a person matches the identity they are claiming. Usually the person will take a selfie as part of the identity proofing process. Liveness detection is a critical feature when using facial verification in order to detect spoofing tactics such as a photo, video playback or even a mask.</p> 
 Live Video Verification  
<p>Live video verification adds an additional layer of security to the identity proofing process. It takes place face-to-face over a video conference, between the employee and their supervisor or an authorized agent and includes questions and actions designed to confirm liveness and detect signs of spoofing or coercion.</p> 
 Chat Verification  
<p>In some cases, such as a lower risk scenario, chat verification may be sufficient. It also may be used as part of a more comprehensive identity proofing flow. Effective chat verification combines AI and human interaction.</p> 
 Attestation  
<p>Attestation by a responsible party of the identity proofing results is a critical part of the process. This creates an official trail for audit and compliance purposes. Your identity proofing software should retain the attested results, not the employee’s sensitive data.</p> 
<p>The integration of these diverse methods creates a comprehensive identity proofing ecosystem, enhancing cybersecurity measures and safeguarding organizations from unauthorized access and data breaches.</p> 
 NIST Identity Proofing Guidelines&nbsp;  
<p>Identity proofing holds a critical role in IAM. Under the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Digital Identity Guidelines, <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63a.pdf">NIST SP 800-63-A</a> covers enrollment and identity proofing. It outlines a general identity proofing flow and describes three different security levels based on the strength of the type of evidence gathered as well as the verification processes used.</p> 
<p><a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-identity-assurance">Identity Assurance</a> Level 1 (IAL1): This level does not require the user to be linked to a known, established real-life identity. It uses self-asserted attributes — in other words, no identity proofing.</p> 
<p>Identity Assurance Level 2 (IAL2): IAL2 introduces the requirement for strong proof connecting the user to a valid, real-world identity. It supports a wide range of identity proofing methods, allowing for either remote or in-person validation. This includes government-issued documentation as well as biometrics;&nbsp; proofing cannot rely on knowledge-based techniques.</p> 
<p>Identity Assurance Level 3 (IAL3): IAL3 is the strictest identity proofing level, requiring user presence and biometric verification.</p> 
 Best Practices for Effective Workforce Identity Proofing  
<p>Many companies verify a worker’s identity at the time of hire and stop there. Make sure your identity proofing strategy addresses all key workplace scenarios and times of increased risk of fraud. Below are some of the most critical moments to address.</p> 
 Employee Onboarding  
<p>Before giving any new hire access to corporate systems and data, HR teams need to ensure that the person they are onboarding has a credible identity and is the legitimate owner of the identity they are claiming. They also need to verify that the new employee is in fact the person that was interviewed for the role. This means elements of identity proofing need to come into play before a candidate steps a real or virtual foot into the office. It’s also crucial to securely tie the new employee’s verified identity to IAM systems using non-phishable methods.</p> 
 Credential Resets  
<p>In many organizations, identity proofing stops at HR’s door. The newly minted employee is provisioned with a digital identity and from that point on verification involves validation of that digital identity — there is no process for ensuring it ties back to the real world holder of that identity. This leaves them vulnerable to social engineering attacks that target the credential reset process. For example, an attacker with the right information can claim to be an employee with a new phone that needs to enroll in MFA on their new device.</p> 
 Changing Roles  
<p>A change in roles often provides an employee with access to systems previously out of reach. Before granting those elevated privileges, organizations should make sure that the role change is legitimate and the user is who they claim to be.&nbsp;</p> 
 Elevated Detected Risk  
<p>When identity monitoring systems detect potential risks, re-proofing may be indicated depending on the risk level and threat type. For example, if a user attempts to log in from a device that is not in proximity to their computer or engages in other suspicious activity, they could be automatically prompted to provide proof that they are the valid credential holder.</p>

  <p>Today, I’m excited to share with you several new developments in the journey towards phishing-resistant authentication for all users!&nbsp; This isn’t just essential for compliance with <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">Executive Order&nbsp;14028 on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity</a> but is increasingly critical for the safety of all the orgs and users who bet on digital identity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TL;DR? Here’s the cheat sheet!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Microsoft Authenticator announces phishing-resistant passkey support. 
 Microsoft Authenticator is FIPS 140 compliant on all platforms. 
 More configuration options for PIV/CAC authentication. 
 FIDO2 support for iOS and MacOS applications. 
 Managed policies help you with “secure by design, secure by default.” 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Details below!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Microsoft Authenticator is becoming phishing-resistant! 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/identity-at-microsoft-ignite-securing-access-in-the-era-of-ai/ba-p/2747279">announced</a> at Ignite 2023, in the first half of 2024, Microsoft Entra ID users will soon be able to register and sign in with device-bound passkeys managed in the Microsoft Authenticator app. This is a cost-effective, phishing-resistant credential available to anyone with the Authenticator app! Passkeys provide you with the latest and greatest security enhancements that will come to the FIDO standard over the next many years – and Authenticator integration lets you take advantage of the security innovations and advanced features Authenticator provides.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Passkey managed in the Microsoft Authenticator app</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To further enhance Microsoft Authenticator and help customers meet compliance requirements, the Authenticator App on Android is now FIPS-140 compliant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beginning with version 6.2310.7174, Microsoft Authenticator for Android is&nbsp;compliant with Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS 140) for all Microsoft Entra authentications using phishing-resistant device-bound passkeys, push multifactor authentications (MFA), passwordless Phone Sign-In (PSI), and time-based one-time passcodes (TOTP).&nbsp;For organizations using Intune Company Portal, install version 5.0.6043.0 in addition to the latest version of the Authenticator for FIPS compliance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Microsoft Authenticator app on iOS is already FIPS-140 compliant, as announced in December of 2022.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Improved configurability for organizations that uses PIV / CAC 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the last year since we announced the General Availability of Certificate-based Authentication (CBA), we’ve seen an increase of over 850% in Entra ID CBA usage for US Government customers. CBA helps our customers in their Zero Trust journey, migrating from on-premises IdPs such as AD FS, while continuing to provide familiar end user experience using PIV / CAC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We continue our investments in cloud-based CBA with recently added capabilities that allow you to tailor authentication policies by certificate and resource type, as well as user group. You can now select certificate strength for different users, use CBA with other methods for multifactor or step-up authentication, and set high affinity (strong) binding for either the entire tenant or by user group.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Additional phishing-resistant authentication options for mobile: FIDO2 support for iOS and macOS applications 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the summer of 2023, we announced support for <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/advancing-modern-strong-authentication/ba-p/3773135">FIDO2 authentication on iOS and macOS web browsers</a>. Today, we’re excited to announce the public preview of FIDO2 authentication on iOS and macOS . With this release, users who have Microsoft Authenticator installed on iOS or Microsoft Intune Company Portal installed on macOS can sign into Microsoft applications using a FIDO2 security key. This feature is available now on iOS and will be available early next year on macOS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FIDO2 authentication is also available in MSAL-enabled third-party apps on iOS and macOS that meet the requirements listed in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/support-fido2-authentication">Support passwordless authentication with FIDO2 keys in apps you develop</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Learn more about the supported platforms <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/fido2-compatibility">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Adopting secure defaults, aligned with “Secure by design, secure by default” approach outlined by CISA 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Microsoft announced the <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/11/02/secure-future-initiative-sfi-cybersecurity-cyberattacks/">Secure Future Initiative</a>. As part of this initiative, we will start <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/?p=132044">Auto-rollout of Conditional Access policies</a>. These initiatives align with the “Secure by design, Secure by default” approach called out by The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), to ensure consumers can trust the safety and integrity of the technology that they use every day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe that tackling cybersecurity challenges is a collective effort. We're dedicated to collaborating closely with government agencies, security experts, and the broader community to strengthen our collective defenses against cyber threats. Our aim is to provide government customers with the tools and knowledge they need to stay ahead of evolving risks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our recent releases and ongoing commitment to enhancing cybersecurity will support our broad set of customers, including the U.S. government customers who are working to meet the Executive Order. Together, we can build a more secure digital future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Digital wallets are necessary but not nearly sufficient for effective verifiable credentials. Here I look at the essential details for verifying credentials that have nothing to do with wallets.</p>
<p>We use metaphors to make sense of novel phenomena in everyday terms. In technology, successful metaphors reduce non-intuitive concepts to concise, clear mental images. Metaphors shape how we think about things (noting that shape is itself a metaphor!)</p>
<p>Really catchy metaphors can capture our imagination to the extent that we stop thinking about how things really work. A powerful metaphor can distract instead of illuminate.</p>
<p>For example, the passport metaphor has dominated digital identity. In the early 2000s, Microsoft even named its e-commerce single-sign-on service “Passport”. It has taken the industry many years to wean itself off the single global identifier implied by that metaphor and graduate to a more nuanced model of contextualised credentials (see also “<a href="https://lockstep.com.au/no-such-thing-as-a-passport">No such thing as a passport</a>”).</p>
<p>So now I wonder if the popular metaphor of digital wallets is similarly diverting attention from the important work that needs to be done to make verifiable credentials truly verifiable at scale. </p>
<p>Renowned payments and digital identity commentator David Birch sees digital wallets as “<a href="https://dgwbirch.com/speaker/">the central organising principle for consumers [in the metaverse]</a>”. But I think the real organisation of payments and credentials is done well outside the digital wallet.</p>
<p>Digital wallets are certainly necessary, as personally controlled stores of credentials and secure carriers of our all-important private keys. The wallet is the graphical user interface to what is essentially a container of credentials and private keys. But wallets are not nearly sufficient to enable digital credentials to be meaningful and verifiable. If we focus too much on the container then we may overlook where the hard work remains to be done.</p>
 What are wallets for? 
<p>The wallet metaphor of course is all about cards. Our traditional wallets hold lots of them: payment cards, driver licences, government and professional IDs, employee IDs, transit cards, health cards, student cards, loyalty cards, club membership cards and so on. Most of these are candidates for analog-to-digital conversion.&nbsp; Indeed, payment cards and driver licences are the leading examples of cryptographically verifiable credentials. The Apple and Google wallets started with payments and are now adding driver licences (slowly and carefully).</p>
<p>Digital wallets will become quasi-standard doorways into much of cyberspace, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202302/digital-wallets-to-be-as-essential-as-browsers-openwallet-foundation-calls-for-builders">perhaps as crucial as web browsers</a> have been. With big tech poised to monopolise the way consumers exercise their digital credentials, the “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbirch/2023/02/01/the-wallet-wars-are-not-about-money-they-are-about-identity/?sh=149889fe314a">wallet wars</a>” are looming.</p>
 The real action is outside the wallet and beyond the cards! 
<p>Credit cards are a modern-day miracle when you think about it: I can present an Australian credit card to almost any merchant in almost any country to buy most anything.&nbsp; The merchant doesn’t know me but what really matters is it doesn’t need to know my bank either or anything at all about the Australian financial system.</p>
<p>How is it possible? The answer illuminates the real role of the card and wallet, and the unsung power of the business networks.</p>
<p>A credit card is just a container of data which is issued by a customer’s bank and which needs to be conveyed to the merchant’s bank. It is clearly one instance of a general pattern: the card carries data about its holder, provided by a recognised issuer, to be presented to and ingested by a relying party.</p>
<p>But there is more to the story than carrying data. The essential complexity goes unnoticed by cardholders and extends way beyond the card:</p>
 
 card manufacture and customisation, in specially managed secure production plants 
 secure distribution and activation of cards (not to mention the test of the card lifecycle including renewal, replacement and retirement) 
 anti-counterfeiting technology to assure the merchant that the card presented is valid 
 a choice of standardised interface technologies for presenting cards to diverse retail systems (e.g. merchant terminals, kiosks, and remote card-not-present arrangements) 
 and above all, the legal and business arrangements whereby branded cards are accepted by merchants and payments then cleared between customer and merchant banks. 
 
<p>So a wallet is just a container of containers.</p>
 The network effects 
<p>Card schemes are more about business networks than the cards.</p>
<p>A card scheme operates a two-sided network which caters to both cardholders and merchants, via their respective banks. The scheme sets a raft of participation rules for the issuance of cards to customers and the acceptance of cards by merchants.</p>
<p>Cardholders and merchants are joined to the scheme via their respective banks. An issuing bank creates credit accounts for its customers and issues branded cards under a given scheme, such as Mastercard or Visa.</p>
<p>An acquiring bank provides merchants with credit card acceptance equipment and/or software services under a standardised merchant services agreement and takes care of the payment processing.</p>
<p>(A credit card acquirer does a whole lot more, such as providing payment guarantees, deposit timing, additional layers of security and fraud controls, to name a few, but these extras do not concern us right now; the current discussion is just about card acceptance.)</p>
 What made digital credit cards so much better? 
<p>The credit card has just one job to do: securely convey a copy of the cardholder’s details to the merchant together with signals to give the merchant confidence that the customer presenting the card is legitimate.</p>
<p>Over several decades, credit card technology has evolved to make the presentation of cardholder details more reliable, especially in regards to theft and illicit replay or tampering.</p>
<p>Old fashioned magnetic stripe cards store cardholder data in a short ferrite tape, much like a cassette tape stores music. There is no encryption; the data is held in a standard plaintext format, making it easily scanned and copied using commonplace equipment. This is what enabled large scale criminal skimming and carding to take over customer accounts.</p>
<p>Chip cards are very different, in two respects. Firstly, they carry cardholder details in a data structure that is digitally signed by the issuing bank when the card is manufactured, thus proving that each credit card is original and genuine.</p>
<p>And secondly, when cardholder details are transferred to a merchant terminal in a transaction, they are dynamically signed by the chip, thus proving that the card has been unlocked (it won’t operate to produce the signed transaction otherwise) and is therefore likely to be in the right hands.</p>
<p>The static and dynamic cryptographic functions make counterfeiting or copying chip cards infeasible.</p>
<p>Upgrading credit cards from magnetic stripe to chip was the single most important enhancement in the history of card payment security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mobile virtual credit cards share the same cryptographic security techniques as chip cards, but the crucial details are hidden from the cardholder; all they see is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph">skeuomorphic</a> wallet user interface and its familiar images.</p>
 The lessons of credit cards for verifiable credentials 
<p>As mentioned, digital wallets are getting all the attention in the move to cryptographically verifiable credentials.&nbsp; But why do we spend so much time designing digital experience and trust frameworks around a component that has played no part in system security?</p>
<p>Why do we bother with the wallet metaphor at all? Real world wallets are actually an uninteresting part of the payments system.</p>
<p>It is the credit card network that critically enables digital credentials from vetted issuers to be securely loaded to a customer’s card.</p>
<p>Being prepared to accept credentials requires extensive arrangements to be made in advance, including knowing what types of credentials to expect, and having the right public keys with which to verify the various digital signatures on the credentials and the presentations.</p>
<p>It’s this last aspect that needs the most attention for verifiable credentials to scale. Verifiable credentials need to be legible when the RP is at arms’ length from the issuer and can’t afford to make its own arrangements regarding all the different credentials and issuers, and which of them are fit for purpose.</p>
<p>I agree wallets are important, yet carrying cards is the easy part of payments and credentialing systems. The wallet metaphor does not illuminate much of the real problem to be solved in verifiable credentials, omitting the essential underlying infostructure needed to (a) load the right verifiable credentials from the many issuers coming onto the market, and (b) make credentials legible at scale.</p>

 An increase in candidate fraud is presenting a real risk for the HR industry, especially for remote recruiters. We delve into the history of document fraud, and explain how businesses can protect themselves from the different types of recruitment fraud. 



 



<p>In 1934, Albert Einstein wrote: “Concern for man and his fate must always form the chief interest of all technical endeavors.” Although he was likely referring to his discoveries of the atom, and what, just a few years later, was to become the atomic bomb, Einstein’s quote also sums up the responsibility of those who create and rely on the latest technological advances. Thanks to the rapid pace at which the world has gone digital, technological innovation has produced risks that must be navigated in every industry, even in the recruitment sector.  </p>



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/document-fraud/">Document fraud</a> has always existed, from the earliest days of identity documents. For example, in 16th century France during the reign of François I the emergence of the first attempts to curb this already widespread scourge started occurring when people falsified their identity papers to avoid paying taxes. According to Christophe Naudin in his publication Document fraud: the explosion of a cross-disciplinary crime at the crossroads of all forms of trafficking he states,&nbsp;“To avoid paying tithes and gabelles (taxes for the church and for common goods), Jean du Moulin, who generally signed his name with a simple anonymous cross, claimed to be called Jean Meunier or Jean Blanc or Leblanc, or even Moulinier, swearing before God and all his saints that he had fulfilled his duties.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Document fraud is one of those reprehensible acts that persist and mutate constantly, despite the inventiveness and ongoing technological advances developed to curb it. Thanks to the democratization of digital tools, the explosion in mobility and widespread access to the Internet, this type of crime is becoming increasingly popular among unscrupulous individuals who are prepared to falsify documents and information to achieve their ends. And the HR industry is no exception…</p>



 Understanding the different types of hiring fraud.&nbsp; 



<p>To grasp the impact of document fraud on recruiters and companies likely to hire a fraudster, it is necessary to understand the risks, and therefore the types of fraud.</p>



 Application fraud. 



<p>Application fraud refers to any information provided by the candidate that is invented or altered by him or her. Examples include, falsifying the ability to speak a foreign language, lying about experience abroad or exaggerating involvement in a project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Difficult to identify when reading a CV or application file, application fraud is nevertheless easily detectable when the candidate is confronted with his or her lie during an interview or the first few days on the job. For example, a simple foreign-language proficiency test during the interview will suffice to reveal the fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Often of low intensity, application fraud is extremely widespread: in 2022, 62% of recruiters in France admitted to having already observed falsified CVs during recruitment. However, application fraud often only materializes through slight alterations, with the “enormities” rarely going unnoticed. The final risk for the recruiter is therefore relatively low.</p>



 Document fraud.&nbsp; 



<p>Document fraud involves the creation or use of falsified documents by the candidate. This may include forging identity documents, falsifying diplomas or forging credentials. It differs from application fraud in that the fraudulent candidate will attempt to “justify” the invented information by producing documents attesting to the accuracy of the lie in question. In some cases, it may also involve identity theft. According to the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, a fraud scheme can <a href="https://www.acfe.com/-/media/files/acfe/pdfs/rttn/2022/2022-report-to-the-nations.pdf">last 12 months before detection and costs companies a loss of $8,300 a month</a>. </p>



<p>This method of fraud is becoming increasingly widespread, facilitated by the use of technological tools (not to mention the use of Artificial Intelligence). Today, easy access to DarkWeb platforms, for example, enables anyone to obtain false papers for just a few hundred euros. Such is the democratization that it is now possible to find resellers of false identity papers on mainstream applications, such as SnapChat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Document fraud, unlike application fraud, is a major challenge for a growing number of institutional and private players. Mainly centered around the falsification and creation of false identity documents (CNI, passport, etc.) or proof of identity (invoices, transport tickets, etc.), it presents a significant multi-factorial risk for end employers:</p>



<p>Legal: the irregularity of certain documents, particularly identity documents, can lead to severe legal consequences for the final employer: closure of the company, criminal liability of the director or even substantial fines. In France, regulations place the responsibility for verifying identity and professional documents on the employer, particularly in the event of an incident involving the fraudulent employee.</p>



<p>Reputational: The reputational stakes for companies that fall victim to fraud can be substantial. Organizations that are perceived as exploiting vulnerable, irregular or law-breaking workers risk damage to their brand image, which is sometimes more damaging than a simple fine.</p>



<p>Regulatory: In some sectors, companies require licenses or authorizations to operate. The employment of illegal workers can lead to the revocation of these licenses or authorizations, and seriously hinder company operations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Due to document fraud having been identified as a critical issue by a growing number of players, there has been an increase in the number of training courses and job openings aimed at combating it, both within institutions and private companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because it is the main threat facing recruiters today, document fraud and its implications for recruitment processes will be the main focus.</p>



 Document fraud and legal obligations.&nbsp; 



<p>When it comes to recruitment in the EU, each country is regulated by law, and can be subject to regular checks by various government bodies. For example, the recruitment of an illegal worker can have a severe impact on a company, even if the latter demonstrates in good faith that it was unaware of the fraud.&nbsp;Plus, it is the company’s right to <a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/human-resources/employment-contracts/employment-terms/index_en.htm">ask a potential employee their abilities such as foreign language skills</a> as long as they correlate to the job posting.</p>



<p>This legislative and jurisprudential framework is constantly evolving and requires dedicated regulatory monitoring.&nbsp;Even in the UK, Crowe, a UK-based accountancy firm along with the University of Portsmouth, <a href="https://www.crowe.com/uk/croweuk/-/media/Crowe/Firms/Europe/uk/CroweUK/PDF-publications/The-Real-Cost-of-Recruitment-Fraud-2019.ashx?la=en-GB&amp;hash=1EFDFE2F6EEFFC4C71781638A0B8A354DAA00404">carried out Resume and CV checks</a> of an unnamed organization’s 5,000 employees and found 80% contained discrepancies, with 20% using inflated job titles and 12% falsifying educational grades.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To deal with these threats while complying with European regulations (notably the GDPR), technological solutions have emerged to facilitate the work of recruiters. Optical character recognition (OCR) technology is at the heart of these solutions. But the democratization of technologies enabling the falsification or creation of documents that can be used as proof of identity (passports, proof of residence, licenses, etc.) now requires the implementation of more robust, granular and detailed processes and solutions, in order to get to know candidates properly.</p>



<p>To this end, IDnow has developed various technical solutions to respond to these new threats:&nbsp;</p>



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/capture-solutions/">Real-time document capture</a>: using a web or mobile SDK that can be easily integrated into an existing interface, this increases the level of security while saving considerable time thanks to its many advantages (real-time photo or video capture, fluid, multi-channel UX, NFC chip reading, etc.).&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/identity-verification-service/">Facial recognition and live detection</a>: biometric face capture enables us to use a video verification to ensure that the user is who they claim to be on their documents.&nbsp;&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/verification-documents/">Instant document verification</a>: as a stand-alone API or integrated into an architecture, it enables virtually instantaneous verification (averaging 12 seconds) of the authenticity and validity of documents submitted.&nbsp;  



<p>These solutions enable recruiters to detect document fraud, and are capable of detecting the most elaborate forgeries.</p>



 Identifying the right solution: what are the key criteria?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Numerous solutions, such as those from IDnow, have appeared over the last 10 years to enable recruiters to work while protecting their companies from fraud. But are all solutions the same?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finding the right solution involves more than a simple economic calculation. It must offer a number of advantages, which can be prioritized as follows:</p>



  Reliability: The reliability of the tests carried out by the identity verification solution is the main criterion recruiters should aim for. The solution must provide its user with guarantees as to the results provided.&nbsp;  Transversality: The solution should incorporate the latest technologies for advanced fraud detection, with the option of live detection, face-matching or state-of-the-art occlusion techniques. It should also include the option of additional expert checks.&nbsp;  Flexibility: The solution should offer a wide range of options in terms of the type and range of documents covered, enabling checks to be customized according to the candidate’s profile, the documents provided, the employer’s expectations and the relevant regulatory framework.&nbsp;  Speed: It’s important that the solution delivers fast, near-instantaneous results, so as not to overburden the recruitment process and congest the recruitment department.&nbsp;  Rationality: The solution should meet the economic constraints of the recruiter and its organization, and be adapted to its needs: volume of candidates, frequency of recruitment, type of checks required, etc.  



<p>To meet these challenges, IDnow has developed a range of solutions and tools tailored to the risks identified. Using the established typology, here’s how IDnow addresses the issues identified:</p>



  Reliability: With 99.9% document fraud detection reliability, IDnow’s remote identity verification solution brings peace of mind to its users. In case of doubt, fraud experts can intervene to verify or complete the analysis made by the automatic solution.&nbsp;  Transversality: Based on the latest technologies in terms of occlusion, live detection and face matching, IDnow’s solutions are constantly updated by teams of dedicated document fraud experts to identify the latest fraud trends.&nbsp;  Flexibility: The IDnow solution can be customized, enabling recruiters to adjust their checks intuitively and efficiently.&nbsp;  Speed: with an average processing time of 12 seconds, the speed of verification brings unrivaled fluidity to recruitment, particularly in the case of high volumes.&nbsp;  Rationality: Available in several formats and options, the IDnow sales team is committed to offering its customers and partners solutions tailored to their needs and budgets.

  <p>Let’s continue our discussion on preventing data exfiltration. In previous blogs, we shared Microsoft’s <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/apply-zero-trust-principles-to-authentication-session-management/ba-p/3615343">approach to securing authentication sessions</a> with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/concept-continuous-access-evaluation">Continuous Access Evaluation</a> (CAE) and discussed <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/how-tenant-restrictions-v2-can-be-used-to-prevent-data/ba-p/3915339">securing cross-tenant access</a> with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/tenant-restrictions-v2#step-4-set-up-tenant-restrictions-v2-on-your-corporate-proxy">Tenant Restrictions v2</a>. Today our topic is stolen authentication artifacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stolen authentication artifacts – tokens and cookies – can be used to impersonate the victim and gain access to everything the victim had access to. Up until a few years ago, token theft was a rare attack and was most often exercised by corporate Red Teams. Why? Because it’s simpler to steal a password than a cookie. However, with multifactor authentication (MFA) becoming more prevalent, we’re seeing real-life attacks involving artifact theft and replay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before diving into details, it’s important to note that Microsoft recommends that the first line of defense against token theft is protecting your devices by deploying endpoint protections, device management, phishing-resistant MFA, and antimalware, as described in <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/11/16/token-tactics-how-to-prevent-detect-and-respond-to-cloud-token-theft/">Token tactics: How to prevent, detect, and respond to cloud token theft | Microsoft Security Blog</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, let’s discuss types of authentication artifacts and what techniques are recommended for each type to minimize the impact of theft. All authentication artifacts can be roughly divided into two buckets:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Sign-in session artifacts, maintain single sign-on (SSO) and app state between the client and Entra ID. 
 Apps session artifacts, grant data access to client applications. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may be obvious that the first priority would be protecting the most powerful device SSO artifacts - <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/devices/concept-primary-refresh-token">Primary Refresh Tokens</a> (PRT). The good news is that PRTs on all operating system&nbsp;platforms have been hardened against theft from day one. The level of protection depends on operated system capabilities, with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/devices/concept-primary-refresh-token#how-is-the-prt-protected">Windows offering the strongest protection</a>. PRT protection is not controllable by policy and is always on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Offering similar protection for all artifacts is on our roadmap, but delivering these capabilities is going to be a multi-year journey. If you want to learn more about various challenges of building comprehensive protection against token theft, watch this <a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/library/presentation/usa/2022/token%20theft%20hip%20kids%20are%20doing%20it%20now%20what%20are%20we%20going%20to%20do%20about%20it">RSA presentation</a>. In the meantime, you can reduce token theft by carefully orchestrating Entra ID security products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Addressing token theft of sign-in session artifacts 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/public-preview-token-protection-for-sign-in-sessions/ba-p/3815756#:~:text=Token%20Protection%20ensures%20that%20tokens%20can%20only%20be,users%20and%20data%20against%20breaches%20involving%20token%20theft.">Conditional Access: Token protection policy</a>&nbsp;offers cryptographic protection against replay of stolen tokens. This feature leverages and builds on top of already existing cryptographic protections of PRTs. When token protection policy is on, use of unprotected sign-in sessions is blocked. In combination with PRT protection always being on, it extends cryptographic protection to all renewable artifacts. Token protection is in public preview for Office and Outlook on Windows. Start in report-only mode first to evaluate the impact for your organization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Client Applications that are not yet in scope of token protection can be protected by enabling <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-compliant-network">compliant network check</a> for <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/overview-what-is-global-secure-access">Entra Global Secure Access</a>. This policy will ensure that authentication artifacts always come from your organization’s network. It means that stolen tokens can only be replayed from your organization’s network, thus significantly reducing blast radius of the attack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Addressing token theft of app session artifacts 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on your network configuration, you might be able block usage of stolen access tokens and workload cookies outside of your corporate network by using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-location">Conditional Access: Block access by location</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-continuous-access-evaluation-strict-enforcement">strictly enforce location policies for continuous access evaluation (CAE)</a>. This new CAE enforcement mode blocks access from outside allowed IP ranges, thus blocking any usage of stolen tokens from outside your network and significantly reducing blast radius of the attack. To take advantage of this capability, your users must access both Entra ID and workloads from enumerable IP addresses. CAE strictly enforce locations policy can be enforced for corpnet users accessing data via Entra Global Secure Access (GSA) because Entra GSA is able to pass along IP address of user’s device. When configuring <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/security/conditional-access-framework#named-locations">Named Locations</a> in Conditional Access (CA), make sure to include range of IP addresses from which your users access both Entra ID and workloads (e.g. SharePoint Online).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Detecting token theft 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To detect stolen artifacts, you can enable risk detections with Microsoft Entra ID Protection to elevate user risk when token theft is suspected. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks#anomalous-token">Anomalous token</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks#token-issuer-anomaly">token issuer anomaly</a>, and adversary in the middle detections can be indicative of token theft. Each detection is calculated offline, whereas anomalous token can also be calculated in real-time at sign-in to catch the threat and flag the sign in as compromised. To take full advantage of these detections, we recommend configuring <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-policies">risk-based access policies</a>&nbsp;to ensure your users have the proper policy controls applied when token theft is suspected. When risk-based access policies are applied against token theft detections, it forces the user to complete multifactor authentication and reset their password, and when applicable, require an admin to revoke user tokens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-continuous-access-evaluation">Continuous Access Evaluation</a> works together with risk-based access policies to block resource access with tainted artifacts. When user risk increases, CAE issues signals to all CAE-capable workloads to enforce risk-based access policy immediately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As token theft attacks are becoming more prevalent Microsoft constantly improves defenses against such attacks. Stay tuned for new updates in this area soon.</p>

  The UK Crypto Travel Rule has no minimum threshold, as VASPs must collect basic information from all parties in a transaction, regardless of its&nbsp;value.  However, the breadth of information required depends on the transfer value, notably increasing for transactions exceeding £1,000.  With the Crypto Travel Rule active in the UK since September 2023, VASPs must diligently collect, verify, and share virtual asset transaction data to meet compliance standards.  <p>The Crypto Travel Rule came into effect in the United Kingdom <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/fatf-travel-rule-in-the-uk-challenges-and-concerns">on September 1st</a>, 2023. This event was a result of a series of regulatory actions, starting on July 22nd, 2021 when <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/amendments-to-the-money-laundering-terrorist-financing-and-transfer-of-funds-information-on-the-payer-regulations-2017-statutory-instrument-2022">the HM Treasury published</a> a consultation seeking views on amendments to the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Transfer of Funds Regulations 2017.</p><p>It took up to mid-October that year to conclude the consultation, and by July 2022, the United Kingdom had published the amended regulations.</p><p>As part of the new regulations, UK authorities rolled out <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule">the FATF Travel Rule</a>, a key requirement for virtual asset service providers (VASPs). The introduction was followed up with a public consultation on Travel Rule guidance, which concluded on August 25th,&nbsp;2023.</p><p>In between, the FCA had also clearly set out expectations on the nature of compliance that UK VASPs were required to&nbsp;follow.</p> The Genesis and Evolution of the Crypto Travel: UK and Elsewhere <p>The <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/fca-sets-out-expectations-uk-cryptoasset-businesses-complying-travel-rule">Financial Conduct Authority</a> was transparent and articulate about its motivation to implement the Crypto Travel Rule in the country. In a <a href="https://twitter.com/TheFCA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1692166998225010747%7Ctwgr%5Ed1576ae642f907dbed1fd32e3b15eabbc9d640a4%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fuk-crypto-travel-rule-comes-into-effect">tweet</a> dated August 17th, 2023, the FCA&nbsp;said:</p><blockquote>“The Travel Rule is designed to bring greater transparency to crypto asset transfers, making it harder for criminals to use crypto for illegal activity.”</blockquote><p>In brief, the Travel Rule requires UK-based VASPs to “collect, verify and share information” on crypto transfers.</p><p>For inbound payments from an overseas jurisdiction that has not implemented the Travel Rule yet, the VASPs were asked to conduct a risk-based assessment to ascertain whether the beneficiary qualifies to receive the transfer. The same should apply to outbound transfers.</p><p>Implementation of the Crypto Travel Rule in the United Kingdom had global precedents, as countries like the United States, Germany, Japan, Singapore, Switzerland, Canada, South Africa, Netherlands, etc., have already adopted&nbsp;it.</p><p>Singapore, for instance, implemented the Travel Rule as early as <a href="https://sumsub.com/blog/what-is-the-fatf-travel-rule/">January 28th, 2020</a>. In Canada, it came into effect on <a href="https://sumsub.com/blog/what-is-the-fatf-travel-rule/">June 1st, 2021</a>. South Korea and Estonia implemented the travel rule on March 15th and 25th, respectively. <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/japan-to-enforce-crypto-travel-rule-from-june-1st">Japan</a> and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-hong-kong">Hong Kong</a> enforced the same since June 1st,&nbsp;2023.</p><p>More countries began implementing the Travel Rule after the FATF called out countries to adopt it urgently, after its<a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/Targeted-update-virtual-assets-vasps.html"> March 2022 survey</a> found only 29 of 98 jurisdictions had enforced&nbsp;it.</p> UK Crypto Travel Rule Compliance Requirements <p>The UK Crypto Travel Rule compliance requirements apply to UK-based crypto asset businesses, abbreviated as CBs. The regulations define these businesses as crypto asset exchange providers or custodian wallet providers.</p><p>Crypto asset exchange implies entities that facilitate the exchange of the crypto assets or arrange for it. On the other hand, the job of a custodian wallet provider is to offer services of holding crypto assets and cryptographic keys for its customers or make arrangements towards the&nbsp;same.</p><p>When it comes to CBs collecting, verifying, and sharing the relevant information, the quantum of information to be dealt with depends on the transfer amount. If the crypto asset transfer is worth below 1,000 pounds sterlings, the information includes the name and account number of the originator and the beneficiary.</p><p>If the transfer is worth above 1,000 pounds sterlings, the quantum of information to be collected increases. If the sender or originator of funds is a firm, the CBs would have to ask&nbsp;for:</p><p>(i) Customer Identification Number<br>(ii) Address of the&nbsp;firm.</p><p>And when the sender is an individual, the CBs would have to collect the following:</p><p>(i) Birth certificate number</p><p>(ii) Passport number / National identity card&nbsp;number</p><p>(iii) Date and place of&nbsp;birth</p><p>To be compliant with the regulations, the UK-based CBs would have to conduct rigorous due diligence. It is the firm’s responsibility to become compliant with the Travel Rule, even if the firm is leveraging the services of a third party. The implementation of the rule has to be regularly supervised.</p> How Does the UK Crypto Travel Rule Impact the Crypto Exchanges and&nbsp;Wallets? <p>The UK’s adoption of the Crypto Travel Rule has significant implications for cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet providers, altering how they operate and interact within the global market. It mandates a new level of compliance, directly affecting various aspects of their business.</p> 1. Increased Responsibilities <p>UK-based cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet providers now face additional duties due to the Travel Rule. They must establish systems like <a href="https://www.shyft.network/veriscope">Veriscope</a> or hire third-party services to collect, verify, and share transaction data. This means more work and investment in resources.</p> 2. Cost Optimization and Efficient Data&nbsp;Handling <p>VASPs need to manage the added workload efficiently and cost-effectively. They must develop systems that can securely and swiftly handle data collection and transmission.</p> 3. Transaction Threshold Management <p>A key aspect is managing the transaction threshold, which is set at 100 pounds. Due to the high volatility in the crypto market, determining whether a transaction meets this threshold can be challenging.</p> 4. International Disparities <p>With varying implementations of the Travel Rule globally, UK crypto firms must make strategic decisions on how to interact with jurisdictions that haven’t adopted similar regulations.</p> 5. Gather Necessary Information <p>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) provides clear instructions for handling transfers to and from jurisdictions without the Travel Rule. UK firms are required to attempt to gather necessary information for outbound transfers and conduct risk assessments for inbound transfers from non-compliant jurisdictions.</p> 6. Adapting to Regulatory Evolutions <p>Lastly, these companies need to keep up with the changes in the Travel Rule and adapt accordingly as global regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies continue to&nbsp;evolve.</p> Travel Rule in the UK vs the World: A Comparison <p>Staying within the broad framework of FATF, different countries have tried different ways to optimize crypto travel rules in their&nbsp;country.</p><p>The United States, for instance, has a threshold of US$3,000. The European Union is yet to activate a threshold as the grace period is ongoing at present, with an enforcement date target of December 30th, 2024. Then, there are countries like Estonia that have already enforced the Travel Rule but have not kept any transaction threshold yet.</p><p>There are also differences in terms of how self-hosted wallets are approached across jurisdictions.</p><p>In the United Kingdom, the requirement is that of collecting information from the VASP’s customers, whereas, in <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/comprehensive-guide-to-crypto-regulations-and-fatf-travel-rule-in-singapore">Singapore</a> and Germany, the requirement goes a notch higher for identity verification of the unhosted wallet owner. In Switzerland, the requirements ask to establish proof of ownership over and above the identity verification needs.</p><p>With more and more countries implementing the FATF Travel Rule in their jurisdiction, new similarities and differences will&nbsp;emerge.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>While evolution and amendments would be a reality throughout the lifetime of the regulation, the authorities would always have to be mindful of the core purpose of the Crypto Travel Rule, which is to advance the <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">anti-money laundering</a> mechanism and put a stop to financial crime.</p><p>To achieve this objective, the VASPs need to ensure that suspicious transactions are promptly detected, and effective screening is carried&nbsp;out.</p><p>Fraudulent actors often exploit the pseudonymity of blockchain technology, which only requires knowing the wallet address of the beneficiary and the private cryptographic key of the&nbsp;sender.</p><p>While implementing the Travel Rule is a difficult requirement for crypto businesses to fulfill, it is for the benefit of the industry and its players that the Crypto Travel Rule UK implementation is dealt with utmost sincerity.</p> Frequently Asked Questions  Q1: Is there a minimum transaction threshold for the Crypto Travel Rule in the&nbsp;UK? <p>No, there is no minimum threshold. VASPs must collect basic information for all transactions. However, for transactions over £1,000, VASPs need to collect more detailed information compared to transactions below this&nbsp;value.</p> Q2: When did the Crypto Travel Rule come into effect in the&nbsp;UK? <p>The Crypto Travel Rule came into effect in the United Kingdom on September 1st,&nbsp;2023.</p> Q3: What are the compliance requirements for UK-based crypto businesses? <p>The UK-based crypto businesses must rigorously collect, verify, and share transaction data to comply with the Crypto Travel Rule. This includes detailed information on parties involved in transactions over&nbsp;£1,000.</p> Q4: How does the Travel Rule impact crypto exchanges and wallets in the&nbsp;UK? <p>It requires them to establish systems for efficient transaction data collection and management, impacting how they handle transactions and interact with global&nbsp;markets.</p><p>___________________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p>Dear Community,</p><p>Metadium continued to make significant advancements in DID in the year’s second half. As we express our gratitude to everyone who has been with Metadium in 2023, we would like to take a moment to review and summarize the key achievements and developments from the past six months before launching our new goals for&nbsp;2024.</p> Summary   From October to December 2023, 10,191,291 transactions and 41,912 DID wallets were&nbsp;created.  Bokbunja hard fork was successfully applied to the&nbsp;mainnet.  Metadium Mainnet Explorer was renewed following Bokbunja Hard&nbsp;Fork.  The staking contract for Metadium Governance was upgraded.  Announcements were made regarding changes in BP and FeeCollector addresses, staking amounts, and META circulating supply.   Technology Updates:  Q4 Monthly Transactions <p>During the fourth quarter of 2023, there were f 10,191,291 transactions, and 41,912 DID wallets were created.(as of January&nbsp;2nd).</p> Launch of Wepublic&nbsp;Wallet <p>The existing DID wallet service, MYKEEPIN, was renewed and rebranded as Wepublic Wallet. Metadium’s DID technology was implemented in Wepublic Wallet, contributing to Wepublic DAO participants’ identity verification protocol.</p><p>Wepublic supports four decentralized protocols: identity proofing, credentialing, result proofing, and balance proofing. Metadium aims to enhance transparency in society and services within the DAO platform ecosystem by utilizing blockchain technology.</p>  Find more information <a href="https://medium.com/metadium/mykeepin-renewal-open-with-wepublic-wallet-and-adding-dao-functionality-6d733c3f5ad3">here</a>.   Explorer Renewal <p>With the Bokbunja Hard Fork on October 31, the Metadium Mainnet Explorer was renewed. The Explorer was redesigned for improved functionality and usability, serving as the foundation to provide better services to the Community.</p><p>The renewal included a visually comfortable design, easy confirmation of transactions and DID creations, a reflection of Bokbunja Hard Fork details, adding the Name Tag&nbsp;feature.</p>  Find more information <a href="https://medium.com/metadium/metadium-explorer-renewal-5db583d05b8a">here</a>.   Bokbunja Hard&nbsp;Fork <p>On October 31, at 12 PM, the Bokbunja Hard Fork was successfully implemented on the mainnet -this groundbreaking upgrade aimed to enhance the Metadium network by introducing features, including fee delegation.</p>  Find more information <a href="https://medium.com/metadium/metadium-mainnet-update-bokbunja-hard-fork-8147ea32080e">here</a>.   Governance BP&nbsp;Upgrade <p>The staking contract is where Metadium governance members store their staking assets. A bulk transfer of staking assets was carried out to upgrade the staking contract. All the assets within the staking contract were transferred to the BP1 node wallet, serving as the contract owner. The total staking amount within the BP1 node wallet was subsequently moved to the newly upgraded staking contract.</p>  Find more information <a href="https://medium.com/metadium/metadium-mainnet-governance-upgrade-dabc9cc693a7">here</a>.   BP Staking Contract Asset&nbsp;Transfer <p>Assets were transferred to standardize the number of staking contracts to 5 million. If the BP quantity exceeded 5 million, the excess amount was unstaked and withdrawn. If the BP quantity was less than 5 million, an additional deposit was made for the insufficient quantity. The remaining amount was transferred to a non-circulating wallet that does not contribute to the circulating supply. Throughout this process, there was a change in the total staking&nbsp;amount.</p>  Find more information <a href="https://medium.com/metadium/bp-staking-contract-asset-movement-amount-320b2e32126e">here</a>.   BP, FeeCollector Address Change and Circulating Supply&nbsp;Update <p>Voter addresses of BPs were changed, and the address of FeeCollector was registered. This change aimed to separate Voter addresses from Staker addresses and directed transaction fees to accumulate in the FeeCollector’s address.</p>  Find more information <a href="https://medium.com/metadium/metadium-mainnet-bp-update-details-b775447240dc">here</a>.   Business Partnerships:  Purchasing META for THEPOL&nbsp;Rewards <p>THEPOL purchases META from the market to use as a reward for app users. As the number of THEPOL users and activities increases, the reward demand grows, and THEPOL buys additional META from the market. This signifies the growth of Metadium’s DApp in&nbsp;action.</p>  Find more information <a href="https://medium.com/metadium/thepol-has-bought-metadium-meta-to-use-as-a-user-reward-f4722257f047">here</a>.

<p>In this article, we explore the vLEI (verifiable Legal Entity Identifier) and KERI (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure). KERI is the technology that vLEI is built on.</p>
 What is vLEI? 
<p>vLEI is a new form of digitized organizational identity representing a secure digital form of a conventional LEI. To understand these concepts first, we have published <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/legal-entity-identifier-lei/" title="articles introducing both LEI and vLEI">articles introducing both LEI and vLEI</a>.</p>
<p>vLEI is also an implementation of Verifiable Credentials, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-management/verifiable-credentials-understanding-key-principles/" title="read our introduction on the concept of Verifiable Credentials">read our introduction on the concept of Verifiable Credentials</a>. In short, “verifiable” means each vLEI credential has cryptographic proof that enables a recipient or Verifier to cryptographically verify its integrity and authenticity.</p>
 What is KERI? 
<p>KERI is a modern Distributed Key Management System (DKMS) and is the protocol on which vLEI is built.</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll look at how vLEI builds on the KERI architecture and what the most important KERI features are for vLEI.</p>
 &nbsp;KERI Architecture 
<p>This diagram represents a typical KERI architecture for vLEI. See below for a description of each term included in the diagram.</p>
<p></p>
 Signify Client 
<p>The end user or controller uses a Signify Client instance to perform KERI operations. Only the Signify Client has access to the private keys of the controller. It implements a “Signing at the edge” concept where the private keys are never exposed outside the context of the Signify Client. The Signify Client adds controller signatures to key event log entries.</p>
<p>Signify Client is not an end user application itself. Instead, it is a library that is embedded as a component in other applications, such as mobile wallets, web applications etc.</p>
 KERI Agent 
<p>This is the backend of a Signify Client. The KERI Agent manages the key event logs of each Signify Client and publishes signed key event logs to witnesses.</p>
 Witness Network 
<p>A KERI Witness receives key event logs with controller signatures from KERI Agents. For authenticity, the witness adds witness signatures to the key events, then makes the key event logs available to Verifiers.</p>
 Verifier 
<p>A controller uses Signify Client to create digital signatures and to send presentations of verifiable credentials to Verifiers. The Verifier will access key event logs provided by KERI Witnesses when verifying digital signatures and credential presentations. Comparing key event logs from multiple witnesses lets the Verifier mitigate against duplicity and other types of threats against key event logs.</p>
<p>Many types of applications can act as Verifiers. For example, Verifier functionality could be integrated in the backend of a web application or in document management systems where signatures of signed documents are verified.</p>
 KERI Features 
<p>The KERI key management system has many features. Below I expand on some of the most important features for vLEI.</p>
 Key management 
<p>Key management is the main function of KERI. Key management solves problems such as:</p>
 
 How do you make sure you are using the correct keys with your peers? 
 How do you signal to your peers you have changed or terminated your keys? 
 
 Key Event Log 
<p>The Key Event Log (KEL) is the basic construct of KERI. The KEL is a hash linked chain of key events. A KERI identifier represents a single distinct KEL. The KEL is the cryptographic ledger or block chain of KERI.</p>
<p>Inception, rotation, and interaction are examples of common events in a KEL. Every KEL begins with an inception event followed by other events. The hash value of the first inception event becomes the KERI identifier of a KEL. Many key event logs will be relatively small and rather static with only a few entries.</p>
<p>The controller of a KEL adds its controller signature to each event that gets added to a KEL. As events are added the controller continuously publishes the KEL to one or more witnesses who add their witness signature to each event in the KEL. Once the KEL has been published to witnesses, the KEL becomes immutable, and no past entries in the KEL can be modified or removed. The witness makes the KEL available to Verifiers.</p>
<p>By comparing KELs from multiple witnesses a Verifier can make sure the KEL is authentic and has not, for example, been duplicated, branched, or otherwise tampered with.</p>
 Pre-rotation 
<p>Pre-rotation is a unique feature of KERI, where only the current public key or keys are published in a KEL. Only the hashes or commitments of the next public keys are published. Pre-rotation improves security because no parts of the key material of the next keys are made public.</p>
 Delegation 
<p>KERI delegation is a cooperative mutual agreement between two KERI identifiers. Delegation requires cryptographic commitment from both parties. KERI delegation delegates signing authority to the delegate.</p>
<p>In vLEI, delegation is used between the GLEIF root (a KERI identifier that links back to everything within the eco-system, this link is what provides the delegate-able abilities to vLEI) and external identifiers, and between the GLEIF external and QVI identifiers.</p>
 Multi-sig 
<p>KERI multi-sig is a KERI identifier formed from a group of public keys. Each multi-sig may be given a signing threshold to control who has signing authority and to improve resilience. </p>
<p>For example, a group with a signing threshold of three out of three always requires participation of all members. This threshold sets a strict control on signing authority but does not improve resilience. If any of the members lost control of their key, the group could no longer operate and recover from the loss.</p>
<p>In vLEI currently, the GLEIF root has a threshold of three out of seven. GLEIF external is two out of five. The minimum requirement for QVI and Legal Entity identifiers is a group of two members.</p>
 ACDC credentials 
<p>The wider ‘KERI’ ecosystem provides a verifiable credential format known as Authentic Chained Data Container (ACDC) credentials. Credential chaining is a unique feature of ACDC credentials compared to most other Verifiable Credential formats present today.</p>
<p>When verifying an ACDC credential the Verifier will check the revocation status of the received credential and each of the chained credentials. This allows implementing advanced use cases where, for example, credential revocation authority is delegated to other actors than the issuer of the credential.</p>
<p>In vLEI, every credential is on a chain that leads up to the QVI credential issued by GLEIF (Global LEI Foundation) to the QVI.</p>
 vLEI Trust Model&nbsp;  
<p>The vLEI Ecosystem Governance Framework describes the trust model of vLEI in full. This is a distilled view of the most important roles and types of credentials.</p>
 GLEIF 
<p>The Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) controls the vLEI root of trust with two multi-sig identifiers: GLEIF root and GLEIF external. The two identifiers are established with a delegation agreement. A member of the GLEIF multi-sig groups is called GLEIF Authorized Representative (GAR). The GARs will perform identity verification needed to issue QVI credentials.</p>
<p>The QVI credential is issued by the GLEIF external identifier to Qualified vLEI Issuers. The root identifier will never issue any credentials. This way the root identifier can remain offline, while only the KEL of the root identifier is made public.</p>
 <p>Figure 2 – GLEIF identifiers for vLEI root of trust.</p> 
 Qualified vLEI Issuer 
<p>The Qualified vLEI Issuer (QVI) is an organization that has been qualified by GLEIF to act as an issuer of vLEI credentials.</p>
<p>The QVI controls a multi-sig identifier with at least two members and that has established a delegation agreement with GLEIF external. </p>
<p>In addition, a QVI credential is issued by GLEIF external to the QVI. The QVI credential claims contain the LEI code of the QVI. The QVI credential is the top-most credential in the chain of vLEI credentials.</p>
<p>A member of the QVI multi-sig group is called Qualified vLEI Issuer Authorized Representative (QAR). The QARs will perform identity verification needed to issue vLEI, OOR and ECR credentials.</p>
 <p>Figure 3 – GLEIF authorizes the QVI by setting up delegation and issuing a QVI credential.</p> 
 Legal Entity  
<p>The Legal Entity (LE) is an organization that receives the vLEI credential.</p>
<p>The LE controls a multi-sig identifier with at least two members.</p>
<p>A LE-vLEI credential is issued by the QVI to the LE. The LE-vLEI credential claims contain the LEI code and name of the LE. The LE-vLEI credential is chained to the QVI credential of the issuer. </p>
<p>A member of the LE multi-sig group is called Legal Entity Authorized Representative (LAR).</p>
 <p>Figure 4 – The QVI issues a vLEI credential to the Legal Entity.</p> 
<p>The LE may issue OOR and ECR authorization credentials to a QVI, to authorize the QVI to issue individual OOR and ECR credentials on its behalf. The LE may also directly issue individual ECR credentials.</p>
 OOR and ECR Authorization Credentials 
<p>Authorization credentials are issued to the QVI by the LE. The credential’s claims contain the person’s name and role. The authorization credentials are chained to the vLEI credential of the LE. This way the LE has authority to revoke any OOR and ECR credentials. </p>
 OOR Credentials 
<p>Official Organization Role (OOR) credentials are issued to an individual person by the QVI. The credential’s claims contain the person’s name and official role as defined by ISO, from the authorization credential. The OOR credential is chained to the OOR authorization credential.</p>
<p>The QVI will verify information about Official Role assignment such as Chairman of the Board, CEO etc. from public records and perform identity verification needed to issue the OOR credential.</p>
 <p>Figure 5 – An OOR credential has many levels of chaining, leading up to the QVI Credential.</p> 
 ECR Credentials 
<p>Engagement Context Role (ECR) credentials are issued to an individual person either by the LE itself or by the QVI. The credential’s claims contain the person’s name and context role. The role name is context specific and defined by the LE. The ECR credential is either chained to the vLEI credential or the ECR authorization credential.</p>
<p>If the LE issues the ECR credential, then it is the responsibility of the LE to perform identity verification to a level that satisfies requirements of the LE.</p>
<p>If the LE authorizes the QVI to issue the ECR credential, for example to external contractors, then the QVI will perform identity verification needed to issue the ECR credential.</p>
 <p>Figure 6 – An ECR credential has many levels of chaining, leading up to the QVI Credential.</p>

This higher baseline sales also makes Volume DF and Passive DF more attractive.</p><p>DF71 is live today, Jan 4. It concludes on Jan 11. 150K OCEAN and 20k ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF71   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.

To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF71 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 20k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.

<!-- use 'smarter' algorithm for cutoff snippet text

   Ready to get a start on understanding the latest digital identity credential standards? Two influential standards, ISO/IEC 18013 and W3C's Verifiable Credentials, offer different solutions for digital identity. Is one clearly better than the other? Well, no. Whether one is better than the other depends on. your use case. Choosing among these standards depends on your users' needs, the browsers you

<div class='item-content item-summary'>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Staying informed about the latest digital identity standards and technology is more than a full-time job. Even focusing on just what’s available for the<a href="https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/16/"> identifiers</a> that provide a way to recognize a (digital) identity is enough to keep a person gainfully occupied for a few years. Why a few years, you ask? Because these standards are still under development in many ways – this is a bleeding edge of digital identity. Let’s talk about the two of the most influential standards under development that inform so much of the activity in this space: the ISO/IEC 18013 specifications and the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C’s) Verifiable Credentials.</p>



 The tl;dr 



<p>The<a href="https://www.iso.org/search.html?q=18013"> ISO/IEC 18013</a> family of documents specifies the technical and operational requirements for physical and mobile driver’s licenses (mDL). The mdoc format, part of ISO/IEC 18013-5, refers to the structure and specifications for mobile driver’s licenses and similar electronic ID solutions. (18013-5 and the in-progress 18013-7 are the ones most identity people focus on). If you would like to read and implement according to these standards, be prepared to pay money to access them.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> is a standard developed by the Verifiable Credentials Working Group within the World Wide Web (W3C) consortium. You can use Verifiable Credentials for any type of credential, from educational degrees to government IDs. Unfortunately, the identity industry has confused matters by using the generic term “verifiable credential” to sometimes mean something more or less different from the W3C Verifiable Credential format. If you want to read and implement according to the W3C Verifiabl Credential data format, go for it. Access to the specification is free.</p>



 Comparing mdoc/mDL and Verifiable Credentials 



&nbsp;ISO/IEC 18013-5W3C Verifiable CredentialPurposeDesigned explicitly to represent driver’s licenses and possibly other official IDs in a mobile format. It can be used for “secondary use cases,” such as anything you might use a physical driver’s license for that doesn’t involve driving. The ultimate case of YMMV.A standard that<a href="https://gataca.io/blog/what-are-verifiable-credentials/"> can be used</a> for any type of credential, from educational degrees to memberships, and not limited to driving licenses or IDs.Standardizing BodyISO/IEC (a treaty-based, government-supported standards organization)&nbsp;Be prepared to pay to read the standard. If you’d like to<a href="https://www.iso.org/get-involved.html"> participate</a> in developing the standard, you have a few more hoops to jump through.W3C (an industry-based standards organization that uses a tiered model for membership and engagement)&nbsp;Access to the standards is always free. The ability to vote on approving the standard requires a (paid)<a href="https://www.w3.org/membership/"> membership</a>. The ability to be a part of developing the standard or incubating an idea can be part of (paid) membership or (free) invited experts.Privacy and SecurityPrivacy is a strong consideration, but the focus is on a government credential and how governments need to use it. Protections are built in to ensure that data is shared only when necessary and (mostly) based on individual control. Because of the complexity involved, the use of am mDL is, at least as far as the specification is concerned, an in-person action. Remote use of these credentials is still a work in progress.Privacy is a strong consideration for the W3C as well. Since this specification is designed to support a broader set of use cases, there are privacy considerations to help the individual control what data is shared. There are also considerations about what data is collected since not all use cases require the same data.InteroperabilityThe ISO/IEC 18013-5 specification is trying to ensure interoperability across different jurisdictions, ensuring that a mobile driver’s license issued in one state or country can be read and verified in another, assuming both places follow the same ISO standard. Other use cases may take advantage of being interoperable if everyone uses the same format, but it’s worth remembering the underlying assumption of government use.The W3C VC specification is, as noted, designed for broad interoperability across the web. Interoperability means ensuring that various platforms, websites, and services can understand and verify the credentials. The underlying assumption here is that these credentials must be able to support use on the web by anybody, whether they be a company, a government, or the local pizza delivery service.



 Drama! Intrigue! Big Tech! 



<p>What we appear to have here is a general versus specific-purpose identifier format. Why not just use the one that fits your use case? Why all the drama?</p>



<p>In part, it comes down to resource availability. The costs grow for every standard or technology an organization has to support. Developer costs, UX designer costs, support team costs, they all add up. Even organizations the size of Google and Apple would very much like to limit what technologies they have to support. Anything else gets crazy expensive AND frustrates the individuals using their platforms with too many options.</p>



<p>In this case, Apple has<a href="https://developer.apple.com/wallet/get-started-with-verify-with-wallet/"> focused on supporting</a> the ISO specification only, which frustrates some developers. Google hasn’t decided whether it will support one or both of these standards. Outside of browser-land, the European Union is working on an<a href="https://eudiwalletconsortium.org/"> entire digital identity ecosystem</a>. It will support use cases in education, social security, and other services; their<a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-digital-identity-wallet-architecture-and-reference-framework"> architecture</a> specifically mentions both the W3C  and the ISO work.</p>



<p>Let’s not forget that the technology sector loves its ideology wars. From the command line<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war"> editor wars</a> between vi versus emacs to decades of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars"> browser wars</a>, technologists get attached to their favorite tools. This also appears to be playing out here in the mdoc versus VC drama.</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>Both ISO’s guidelines and the W3Cs specifications are still evolving. Several critical features are still under active development, sometimes in other standards organizations (I’m looking at you, <a href="https://openid.net/openid4vc/">OpenID Foundation</a> and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/search?name=selective+disclosure&amp;sort=&amp;rfcs=on&amp;activedrafts=on&amp;by=group&amp;group=">IETF</a>). Some of those features are raising <a href="https://github.com/WICG/identity-credential/blob/main/custom-schemes.md">significant concerns</a> from privacy advocates.  If you are going to implement something, be prepared to be flexible to future changes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Exploring these formats is necessary if you’re moving to a Self-sovereign Identity (SSI) model. But that said, it’s not just about the content of the specifications. Also, review the use cases they are designed to support, what browser you expect your users to use, and even where you are in the world.</p>



 ETA: A Few More Thoughts 



<p>I love it when my posts spark discussion and feedback! <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@aniltj/111692855215449887">Anil John</a> offered some great insight in a thread on Mastodon that I’m sharing here (to keep it in one place) with permission:</p>



<p>❖ The starting point for the W3C VC work and the ISO mDL work were radically different; the mDL work was directly focused on in-person use cases while the W3C work was focused on remote/online use cases. Both are trying to address the other at present, but the starting point has influenced the design choices that are inherent in both standards.</p>



<p>❖ The W3C VCDM is a data model for describing a broad range of credentials and does not explicitly define the protocols used to move credentials defined using the VCDM from point A to Point B (provisioning and presentation)</p>



<p>❖ The ISO mDL is a tightly coupled mix of an explicitly defined set of data attributes that make up a digital version of a driver’s licence AND a protocol interface description for moving a credential composed of those attributes from a mobile device to a reader/verifier using NFC, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi Aware protocols (in-person presentation); how that credential is provisioned to the mobile device from an issuing infrastructure is explicitly out of scope for the ISO mDL standard.</p>



<p>❖ The W3C VCDM supports and encourages the use of attribute and vocabulary transparency akin to how schema.org works; the ISO mDL vocabulary is part of the standard and as such is under the control of the ISO working group.</p>

Verida Mainnet is&nbsp;live Verida Network Mainnet is&nbsp;live <p>On December 28th, 2023, Verida Mainnet officially went live, marking the arrival of the first private self-sovereign data network for&nbsp;web3.</p><p>The Verida Network is the first self-sovereign database network for storing private data. The Verida Network is decentralized public infrastructure (DePIN) providing secure and private database infrastructure for users to own and control their private&nbsp;data.</p><p>Today marks a massive milestone for the Verida community. The network is now a reality four years after its beginnings, and two years after the release of the Verida Whitepaper.</p><p>The Verida Testnet has reached over 35,000 accounts in late 2023 and we are excited to migrate those users across to Mainnet as soon as possible.</p> A new era for data control with&nbsp;DePIN <p>The Verida Mainnet launch signifies more than just Verida going live. It’s the start of a new era for personal data ownership. A time where anyone can choose to take control and ownership of their personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Whether you’re checking into a hotel, signing up for a new app, going to a doctor and filling out patient forms, or joining a crypto exchange, you’re always finding yourself in a situation where you’re handing over licence numbers, passport details, your home address, the list goes&nbsp;on.</p><p>One in two people are victims of data breaches, caused by the centralization of user data, while large corporations have a monopoly over how to use our personal information.</p><p>We have no agency over what information we can share and what we can keep private in any given situation. Every time we share information, we increase our risk of being exposed in a data leak and falling mercy to data&nbsp;theft.</p><p>Verida is changing this status-quo and providing a new architecture for data ownership and application development that puts users front and centre, in control of their digital identity and personal&nbsp;data.</p> The growing Verida ecosystem <p>Verida is not enabling the personal data ownership vision alone. A growing ecosystem has emerged to contribute new capabilities and extensions to the infrastructure stack.</p><p>We’ve been working with key partners across web3, crypto and identity and data ecosystems to bring privacy-preserving decentralized technology to the&nbsp;world.</p>Verida Ecosystem<p>Explore the Verida Ecosystem further&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verida.network/ecosystem">here</a>.</p> Introducing the Verida&nbsp;Mainnet <p>The Verida Mainnet is the production ready deployment of the Verida network for storing private, user data on mainnet storage nodes, controlled by private&nbsp;keys.</p><p>This release includes the deployment of the Verida DID method on Polygon PoS blockchain, enabling users to manage their self-sovereign identities. The Verida developer SDKs now support both Verida Testnet and Verida Mainnet for building dApps that handle private user data. See Developer Docs for more&nbsp;details.</p><p>Existing <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/extras/demos">demo applications</a> have been upgraded to operate on the Verida Mainnet, while the <a href="http://verida.io">Verida Wallet</a> has been upgraded to support data storage using the Verida&nbsp;Mainnet.</p> Getting started on the Verida&nbsp;Mainnet <p>You will need to update to the latest <a href="http://verida.io">Verida Wallet</a> (iOS and Android) to access the Verida&nbsp;Mainnet.</p><p>We strongly recommend all Acacia Testnet users migrate their accounts to Mainnet. This process can be managed directly in the latest version of the Verida Wallet. Any data on your Testnet account will be permanently deleted once this process is completed.</p><p>The <a href="http://missions.verida.network">Verida Missions</a> rewards program will continue on the Verida Mainnet. It’s critical that existing Testnet users who have completed activities on Verida Missions, migrate their Testnet account to Mainnet, in order to retain their existing XP&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Alternatively, you can create a new Mainnet identity from scratch in the Verida&nbsp;Wallet.</p><p>Important: The Verida Wallet blockchain wallet currently supports testnet blockchain networks. Mainnet blockchain network support will be available shortly. Do not send mainnet tokens to your testnet addresses. See our <a href="https://community.verida.io/user-guides">user guides </a>on using testnet faucets to send tokens to your&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Use your Mainnet identity to connect and use these&nbsp;apps:</p>  Verida Missions: <a href="https://missions.verida.network/">https://missions.verida.network/</a>  Markdown Editor (Demo): <a href="https://markdown-editor.demos.verida.io/">https://markdown-editor.demos.verida.io/</a>  <p>Explore the Verida&nbsp;Network:</p>  Network Explorer: <a href="https://explorer.verida.network/">https://explorer.verida.network/</a>  <p>Get started with the Verida&nbsp;Mainnet:</p>  <a href="https://community.verida.io/user-guides/verida-mainnet-soft-launch-user-guide">Verida Mainnet launch user&nbsp;guide</a>   How to migrate to the Verida&nbsp;Mainnet <p>Users on the Acacia Testnet are recommended to migrate to Myrtle Mainnet. This process can be managed directly in the latest version of the Verida Wallet. Any data on your Testnet account will be permanently deleted once this process is completed.</p> Verida Wallet&nbsp;Users   Update to the latest Verida Wallet version (available in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/verida-vault/id1546599632">Apple App Store</a> and the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.verida.vault">Google Play&nbsp;Store</a>)  Choose the Testnet identity you want to migrate, and select “Migrate to Mainnet” on the home&nbsp;screen.  <p>Important: Do not close the Verida Wallet or switch to a different app while it is migrating. As a decentralized network, your mobile device is responsible for replicating your data between networks. It will likely take 2–5 minutes to migrate your data, depending on how many applications and how much data you have stored on the&nbsp;network.</p><p>See the<a href="https://community.verida.io/user-guides/verida-mainnet-soft-launch-user-guide"> Verida Mainnet Launch guide</a> for more&nbsp;details.</p> Application developers <p>Developer documentation has been updated to include details on switching between testnet and mainnet. There are two key changes for application developers to upgrade their applications to use the Verida&nbsp;Mainnet:</p>  Update to latest&nbsp;SDKs  Change network from “TESTNET” to “MAINNET”  <p>See the Developers<a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/extras/migrate-mainnet"> Migrate to Mainnet page</a> in the Developer Portal for more information.</p> Verida Missions and XP&nbsp;Rewards <p>Verida Missions and the <a href="https://news.verida.io/verida-missions-now-live-join-the-mission-and-pave-the-way-for-a-decentralized-future-8e9da990c5bb">incentivized testnet program</a> has been instrumental in testing the performance of Verida network infrastructure and Verida applications.

<p>Co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/heathercdahl?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAG1mncB9siO_1vzhRrWgNAtko4MTLPxB4M">Heather C. Dahl</a> was named along with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/openai/">OpenAI</a> co-founder and CEO Sam Altman; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/airbnb/">Airbnb</a> CEO Brian Chesky; Steve Hafner, CEO of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/kayak/">KAYAK</a>; Vanessa Hudson, CEO of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/qantas/">Qantas</a> Group; Robert Isom, CEO, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/american-airlines/">American Airlines</a>; Aloke Bajpai, co-founder and group CEO, and Rajnish Kumar, co-founder and chief product and technology officer, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ixigo/">ixigo</a>; Alix Boulnois, chief digital officer, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/accor/">Accor</a>; Ben Drew, president, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/viator/">Viator</a>; Ethan Lin, co-founder and CEO, and Eric Gnock Fah, co-founder and COO, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/klook/">Klook</a>; Rathi Murthy, chief technology officer and president of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/expedia/">Expedia Group</a> Product &amp; Technology; Andreas Slettvoll, co-founder and CEO, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/chooose/">CHOOOSE</a> ; Johnny Thorsen, vice president of business development for content distribution, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/spotnanatechnology/">Spotnana</a> ; Richard Valtr, founder, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/mewssystems/">Mews</a>; and Rose Yao, vice president of product management, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/google/">Google</a> for transforming travel in 2023 — and among those to watch in 2024.</p>
<p>Here’s what Dahl had to say about the news.</p>
<p>It’s an honor to be listed among leading innovators who are changing how the world interacts and moves. We founded Indicio to do just this — to remove the friction, the obstacles, and the limitations of how we move through the world, digitally, and to make every interaction simple, seamless, instant.</p>
<p>For travel, this meant reimagining airports without lines, where everything, from check in to border crossing would be digitized and managed with the traveler’s consent — from their sofa.</p>
<p>The solution would be simple to implement across airline systems and radically improve operational efficiency. It would be secure and trustworthy and protect privacy. Everything would be seamless, streamlined, and stress-free. Everything could be integrated from booking to rewards programs to airport services, hospitality and beyond. People could just go and keep moving.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, thanks to partners SITA and the Aruba Tourism Authority, that’s what we delivered with the <a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/aruba-makes-steady-progress-in-launching-new-digital-travel-credential-873429964.html">Digital Travel Credential</a>. A seamless solution that works on any system and provides award-winning (<a href="https://indicio.tech/what-the-eic-decentralized-identity-award-means-for-indicio/">KipplingerCole</a> EIC and <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-wins-the-supernova-award-from-constellation-research-for-disruptive-technology-leadership-in-digital-safety-governance-and-privacy/">Constellation SuperNova</a>) privacy protection.</p>
<p>What it means today: You can now cross a border in the time it takes to smile.</p>
<p>What it will mean in 2024: Everything you need as a traveler will be accessible seamlessly — car rental, hotel check in, event booking, you name your need, we’ve got a simple, secure way to integrate it into your experience.</p>
<p>And, because verifiable credentials have digital superpowers, everything can be configured, with the traveler’s consent, to provide boss-level personalized interaction.</p>
<p>We’ve even <a href="https://indicio.tech/a-trusted-copilot-using-decentralized-identity-to-manage-an-ai-virtual-assistant/">shown</a> how verifiable data and identity are essential for AI to access and leverage personal data.</p>

It leveraged a primitive home grown cloud agent, mediator agent, and edge wallet. During the pandemic times, we were super busy in integrating the platform with Aries Python Cloud Agent, thus making the solution more compliant and standards driven. Post pandemic days, our team was focused on serving a few customers.</p> V2.0 (Q2/2023) — What’s&nbsp;new? <p>This release was unique. Beginning in the year 2023, we completely revamped the architecture of <a href="https://credebl.id">CREDEBL</a> Platform &amp; ADEYA SSI Mobile App / SDK to make it more lightweight, scalable and easy for developers to start developing digital identity solutions on top of&nbsp;it.</p><p>Keeping priority for population-scale demands, we shifted from Aries Python Agent (ACA-Py) to Aries Framework JavaScript (AFJ), besides having a single codebase for both cloud (org) agents &amp; mobile edge agents. Now you can set up your organization and AFJ-based multi-tenant agent quickly and thus, be able to start using the platform.</p><p>Some of the key features we added in V2.0&nbsp;are:</p>  Ability to deploy CREDEBL on your own cloud environment, or use&nbsp;SaaS  Aries Framework JS support resulting in — i) W3C JSON-LD credentials, Multi-tenant org agents, ii) Support for did:web, did:key, did:peer, did:cheqd, iii) Mobile &amp; Cloud agents using the same AFJ code&nbsp;base  Bulk issuance of credentials  Passkey authentication using FIDO&nbsp;WebAuthn  Supabase as a database for CREDEBL Platform — using Auth&nbsp;module  Option to deploy the new CREDEBL Studio (UI) on Deno Deploy or on your&nbsp;cloud  CREDEBL Docs built using&nbsp;Astro   DPG Status <p>In October this year, CREDEBL was announced as Open Source under Apache 2.0 license and <a href="https://app.digitalpublicgoods.net/a/10902">registered</a> under the DPGA (Digital Public Goods Alliance) — an United Nations endorsed entity which assesses the DPGs globally and maintains <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/">the registry</a>.</p><p>With the DPG status, CREDEBL is also being used by several Governments for implementing population-scale decentralized digital identity solutions for citizens benefits.</p> Release — v0.2 — beta.03&nbsp;Features <p>We are keen to listen to the demands and expectations from the customers, so are our future roadmap for&nbsp;CREDEBL.</p>  Out-of-band by issuance for multiple credential records  Delete organization invitations  Token based authentication for Aries Agent&nbsp;(AFJ)  Pagination and sorting for tables on connections, issuance, and verification screen  Set organization to private by&nbsp;default  <p>See the full details of the latest release — <a href="https://github.com/credebl/platform/releases">https://github.com/credebl/platform/releases</a></p> What to expect in next major&nbsp;release   Issue &amp; verify JSON-LD credentials  Support for Polygon &amp; Hedera as VDR (Verifiable Data Registry) for writing DIDs, Schemas &amp; Credential Definitions  Support for Keycloak as an IDP &amp; for OpenID4VC  Support for Post-quantum crypto such as Crystal Kyber, Crystal Dilithium  <p>As Simon Sinek says ‘Business is an infinite game and your competition is your former self’, one should continue to improve..</p><p>With that in mind, we look forward to an even brighter and successful 2024.</p>

It was all about getting together to learn, create, and connect. And wow, did it take&nbsp;off!</p><p>By the end of February, it turned into a home for all dreamers, builders, and crypto buffs. It’s been amazing to see how our dedication, teamwork, and innovation brought us all together.</p><p>As the months flew by, we saw so many new faces join. Our Ambassador Program wasn’t just growing — it was thriving.</p><p>And <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-dao/meet-the-wotnot-made-of-fire-release-shyft-dao-nfts-for-all-ambassador-program-members-170b33d855c9">those WotNot Made of Fire NFTs</a> we introduced in June?

Our leaderboard was buzzing with activity, celebrating everyone’s hard work and achievements. It was all about being fair and giving a pat on the back to everyone who contributed.</p><p>We didn’t stop there, though. Extending the NFT minting period and bringing in special NFTs for our Level 2 Ambassadors was our way of saying, “Hey, we see you and appreciate you!”</p><p>Later in the year, we shifted gears to make our engagements even more meaningful. Thanks to your feedback, we brought in <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-dao/shyft-daos-november-review-strategic-shifts-fair-play-focus-and-nft-ideas-81279881e161?source=collection_home---4------0-----------------------">qualitative tasks in November</a>, which added so much more depth to our interactions.</p> Tracking the Roadmap Milestones <p>2023 wasn’t just about community vibes. We made some serious gains on the tech side,&nbsp;too.</p><p>Remember the Veriscope Campaign? That was all of us getting deep into all things Veriscope and breaking it down, collectively exploring every aspect of&nbsp;it.</p><p>Plus, <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-dao/unleash-your-inner-chameleon-discover-the-new-shyft-dao-website-4e52075fcff8?source=collection_archive---------7-----------------------">our new website</a> and those awesome community contests were all about making our digital space as lively and engaging as our community.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>Looking forward, we’re not just stepping into 2024. We’re leaping in with big plans and dreams. It’s all about building on what we’ve achieved and taking it to the next&nbsp;level.</p><p>So, as we say goodbye to a phenomenal 2023, let’s gear up for another year of making waves, bonding over blockchain, and having a blast while we’re at&nbsp;it.</p><p>Here’s to us — the Shyft DAO community — and all the amazing things we’ll do together in&nbsp;2024!</p><p>_____________________</p><p>The <a href="https://shyftdao.org/">Shyft DAO</a> community is committed to building a decentralized, trustless ecosystem that empowers its members to collaborate and make decisions in a transparent and democratic manner.

This higher baseline sales also makes Volume DF and Passive DF more attractive.</p><p>DF70 is live today, Dec 28. It concludes on Jan 4. 150K OCEAN and 100k ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF70   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF70 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 100,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 100k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  You can read the details for how Predictoor DF Reward Amounts work&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa#58d9">here</a>.  Read how to optimize Predictoor rewards&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/rewards-mechanisms-of-ocean-predictoor-6f76c942baf7?source=collection_home---4------0-----------------------">here</a>.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Notes <p>[1] Source of the $27K USD&nbsp;number:</p>  CoinGecko prices on Dec 7, 2023: $0.511 / <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ocean-protocol">OCEAN</a> and $0.0798 /&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/oasis-network">ROSE</a>  $0.511 / OCEAN * 37,500 OCEAN = $19,163&nbsp;USD  $0.0798 / ROSE * 100,000 ROSE = $7,980&nbsp;USD  Total: $19,163 + $7,980 = $27,142.5 ≈ $27K&nbsp;USD   Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>As 2023 draws to a close, we stand at a pivotal moment in our journey. This year has been extraordinary, not just in the challenges it presented but in the remarkable resilience and innovation it has sparked across the crypto&nbsp;world.</p><p>At Shyft Network, this year has been about building, changing, and expanding. Our commitment to shaping a robust, fair, and forward-looking blockchain landscape has never been stronger.</p><p>Our dedication to maintaining an open, decentralized, and resilient ecosystem continues to guide us in times of a newly emerging regulatory climate.</p><p>In this challenging year for the industry, we had our victories and our lessons, and the sum of them all made us stronger.</p> Tech Development <p>Throughout 2023, Veriscope’s suite of technical enhancements and upgrades saw a seamless integration of various upgrades and enhancements, all aimed at bolstering efficiency, user experience, and compliance adherence.</p><p>From <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/user-signing-now-available-on-shyft-veriscope">the integration of User Signing</a> to the enhancement of <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-dev-deep-dive-monthly-jan-2023">Node Synchronization and the Veriscope Relay Node</a> featuring Nethermind v1.15.0 for faster blockchain data synchronization, each update, including the improved user interface with streamlined navigation and settings management, was meticulously designed.</p><p>The <a href="https://demo.usersigning.shyft.network/">User Signing</a> feature, in particular, was one of the most significant enhancements in Veriscope’s capabilities in 2023, as it allows VASPs to validate transactions from non-custodial wallets securely and efficiently, ensuring compliance with the FATF Travel Rule. By allowing for cryptographic proof directly from users’ wallets, it significantly enhances the security of transactions and brings a new level of trust and transparency to the ecosystem.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-dev-deep-dive-monthly-jan-2023">incorporation of additional IVMS fields</a>, in line with the IVMS specification, further strengthened our commitment to give the best experience possible for VASPs during regulatory compliance. Additionally, the Veriscope infrastructure, now leveraging <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/veriscope-infrastructure-as-code-streamlining-server-deployment">AWS, Terraform, and Ansible</a>, marked a significant step in simplifying the setup and maintenance for&nbsp;VASPs.</p><p>These collective enhancements, along with the implementation of features like the <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-veriscope-releases-bloom-filters-a-game-changer-for-vasps-to-identify-address-relevant-attestations">Bloom Filter for deposit addresses</a> and the <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-dev-deep-dive-monthly-feb-2023">Support for Multiple Trust Anchors</a> (MTAs), have been instrumental in advancing Veriscope’s capabilities.</p> Strategic Partnerships <p>In 2023, we have formed significant partnerships that have further solidified our commitment to providing innovative and compliant solutions in the blockchain space.</p><p>We <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/sygna-and-shyft-veriscope-partner-to-enhance-crypto-travel-rule-interoperability-and-compliance">teamed up with Sygna</a>, a leader in crypto compliance solutions, to bring a seamless user experience to Sygna’s users.

This partnership helped mark a significant step towards establishing a more secure and compliant environment within the crypto space, enhancing safety and regulatory adherence for both entities and their&nbsp;users.</p> Tokenomics <p><a href="https://data.shyft.network/public-dashboards/9e1235893c184f17b4f29583294efeb1?orgId=1">As of December 28th, 2023</a>, the purchasers hold 40% of SHFT tokens (431M vested to purchasers of the 1.06B circulating). The Economic Metagame and Core Team are allocated 20.0% and 17.9%, respectively.</p><p>The Shyft Treasury holds a strategic reserve of 6.6%, earmarked for long-term network health and growth, whereas 44.173% of SHFT tokens are vested. Specific to the Treasury, 17.009% of tokens are vested, with 10.558% in the Token Reserve and 9.394% for Strategic Purchasers, mapping out a controlled release that supports steady growth and market absorption. These figures are stated as fractions of the total vested to&nbsp;date.</p><p>The total allocation of SHFT tokens is 2.52 billion, of which 977 million SHFT tokens are vested to date. The Block Rewards stand at 279 million, alongside 841 million tokens unlocked, contributing to a circulating supply that now totals 1.06&nbsp;billion.</p> Marketing <p>Following our strategy to build, engage and educate our various audiences, we kept a close eye on the <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom">major crypto regulatory developments</a> and dissected their potential implications on the industry’s future. In line with this focus, we have launched three editorial series this year: The Shyft Perspectives, The Dev Deep Dive, and long-format analytical blogs.</p><p>Our analysis focused on the lead developments and intricacies of the crypto regulations in various territories. We’ve examined diverse approaches from North America to Australia as governments and regulatory bodies grapple with the challenges and opportunities presented by the burgeoning crypto industry.</p><p>The goal behind our editorials remains clear: to build a stronger trust in blockchain economies, a commitment we consistently highlight to our community and the broader industry.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>As we reflect on the milestones and growth of Shyft Network in 2023, we look forward with optimism to the opportunities that lie ahead. This year has been a testament to our resilience, marked by key partnerships and technological advancements that have strengthened our foundation and expanded our reach within the crypto ecosystem.</p><p>Looking to the future, we are excited to continue this journey, committed to innovation and excellence.

 ERC-3643 Validated As The De Facto Standard For Enterprise-Ready Tokenization 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in December 2023.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>Ready for an exciting year of tokenization?</p>
<p>Last week, the ERC-3643 standard achieved a significant achievement by attaining<a href="https://www.erc3643.org/news/ethereum-community-approves-erc3643-as-the-first-tokenization-standard?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_kjLgkKyKQeSHDSFv2FH7jVneK_-VvwmDYV64SCj2JROetoODqqwO8Ke-Rdqi10DJW3wne">&nbsp;‘Final’ status in its Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)</a>. This indicates its validation by the official Ethereum community.</p>
<p>The EIP is a rigorous process mandatory for all Ethereum-based standards, including prominent ones like ERC-20 and ERC-721. Achieving the final status signifies a major milestone for the tokenization industry, as&nbsp;ERC-3643 now provides an official token standard for compliant tokenization.</p>
<p>As the initial creator of the ERC-3643 standard, we identified an essential requirement for a unified standard to achieve interoperability. From its inception, we committed to an open-source approach. Initially known as the T-REX (Token for Regulated EXchanges) protocol, this protocol embodied our vision for a more interconnected and efficient tokenization ecosystem with built-in compliance.</p>
<p>In 2021, we submitted the T-REX protocol to the EIP, aspiring to establish it as an official standard. This journey, though extensive and intricate, involved the process of evolving from Draft to Stagnant, then to Review, and ultimately achieving Final status after two years of dedicated effort.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>Today,&nbsp;ERC-3643 is the de facto standard for enterprise-ready tokenization,&nbsp;with highlights including:</p>
<p>✅ Validated&nbsp;by the Ethereum community: Earning&nbsp;<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3643?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_kjLgkKyKQeSHDSFv2FH7jVneK_-VvwmDYV64SCj2JROetoODqqwO8Ke-Rdqi10DJW3wne">the ‘Final’ status</a>&nbsp;ensures official recognition and trust from the EVM developer community.</p>
<p>✅ Audited&nbsp;by Hacken:&nbsp;The audit results yielded&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/hacken-grants-tokenization-protocol-erc3643-a-10-10-security-audit-score/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_kjLgkKyKQeSHDSFv2FH7jVneK_-VvwmDYV64SCj2JROetoODqqwO8Ke-Rdqi10DJW3wne">a flawless score of 10/10</a>, serving as a testament to the high level of security and integrity that the protocol offers.</p>
<p>✅ Supported&nbsp;by institutions: Prominent institutions and firms, like Apex Group, Invesco, Aztec, CMS, DLA Piper, and Polygon have formed<a href="https://www.erc3643.org/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_kjLgkKyKQeSHDSFv2FH7jVneK_-VvwmDYV64SCj2JROetoODqqwO8Ke-Rdqi10DJW3wne">&nbsp;a non-profit association</a>&nbsp;to catalyze worldwide adoption of the ERC-3643.</p>
<p>✅ 6-year track record:&nbsp;The standard has been used to tokenize over&nbsp;$28 billion in assets for hundreds of projects over the past six years.</p>
<p>2023 marks the dawn of institutional tokenization, and we believe that institutions will increasingly embrace tokenization.&nbsp;The audited and validated ERC-3643 standard is set to expedite this shift in 2024!</p>
<p>It is an exciting day for Tokeny’s brainchild. We encourage anyone interested in tokenizing or wanting to implement ERC-3643 to access the code on GitHub&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/TokenySolutions/T-REX?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_kjLgkKyKQeSHDSFv2FH7jVneK_-VvwmDYV64SCj2JROetoODqqwO8Ke-Rdqi10DJW3wne">here</a>.</p>
<p>However, building a tokenization platform is&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/what-should-you-expect-from-a-tokenization-platform-in-2024/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_kjLgkKyKQeSHDSFv2FH7jVneK_-VvwmDYV64SCj2JROetoODqqwO8Ke-Rdqi10DJW3wne">more than just deploying smart contracts</a>. We have built a no-code and API-ready platform for enterprises to start securely and quickly with an easy UI and UX.</p>
<p>We wish you a Happy New Year!</p>

<p>“Fast” and “frictionless” onboarding for customers, workers and citizens is an elusive goal. Sure, identity verification is crucial, but so is verifying claims such as educational qualifications, an industry certification, health data, citizen status, residency and more. Striking the right balance with defenses against another, less desirable “F” word—fraud—in a manner that protects privacy and reduces the chances of compromise, yet another challenge</p>
<p>Whether it’s for onboarding, new customer account origination, or provisioning additional digital services to qualified requesters, organizations need to replace and digitally transform outdated and manual verification using AI, data triangulation and machine verification of identity and credentials. The new and better way to do this is to give users reusable, verified “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/07/20/why-reusable-smart-credentials-will-win-over-physical-analog-identity-verification/?sh=6349fdf03373">smart credentials</a>“neatly packaged in a digital identity wallet that users keep up-to-date, present on demand, and grant specific sharing permissions.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials leverage data registries that include trusted databases, decentralized databases, government ID databases, and distributed ledgers. The credential holder mediates between the registry or trusted “issuer” and the verifier authenticating the holder—creating a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials#:~:text=Verifiable%20credentials%20(VCs)%20are%20digital,ownership%20of%20a%20bank%20account.">triangle of trust.</a> A holder’s credentials can be verified without any data being exchanged – a zero knowledge proof. In this way, verification is assured, privacy concerns are ameliorated, and the risk of identity theft or compromise is minimized or eliminated. Here again, the 1Kosmos architecture excels because this all needs to be done in an auditable, tamper-evident way to ensure high assurance and trust.</p>
 IAM Verified–Quickly, Easily, and Accurately 
<p>In Parts <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/possession-is-nine-tenths-of-the-flaw-why-device-based-biometrics-dont-cut-it-for-iam/">Two</a>, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blockchain/ditching-the-feds-why-decentralized-digital-identity-is-key-to-effective-iam/">Three</a>, and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blockchain/the-immutable-chain-of-custody-why-distributed-ledger-is-critical-to-modern-iam/">Four</a> in this series, we explained how the<a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/what-a-difference-identity-makes-why-iam-keeps-falling-short-and-how-to-fix-it/"> 1Kosmos architecture</a> provides a secure and reliable way to verify user or applicant identity and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication-platform/">biometrically authenticate</a> them with 99.6% accuracy via decentralized digital identity (DID) mechanisms within our BlockID solution, including a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/decentralized-digital-identity/">reusable digital identity wallet</a> while removing the centralized PII honeypot hackers target for exploitation.</p>
<p>The final pillar of the 1Kosmos <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/what-a-difference-identity-makes-why-iam-keeps-falling-short-and-how-to-fix-it/">architectural advantage</a> is <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/verifiable-credentials/">Digital Claims and Credentials Verification</a>, which delivers automated, cryptographically secure verification of identity, qualifications, competencies, authority, and more while respecting an individual’s privacy.</p>
<p>Why did we feel this pillar was so important? Because it provides progressively higher levels of identity assurance for authentication and digitally transforms a broad range of business processes—from worker or contractor onboarding to new customer account origination to the provisioning of new digital product lines and beyond. Often, there is more than one type of verifiable data registry utilized, depending on use cases that span:</p>
 
 Education: Utilize a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-use-cases/#dfn-credential-repository">credential repository</a> service to provide digital transcripts and digital credentials representing certificates or degrees verified to be earned by the individual 
 Finance: Perform Know-Your-Customer (KYC)- and Anti-Money Laundering (AML)-compliant identity verification using government-supplied <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-use-cases/#dfn-verifiable-credentials">verifiable credentials</a> and issue a digitally-signed <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-use-cases/#dfn-credential">credential</a> 
 Retail: Verify retail and payment account ownership, payment amount, and sufficient permission to approve payment 
 Healthcare: Facilitate patient-approved sharing of electronic healthcare records with a Qualified Health Information Network (AHIN) 
 Government: Enable government agencies to function as Credential Service Providers by performing Identity Assurance Level 2 (IAL2) and issuing a digitally-signed Authentication Assurance Level 2 (AAL2) credential certified to NiST 800-63-3 and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-identity-attributes-trust-framework-updated-version">UK DIATF</a> standards 
 Enterprise: Share current and past employment to prospective employers and other entities that need to verify status 
 
 A Trustworthy Method for Verifying Claims and Credentials 
<p>1Kosmos BlockID automates manual identity and credential verification with a secure, rules-based workflow, reducing errors and improving accuracy. High assurance along with cryptographically secure storage and sharing establish repeatable, high-trust, and seamless re-verification by business partners or by additional lines of business. Key features of the 1Kosmos solution include the following.</p>
 Data Triangulation to Verify Claims Across Trusted Data Sources 
<p>To reach identity verification and authentication assurance to <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST 800-63-3</a> standards, BlockID triangulates claims across multiple verifiable sources. These include personal details such as the individual’s full name, date of birth, address, place of birth, photo ID, phone number, employer, etc. The triangulation is based upon government- or bank-issued documents such as a driver’s license, national ID card, passport, credit card, and Social Security Number.</p>
<p>Information can be matched across multiple sources to validate documents as current, or flagged as lost or stolen. Our verification accommodates government-issued credentials in 205 countries with +99% identity proofing accuracy and spoofing/counterfeit detection. Verification at lower levels of assurance is achieved through banking, telco (SIM binding), email, Social Security Number, phone number, and more.</p>
<p>This kind of digital verifiable credential can represent all of the same information that a physical credential represents while also including additional assurances against fraud, such as a digital signature.</p>
 Standards-based Design for Maximum Interoperability 
<p>With 1Kosmos, verifiable credentials allow for the digital proofing of an individual’s claims information through public-private cryptography. Our solutions follow the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">VC Data Model</a> defined at the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C</a>, which provides a common mechanism for the interoperable implementation of digital credentials that are cryptographically secure, tamper-evident, privacy-respecting, and machine-verifiable.</p>
<p>A standardized data model enables credential packaging, cryptographic signing, and proof expression. This creates a verified credential (VC) ecosystem with interoperable credentials that can be processed and understood across and between disparate systems.</p>
 Powerful, Easy-to-Use Administration and DevOps Tools 
<p>We developed the 1Kosmos BlockID platform to require no custom coding, special firewall rules, or unique security configurations. Deployment is simple and fast, with over 50 out-of-the-box <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/integrations/">integrations</a> and a robust SDK/API framework that complies with the strictest GDPR, SOC2, and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blockchain/privacy-by-design-iso-standard/">ISO 27001</a> certification standards for handling and retaining sensitive data.</p>
<p>This enables ID proofing to be quickly integrated into native apps via an API, mobile, web, or desktop integration. This flexible, standards-based approach can meet the needs of virtually any workflow and enables BlockID to satisfy both workforce and customer identity verification.</p>
<p>Our cloud-based administration panel makes configuring and managing the BlockID platform easy. And our <a href="https://developer.1kosmos.com/devportal/">DevX portal</a> provides a hosted sandbox for developers to test FIDO-based authentication and verification options integrated into your applications. The <a href="https://developer.1kosmos.com/devportal/demo/?tab=dlverify">Developer Sandbox</a> offers an easy, hands-on way for developers to test use cases using available APIs for FIDO-based <a href="https://developer.1kosmos.com/devportal/demo/?tab=passwordless">authentication</a>, <a href="https://developer.1kosmos.com/devportal/demo/?tab=fidowebauthn">WebAuthn</a>, <a href="https://developer.1kosmos.com/devportal/demo/?tab=magiclinks">Magic Links</a>, <a href="https://developer.1kosmos.com/devportal/demo/?tab=dlverify">Driver’s License Verification</a>, <a href="https://developer.1kosmos.com/devportal/demo/?tab=vc">Verified Credentials</a>, and more.</p>
 A Modern IAM Architecture That Means Business 
<p>According to a recent <a href="https://www.ey.com/en_in/forensic-integrity-services/ensuring-fraud-free-hiring-with-technology-powered-employee-background-check">Ernst &amp; Young survey</a>, nearly 70% of organizations report having manual verification processes that are riddled with errors, highly time-consuming, or both. By automating manual identity and credential verification with a secure, rules-based workflow, BlockID eliminates errors, improves accuracy, and reduces administrative overhead. Its high assurance and cryptographically secure storage and sharing, help establish repeatable, high-trust re-verification by business partners or additional lines of business. And its automated machine verification, combined with the high level of trust from a tamper-proof design, reduces the need for manual reviews and enables digital processes to scale or evolve rapidly. All while providing a fast, frictionless user experience—while kicking that other “F” word to the curb.</p>

<p>The end of the year is always an exciting time, from reflecting on everything we’ve accomplished to planning for the exciting projects that lie ahead.</p><p>For SpruceID, 2023 has been a positive year of growth and change. We grew our company, participated in many events that helped expand our community, enhanced our products and platforms, and more.</p><p>Let’s take a walk down memory lane through 2023 and revisit some major highlights of the past year together!</p> 👪 Our Team <p>We gained even more Sprucers this year and remain to be a small but mighty global team. From engineering to product development, marketing, and design, we’re excited to continue to build up our talent to meet the demands of our growing company.</p><p>Although we are a remote-first company, we hold offsites every six months for one week at a time to focus on relationship building, align on strategy, and more. This year, we met in Lisbon, Portugal, and Dublin, Ireland!</p><p>Interested in joining our awesome team? <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/sprucesystems?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Check out our open roles here</a>.</p> 🎤 Events and Hackathons   SpruceID attended ETHDenver this year and connected with others in the decentralized identity space! Our booth offered an interactive experience where visitors could test out claiming a credential to prove they visited our booth and then plant a tree after verifying that credential.&nbsp;  In March, we hosted <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/announcing-did-day-an-exploration-of-decentralized-identity-at-ethdenver-buidlweek/">did:day</a>, a half-day event during ETHDenver’s #BUIDLWeek with a mission to create a forum dedicated to educating about decentralized identity, how it impacts web3 and beyond, and how to increase adoption. The event consisted of several lightning talks and panels on user-controlled identity, decentralized social media, and more.  This summer, we<a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/encode-university-hackathon-2023/"> participated in the Encode Future of Blockchain University Hackathon</a>. Over the course of four weeks, university students from blockchain clubs across the world learned about decentralized identity, built projects, and competed for prizes. Read more about our <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/encode-university-hackathon-2023/">bounties</a> and the <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/announcing-our-encode-hackathon-bounty-winners/">winners</a>.  At the end of August, SpruceID <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/mobile-drivers-license-interoperability-event/">hosted the first fully remote asynchronous interoperability test event for mobile driver’s license implementations</a>. This event provided a collaboration forum over the course of two weeks for implementers of the draft technical specification for unattended or fully online presentation of mobile driver’s licenses (ISO/IEC 18013-7). Read more about the event results <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/iso-iec-18013-7-interoperability-event-results/">here</a>.  We rounded out the year by hosting a webinar with GovTech featuring a fireside chat between Wayne Chang, SpruceID Co-Founder and CEO, and Ajay Gupta, Chief Digital Transformation Officer at the State of California DMV. <a href="https://event.on24.com/eventRegistration/console/apollox/mainEvent?eventid=4419861&amp;sessionid=1&amp;username=&amp;partnerref=&amp;format=fhvideo1&amp;mobile=&amp;flashsupportedmobiledevice=&amp;helpcenter=&amp;key=2C578405F3FE22F30ADF478630724166&amp;newConsole=true&amp;nxChe=true&amp;newTabCon=true&amp;consoleEarEventConsole=false&amp;text_language_id=en&amp;playerwidth=748&amp;playerheight=526&amp;eventuserid=653726278&amp;contenttype=A&amp;mediametricsessionid=561697865&amp;mediametricid=6227059&amp;usercd=653726278&amp;mode=launch&amp;ref=blog.spruceid.com">Watch the webinar</a> to learn more about:  How the California DMV is offering mobile driver's licenses and other digital credentials, such as car registrations, to its residents and best practices for success  The importance of open-source development to enable myriad use cases across public and private sectors for verifiable digital identity  The security and accessibility advantages of digitally verifiable credentials     🛠️ Our Products<br>  Credible <p>This year, we’ve been honing in on Credible — an entire credential lifecycle management product with security and privacy at its core. From credential issuance and presentations to updates and revocations, Credible is made to integrate into high-assurance environments that require certain safety and security certifications.</p>  After working with the State of California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) for 18 months to bring mobile driver’s licenses to residents of California, we were thrilled to help launch the pilot program to allow California residents to <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/ca-dmv-wallet/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">download a mobile driver’s license (mDL)</a> on their smartphone in August of 2023. This project demonstrated a successful implementation of Credible and our open-source libraries.  We ended this year on a high note with a <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/about/awards/government-eye-on-innovation?utm_source=int-mktg&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=RM_GB_2023_ITDIS_SOC_SOC1_EOI23SOCIALBUNDLE">Gartner Eye on Innovation Award for Government</a>. The State of California Department of Motor Vehicles won this award for their Open Source Mobile Wallet for Decentralized Digital Credentials, which was built by SpruceID. We couldn’t be more proud to have played a role in winning such a prestigious award.   SpruceKit <p>If you’ve been keeping up with our developer community, you may be familiar with many of our open-source libraries, such as Sign-In with Ethereum, DIDKit, and TreeLDR. This year, we moved these open-source libraries all under SpruceKit, an open-source toolkit for decentralized identity. SpruceKit enables secure wallet construction by allowing builders to accept digital credentials from users on their terms, originate trusted information for users, and interact with data vaults.</p><p>Sign-In with Ethereum</p>  As of the end of this year, Sign-in with Ethereum has 2,890,141 total downloads on NPM (and 2,000,000 just in this year alone), as well as 53,848 downloads on PyPI!  This year, we <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruce-integrates-sign-in-with-ethereum-into-metamask-for-better-user-experience-and-safety/">integrated Sign-In with Ethereum into Metamask</a>. These efforts to provide user-friendly security and safety enhancements across Web3 wallet experiences should increase users' confidence in interacting with dapps.  <p>Kepler</p>  Kepler had an extensive refactor to extract the core logic into a new crate separate from the HTTP API and to implement its state tracking using SQL (SQLite, Postgres, and MySQL are supported) (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler/pull/143?ref=blog.spruceid.com">kepler #143</a>).  This year, we added support for a capability read function so clients can read capabilities delegated to them and others if authorized (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler/pull/134?ref=blog.spruceid.com">kepler #134</a>).  We moved host key management into the OrbitDatabase in kepler-core via the Secrets trait and provided an implementation of the trait based on simple per-orbit derivation from a static secret (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler/pull/146?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#146</a>).  <p>SSI/DIDKit</p>  Support for DataIntegrityProof proof suites was introduced (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/515?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#515</a>).  We rewrote our VC API implementation in Axum (didkit <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/didkit/pull/351?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#351</a>) and added it to the W3C-CCG interoperability test suites (<a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-api-test-suite-implementations/pull/64?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#64</a>).  A major refactor of ssi was initiated. This refactor will help us to handle Linked Data better and generally improve our implementation of the various Verifiable Credentials and Decentralised IDs specifications (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/508?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#508</a>). The general API redesign is over, and we are now rewriting all ssi tests and making sure the new implementation does not introduce regressions.  <p>TreeLDR</p><p>This year, we improved every aspect of TreeLDR: layouts, DSL, and generators.</p>  Layouts:  We introduced a new version of <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/blob/v0.2/layouts/README.md?ref=blog.spruceid.com">TreeLDR's layouts</a>, simplifying their definition and how developers can interact with them. We are working on the <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/tree/v0.2/layouts/book?ref=blog.spruceid.com">layout book</a>, containing an overview and formal specification of TreeLDR's layouts. This update introduces a lot of breaking changes for the better. We are still working on making all TreeLDR features work with these new layouts.    DSL:  We started using RDF as our intermediate representation for layouts. This change will allow the compiler to accept any RDF syntax as input in the future. Besides the TreeLDR DSL, the compiler supports N-Quads (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/108?ref=blog.spruceid.com">treeldr #108</a>) and RDF-Turtle (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/119?ref=blog.spruceid.com">treeldr #119</a>).  The DSL is not yet compatible with the new layouts. As a first step, we extracted the RDF handling part of TreeLDR's compiler into a separate project, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/inferdf-rs?ref=blog.spruceid.com">InfeRDF</a>. This standalone RDF engine is dedicated to the inference and interpretation of RDF datasets so the compiler can focus entirely on its primary purpose: layouts.    Generators:  We redesigned the Rust code generator to simplify maintenance and future extensions (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/143?ref=blog.spruceid.com">treeldr #143</a>), generate code for restricted data types with runtime validation (such as numerical constraints, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/145?ref=blog.spruceid.com">treeldr #145</a>), support for default values (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/147?ref=blog.spruceid.com">treeldr #147</a>), and more. In addition, the procedural macro used to embed TreeLDR layouts directly in Rust can now use external modules, allowing modular code generation (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/130?ref=blog.spruceid.com">treeldr #130</a>). The Rust code generator will be the <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/162?ref=blog.spruceid.com">first to support the new layouts</a>.    <p>Rebase</p>  We've added large amounts of prototype work to support two new flows, POAP ownership and NFT ownership (Rebase <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase/pull/44?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#44</a> and <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase/pull/45?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#45</a>), and added basic credential verification to the Rebase witness (Rebase <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase/pull/47/files?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#47</a>).  We've added the ability for Rebase Witnesses to arbitrarily validate any VCs that have types supported by ssi (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase/pull/69?ref=blog.spruceid.com">rebase #69</a>).  We’ve added the ability to support delegate keys to allow users to issue their own credentials without a signing prompt for each one (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase/pull/82?ref=blog.spruceid.com">rebase #82</a>).  <p>SSX</p>  We released support for NextAuth via our ssx-react package <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/tree/main/examples/ssx-test-nextauth?ref=blog.spruceid.com">with an example</a> to show how to integrate it.&nbsp;  We reworked the library architecture of SSX. The previous functions of SSX have been moved into a new module named UserAuthorization, which is responsible for end-user signing-related operations. A new storage module was added, which provides functionality to store and retrieve data in Kepler. Check out the <a href="https://www.sprucekit.dev/ssx?ref=blog.spruceid.com">SSX v2.x Docs</a>.  We’ve added Credential Modules, which allow you to fetch credentials issued on <a href="https://issuer.sprucekit.dev/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">SpruceKit Credential Issuer</a>, which can be used as a faucet for credentials.  <p>Example Apps</p>  In June, we released three new reference apps, <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/introducing-the-sprouts/">The Sprouts</a>, to demonstrate how you can leverage the SpruceKit open-source libraries to introduce decentralized identity in the next app you build. These included an AI chat interface, an app for book reviews, and a sample social networking app.   📝Standards and Working Groups   <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruce-owf/">We joined OpenWallet Foundation</a> as one of their founding members. The OpenWallet Foundation is a new open-source project hosted by the Linux Foundation Europe. This collaborative effort will develop best practices for open-source digital wallet technology.  This year, we continued participating in working groups or global standards bodies and foundations to champion open-source, interoperable solutions that help create a more privacy-forward, user-centric internet. These include W3C working groups, ISO working groups, OpenID Foundation working groups, and more. To learn more about standards we’re contributing to, whitepapers we’ve published, and more, see an example of our quarterly Standards and Working Groups update <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/q2-2023-wgs-udpate/">here</a>.   See you in 2024 <p>2023 was an exciting year full of opportunities and growth. We can’t wait to see what’s in store for 2024 as we continue on with our mission to let users control their identity and personal data across the web in a way that facilitates trusted interactions. Here’s to a fresh new year!</p> <p>About SpruceID: SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

<p>Authors: Yanisa Sunanchaiyakarn &amp; Nuttawut Kongsuwan, Finema Co.&nbsp;Ltd.</p><p>As global business transactions are increasingly conducted online, the rise of digital fraud and impersonation have become a growing threat. Consequently, digital means for the identification and verification of businesses have emerged as indispensable facilitators for seamless business transactions. Nevertheless, cross-border commerce is hindered by the diverse practices, standards, and regulations used by individual countries, presenting a substantial obstacle for businesses.</p><p>The global challenge of identifying businesses saw a significant step forward with the introduction of the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/introducing-the-legal-entity-identifier-lei">Legal Entity Identifier (LEI)</a> by the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) in the 2010s. While LEIs have proven to be a successful and reliable means of identifying organizations on a global scale, there remains a gap in effectively identifying organizations’ representatives.</p><p>Consequently, GLEIF has introduced an innovative solution to address this gap through the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">verifiable Legal Entity Identifier (vLEI)</a>. The vLEI is a globally interoperable framework that enables individuals to digitally verify their status as authorized representatives of LEI-registered organizations worldwide. Stephan Wolf, GLEIF’s CEO, has articulated the necessity and significance of this revolutionary approach in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=F4WGybUNjElwWjeT&amp;v=3mhuL9_q-hs&amp;feature=youtu.be">Organizational Identity and the&nbsp;LEI</a>.</p><blockquote>The vLEI is a globally interoperable framework that enables individuals to digitally verify their status as authorized representatives of LEI-registered organizations worldwide.</blockquote><p>The vLEI harbors the potential to revolutionize the dynamics of digital interactions among organizations, fostering seamless global business transactions online. It is imperative for large organizations and regulators worldwide to diligently heed this transformative advancement.</p><p>In this blog, we provide a visual guide for GLEIF’s vLEI ecosystem and explore how it stands out from any other organizational digital identity infrastructures.</p> vLEI Ecosystem Governance Framework <p>In 2022, GLEIF introduced the verifiable Legal Entity Identifier (vLEI) <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-vlei-ecosystem-governance-framework">Ecosystem Governance Framework (EGF)</a>, aligning with the Trust over IP (ToIP) Governance Specifications and Templates. The vLEI EGF meticulously outlines the following details:</p>  Rules, responsibilities, and obligations for all stakeholders involved in the vLEI ecosystem, including GLEIF&nbsp;itself.  Hierarchical relationships among the stakeholders, including organizations and their representatives.  Identity Verification processes for all human stakeholders.  Detailed qualification processes for vLEI issuing stakeholders, known as qualified vLEI issuers&nbsp;(QVIs).  Technical specifications for the management of cryptographic keys and self-certifying identifiers, known as autonomic identifiers (AIDs).  Technical specifications for six types of vLEI credentials.  Rigorous technical and business processes governing the issuance and revocation of vLEI credentials.  <p>According to Drummond Reed, a member of the Trust over IP Foundation Steering Committee, the strategic choice to build vLEI EGF on the ToIP governance model is poised to foster a secure and interoperable system on a global scale. This move has the potential to revolutionize the global digital trust ecosystem, bringing substantial benefits to businesses and individuals across various industries and international borders.</p><p>As of December 2023, the vLEI EGF stands out as arguably the most comprehensive digital identity framework to&nbsp;date.</p> vLEI Stakeholders <p>Within the vLEI ecosystem, there are four key stakeholders that are issuers and holders of vLEI credentials. The key stakeholders include GLEIF, qualified vLEI issuers (QVIs), legal entities (LEs), and organization representatives. The first three in the list are organizations, which are made of representatives who are authorized to participate in the vLEI ecosystem. The overview of all vLEI stakeholders is displayed below.</p>vLEI Stakeholders, including organizations and their representatives.<p>1. Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF): GLEIF appointed representatives, called GLEIF Authorized Representatives (GARs), to participate in the vLEI ecosystem and issue the QVI vLEI Credential. There are three types of GARs as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Root GARs: The root GARs collectively serve as the root of reputational trust of the entire vLEI ecosystem. Root GARs do not directly participate in the vLEI ecosystem but, instead, delegate their authority to internal GARs and external&nbsp;GARs  Internal GARs: The internal GARs participate directly in the vLEI ecosystem as a collective holder of an LE vLEI credential.  External GARs: The external GARs are responsible for the issuance and revocation of QVI vLEI credentials as well as performing identity assurance of&nbsp;QARs.  <blockquote>Note: There are two types of trust in a digital identity system: reputational trust and attributional trust. The former is the human side of trust whereas the latter is the technical side. In the vLEI ecosystem, GLEIF serves as the root of reputational trust, providing trust for identity assurance of all stakeholders. The attributional trust, on the other hand, is purely cryptographic in the vLEI ecosystem and is provided by the <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">KERI protocol</a>.</blockquote><p>2. Qualified vLEI Issuer (QVI): A QVI is an organization that is qualified by GLEIF to participate in the vLEI ecosystem as an issuer of vLEI credentials. Prior to being a QVI, a candidate organization has to undergo thorough qualification processes by GLEIF to ensure that they are capable financially and technically of issuing vLEI credentials. QVI authorizes two types of representatives:</p>  Designated Authorized Representative (DAR): The DAR of a QVI is the primary representative that is authorized to sign contracts with GLEIF and legal entities. The DAR designates and replaces the QARs of the&nbsp;QVI.  Qualified vLEI Issuer Authorized Representatives (QARs): The QARs are a collective holder of a QVI vLEI credential. The QARs perform identity assurance, issue, and revoke LE, OOR, and ECR&nbsp;vLEIs.  <p>3. Legal Entity (LE): Within the vLEI ecosystem, an LE is an LEI-registered organization. The LEs also appoint two types of representatives:</p>  Designated Authorized Representative (DAR): The DAR of an LE is the primary representative that is authorized to sign contracts with a QVI. The DAR designates and replaces the LARs of the&nbsp;LE.  Legal Entity Authorized Representatives (LARs): The LARs are a collective holder of an LE vLEI credential. The LARs perform identity assurance, issue, and revoke ECR and AUTH&nbsp;vLEIs.  <p>4. Organization Representative: An organization representative is a person who is authorized to represent an LE. Representatives are categorized by either their official or functional roles within their&nbsp;LE.</p>  Official Organizational Role Person (OOR Person): An OOR person represents an LE in an official organizational role.  Engagement Context Role Person (ECR Person): An ECR person represents an LE in a functional role.  <blockquote>Note: A person may hold any number of role vLEI credentials from a single or multiple&nbsp;LEs.</blockquote> Official Organization Role&nbsp;(OOR) <p>In <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/80603.html">ISO 5009</a>, an official organization role (OOR) is defined as an “official role of a person within an organization or legal entity within a particular jurisdiction that is publicly discoverable in formation, registration or other official documents of the organization or legal&nbsp;entity”.</p><p>GLEIF has released the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/code-lists/iso-5009-official-organizational-roles-code-list">Official Organizational Roles (OOR) Code List</a>, comprising over 2000 OORs across 89 jurisdictions. While this list provides an overview of OORs in respective native languages, it is by no means exhaustive, and there are still numerous countries awaiting inclusion.</p><p>A legal entity may assign an OOR that is not in the official OOR code list as long as the OOR is publicly discoverable in a business registry or defined in official documents of incorporation for the organization. For example, Stephan Wolf has an OOR as the CEO of GLEIF. While GLEIF is registered in Switzerland, the CEO role does not exist in the official OOR code list for Switzerland.</p> Engagement Context Role&nbsp;(ECR) <p>An engagement context role (ECR) is loosely defined by GLEIF to widely include as many use cases as possible. Here are some examples of&nbsp;ECRs:</p>  ECR as an “unofficial” organization role: An organization role that is neither publicly discoverable nor defined in official documents may be considered an ECR. For example, an employee could have an ECR as a software engineer.  ECR as an internal functional role: An ECR could be defined and used internally within an LE. For example, an employee who is officially a software engineer could also have an ECR as a Cultural Ambassador.  ECR as an external functional role: An ECR could be defined and used externally to an LE. For example, the <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/">European Banking Authority (EBA)</a> may define an ECR called an “<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-12/d5b13b4d-a9dc-4680-8b7c-0a3a4c694fac/Discussion%20paper%20on%20Pillar3%20data%20hub.pdf">EBA Submitter</a>”. An LE may designate an employee to be their EBA Submitter so that the employee may submit a financial report to&nbsp;EBA.   Collective Identifiers for&nbsp;vLEIs <p>The vLEI ecosystem is designed to be used by organizations that are made of humans and inevitably prone to human errors and shortcomings. For the vLEI to be reliably used on the global scale with the utmost trustworthiness, the vLEI EGF chooses a decentralized approach to digital identity management, also known as self-sovereign identity (SSI), to eliminate a single point of failure to the entire ecosystem by a single human administrator.</p><p>On the flip side, the absence of an administrator leaves an organization without a safety net in the case of disastrous mishaps. Consequently, the architecture of decentralized identity management for an organization should prioritize fault tolerance, avoiding dependency on a singular person or key. Otherwise, there’s a potential risk of an organization permanently losing control over its digital identity — such as in the unfortunate event of a key employee’s sudden&nbsp;demise.</p><p>The section outlines how the vLEI EGF specifies the usage of a collective identifier for an organization that is collectively controlled by multiple individuals using the KERI protocol and a multi-signature autonomic identifier.</p> Key Event Receipt Infrastructure <p>To achieve the highest level of security, scalability, and decentralization for the vLEI ecosystem, the vLEI EGF chooses the <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI)</a> protocol for the management of cryptographic keys and decentralized identifiers.</p><p>Invented in 2019 by Samuel M. Smith, KERI is a decentralized protocol for the management of cryptographic keys and identifiers that utilizes hash-chain data structures in a similar manner to traditional distributed ledger technology, also known as blockchains. Unlike traditional distributed ledgers, the KERI protocol is not subject to the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/glossary/blockchain-trilemma">blockchain trilemma</a> because KERI does not rely on a distributed consensus mechanism such as proof-of-work and proof-of-stake.</p><blockquote>Note: For more information and a glossary related to KERI, I recommend <a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/">KERISSE</a>, which is the KERI Suite Search Engine, and an upcoming browser extension <a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/test/kerific?level=3">KERIfic</a>.</blockquote> Autonomic Identifiers (AIDs) <p>As mentioned above, GLEIF only provides the root of reputational trust — i.e., human trust — within the vLEI ecosystem. The root of attributional trust — i.e., technical trust — is purely cryptographic and provided by <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#7344">autonomic identifiers (AIDs)</a>.</p><p>Without going into too much technical detail, an AID is a variant of a self-certifying identifier (SCID), which is used within the KERI protocol. This means an AID is derived by a cryptographic protocol in a decentralized manner. An AID has the following properties:</p>  An AID does not rely on any centralized entity, e.g., a human administrator. An AID is derived and controlled purely in a cryptographic manner.  An AID is persistent and is suitable for long-term use. This is because an AID is not tied to a single cryptographic key pair via a mechanism called <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#0a82">pre-rotation</a>.  An AID does not rely on a distributed ledger. However, it may be used in combination with one or more distributed-ledger networks.  An AID is portable across multiple platforms. In the case that an AID is used with a distributed ledger, an AID is not locked to that specific ledger and may be migrated to another&nbsp;ledger.  An AID is quantum-recoverable. In the case that an AID is attacked by a quantum computer, the control over the AID can be recovered from the&nbsp;attack.   Collective AIDs <p>In the KERI protocol, an AID may be cryptographically controlled via a multi-signature scheme that allows multiple individuals, called controllers, to collectively control a single identifier. This makes the KERI protocol and AIDs particularly suitable for organizational uses.</p><blockquote>Note: It is called the multi-signature scheme because multiple digital signatures from multiple private keys are required to control a single&nbsp;AID.</blockquote><p>Arbitrary levels of control authority over an AID may also be given to its controllers. For example, an AID of an LE may be controlled by three LARs — a CEO, an IT administrator, and a human resource manager — with the following control authority:</p>  The CEO of the LE has “2/3” control over the LE&nbsp;AID  The IT administrator has “1/3” control over the LE&nbsp;AID  The human resource manager has “1/3” control over the LE&nbsp;AID  <blockquote>Note: This type of scheme is called a fractionally weighted multi-signature scheme.</blockquote><p>A multi-signature AID requires signatures with a combined control authority of “1” or more. In the above example, the CEO may authorize a transaction with either the IT admin or the HR. However, the IT admin and the HR—without the CEO—are not able to authorize a transaction since their combined control authority is only “1/3” + “1/3” =&nbsp;“2/3”.</p> Multi-device AIDs and&nbsp;MFA <p>The multi-signature scheme also allows an AID to be controlled by multiple devices. For example, an ECR person may control their AID using a mobile phone and a laptop, each having control authority of “1”. In this example, the ECR person may either use their mobile phone or laptop to, e.g., sign a contract with the ECR vLEI credential.</p><blockquote>Note: To be more technically precise, the ECR person uses a private key that is associated with an AID to sign the contract. The AID must be the same as the AID specified in their ECR vLEI credential.</blockquote><p>The multi-signature scheme could be utilized to enable KERI-native multi-factor authentication (MFA). For example, an ECR person may assign “1/2” control over their AID to a mobile phone and another “1/2” to a laptop. In this example, the ECR must use both the mobile and the laptop to, e.g., sign a contract.</p><blockquote>Note: The multi-signature scheme may be used recursively. For example, an LE AID may be controlled by three individuals, each with control authority “1/3”. Each “1/3” could be further divided into two halves using two devices. For more details, see <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy/discussions/602">Key Management for Organizational Identity</a> by Samuel M.&nbsp;Smith.</blockquote> AID Management by vLEI Stakeholders <p>The vLEI EGF requires that all vLEI issuing organizations — including GLEIF, QVIs, and LEs — hold collective AIDs using such multi-signature schemes. This enables the maker-checker process that requires the approval of at least two individuals for all workflows related to the issuance and revocation of vLEI credentials.</p><p>An example of the management of the AIDs and associated cryptographic keys for all vLEI stakeholders is shown&nbsp;below.</p>Management of AIDs and associated keys by representatives of vLEI stakeholders.  GLEIF Root AID: The GLEIF Root AID enables the root of reputational trust of the vLEI ecosystem. The role of the GLEIF Root AID is to delegate to GIDA and GEDA. Currently, the GLEIF Root AID is controlled by 7 Root GARs, each with control authority of&nbsp;“1/3”.  <blockquote>Note: Delegation in the vLEI ecosystem utilizes the <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#c421">cooperative delegation mechanism</a> in the KERI protocol. It requires a cryptographic commitment from both the Delegator and the Delegate to initialize or update the key states of&nbsp;AIDs.</blockquote>  GLEIF Internal Delegated AID (GIDA): The GIDA is used to participate in the vLEI ecosystem as the holder of the LE vLEI credential. Currently, the GIDA is controlled by the 5 Internal GARs, each with a controlled authority of&nbsp;“1/2”.  GLEIF External Delegated AID (GEDA): The GEDA is used to issue and revoke the QVI vLEI credentials. Currently, the GEDA is controlled by the 5 External GARs, each with controlled authority of&nbsp;“1/2”  <blockquote>Note: The key management for the GLEIF’s AIDs can be inspected from their KERI witnesses as follows: <a href="https://www.gleif.org/.well-known/keri/oobi/EDP1vHcw_wc4M__Fj53-cJaBnZZASd-aMTaSyWEQ-PC2?name=GLEIF%20RoOT">GLEIF Root AID</a>, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/.well-known/keri/oobi/EFcrtYzHx11TElxDmEDx355zm7nJhbmdcIluw7UMbUIL?name=GLEIF%20Internal">GIDA</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gleif.org/.well-known/keri/oobi/EINmHd5g7iV-UldkkkKyBIH052bIyxZNBn9pq-zNrYoS?name=GLEIF%20External">GEDA</a>.</blockquote>  QVI AID: A QVI AID is delegated by the GEDA and must be controlled by at least 3 QARs where at least 2 QARs are required to authorize issuance and revocation of vLEI credentials. For example, a QVI AID could be controlled by 4 QARs with control authority of [“2/3”, “2/3”, “1/3”, “1/3”] such that the QVI cannot authorize a transaction without either of the first two&nbsp;QARs.  <blockquote>Note: All QVI AIDs are also delegated by the GEDA using the <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#c421">cooperative delegation mechanism</a> in the KERI protocol. As a result, key rotation of a QVI AID must be approved by the External GARs. For example, if a QVI wishes to change one of their QARs by rotating the key of the leaving QAR, the QVI must inform the External GARs to approve the key rotation&nbsp;event.</blockquote>  LE AID: An LE AID must be controlled by at least 3 LARs where at least 2 LARs are required to authorize issuance and revocation of vLEI credentials. There is an exception to this rule when an LE has fewer than 3 employees. In this case, the LE cannot directly issue a vLEI credential and must authorize a QVI to issue it on their&nbsp;behalf.  Role AID: There is no requirement for a multi-signature scheme for ECR and OOR persons. An organization representative may control their AID using a single signing key. They may also use a multi-signature scheme to divide the control authority of their AID to multiple&nbsp;devices.   Types of vLEI Credentials <p>The previous sections have outlined the stakeholders, their relationships, and the management of their identifiers, called AIDs, in the vLEI ecosystem. We are now well-positioned to explore what the vLEI credentials actually are. The vLEI credentials, in fact, consist of six types of verifiable credentials that are issued and received by different vLEI stakeholders. Their schemas can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/vLEI/tree/dev/schema/acdc">here</a>.</p><blockquote>Note: vLEI credentials utilize<a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html"> Authentic Chained Data Containers (ACDCs)</a>, which are considered a variant of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials Data&nbsp;Model</a>.</blockquote> (1) Qualified vLEI Issuer (QVI) vLEI Credential <p>A QVI vLEI credential is issued by the External GARs (i.e., the GEDA) to a candidate QVI after they complete the formal qualification process. The issuance of the QVI vLEI credential serves as the formal qualification by GLEIF that the QVI is now eligible to participate in the vLEI ecosystem.</p><p>Before the issuance of a QVI vLEI credential, the External GARs must perform identity verification on all of the QARs. After the issuance of the QVI vLEI credential, if the QVI wishes to add more QARs, the identity of the new QARs must also be verified by the External&nbsp;GARs.</p> (2) Legal Entity (LE) vLEI Credential <p>An LE vLEI credential is issued by a QVI to an LE. The issuance of the LE vLEI credential allows the LE to issue role and AUTH vLEI credentials.</p><p>Before the issuance of an LE vLEI credential, the QARs must perform identity verification on all of the LARs. After the issuance of the LE vLEI credential, if the LE wishes to add more LARs, the identity of the new LARs must also be verified by the&nbsp;QARs.</p><blockquote>Note: A QVI may issue an LE vLEI credential to the GIDA. The GIDA’s LE vLEI was initially issued by <a href="https://provenant.net/">Provenant Inc.</a>, the first&nbsp;QVI.</blockquote> (3) &amp; (4) Qualified vLEI Issuer (QVI) Authorization (AUTH) vLEI Credentials <p>A QVI AUTH vLEI credential is issued by an LE to a QVI to authorize the QVI to issue a role vLEI credentials, including the LE ECR and LE OOR vLEI credentials. A LAR of the LE has to input the accurate data of their representative — including the legal name and role — in the QVI AUTH vLEI credential. There are two variants of the QVI AUTH vLEI credentials as&nbsp;follows:</p>  OOR AUTH vLEI credential, which authorizes a QVI to issue an OOR vLEI credential  ECR AUTH vLEI credential, which authorizes a QVI to issue an ECR vLEI credential  <p>Before the issuance of a QVI AUTH vLEI credential, the LARs must perform identity verification on the representative, who is either an OOR or ECR&nbsp;person.</p> (5) Official Organizational Role (OOR) vLEI Credential <p>An OOR vLEI credential is a role vLEI credential issued by a QVI to an OOR person. Before issuing an OOR vLEI credential, the QVI must be first authorized by the OOR AUTH vLEI credential, which has been issued by the LE that the OOR person represents.</p><p>Before the issuance of an OOR vLEI credential, the QARs must perform identity verification on the OOR person. The QVI must also verify that the OOR person genuinely holds the specified OOR using official public sources or documents of the&nbsp;LE.</p> (6) Engagement Context Role (ECR) vLEI Credential: <p>An ECR vLEI Credential is a role vLEI credential issued to an ECR person. Unlike other types of vLEI credentials, an ECR vLEI credential may be issued by two approaches as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Direct issuance by an LE: The LARs of the LE perform identity verification on the ECR person and directly issue the ECR vLEI credential.  Issuance by a QVI: The LARs perform identity verification on the ECR person and issue an ECR AUTH vLEI credential to a QVI. The QARs of the QVI then perform identity verification on the ECR person again before issuing the ECR vLEI credential.   Credential Chaining <p>One of the unique properties of vLEI credentials, which utilize authentic chained data containers (ACDCs), is credential chaining. vLEI credentials are chained using strong cryptographic digests, starting from QVI vLEI credentials issued by the External GARs. For example, an OOR vLEI credential of an OOR person is chained in the following manner:</p>  (5) the OOR vLEI credential, which is issued by a QVI, is cryptographically chained to (3) an OOR AUTH vLEI credential issued by an LE that the OOR person represents,  (3) the OOR AUTH vLEI credential is cryptographically chained to (2) an LE vLEI credential that the same QVI issues to the&nbsp;LE,  (2) LE vLEI credential is cryptographically chained to (1) a QVI vLEI credential that the External GARs (GEDA) issue to the&nbsp;QVI  The GEDA is cryptographically linked to the GLEIF Root&nbsp;AID.  <p>Due to credential chaining, every vLEI credential can be cryptographically verified, all the way, to the GLEIF Root&nbsp;AID.</p><blockquote>Note: The cryptographic digests for ACDCs are generated using the <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-2-said-and-acdc-de6bc544b95e">Self-Addressing Identifier (SAID)</a> protocol.</blockquote> Conclusion <p>The verifiable Legal Entity Identifier (vLEI) Ecosystem Governance Framework (EGF) has laid a foundation for a globally interoperable digital identity system for organizations. The vLEI EGF defines a hierarchical governance structure where GLEIF is the root of reputational trust. It employs a novel approach to key management using Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) and autonomic identifiers (AIDs) that serve as the root of attributional trust. This approach enables multiple authorized representatives to collectively control their organizations’ decentralized identifiers. Most importantly, the vLEI EGF defines 6 types of vLEI credentials with rigorous cryptographic relationships that reflect the hierarchical structure of the vLEI ecosystem. Every vLEI credential is cryptographically chained and can be verified, all the way, to the GLEIF Root&nbsp;AID.</p><p>The vLEI EGF facilitates the issuance of vLEI credentials, providing the highest level of identity assurance. These credentials enable digital verification of organizations and their authorized representatives globally and across industries. The vLEIs stand as a cutting-edge, interoperable, and decentralized solution in the organizational digital identity ecosystem, positioning them as the utmost secure and trustworthy choice for global business transactions.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/vlei-demystified-part-1-comprehensive-overview-212349c09643">vLEI Demystified Part 1: Comprehensive Overview</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/finema">Finema</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Holochain started the year with the release of <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-beta-released/">Holochain Beta 0.1.0</a> and it’s been an avalanche of development and achievements since then. We can’t talk about everything here, but want to share some highlights with you. As we bundle up for winter in the northern hemisphere (and rejoice at summer in the southern hemisphere), let’s walk through the year together to remember where we have been.&nbsp;</p> Spring: Holochain Beta <p>The Holochain beta release continued through the spring with <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/tag/dev-tools-explainers/">dev tooling</a>, updates to the 0.1.x series, and even an early release of 0.2.x. Paul d’Aoust started work on our dev documentation and refreshed <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Dev Portal</a>, and the team could feel the excitement as we continued to improve on a stable codebase.&nbsp;</p><p>Taking Holochain back out on the road, we <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-at-ethdenver-2023/">attended EthDenver</a>, hosting a series of satellite events where we gave blockchain devs a hands-on opportunity to feel what Holochain can do, and collectively we imagined the future of the web.</p><p>In March, we had our first of two online <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dev-training-recap/">Dev Trainings</a>. The course was taught by Marcus Phillips, co-founder of the immersive software engineering school <a href="https://www.galvanize.com/hack-reactor/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Hack Reactor</a>, and community developer Guillem Cordoba (check out his work at <a href="https://darksoil.studio/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Dark Soil</a>). The cohort of eighteen students learned how to work with Holochain’s backend code, preparing them to build custom distributed applications.</p><p>This spring we felt Holochain really <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/becoming-viable-seeds-to-saplings/">become viable</a>.</p> Summer: DWeb Camp <p>Summer took us to <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dweb-camp-2023-holochain/">DWeb Camp</a>. For those that don’t know it, DWeb Camp is a sort of Mecca for the distributed web community. Getting to think, work, talk, and present alongside and with all of the other projects building the next web (from Filecoin and OpenAI to Secure Scuttlebutt and Spritely) was truly an honor. But we might have learned the most from the <a href="https://dwebcamp.org/fellowships/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DWeb fellows</a> who brought their openness, honesty, situated need, and greatly innovative ideas to the gathering.&nbsp;</p><p>As a co-sponsor of the event, Holochain showed up in force, with dozens of team and&nbsp; community members attending. In addition to presentations, workshops, and panels, we developed a custom app for the event. We decided to create an app for scheduling and managing emergent sessions across the event. But this app had to work in the woods, and on people’s phones. <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/emergence-lessons-in-contextual-complexity/">In the end, we stumbled and learned.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>The need for mobile on Holochain has pushed us to develop a deep relationship with smartphone manufacturer <a href="https://volla.online/en/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Volla</a> as a first test case for a mobile native Holochain. In May, community devs <a href="https://twitter.com/Holochain/status/1663847940853571586?ref=blog.holochain.org">Hedayat Abedijoo and Nick Stebbings showcased a small Holochain application at the Volla community event</a>. Since then we have been in a collaborative process of application design and testing to get Holochain apps running on their privacy-first OS.</p> Fall: Connecting to Web3 <p>Fall took the team from conference, to podcast, to conference, including a number of appearances as speakers and moderators. Check out a few of the opportunities we had to talk to the world about Holochain throughout the year.</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/holochain/status/1689684274390212622?ref=blog.holochain.org">Mary on the Diving into Crypto podcast</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/holochain/status/1692092474506752391?ref=blog.holochain.org">Mary on the Web3 Disruptor podcast</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7puEjHI2J4&amp;list=PLOuXrtFJO6zXsTs56d0bpPmVpHjMO7m50&amp;index=1&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">Zebu Live 2023: How Verifiable Data Powers Up Web3</a>  <p>This fall also saw Holochain used in Web3 and blockchain contexts in new ways. <a href="https://welcometonor.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Nor</a>, is a Web3 gaming platform using Holo and Holochain for a variety of systems, such as identity and login. Nor is creating new models of skill based gaming and reward in Web3.</p><p>Similarly <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/fractal-tribute-bridging-blockchains-and-holochain/">Fractal Tribute</a>, developed by Josh Hardy of the <a href="https://rainlang.xyz/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Rain Protocol</a>, in partnership with our Executive Director Mary Camacho showed that it was possible to secure NFT assets on a Holochain app. The app is a live play, distributed art game, inspired by r/place, where players collaboratively make art which they can mint into NFTs. We showcased this game at events from <a href="https://www.zebulive.xyz/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Zebu Live</a> in London, to <a href="https://devconnect.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DevConnect</a> in Istanbul, and we even <a href="https://twitter.com/holochain/status/1721146092593586602?ref=blog.holochain.org">hosted our own event</a> spinning off from <a href="https://nftsanfrancisco.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">NFT SF</a> when the conference was sadly put on hold. Fractal Tribute acts as a proof of concept for new ways to <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/augmenting-nfts-with-holochain/">augment NFTs using Holochain</a>.</p><p>In October we also held our second online <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/joins-us-and-learn-holochain/">Dev Training</a>. Check out these clips from the demos:</p>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xZmBZQ3KywA?si=YW933FuCumG8Qvf3&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">A Design Pattern for Private Data — Dev Training hApp Demo</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xZmBZQ3KywA?si=YW933FuCumG8Qvf3&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org"></a><a href="https://youtu.be/KvkmfPaRqjs?si=6Ne0KSqb7N9FUb9x&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">A Deck Building Game — Dev Training hApp Demo</a>   Winter: Holo Feature Complete <p>The end of this year brings the next big leap for Holochain as we step into 2024. The Holo network is built on the Holochain framework to provide distributed hosting to hApps. With the release of the Holo Network-RC and the upcoming Holo Launch, we have a real case study showing a performant Holochain used for a commercial application. This will spur development of Holochain apps, and we expect an increase in both apps hosted on the Holo network and operating directly in peer networks as a result. Read <a href="https://press.holo.host/232769-holo-delivers-network-release-candidate-in-december?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holo’s Lead/Org announcement</a> to learn more.</p><p>As we enter into 2024, we are excited for what is to come: New and developing collaborations like those with Nor and Volla; the growth of ecosystem projects like Neighbourhoods’ <a href="https://blog.neighbourhoods.network/neighbourhoods-offers-support-to-the-green-climate-funds-sri-lankan-initiative-3532a70264b7?ref=blog.holochain.org">pilot program</a> with the Green Climate Fund in Sri Lanka; and continued application development as Holochain apps become more accessible through Holo’s hosting network. This is just the beginning. Welcome to a New Year.</p> Looking to Catch Up? <p>We’ve been catching up on reading over the holidays and wanted to recommend a few articles from this last year.</p> From Holochain:   <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/what-is-digital-identity/">What is Digital Identity?</a>  <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/acorn-under-the-surface/">Acorn: Under the Surface</a>  <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/distributed-collective-action-network/">Building Group Cohesion Horizontally with Holochain</a>  <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/data-commoning-with-holochain-pt-1/">Data Commoning with Holochain Pt.1</a> and <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/data-commoning-with-holochain-pt-2/">Pt.2</a>   From Fellow Travelers:   <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-cloud-is-a-prison-can-the-local-first-software-movement-set-us-free/?ref=blog.holochain.org">The Cloud Is a Prison.

 As we look back on the past year, we’re amazed by all our incredible accomplishments. <p>Read on to take a look at our journey through 2023, the exciting milestones we reached together, and what 2024 looks like for the Veramo community.</p> Increased community contributions and participation <p>Our community has witnessed an upsurge indicating a flourishing engagement ecosystem. This surge reflects the collective effort of our community, poured into building Veramo. Community contributions and discussion participation soared this year, creating an environment where diverse perspectives meet. We also received lots of positive feedback which has been particularly heartwarming.</p><p>2023 was the [first] year of the community for Veramo.<br>Since the first lines of code, Veramo was meant to be a public good project. It was developed in the open under the old <a href="https://github.com/uport-project">uport-project</a> org on GitHub with the intent that it would be the tool to use when getting started with SSI &amp; verifiable data.</p><p>This intent is manifested in 2 ways, the architecture and the basics.<br>The architecture we chose is open, modular, and extensible. The choice was obvious to us as we were looking for a way to work in a rapidly evolving space with new and growing standards and protocols. In such a space, it would have been hard for our team to do everything internally and reasonably keep up with everything. We opted to reuse existing tooling and libraries as much as possible instead of writing new implementations, and this option now manifests as a way for anyone to use their existing tools and libraries to create plugins for Veramo.<br>The basics are all the plugins developed alongside the core package to use as a starting point to build products and apps as well as new protocols. They cover most of what you would need to function in the issuer-holder-verifier triangle of Verifiable Credentials, like key and DID management, credential issuance, storage, messaging, presentation, and verification, with a diverse set of formats and algorithms built&nbsp;in.</p><p>The ease of adding new functionality and the ability to decide which plugins to use instead of hauling around a monolith has brought a lot of attention to the Veramo framework and has prompted many folks to not only adopt it for their projects but also to contribute back some of their additions. It’s worth highlighting some of the new features and the teams that were the most active developing them: new sub-protocols supported for did-comm: coordinate mediation, trust-ping, message-pickup, routing, as well as message attachments; support for Secp256r1 for signing credentials; a new storage plugin based on kv-store; native support for did:peer, did:jwk, did:pkh and meta-transaction support for did:ethr.</p><p><a href="https://masca.io/">Masca</a>, <a href="https://sphereon.com/">Sphereon</a>, <a href="https://www.tuum.tech/">Tuum tech</a>, <a href="https://www.spherity.com/">Spherity</a>, <a href="https://www.ltonetwork.com/">LTO network</a>, and <a href="https://www.geoweb.network/">Geo Web</a> are some teams that contributed these features and deserve a shoutout.</p> Tech updates <p>Besides the contributions from the community, the recent releases of Veramo have focused on stability and interoperability improvements. Having a growing set of projects use Veramo means there is an increase in the number of corner cases encountered, new ways in which it is deployed, or plain interoperability friction. This is a great way to discover and fix bugs and make the platform as a whole much more robust. To that end, Veramo is now much more lenient with the encoding quirks of certain libraries, DIDs, or systems, and we upgraded the encryption capabilities for the did-comm package to adhere to the spec requirements and recommendations for key wrapping and content encryption.</p><p>Alongside the Veramo framework, we’ve had some interesting collaborations and projects this year. Our team was a launch partner for the Collab.land marketplace, creating <a href="https://dev.collab.land/help-docs/marketplace/apps/kudos">one of </a>its first mini-apps.</p><p>We significantly upgraded the architecture of <a href="https://explore.veramo.io">the agent-explore tool</a> and it now follows the same principles of modularity and extensibility as the Veramo framework. We hope this tool will foster the same kind of innovation in the user interface space as the Veramo framework already has done in the DID/Credential space. We used some of the learnings from that to build a <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Veramo.veramo-vscode">VSCode extension</a> for improving the experience of working with raw Verifiable Credentials.</p><p>We also used this basis to participate in the <a href="https://jokerace.xyz/contest/polygon/0x7C8420e6237C9A592EFcAC7777d28FAe78C42394">Newforum identity hackathon</a> where our BrainShare plugin for agent-explore got us a spot among the winning projects.</p> Veramo donated to&nbsp;DIF <p>​​In October this year, <a href="https://mesh.xyz/insights/the-veramo-project-donated-to-the-decentralized-identity-foundation">Veramo was donated to the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)</a> to ensure continuous collaboration and support within the broader decentralized identity community.</p><p>As part of DIF, we’ll continue to build and develop the project, alongside our community with support from the foundation. A Veramo User Group will be created in 2024, and all the members of our community, code contributors, and partners are welcome to join. The user group will be open to all regardless of DIF membership. More details about this will be shared in January, stay&nbsp;tuned.</p> Outreach <p>Veramo had a strong presence at various events throughout the year, fostering connections and sharing insights with the wider community. From the Rebooting Web of Trust to Berlin Blockchain Week, IIW38, and Eth Denver. Alongside Ceramic, we co-hosted RepConnect at DevConnect Istanbul. Outreaches like this are great opportunities to learn, share, and connect with other people in the reputation space.</p>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVpCGfoSk1Q">Demo at RepConnect</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jvf5r33UtXk?feature=shared">Panel on Insights &amp; Action Items for Building Real Apps With Decentralized Reputation at RepConnect</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/veramo/veramo-didcomm-bringing-identity-to-ai-f7efd1fbdf5d">Veramo and DidComm: Bringing Identity to AI</a>&nbsp;[Blog]  <a href="https://youtu.be/LYcIjBppkGE?feature=shared">What medium is our message?</a> [EthDenver]   Conclusion <p>Community and open source will remain at the forefront of our efforts, as they have been integral to what we’ve built.

<a href="https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/contract-upgrade-failed-because-variables-are-deleted-in-openzepplin-5-0/38341">unsafe upgradability note</a><p>OpenZeppelin is a well-known and trusted company in the blockchain world. It provides secure open-source smart contracts and libraries, which accelerate the blockchain development worldwide. For more than two years, developers from all over the world have been using OpenZeppelin’s v4 contracts to build applications. The v4 contracts were maintained, well-documented, and audited over a long period. However, On the 5th of October, a new journey began with the release the v5 of OpenZeppelin contracts. In this article, we will explain - with an example - why it is not safe to upgrade existing deployments from OpenZeppelin Contract v4 to&nbsp;v5.</p> TLDR <p>The v5 of the contracts includes significant changes and improvements. Some contracts and libraries have been restructured, while others have been removed. However, the most crucial reason for the incompatibility is that the v5 contracts of OpenZeppelin integrate a significant change to the storage layer. The contracts in v5 adopt the namespaced storage layout, which is defined in <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7201">ERC-7201</a>. This change implies that the new logic of v5 contracts will query existing data and write new data in incorrect storage slots, making an upgrade from v4 to v5 not safe. Developers have several options to update an existing contract, such as reinitializing the contract, deploying it as a new proxy, or choosing to continue with updated v4 contracts. Each option has its own unique challenges and requirements.</p> Prerequisites <p>We consider the knowledge of upgradeable smart contracts and rudimentary knowledge of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) storage as a requirement for understanding this article. The following tutorials give a good overview about upgradability of smart contracts:</p>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgSj7IiE4jA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgSj7IiE4jA</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWUDTZhxKZI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWUDTZhxKZI</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJZV9uiDbJI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJZV9uiDbJI</a>  <p>For the EVM storage layer we recommend the following articles:</p>  <a href="https://steveng.medium.com/ethereum-virtual-machine-storage-layout-beb9a72a07e9">https://steveng.medium.com/ethereum-virtual-machine-storage-layout-beb9a72a07e9</a>  <a href="https://www.adrianhetman.com/unboxing-evm-storage/">https://www.adrianhetman.com/unboxing-evm-storage/</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/@Knownsec_Blockchain_Lab/knowsec-blockchain-lab-depth-understanding-of-evm-storage-mechanism-and-security-issues-50509acea373">https://medium.com/@Knownsec_Blockchain_Lab/knowsec-blockchain-lab-depth-understanding-of-evm-storage-mechanism-and-security-issues-50509acea373</a>   Comparing how state variables are stored in OpenZeppelin upgradeable contracts in v4 versus&nbsp;v5 <p>The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) stores state variables in a key-value store with 256-bit keys and 256-bit values. These state variables are stored in a compact, continuous manner. Therefore, the order of the state variables in a smart contract determines their position in the&nbsp;storage.</p><p>OpenZeppelin v4 upgradeable contracts primarily use the default approach for storage management. The storage slots for state variables are determined by their sequential order in the contract. Therefore, base contracts often include a ‘storage buffer’ — defined as uint256[49] __gap; — to reserve storage slots. This will allow future versions of that contract to use up those slots without affecting the storage layout of child contracts. This approach of storage handling complicates contract management and upgradeability by increasing the risk of mistakes and storage conflicts, where new upgrades may unintentionally overwrite existing storage&nbsp;slots.</p><p>To simplify upgradability and minimize storage conflicts, OpenZeppelin v5 adopted the namespace storage layout, which has been proposed officially as ERC-7201 on June 20, 2023. The ERC-7201 recommends using pseudorandom locations derived from a namespace as the basis for new storage trees in base contracts. The root slot for storage is calculated using a <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7201#formula">specific formula</a>. This approach does not require changes on the EVM level and can be implemented by grouping state variables within a struct and using assembly language to access specific storage slots directly, as shown in the&nbsp;example:</p>Example of namespace-based storage locations in a smart contract following <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7201">ERC-7201</a><p>In the example smart contract x and y are state variables. However, they are not stored on the first and second slots in the storage as default. They will be stored in the storage tree under the given root MAIN_STORAGE_LOCATION = 0x183a…b500, which is calculated using the suggested formula in ERC-7201.</p><p>When a v4 upgradeable contract is deployed on the network, the state variables of the contract are initialized, stored, and managed using the default storage pattern based on their order in the contracts. However, if the implementation contract is upgraded using v5 contracts, a critical issue occurs. The new v5 contracts are designed to interact with storage in a different way, using the namespaced storage layout introduced in ERC-7201. As a result, these updated contracts will not recognize or access the original storage slots used by the old contract. This mismatch in storage access will lead to dangerous and incorrect states where variables may not reflect the intended values, and functions may behave unpredictably, leading to loss of funds or compromised security.</p> Unsafe Upgradability Example <p>The following ExampleV4 contract uses OpenZeppelin v4 and imports the following contracts Initializable, OwnableUpgradeable, and UUPSUpgradeable. It sets the value of exampleStateVariable, the address of the owner, the address of implementation contract, and the status of the contract to Initialized during the initialization process when it is deployed as&nbsp;proxy.</p>example upgradable contract using v4&nbsp;version<p>To check the storage keys of the state variables, we can deploy it as <a href="https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/run_proxy_contracts.html">proxy using Remix IDE</a> and then debug it using the <a href="https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/debugger.html">Debugger</a>.</p>the storage of the&nbsp;contract<p>As shown in the picture, slot 0x000…000 (slot 0) has the value 0x01 marking the contract as initialized. At Slot 0x000….033 (Slot 51) the, address of the owner of the contract is stored. At 0x000…0c9 (Slot 201) the value 7 of the exampleStateVariable is stored (Note: The variables are not sorted at slots 0, 1, 2 due to the buffer gaps between the contracts). At Slot 0x36089…82bbc the address of the implementation contract stored (Note: The slot of the implementation contract address was already hardcoded in v4 in a similar way to the namespaced storage layout to prevent conflicts).</p>map current slots to values in&nbsp;v4<p>For demonstration purposes, we will update the implementation contract to ExampleV5 using OpenZeppelin v5 contracts, without introducing new logic. To execute the upgrade, we must import the new v5 contracts, make minor modifications to the original contract to align with the new structure, and then deploy it. Then, we invoke the upgradeTo function on the proxy contract, providing the address of the new implementation contract as an argument.</p>Code of the upgradeable smart contract in OpenZeppelin version&nbsp;5<p>After upgrading the contract we can call the two state variables in the proxy contract to check their&nbsp;values.</p>the values of the state variables after the&nbsp;upgrade<p>The value of exampleStateVariable is now 1 and not 7 because the upgraded contract reads the value from the first storage slot, which was the same slot of the initialized status. Furthermore, the owner is the zero address 0x000…000 because the new implemented contract following v5 of OpenZeppelin looks for the address of the owner at another storage slot. Inspecting the v5 contract, we will find that the owner value is read from slot 0x9016…9300, which is&nbsp;empty.</p>the <a href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/v5.0.1/contracts/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol">OwnableUpgradeable</a> v5&nbsp;contract<p>The same issue applies to the Initialization status of the contract. It is read from slot 0xf0c5…6a00 and not from 0x000…000 as it was in v4 contracts</p>the <a href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/v5.0.1/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol">Initializable</a> v5&nbsp;contract<p>This means our very simple updated contract has incorrect values, is not initialized, and has the zero address as&nbsp;Owner.</p>compare current slots to values before and after upgrade shows the misplacing of state variables between old and new v5&nbsp;contract<p>At this point, anyone would be able to initialize it again giving the address of owner to control the contract. Even if the original owner still managed to initialize the contract before anyone else the contract will stay in an unsafe state. To explain this we will re-initialize and debug the storage of the upgraded contract using&nbsp;Remix.</p>The storage keys and values after the upgrade and re-initialization of the&nbsp;contract<p>As displayed on the above storage snapshot, the original (v4) storage slots at 0x000…0c9, 0x000…033 are not empty. Therefore, new state variables added to the contract could unintentionally use these slots, creating invalid&nbsp;values.</p> Going Forward with Existing Contracts <p>For developers, finding the best way to update existing contracts is crucial. There are several options for updating deployed v4 upgradable contracts, some of these options&nbsp;are:</p>  Reinitializing the Contract: This process involves clearing the storage and migrating the data within the contract. While this approach might be feasible for simple contracts, for complex contracts with dynamic data types such as arrays, strings, and mappings, the storage becomes overly complicated, making migration within the contract impractical, if not impossible.  Deploying as a Proxy: Similar to the <a href="https://sergiomartinrubio.com/articles/how-to-release-new-versions-of-smart-contracts/#social-migration">Social Migration</a> approach for non-upgradable contracts, this method involves deploying the new contract as a new proxy with a new address, followed by migrating the data and users to this new contract. Depending on the contract type and existing data, this process can become complicated. Additionally, it requires users’ involvement.  Updating using v4 Contracts: Likely the most advisable approach is to continue using v4 contracts. This method eliminates the need for data migration or storage restructuring. Developers need to maintain their existing OpenZeppelin v4 contracts, extending or updating only the necessary components for their specific needs when required.   Summary <p>In Ethereum, upgradeable contracts are complicated due to potential storage conflicts. The introduction of a new storage layout aims to make the upgrade process easier and cleaner. However, old upgradable v4 contracts will face issues with the new layout, as their state variables could be dislocated, leading to an invalid contract state. Therefore, a native upgrade from v4 contracts to v5 is considered as not safe and is not recommended, requiring careful selection of strategies for updating v4 Upgradeable Contracts.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/51nodes/why-upgrading-openzeppelin-smart-contracts-from-version-4-to-version-5-is-unsafe-e08be30efd8a">Why Upgrading OpenZeppelin Smart Contracts from Version 4 to Version 5 is Unsafe</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/51nodes">51nodes</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

			 What Should You Expect from a Tokenization Platform in 2024 
<p>Season’s Greetings from all of us at Tokeny!</p>
<p>As we approach the new year, it’s the perfect time to upgrade and take a look at your tokenization strategies. Let’s clear up a common misconception first: Far from being a straightforward task,&nbsp;building a robust tokenization stack demands more than just deploying smart contracts.</p>
<p>The platform should not only support advanced smart contracts such as ERC-3643 for on-chain compliance but also&nbsp;offer tools for transfer management, automation, data management, interoperability with existing financial systems, and a seamless investor experience. Let’s break these down below.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			 Tools for Automation and Token Lifecycle Management: 
<p>🎛️&nbsp;Onchain Compliance Rules: &nbsp;The platform must allow for setting up compliance rules via smart contracts (e.g., jurisdictions of investors, KYC checks, etc.) and utilizing a permission system to manage and appoint agents, for example, KYC agents for signing KYC credentials to investors’ digital identity.</p>
<p>🆔&nbsp;Digital Identities: &nbsp;Every stakeholder, and especially investors, must be properly identified on the blockchain to apply permissions and compliance rules. For this, an encrypted on-chain identity system is needed as wallets ownership cannot be used as proof of identity.</p>
<p>⛓️&nbsp;Blockchain Operations:&nbsp; As most operations result in blockchain transactions, the platform must prepare the needed parameters based on the issuers’ or their agents’ inputs, to facilitate the selection of concerned investors, gas fees, etc. Once ready, these transactions are sent for signature to the authorized agent. This should be made possible for all the functions provided by the token smart contracts (e.g., around 120 functions for the ERC3643 standard).</p>
<p>🔐&nbsp;Secure Wallet Solutions:&nbsp; Wallet solutions are needed for the issuer, its agents, and each investor. For issuers and their agents, they must support signature policies without impeding automation. For investors, they should offer non-custodial options to avoid regulatory constraints. Ideally, the wallet solution is integrated into the tokenization platform to automatically generate wallets, ensuring regulatory compliance and enabling seamless interchangeability through account abstraction.</p>
<p>🖥️&nbsp;User-friendly Interface:&nbsp; The platform must be user-friendly so that any stakeholder, regardless of coding or blockchain experience, can seamlessly navigate the platform. For investors, it should also offer an e-commerce-like experience akin to commonly used mainstream platforms with features like built-in self-custody wallets and gas tanks to eliminate friction points.</p>
 Data Management: 
<p>📊&nbsp;Real-time On-chain Data:&nbsp; The platform needs a performant indexer to sync blockchain data with the smart contracts orchestration platform. This is done by reading different nodes on the network. The platform has to provide an infrastructure management service to listen to the token and compliance smart contracts events, route to the most performing RPC, and provide a real-time data stream to the software and its users.</p>
<p>📑&nbsp;Investor Data Management: &nbsp;Managing investor data requires an automated cap table that aggregates off-chain data like personal identity data and on-chain data (i.e transaction records, digital identity credentials, etc.). In addition, issuers should be able to choose where they prefer the off-chain data to be stored.</p>
<p>📁&nbsp;Asset Data Management:&nbsp;&nbsp; To facilitate distribution, it is crucial to provide detailed documents and information about the tokenized assets to investors. The tokenization platform should enable the enrichment of the token with documents, third-party certifications (e.g., ESG), valuation, etc.</p>
 Interoperability with Financial Systems: 
<p>🔌&nbsp;Legacy Systems: &nbsp;Large institutions need API-ready solutions to plug and play in their legacy systems to ensure the adoption of new technologies is seamless. Synchronizing investors with their on-chain identities, or integrating token actions in existing investor portals are usually the most needed integrations.</p>
<p>🌐&nbsp;Trading Venues and DeFi Services:&nbsp; Broad distribution and diverse liquidity options are the most important reasons issuers tokenize assets on-chain. Therefore, the platform must enable issuers to connect natively to the best trading platforms (centralized exchanges, OTC, etc.), distributors, and DeFi applications (DEX, collateralization, etc.), to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>As we enter this new era of finance, asset managers, banks, and asset servicers must accelerate their tokenization market presence to stay ahead of the curve in 2024. It is crucial to collaborate with a seasoned tokenization platform provider, rather than starting from scratch.</p>

To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF69 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 100,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 100k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  You can read the details for how Predictoor DF Reward Amounts work&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa#58d9">here</a>.

<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.govtech.com/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Government Technology</a> and SpruceID hosted a webinar featuring a fireside chat between Wayne Chang, CEO and Founder of SpruceID, and Ajay Gupta, Chief Digital Transformation Officer at the State of California DMV, about their <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruceid-partners-with-ca-dmv-on-mdl/">recently launched mobile driver’s license</a> (mDL).</p><p>This conversation between Wayne and Ajay gave an inside look into the past couple of years working together to bring the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/about/awards/government-eye-on-innovation?utm_source=int-mktg&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=RM_GB_2023_ITDIS_SOC_SOC1_EOI23SOCIALBUNDLE">Gartner-award-winning</a> mDL to the State of California residents — from addressing complexities with implementation, working to adhere to global standards, understanding the rapidly evolving market ecosystem, and more.</p><p>Read through the top 5 takeaways of this conversation, and listen to the full recording below to learn how the State of California DMV worked alongside SpruceID as their technology partner to bring this project to life.</p><p></p> 1 - People Expect a Digital Experience <p>At the start of this discussion, Ajay touched on how people expect a digital experience when interacting with any establishment in today's increasingly digital world. This expectation has been accelerated drastically by the pandemic when businesses were required to offer services online. With the shift to digital, people will inevitably be asked to verify their identity online in various situations.</p><p>Offering both a mobile driver’s license and an online self-serve onboarding experience provides increased efficiency and convenience for the user so they are not stuck in long lines waiting for a human to help them renew their driver’s license. It also greatly reduces the cost of operations within a DMV.</p><p></p> 2 - Implementing an mDL Comes with Complexities <p>Standing up a program that provisions mobile driver’s licenses has many advantages, such as reducing fraud (seen today in situations such as the billions of dollars lost by false claims to unemployment benefits online) or eliminating fake IDs. However, getting to this point isn’t without challenges and complexities.</p><p>Starting out, one question the California DMV had was how they would gain residents’ trust when they started using their digital ID. In the webinar, Wayne and Ajay touch on how SpruceID helped to introduce cryptography and other security elements, such as biometrics, to allow California to securely provision mobile driver’s licenses that could be trusted and help to eliminate issues such as fraudulent claims.</p><p>Another challenge was creating transparency with users regarding how their information is handled in the California DMV wallet app. The California DMV and SpruceID prioritized keeping users’ data private without there being any digital trail of how and where residents use their mDL. </p><p>In addition, they mention how important it was for selective disclosure to be built into the app so that residents provide only the minimum amount of information required when being asked to present their digital ID. It should be clear to users exactly what information they consent to share in each situation. For example:</p><p>Despite having to work through several complexities with the technology and ecosystem along the way, both the California DMV and SpruceID describe how they're confident this solution best serves California residents while preserving their privacy and keeping their data secure. In the full webinar recording, listen to both Wayne and Ajay dissect some of the complexities they encountered throughout this undertaking, and how they were addressed by technology.</p><p></p> 3 - Open-Source Has Its Advantages <p>One quality unique to SpruceID’s mobile driver’s license implementation is having built an open-source mobile wallet. The many benefits of using an open-source solution include things like customization, third-party audits, and increased trust and transparency. When discussing some of the open-source tools used, Ajay mentioned:</p><p>Allowing users to verify the authenticity and integrity of the software by checking the source code helps build accountability within a community of users.</p><p>In addition to the open-source approach, SpruceID also participates in a number of different working groups in order to contribute to some of the standards bodies on which our software is based. These standards bodies create technical frameworks to promote the safe and secure use of technology and define requirements for security, data elements, and more.</p><p>Wayne mentions how being an active participant and <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/mobile-drivers-license-interoperability-event/">helping lead events</a> for these standards groups has benefited SpruceID as an organization and has been a catalyst to drive the standards forward.</p><p></p> 4 - Market Ecosystem Opportunities are Endless <p>A high point of the webinar was hearing Wayne and Ajay talk through the multitude of market opportunities that will be brought about by the launch of California’s mobile driver’s license.</p><p>SpruceID and the California DMV talk through the market ecosystem that is being developed around digital credentials today, as well as their current efforts working with organizations that will begin accepting mobile driver’s licenses as part of their business model: </p><p>Facilitating market growth, including momentum from both users of mobile driver’s licenses and businesses accepting these digital credentials, will open many doors and opportunities for growth in the overall ecosystem.</p><p></p> 5 - The Future for California is Bright <p>As the webinar came to a close, Ajay talked through some of the exciting plans for the California DMV that lie ahead on their roadmap. To name a few, working with credit unions and banks to start accepting the mDL as an identity verification mechanism and creating digital registration cards, titles, and disabled placards. They are also collaborating with law enforcement on a way for police officers to safely and securely accept a mobile driver’s license.</p><p>SpruceID is looking forward to seeing what’s in store for the State of California DMV and working together as the current landscape evolves. We feel grateful and honored to have been able to partner with the California DMV team on this groundbreaking initiative.</p> Watch the Webinar <p>We’ve barely scratched the surface of what was covered during this inspiring and educational fireside chat, so head over to our YouTube channel to listen to the whole conversation between Wayne and Ajay.</p><p>Interested in chatting with us more about your own digital credentials, whether it’s augmenting existing infrastructure or creating something new? <a href="https://spruceid.com/contact-us?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Contact us today</a>.</p> <a href="https://youtu.be/oy7ycRoCiws?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Watch Webinar Recording</a>  <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

  The Crypto Travel Rule threshold in Hong Kong is set at HKD 8,000 or US$1,000, above which detailed information, including the originator’s address or ID number, is required.  For transactions below this threshold, only the name and account number of the originator and beneficiary are&nbsp;needed.  This threshold approach aligns Hong Kong with countries like Singapore, Indonesia, and the UK, differing from places like Malaysia, Estonia, and the EU, where no threshold applies.  <p>The Crypto Travel Rule came into effect in Hong Kong on June 1st, 2023. This was the final step of many regulatory actions that Hong Kong saw in the previous months, known as the enforcement of FATF Recommendation 16, or the Crypto Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>Before this, on December 7th, 2022, <a href="https://www.legco.gov.hk/en/legco-business/council/bills.html?bill_key=10015&amp;session=2022">the Hong Kong Legislative Council approved</a> the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Bill 2022. This change aimed to include virtual asset service providers (VASPs) under rules for customer checks and record-keeping.</p><p>Then, on February 20th, 2023, the Securities and Futures Commission put out a paper for discussion on proposed rules for VASPs. They received 152 pieces of feedback on&nbsp;it.</p><p>After looking at all the feedback, the commission made and shared detailed guidelines on <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">anti-money laundering (AML)</a> and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) for VASPs with SFC licenses. Finally, the Crypto Travel Rule began in Hong Kong on June 1st,&nbsp;2023.</p> Crypto Travel Rule Hong Kong: Technological Solutions to Help Financial Institutions <p>To implement <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule">the Crypto Travel Rule</a>, Hong Kong adopted a risk-based strategy, focusing on both institutional and customer risk. This approach involved assessing technological solutions that financial institutions (FIs) could use to ensure their virtual asset (VA) transfers complied with the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>According to the implementation guidelines, FIs in Hong Kong can choose any technological solution to collect and submit the necessary information for VA transfers. However, the chosen solution must enable the FI to adhere to the Travel Rule requirements. In this context, an FI could function as an ordering institution, an intermediary, or a beneficiary institution.</p><p>For compliance with the FATF Travel Rule in Hong Kong, two primary conditions must be&nbsp;met:</p>  Effective and efficient identification of VA Transfer counterparties.  The technological solution employed must be able to submit the required information for a VA transfer in a timely and secure&nbsp;manner.  <p>Furthermore, when selecting a technological solution for VA Travel Rule compliance, FIs must consider several factors. These include the solution’s interoperability, its capacity to process information for a high volume of VA transfers, and its effectiveness in enabling FIs to implement controls for scrutinizing VA transfers.</p><p>Additionally, the solution should be capable of performing due diligence and securely retaining the required information. This comprehensive approach ensures both the safety and regulatory compliance of VA transfers under the Hong Kong Crypto Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/addressing-the-new-fatf-report-shyft-veriscope-solving-the-travel-rule-challenges-like-no-other">Shyft Veriscope stands out as an ideal Travel Rule solution</a> in line with Hong Kong’s Travel Rule compliance requirements. Built to perform thorough checks and ensure information safety, it addresses key aspects of the Hong Kong Crypto Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>Shyft Veriscope simplifies identifying parties in VA transfers and facilitates the quick and secure sharing of necessary details. Its compatibility with various systems makes it suitable for all financial institutions. This efficiency and versatility make Shyft Veriscope a smart choice for complying with the FATF Travel Rule in Hong&nbsp;Kong.</p> Specifics of the Hong Kong Crypto Travel Rule Compliance <p>While Financial Institutions may adopt qualified technological solutions to help them, all the related stakeholders need to know the specifics that make a VA transfer Travel Rule compliant.</p>  The supervisory body for VASPs in Hong Kong is the Securities and Finance Commission.  Travel Rule implementation does not have a threshold. Irrespective of the transaction value, obtaining Travel Rule information is a must in any VA transfer. However, the volume of required information is less when it comes to transactions under HKD 8,000 or US$1,000.  The Travel Rule compliance requirements apply to all VASPs. For self-hosted wallets, Travel Rule data is to be collected as well, including account numbers associated with the&nbsp;FI.   Compliance Requirements <p>According to the provisions, the originator VASPs of a VA transfer would have to obtain, record, and transmit the required information to the beneficiary VASP in the following manner.</p>  If the transaction amount is less than 8,000 HKD, information required on the originator and beneficiary customer would only include the name and account&nbsp;number.  However, if the transaction amount goes above the threshold of 8,000 HKD or US$1,000, the required information categories would also include the originator customer’s address, customer identification number, identification document number, or date and place of&nbsp;birth.  <p>The SFC mandates that Travel Rule compliance be performed pre-transaction since, in virtual asset transactions, the settlement is immediate and irreversible.</p> Impact on Crypto Exchanges and&nbsp;Wallets <p>Any sort of VASP, including exchanges and wallets, would have to make increased efforts to make their process Travel Rule compliant.</p><p>The VASPs must verify the customers’ wallet ownership when transacting with self-hosted wallets. This implies they need to establish a mechanism for confirming their customer’s ownership or control of the wallet address, which can be achieved, for instance, through a message signing&nbsp;test.</p><p>Additionally, the VASPs are required to conduct more intense monitoring of VA transfers with self-hosted wallets. They must impose transaction limits wherever necessary, possibly including setting appropriate limits on the amount of VA transfers with self-hosted wallets.</p> Global Landscape &amp; a Comparative Analysis <p>When it comes to Hong Kong’s implementation of the Travel Rule, it has many similarities and dissimilarities with its global counterparts.</p><p>For example, Hong Kong’s threshold model aligns with Singapore, Indonesia, and the UK, where a broader scope of Travel Rule obligations is triggered when transactions exceed a certain limit. In contrast, countries like the US, Philippines, and Canada only enforce Travel Rule when a transaction surpasses a threshold. Yet, there are places like Malaysia, Estonia, and the European Union where no such threshold exists.</p><p>The approach to self-hosted wallets also varies significantly across jurisdictions. The United States and Canada, for instance, have not set specific guidelines. On the other hand, countries like Lichtenstein and Estonia have adopted enhanced due diligence measures. The UK and Gibraltar are moving towards gathering more information.</p><p>Hong Kong, which requires verification of information for self-hosted wallets, shares this standard with countries like Germany, Singapore, Switzerland, the European Union, and Hong Kong&nbsp;itself.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>The implementation of the FATF Travel Rule in Hong Kong aligns with global trends in the crypto space, marking a shift towards increased clarity and transparency. Mirroring this trend, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/japan-to-enforce-crypto-travel-rule-from-june-1st">Japan also implemented the Travel Rule</a> on June 1st, 2023, followed by Portugal on July 15th, 2023, and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/fatf-travel-rule-in-the-uk-challenges-and-concerns">the United Kingdom</a> on September 1st,&nbsp;2023.</p><p>As a result, VASPs will need to intensify their compliance efforts, and more solutions are expected to emerge within the country to assist financial institutions and VASPs in adhering to these regulations. With over <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/over-80-crypto-firms-eyeing-presence-in-hong-kong-financial-secretary">80 crypto firms</a> from mainland China and other countries showing interest in setting up operations in Hong Kong, the effective implementation of the Crypto Travel Rule is poised to significantly bolster the country’s crypto&nbsp;economy.</p> Frequently Asked Questions Around Crypto Travel Rule Hong&nbsp;Kong  Q1: What is the threshold for the Crypto Travel Rule in Hong&nbsp;Kong? <p>The threshold is set at HKD 8,000 or US$1,000. For transactions above this threshold, detailed information like the originator’s address or ID number is required.</p> Q2: What information is required for transactions below the threshold? <p>For transactions below HKD 8,000 or US$1,000, only the name and account number of the originator and beneficiary are&nbsp;needed.</p> Q3: When did the Crypto Travel Rule come into effect in Hong&nbsp;Kong? <p>The Crypto Travel Rule was implemented in Hong Kong on June 1st,&nbsp;2023.</p> Q4: What are the main obligations for VASPs under the Crypto Travel Rule in Hong&nbsp;Kong? <p>VASPs must ensure thorough customer checks and record-keeping, verify wallet ownership for self-hosted wallets, conduct intensified monitoring of VA transfers, and impose necessary transaction limits.</p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

 Despite recently introduced regulations, gambling on the black market in Germany is still alive and well. We gathered experts from the industry to discuss why that is and what can be done to curb the worrying trend of illegal gambling. 



 



<p>The drop in tax revenue from €55 million to €10 million per month is due to an inhospitable regulatory environment in Germany, according to Nico Jansen, CEO at Bet IT Best GmbH, who was speaking at our recent <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/germanys-problem-illegal-market-gambling/">webinar on black market gambling in Germany</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since the introduction of the State Treaty on Gambling in 2021, German players have been flocking to either offshore operators, or unregulated black market operators. Why is this happening, and what can be done to stop it?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the recent IDnow webinar, ‘Germany’s problem with the black market’, we gathered experts from the field, including Ted Menmuir, Content Director at the Sports Betting Community, Jochen Biewer, Managing Director at Chevron Consultants, Bernd Henning at IGamingConsult.com, Laszlo Pados, Brand Manager at Greentube GmbH, Nico Jansen, CEO at Bet IT Best GmbH, and our own Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk, Vice President of Global Gaming to delve deeper into the subject and explore what operators across the board need to know.</p>



 
   
     
                     Germany’s problem with the black market. 
                     Watch a panel of experts debate why Germany has witnessed a sudden increase in black market gambling, upcoming regulatory challenges, and what the future of gambling in the German market may look like.

 The current state of gambling regulation in Germany. 



<p>Historically, Germany has had a rather complex and fragmented approach to gambling legislation, with individual states retaining considerable autonomy. Recognizing that an outright ban on online gambling was unsuccessful and had allowed offshore operators to flourish, a new State Treaty on Gambling was enacted in 2021 to regulate the market and offer licenses to German operators.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/gluecksspielstaatsvertrag-glustv/">Glücksspielstaatsvertrag (GlüStV)</a> was first luanched, it introduced a centralized licensing system for online sports betting and casino games and aimed to unify and modernize the regulation of gambling across the country. A noble cause indeed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, while the requirement of operators to have a license opened the market and allowed private operators to break the state monopoly on certain forms of gambling, it also introduced several restrictions and player protection measures, that, some argue, have largely driven players to the black market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>These include:&nbsp;</p>



  Deposit and stake limits<br>  Identity verification<br>  Strict advertising guidelines<br>  Centralized database for monitoring activities  



<p>Read more in our blog post, ‘<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/online-gambling-germany-regulations/">Online Gambling in Germany: regulations, restrictions and ramifications</a>‘.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Online casinos licensed by the national gambling authority (<a href="https://www.gluecksspiel-behoerde.de/de/">Glücksspielbehörde der Länder, GGL</a>) must enforce a deposit limit of €1,000 per player per month across all operators. This is monitored through a centralized database to check player behavior. To prevent excessive gambling, players are subjected to a €1 stake limit on casino games and a 5-second delay on slot machines. Operators must also pay a 5.3% turnover tax on each bet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sportsbook operators face similar restrictions regarding deposit limits. Taxes are even higher, with a whopping 8% tax levied on sports betting. Certain types of betting, such as live betting and fantasy sports, are prohibited.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As pointed out in our webinar, the DSWV report shows that between 2021 and 2022, total <a href="https://europeangaming.eu/portal/compliance-updates/2023/03/13/131693/german-sports-betting-association-calls-for-rethinking-of-regulation-to-combat-the-black-market/">sports betting stakes fell from €9.4 billion to €8.2 billion</a>, and as a result, taxes collected fell from €470 million to €433 million, a drop of 13%.</p>



 What are the risks of black market gambling? 



<p>Perhaps because of the above, the German Betting Trade Association (DSWV) has reported a 65% increase in illicit gambling activities and sports betting activities and is calling for more action against black market activity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gambling sites that operate without the necessary licenses from the GGL or use alternate licenses from international authorities such as the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/malta-gaming-authority-mga/">Malta Gaming Authority MGA</a> or Curaçao are operating in defiance of the legal frameworks established by the government, and are therefore considered black market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consumers who use illegal or unregulated online platforms are doing so at their own risk, as consumer protection standards may not necessarily be enforced, which increases the risk of fraud, a lack of fair play, or responsible gambling mechanisms for players. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/money-laundering-threat-online-casinos/">Illegal gambling operations can also be used for money laundering</a> and other illicit activities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A lack of accountability and transparency can also contribute to difficulties in tracking financial transactions and investigating illegal activities.</p>



 Betting bad: What factors contribute to the growth of illegal gambling? 



<p>A lively discussion point from the webinar was what forced law-abiding German citizens to the black market. Participants suggested several reasons.&nbsp;</p>



  Better entertainment: Players are attracted to offshore gambling sites because they offer more games, betting options and bonus offers.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  No limits: There is no pre-set deposit limit, but players are often encouraged to set a daily, weekly, or monthly deposit limit as part of the operator’s responsible gambling strategy. Similarly, there is no €1 stake limit. Players can choose stake size according to preferences and financial capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  More features: Black market online casinos also offer features such as automatic betting, which spins the slot machine reels a pre-defined number of times without the need to manually click after each spin. There is also no 5-second delay on virtual slots.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  Higher RTP: Due to the high tax rates for German operators, RTPs (return-to-player) on games are much lower, leading to smaller pay-outs on regulated platforms. As players often opt for games with the highest RTPs, they are invariably drawn to the black market.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  Better experience: No deposit and stake limits, no predefined spin duration, more features, and more games can lead to an overall better user experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>While there are a multitude of reasons for consumers to opt for black market gambling sites, a long and expensive licensing process also means many operators may find it more attractive to be licensed elsewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although being a licensed operator has its advantages, not least of which is being able to show you are compliant and adhere to fair play and responsible gaming measures, it does not necessarily make financial sense. Revenue is capped due to deposit limits, taxes are high, and the offering is limited as every game needs to be tested and approved by GGL (even if another operator already offers the exact same game).</p>



 The challenges, loopholes and regulatory hurdles of the German market. 



<p>Since coming into effect, the German State Treaty has proven to be largely ineffective in preventing access to the black market. Attempts at geo-blocking websites are often ineffective, as a recent example from Turkey showed, where one unregulated site was blocked but within minutes had sent a new URL to players via an SMS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main tool German authorities have in the fight against the black market is the ability to pressure payment providers to not process payments for illegal operators. However, when one payment method fails, players invariably just switch methods.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another important factor driving players to the black market is the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">KYC check</a>. As per KYC requirements, German operators are required to verify players at the registration stage or within 72 hours to weed out fraudsters and prevent underage users from accessing games.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the user experience, especially for privacy-conscious Germans can be seen as a hurdle many are simply unwilling to surmount. Few people want to hand over personal details to use a product or service they don’t know much about. Many offshore operators don’t require immediate <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/identity-verification/">identity verification</a>, and usually only do so when players withdraw (a lot of) money from the site. In the case of the Malta Gaming market, this is usually north of €2,000.</p>



 Challenges faced by regulators. 



<p>With a steady decline in tax revenues from legal gambling activities, regulators need to create a more supportive and inclusive environment for players and operators alike.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the <a href="https://www.dswv.de/">German Betting Association (DSWV)</a> has pledged to work closer with operators to crack down on illegal operators. Industry experts don’t necessarily see this as the right approach, as more bans won’t solve the problem of players being drawn to more attractive offers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prohibition and restrictions can drive consumers directly to the black market. As covered in the webinar, high barriers to entry for operators, such as a lengthy licensing process and high taxes on stakes, can be a significant barrier to entry for many operators, while players are often deterred from regulated operators by the monthly deposit and wagering limits, as well as the need to verify their identity before placing a bet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the webinar, Bernd Henning of <a href="https://www.igamingconsult.com/en/">IGamingConsult.com</a> agreed that while steps must be taken to prevent players from using the black market, the main conundrum facing operators is “How can we operate within the confines of the law and still make a profit?”</p>



 Does LUGAS help or hinder? 



<p>LUGAS, which is Germany’s Interstate Gambling Evaluation System, is used to evaluate the data submitted by operators and ensure deposit limits and other regulations are met. It is mandatory for all online gambling operators to connect to LUGAS.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a cross-operator database, it includes deposit limits and regulates access to the regulator’s platform. The system enforces a rule that restricts a player to accessing only one platform at a time, coupled with a specific deposit limit. However, the system is not without its detractors, with even the DSWV raising concerns about data protection. A common criticism is that operators themselves have no way of auditing LUGAS, which raises serious concerns about transparency and accountability.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.gluecksspiel-behoerde.de/de/aufsichtssysteme/technische-richtlinien-und-zugang-zum-testsystem-des-laenderuebergreifenden-gluecksspielaufsichtssystem-lugas">LUGAS</a> appears to be contributing to the growing trend of players turning to the black market. In Denmark, for example, the imposition of a deposit limit led to a significant shift of players to unregulated casinos. However, as soon as this restriction was lifted, players returned to the regulated market. This underlines the importance for regulators to monitor developments in other regulated markets and learn from their experiences with different regulations to effectively navigate the dynamic landscape of online gambling.</p>



 The way forward for regulators, operators, and players. 



<p>The current landscape of gambling regulation in Germany is a valiant, but perhaps misguided attempt to modernize the industry and strike a balance between consumer protection and market openness. However, ironically, it also appears to be driving users and operators to the black market, which suggests a misalignment with the original goal of player protection. A comprehensive re-evaluation of the entire regulatory process may be necessary to achieve the desired results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To keep players within the regulated sphere, cooperation with established international regulators like the <a href="https://www.mga.org.mt/">MGA</a> is essential. Working together to simplify processes and gain a deeper understanding of the market will benefit German regulators, operators, and players alike. For example, the removal of deposit and wagering limits could help to retain players, while the introduction of a game whitelist could streamline the licensing process for operators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ongoing discussions within the German regulatory landscape underline the importance of adapting strategies to adjust to shifting trends and market development. Whether this is done by launching a series of consultations with invested stakeholders like what is currently happening in the UK will ultimately be the decision of German regulators and policymakers. What is clear though is that a collaborative and adaptive approach will be key in creating a thriving, regulated gambling industry that addresses the challenges of an attractive black market.</p>

<p>Today, we announced a new logo for Bluesky:</p>

 Why did we choose a butterfly? 
<p>Well, of course, it flies. But more importantly, it is a symbol of change and transformation. Early on, we noticed that people were organically using the butterfly emoji 🦋 to indicate their Bluesky handles. We loved it, and adopted it as it spread. The butterfly speaks to our mission of transforming social media into something new.</p>
<p>Like a butterfly emerging from its chrysalis, we are starting to open up. Posts on Bluesky have been public from the start through the open protocol, but today we’re making them publicly accessible through the app. We’re unfolding a little bit at a time, and are excited to bring you along on this journey of metamorphosis!</p>
 What’s in a name? 
<p>The name “Bluesky” was originally a placeholder for the project started by Twitter to build an open social protocol. I decided to keep the name when I was chosen as the lead of the project. It’s memorable and symbolizes the open space of possibilities: the Twitter bird freed from a closed platform to fly in Bluesky’s open ecosystem.</p>

The last slide of the presentation I gave to Twitter in my proposal for how to build Bluesky.
<p>As the project matured, we named the underlying standard the AT Protocol, or atproto. Bluesky, as the more colorful (and less technical) name everyone was familiar with, is also what we named the first app we built on atproto. But Bluesky is not the limit. Many more apps and experiences are already beginning to emerge — there are thousands of custom feeds, dozens of other clients, and atproto will eventually support other apps. We hope that Bluesky, as the first app, will be a catalyst for change and transform how social media works, like a butterfly flapping its wings.</p>
 What if I don’t like butterflies? 
<p>The great thing about an open network is that anyone can build on top of it and customize it further! Maybe you like birds more. Well, someone could build BirdSky, and you could switch to using that and still be in the same network, still have the same friends, and still see the same posts.</p>
<p>The protocol that makes Bluesky, BirdSky, and endless other options possible is also what makes Bluesky “billionaire-proof.” Just like you can change email providers or cell phone carriers and bring all your contacts, photos, or messages with you, in an open network, you’ll always have the freedom to choose (and to exit) instead of being held to the whims of private companies or black box algorithms. And wherever you go, your friends and relationships will be there too.</p>
 Explore Bluesky 
<p>We built Bluesky to be a home for public conversation — breaking news, commentary and analysis, jokes and more. And we’re taking one step closer to this goal by releasing a public web view, which means that you don’t have to be logged in to view posts on Bluesky.</p>
<p>Starting today, you can easily view Bluesky posts without being logged in. Sharing will be more convenient — whether it's a joke you want to text a friend, or a post you want to embed in an article.</p>

 In November 2022, the European Banking Authority issued its guidelines for the use of remote entry solutions in the banking and financial sector. High-level or substantial identification schemes and qualified electronic signature solutions took the spotlight. So what’s the difference between these two solutions? How do you choose? PVID vs QES: Which solutions are best for banking and financial relationships? 



 A changing regulatory environment: an overview. 



 The six requirements of the Monetary and Financial Code. 



<p>Article L.561-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code (Code monétaire et financier) sets out six means of customer identification, to ensure that the customer enters into a remote relationship in complete confidence. The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/traditional-banking/">banking establishment</a> must apply at least two of these measures (generally number 1 plus another complementary measure) in order to comply with local <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-directive-amld/">anti-money laundering directives</a>.</p>



 







 European Banking Association recommendations.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Since October 2, 2023, the <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document_library/Publications/Guidelines/2022/EBA-GL-2022-15%20GL%20on%20remote%20customer%20onboarding/1043884/Guidelines%20on%20the%20use%20of%20Remote%20Customer%20Onboarding%20Solutions.pdf">European Banking Association (EBA) has been recommending the use of solutions</a> such as qualified electronic signatures and substantial or high-level identification schemes, such as PVID, in order to strengthen the fight against fraud when entering into a relationship.</p>



 The position of the AMF and ACPR in France.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>In line with the EBA’s recommendations, the authorities that regulate the French financial market, Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) and L’Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de (ACPR), point out the vulnerabilities notably linked to the first installment in the fight against fraud. However, this third measure remains compliant, and is often perceived as less burdensome in terms of user experience, and simpler for regulated institutions to implement, than the measures outlined by the EBA.</p>



 Focus on complementary entry methods. 



<p>Following the EBA’s recommendations, solutions such as qualified electronic signatures and substantial or high-level identification schemes like PVID are favored by regulators when it comes to guaranteeing a more secure entry into the relationship. But what exactly does this mean? Let’s take a closer look.</p>



 Qualified electronic signature.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/qualified-electronic-signature-qes/">Qualified Electronic Signature (QES)</a> offers the highest level of security and guarantee of all electronic signatures. It reliably identifies the signatory and protects it against falsification or alteration. It uses a qualified certificate issued by a certified supplier and it is a particularly robust solution from an anti-fraud point-of-view, and inclusive from a user experience point-of-view.</p>



<p>How does the solution work?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  The user takes a picture of his or her identity document&nbsp;  The user’s face is then captured on video&nbsp;&nbsp;  Finally, the user signs his or her contract electronically  



 







 PVID certified by ANSSI.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>In March 2021, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pvid-baseline-and-challenges/">ANSSI issued a set of requirements for Remote Identity Verification Service Providers (PVID)</a>. The aim of this certification is to create a uniform, trusted service offering for identity verification providers. This solution is built for security, and is designed to limit identity fraud and advanced forgery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How does the solution work?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  The user takes a video capture of his or her document and face.&nbsp;  These captures are then automatically and manually verified by an agent specialized in document and identity fraud.&nbsp;  A file of evidence is built up, and a verdict is reached on the authenticity of these captures and on the identity of the person concerned.  



 







<blockquote><p>Financial operators need to strike the right balance between having a system that filters out as many fraud attempts as possible, while letting legitimate customers through.</p>Baptiste Forestier – Head of Compliance &amp; DPO at Hero</blockquote>



 The choice of solution: PVID vs QES. 



<p>To strike the right balance, both PVID and Qualified Electronic Signature (QES) offer substantial advantages, as mentioned above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pvid-certification-interview/">IDnow is one of the few certified providers</a> of both electronic signature and identity verification solutions who can help you achieve compliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our qualified e-signature solution boasts broad geographical coverage and an easy-to-use workflow, while meeting the main needs of today’s financial players: compliance, fraud prevention and an optimized customer experience.</p>

 Towards multivalent currencies, bioregional monetary stewardship and a distributed global reserve&nbsp;currency <p>This 3-part blog series has been written to explore why money in its current form is a primary driver of the metacrisis¹ and what an alternative system could look like. We have divided our reflections into three sections to address the following questions:</p>  What are the issues that make money (and our dominant monetary systems) so problematic?  What could a desirable future scenario look&nbsp;like?  What can we start building and testing now to begin scaffolding a parallel&nbsp;system?   Part 1: what are the issues that make money (and our dominant monetary systems) so problematic? <p>The global monetary system sits at the centre of every crisis we face, yet it is often excluded from mainstream diagnostics and potential response strategies. In this blog we will trace a number of issues from the intrinsic qualities of money itself, through layers of the economy such as money issuance rights and the profit motive, to the brutal service level manifestations of monetary colonisation and transactional oppression.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@mrthetrain?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Joshua Hoehne</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a><blockquote>1. Money as an intrinsically extractive technology</blockquote><p>In economic textbooks and in the general public discourse, money is often framed as a neutral tool that enables the real economy to function. Perceptions have shifted somewhat following David Graeber’s work highlighting that its origins were bound to social relationships rather than to barter². Despite this, there is still a persistent idea that whilst money might represent underlying social contracts, it is not a powerful force in its own right. In contrast to this benign conception of money, Daniel Schmachtenberger has recently described it as a “unit of game theoretic optimality”³. He argues that it is a uniquely destructive technology for the following reasons:</p>  Money as a highly liquid and abstract value layer: when we exchange goods or services for fiat money (i.e. currency that is not backed by a physical resource such as gold) we are taking complex, entangled values and ruthlessly converting them into a single, indiscriminate and highly liquid token of opportunity. In doing so we are incentivised to consume, exploit and pollute the base layer value of everything.  Singularly upside returns: in an exchange based situation there is a point after which having more of a tangible good or service leads to diminishing returns. In the case of money the opposite is true. Once a base resource is converted into money, it can then be leveraged to generate further monetary returns (e.g. interest, dividends, speculative trading). Thus the liquid token that was exchanged for an underlying resource can self-perpetuate, giving rise to greater claims on other resources and creating an ever increasing cycle of extraction.  <p>As an example, imagine somebody who runs a rose farm and agrees to exchange roses for another commodity such as oil. Having arranged the trade there would be a limit to how many roses would be deemed useful by the supplier of the oil. At this point the roses would have a low liquidity value and there would be a diminishing return on harvesting them. Contrast this scenario with the reality of being able to exchange the roses immediately for money. If the current demand for roses is high, there is a strong incentive to force grow them and sell as many as possible, irrespective of the impact on the intrinsic health of the plants and soil. The money received in exchange for the physical plants can then be used to gain access to more oil (or anything else, including converting the rose farm into a car park if it is more profitable to do&nbsp;so).</p><blockquote>2. Profit as an extractive force that harnesses the liquid optimality of&nbsp;money</blockquote><p>Money can also be understood as the crystallised outcome of profitable activity. Whilst profit generation might be the surface level target, the fundamental goal is to secure the rights over future choices and resources. Profit is money and money is liquid optimality.</p><p>Profit itself is variously described as a distributed signal of value, an appropriate reward, a driver for innovation and the cause of the economic growth obligation. Under different circumstances each of these claims is both true and disputable. If we want to avoid unhelpful, binary reactions to the idea that in its current form profit (and indirectly money) is an extractive force, then these dual ‘truths’ are important to unpack. How would our behaviour change if we understood profit to be a shapeshifting force depending on the&nbsp;context?</p><p>As a signal of value, profit is an important way for people to indicate their preferences and thus collectively shape economic activity. Without such a mechanism we would be reliant on a type of authoritarian centralised planning. In terms of motivation and inspiring progress, it also provides a powerful incentive. However, if we consider how narrowly we define profit can we legitimately claim that it represents value creation? Can a genuine measure of value be bounded by time or geographical context? In an interconnected world, externalities are a delusion yet they are currently excluded from our calculations of&nbsp;profit.</p><p>The way that we define, measure and use profit determines its form. Thus, profit can continue to exist as an extractive claim over undefined future value flows, but it could also be reimagined as a generative tool for decentralised inclusion.</p><blockquote>3. Commercial bank money issuance as a multiplier of future extraction and repression</blockquote><p>The lion’s share of money issued in today’s economy is digitally created by commercial banks in the form of debt. The flexibility of this system has its benefits but its unregulated impact on living systems is profoundly destructive. When debt is issued in this way it creates a future claim on energy, materials and human labour. The right to use the credit (and its associated interest) in the present day creates a future obligation to convert biophysically linked reserves into decoupled monetary units of repayment.</p><p>A second observation is that entrusting the money supply to a niche group of profit incentivised bankers, skews the distribution of who receives funding and thus perpetuates structural inequalities.</p><blockquote>4. Transactional oppression</blockquote><p>In 2010 Wikileaks was permanently blocked from accessing its Paypal account. More recently, a number of journalists and activists have reported having their accounts blocked or removed. A less publicised but equally debilitating phenomenon is that millions of people worldwide are denied the right to a bank account at all. In the UK alone, 1.3 million adults are described as being ‘debanked’ with no access to an account⁴. For some people, this may be a personal choice, but for many others it results from failing to meet KYC (know your client) requirements.</p><p>It is hardly a coincidence that many of the countries with the highest cryptocurrency usage are also amongst the most financially exclusive. For example, Thailand, Nigeria, the Philippines and South Africa all have an uptake of between 19–20% on a per capita basis and an unbanked population higher than&nbsp;30%⁵⁶.</p><p>If money is a social contract, then the ability to transact could be embedded as a fundamental human right, yet our current system ensures that for many this is far from the case. Whilst existing cryptocurrencies offer some reprieve, the dominance of centrally issued and controlled money still forces many communities and even countries into the&nbsp;margins.</p><blockquote>5. Monetary colonisation as a brutal expression of capitalist self-preservation</blockquote><blockquote>Colonialism may be over, but the system that it created — a system designed to siphon wealth from South to North — remains very much in place — <a href="https://www.jasonhickel.org/blog/2018/10/13/the-case-for-reparations#:~:text=Colonialism%20may%20be%20over%2C%20but,problem%20is%20in%20the%20past.">Jason&nbsp;Hickel</a></blockquote><p>The statues of colonists, slave traders and racists are being torn down across the US and UK. These protests reject past actions and condemn the suffering, extraction and violence on which the wealth of such nations was built. What they perhaps fail to acknowledge is that the colonisation is not something that happened in the past. Instead, it is still actively being deployed as a tactic to ensure the comfort and stability of the countries who hold the greatest monetary&nbsp;power.</p><p>One shocking example of this can be seen in the Franc de la Communauté Financière Africaine (<a href="https://taxjustice.net/2021/03/22/the-cfa-franc-as-a-vivid-symbol-of-colonial-continuities-in-francophone-africa/">CFA Franc</a>) which was introduced to Western Africa by the French in 1945. The fourteen countries that use it today are still required to trade internationally in Euros via the French Treasury. They also continually rank amongst the poorest countries in the world. On a wider scale, the US dollar as the global reserve currency creates multiple advantages for its issuing country. With that privilege comes a responsibility that is rarely acknowledged. MMT (Modern Monetary Theory) has a large following in the US, because for a country that mints the most prevalent global currency, the ability to print money is in fact a viable option to stimulate economic activity. Firstly, they can use it to buy goods and services from foreign countries who have a constant requirement for dollars. Secondly, their exchange rate is extremely resistant to devaluation. For the vast majority of countries that do not have a widely desired sovereign currency, this is simply not an option. On the flip side, when the US, UK or Eurozone raise their interest rates to maintain local financial stability, they are also outsourcing their inflation and often accompanying austerity to countries that hold debt in those currencies.</p><p>In our view, the five drivers outlined above are insidiously powerful forces. Left unaddressed they will render a just transition or even a survivable future impossible. This opens up some difficult questions. If we don’t make the self-sovereignty of money a priority, are inclusivity initiatives such as redistributing philanthropic funds futile? Whilst money exists as a singular, abstractive and indiscriminate medium of exchange, do we have any chance of first repairing and then regenerating our planetary home? As the spread of AI and web3 intensifies, how will this extraordinary technological power be&nbsp;wielded?</p><p>Whether such tools are deployed towards further speculation, extraction and exploitation or in service of our collective vitality is the fundamental question of our&nbsp;time.</p><p>As always, we are sharing these thoughts to provoke discussion and to invite feedback.

<p>Have you been reading about digitally verifiable credentials and wanted to know more about them? Are you interested in digitally verifiable credentials but do not know how to get started? Well, then, you are at the right place – this blog post is all about getting started with verifiable credentials and seeing how they change how credentialing is done.</p>



<p>Credentialing is a simple enough workflow we all understand – an organisation issues the credentials to a recipient. In turn, the recipient can present, share or exchange the credentials to seek new opportunities, services and other things. Today, along with printed credentials, there are digital credentials as well – these are often in PDF and can be easily stored and exchanged. Verifiable credentials improve this workflow – they are secure, tamper-evident data representations that help anyone verify the credentials’ issuer and authenticity.</p>



<p>MARK Studio from Dhiway is a credential lifecycle management platform which empowers issuers to design, issue and manage verifiable documents as blockchain-anchored credentials. Including the blockchain as a system of record leads to immutable records, and thus these are tamper-evident. With MARK Studio, anyone can create certificates online and quickly issue them through well-thought-out steps. Transitioning from traditional print-ready credentialing flows to blockchain credentials could be daunting. So, MARK Studio has a Free plan to try out the workflows before committing to adoption. You can sign up to <a href="https://studio.dhiway.com/auth/register">FREE PLAN</a> and get started. The videos on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@dhiwaynetworks">YouTube channel</a> can help you build and issue your first verifiable credential.</p>



<p>MARK Studio comes “batteries included” with over 60 templates and designs to choose from when creating Learning and Education Records (LERs), Skilling and Knowledge Records and Workplace Experience Records. Starting the credentialing journey with MARK Studio ensures that while you get a feel for verifiable credentials, you look at all kinds of records and data that need provenance – and you are soon on your way to verifiable documents. The verifiable documents issued on MARK Studio help reduce the risk of data abuse and thus add value to your data governance strategies. With secure blockchain-anchored credentials now readily available, you can even look at needs such as temporary passes, event passes and IDs to be designed and issued on MARK Studio.</p>



<p>Verifiable credentials on the CORD network blockchain enable recipients to request, receive, store and exchange a whole set of documents they collect as a learner and in their professional roles. The ease of machine verification, data security and integrity, and combining various sets of credentials into a need-based verifiable document (a “digital resume”) makes it a compelling proposition for all key stakeholders – the issuer, the verifier and the recipient. Today, many organisations are switching to blockchain-anchored verifiable credentials with MARK Studio – sign up and try it out for yourself.</p>

<p>Identity and access management (IAM) is a crucial security component and a business enabler for the modern enterprise — but it’s clear that current systems are falling short on both fronts. Enterprises remain rife with legacy systems, technology silos, and manual and disconnected processes that were never intended to cope with today’s complex identity environment. New threat vectors, often aided by generative AI, exploit the gaps in this patchwork of systems, with increasingly alarming consequences.</p>  
<p>A robust identity security strategy requires the consolidation of a broad set of identity assurance capabilities into a unified approach. A new position paper by industry analyst Simon Moffatt of the Cyber Hut explores the current state of IAM security and proposes guidelines for organizations to build a comprehensive Identity Assurance approach that can tackle these challenges.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
 Key Findings  
 Enterprises Face Multiple Operational and Identity Security Challenges  
<p>The current technological landscape has become increasingly complex, characterized by hybrid deployments, fragmented technology silos, and inadequate visibility and metrics. Employee onboarding and credential management processes remain manual and disjointed, creating friction and security gaps. The rising volume and variety of remote work and people supply chains puts further strain on systems and business.</p> 
<p></p> 
 Outdated Authentication and Identity Verification Processes Prevalent  
<p>Authentication stands out as a critical pinch point in user interactions, presenting both opportunities and challenges. Many organizations employ multiple MFA solutions without a clear pathway to consolidation or adoption of phishing-resistant passwordless authentication.</p> 
<p>Moreover, the lack of coherence and continuity in identity verification and validation processes severely impacts business and security, leading to issues such as cumbersome employee verification, fraud, credential theft, account takeover, and data breaches.</p> 
 The Need for Converged Identity Assurance  
<p>A comprehensive <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-identity-assurance">Identity Assurance</a> strategy involves viewing authentication in stages of maturity, moving from siloed and coarse-grained methods to relying on an assured identity that is continually verified. The goal is to reduce fragmentation and trust boundaries, and overlay existing authentication with verified identities on an ongoing basis.</p> 
<p>By embracing a converged Identity Assurance approach, organizations improve identity security, accelerate adoption of Zero Trust principles, improve IAM productivity, and reduce their compliance exposure.</p> 
<p></p>

 What happened? 
<p>On December 16th Truffle Security disclosed a <a href="https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/google-oauth-is-broken-sort-of/">Google OAuth vulnerability</a> that allows employees, even after leaving a company, to retain access to applications like Slack and Zoom. The vulnerability arises from the ability to create Google accounts where the email address has the domain of the corporate organization but does not actually belong to that organization. This poses a risk to organizations, service providers like Zoom and Slack, and Google itself.</p>
 How does it work? 
<p>1. First, the user must have an account in your corporate Google workspace, such as <a href="mailto:user@example.com">user@example.com</a></p>
<p>2. Then the user creates a new personal Google account, using their existing email, but they add “+something” to the user name part of the email, eg. <a href="mailto:user+something@example.com">user+something@example.com</a>. Because Google will essentially ignore anything after the + in an email address, the user will be able to receive all the verification emails in their corporate inbox. (They need to do this in advance of leaving the organization.)</p>
<p>User must click “Use your existing email” and use the alias user+something@example.com</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Now the user can use this google account to sign into 3rd party apps under the corporate domain. This is possible because many of these 3rd party apps only verify that the domain part of the email used when logging into the account is a known corporate account. (<a href="mailto:user+something@example.com">user+something@example.com</a> ⇒ domain = <a href="http://example.com">example.com</a>)</p>
<p></p>
 Was YeshID Affected? 
<p>No, users attempting to use this technique to log into YeshID would not be successful.</p>
 Recommendations 
 Detection 
 
 If your organization has tools to perform an email search (such as the Security Center Investigation Tool in Google Workspace), look for emails sent to addresses containing your domain and a “+” symbol to detect these shadow account creations. 
 Review the user lists in the applications your organization uses to look for accounts with email addresses containing a “+” symbol to detect users who may have exploited this vulnerability. 
 
 Prevention 
 
 If your organization uses applications that allow any user to sign in as long as they are from your domain, consider disabling that feature. For example, in Slack: <a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/115004856503-Manage-how-people-join-your-workspace">https://slack.com/help/articles/115004856503-Manage-how-people-join-your-workspace</a> 
 Switch the application to use SAML for SSO if possible 
 
<p>Regular auditing of your user environment is important and YeshID can help.

<p>Businesses face an ever-expanding array of cyber threats. Phishing, the deceptive practice of tricking individuals into divulging sensitive information, sits prominently at the top. It’s not just about lost data; it’s about lost trust, credibility, and in many cases, significant financial repercussions. Enter Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), an established tool in the cybersecurity arsenal. But as cybercriminals become savvier, the call for more advanced, phishing resistant MFA grows louder.</p>
 
Understanding Phishing Resistant MFA 
<p>Phishing resistant MFA takes the foundational principles of MFA and enhances them. While traditional MFA might rely on something you know (a password) and something you have (a mobile device for an SMS code), phishing-resistant variants add authentication request elements much harder to replicate or steal. This could be a physical device like a hardware token or something inherent to hardware security keys the user, like a biometric detail.<br>
The biometric authentication and login process, for instance, utilizes unique physical or behavioral attributes – from fingerprints to voice patterns. Its strength lies in its uniqueness; while a password can be stolen or guessed, replicating a retina pattern remains profoundly challenging.<br>
Today, cybercriminals employ various tactics to deceive individuals and organizations such as:</p>
 
 Spear Phishing: Unlike generic phishing attacks that target a broad audience, spear phishing is tailored to a specific individual or organization. Having done meticulous research, the attacker crafts a personalized message, making the deceit harder to spot. A typical scenario might involve mimicking communication from a senior executive or an HR representative requesting sensitive data or actions. 
 Whaling: This is a subset of spear phishing but targets high-profile individuals like CEOs or CFOs. Given the potential high return, attackers invest time in understanding the executive’s behavior, likes, dislikes, and even personal schedules, aiming to bypass traditional detection methods. 
 Smishing and Vishing: As mobile usage grows, attackers have begun to target users via SMS (Smishing) and voice calls (Vishing). For example, one might receive an SMS from a “bank” claiming unauthorized activity and requesting immediate action. Vishing attacks, meanwhile, involve human interaction, with attackers using social engineering techniques to extract information over a phone call.<br>
To fully grasp the gravity and evolution of these contemporary cyber threats, it’s crucial to delve into the historical backdrop from which they emerged. Historical Context of Phishing and MFA 
 
 Historical Context of Phishing and MFA 
<p>Over the past few decades, as the digital world has expanded, so too have cyber threats. Phishing began as simple email scams but rapidly evolved, targeting more prominent organizations and employing more sophisticated tactics. In response resist phishing, the cybersecurity industry introduced Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to secure authentication and add an extra layer of protection.<br>
Early MFA systems were rudimentary, often relying solely on passwords and security questions. But with the increasing sophistication of modern phishing campaigns and techniques, MFA had to evolve, leading to the advanced phishing-resistant systems we see today.</p>
 
Why Phishing Resistant MFA is Essential 
<p>Recent years have witnessed a surge in phishing attempts targeting businesses, and online services regardless of size or domain. Beyond the immediate financial losses, which can be substantial, phishing attacks erode client trust and tarnish an organization’s image for years.<br>
Furthermore, the data they store grows as more businesses undergo digital transformations. This makes them attractive targets for cybercriminals. Incorporating phishing resistant technologies and security keys into MFA can act as a formidable barrier, significantly reducing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.</p>
 
ROI of Phishing-Resistant MFA 
<p>When considering any significant change in organizational processes, especially one that involves costs, it’s essential to evaluate the Return on Investment (ROI). With phishing-resistant MFA, the ROI isn’t just measured in monetary terms. Yes, there can be direct cost savings from averting potential cyberattacks, but the intangible benefits are equally vital.<br>
Enhanced brand reputation, infrastructure security agency increased customer trust, and adherence to industry regulations can result in long-term business benefits, from customer retention to easier stakeholder negotiations. In essence, the investment in phishing-resistant MFA could yield returns far beyond the financial.</p>
 
Preliminary Steps Before Implementation 
<p>Rushing headfirst into implementing any security solution without a strategy is a recipe for potential failure. Start with a comprehensive security assessment. Engage experts to understand where your vulnerabilities lie and which assets are most at risk.<br>
An equally critical component is understanding your users. An overly complex system might have substantial resistance, leading to workarounds compromising security. It’s essential to strike a balance – a system robust in its security but user-friendly.</p>
 Best Practices for Implementing Phishing Resistant MFA 
 
User Education and Training 
<p>Technological measures are just one part of a comprehensive security strategy. Your users – employees – are on the front lines. Regular training sessions help reinforce the importance of security. Beyond theoretical knowledge, interactive sessions, such as simulated phishing attacks, can provide practical experience, preparing them for real-life scenarios.</p>
 
Choosing the Right MFA Solution 
<p>The market is flooded with a range of phishing-resistant MFA products. Each boasts its set of features and benefits. While evaluating, look beyond just the security features. Consider the ease of integration into existing systems, how scalable the solution is, its user experience, and its cost-effectiveness. An ideal phishing resistance and solution would align with both your IT infrastructure and budgetary considerations.</p>
 
Phased Implementation 
<p>A phased approach is often more manageable and less disruptive. Begin with the most critical systems that, if compromised, could result in the most significant harm. Parallelly, prioritize high-risk user groups. As you iron out any teething issues and achieve success, expand the implementation to cover more systems and users.</p>
 
Regular Testing and Evaluation 
<p>Implementing a strong phishing resistant MFA isn’t the end. Cyber threats evolve, and your defenses should adapt accordingly. Regularly scheduled penetration tests can provide insights into potential vulnerabilities. Monitoring tools can offer real-time data on the MFA’s effectiveness, allowing for timely tweaks and refinements.</p>
 
Creating a Responsive Support System 
<p>Challenges and uncertainties often mark transition periods. A robust support system can ease these teething pains. Whether through helplines, chat support, or on-ground IT teams, ensure users can easily access assistance. A two-way communication channel can also provide valuable user feedback, refining the MFA system.</p>
 
Ensuring Backup and Recovery Options 
<p>Every system can face hiccups. From a user losing their hardware token to a biometric system failing to recognize a fingerprint, having backup systems in place is crucial. Clear protocols for such scenarios can prevent potential lockouts and ensure continuity of operations.<br>
In addition to these common concerns, addressing the need for offline access is essential, particularly when internet connectivity is unreliable or unavailable, such as during travel.<br>
Here are some strategies to manage these situations:</p>
 
 Offline Access Solutions: Implement offline access features in your phishing-resistant MFA system. This could involve using physical tokens or biometric methods that don’t rely on real-time verification from a central server. For instance, a hardware token generating one-time codes or a biometric system storing validation data locally can provide secure access even without an internet connection. 
 Travel-Friendly Authentication Methods: When users travel, especially across different time zones or areas with limited connectivity, they need reliable authentication methods. Consider providing additional travel-specific hardware tokens or setting up temporary access codes that remain valid for the travel period. 
 Backup Verification Methods: Establish backup verification methods when the primary MFA method fails. For instance, you could use a secondary mobile device as a fallback option or provide a limited number of use-once codes that can be securely stored and used only when necessary. 
 
 Types of Phishing Resistant MFA Tools 
<p>To truly understand the scope of phishing-resistant MFA, it’s crucial to explore the variety of tools available. Hardware tokens, for example, are physical devices that generate time-sensitive codes. While these tokens are secure, they can be lost or stolen.<br>
Biometric systems, on the other hand, offer authentication through facial recognition, fingerprint scans, or even voice patterns. There’s also behavioral-based authentication, which analyzes patterns in user behavior (like typing speed or mouse movements) to confirm identity and to secure their login credentials and credentials. Each tool has advantages and challenges, making it imperative for organizations to choose based on their specific needs.</p>
 
Integration with Other Security Measures 
<p>While formidable and phishing-resistant, MFA can be even more potent when integrated with other cybersecurity measures. For instance, a Virtual Private Network (VPN) adds a layer of encryption and security to data transmissions.<br>
Combining an authentication method MFA with endpoint protection ensures that even if a device is compromised, unauthorized users still need multiple authentication factors to access sensitive data. A multi-layered security approach that includes phishing-resistant authentication methods MFA can create a robust defense mechanism against cyber threats.</p>
 
Enhancing Phishing-Resistant MFA with BlockID 
<p>While phishing-resistant MFA stands strong, its potency is amplified when integrated with other cybersecurity measures. Our BlockID app, for instance, provides a seamless experience in secure digital identity verification, aligning perfectly with the principles of phishing-resistant MFA. When coupled with a Virtual Private Network (VPN), an added layer of encryption and security protects data transmissions.<br>
Further solidifying security, combining a tool like the BlockID app with endpoint protection ensures that even if a device falls into the wrong hands, unauthorized users still require multiple authentication factors to access sensitive data. This combination results in a multi-layered security approach that includes phishing-resistant methods, positioning organizations at the forefront of defense against cyber threats.</p>
 
Addressing Common Challenges 
<p>Change is often met with resistance. Employees accustomed to older systems might view phishing-resistant MFA as an unnecessary complication. Addressing these concerns, clarifying the change’s rationale, and offering training can ease the transition.<br>
On the technical side, the implementation might face hitches like any IT project. It’s crucial to have an IT team well-prepared to address these. Lastly, while security is paramount, user convenience shouldn’t be wholly sidelined. An overly cumbersome system might lead to non-compliance, defeating its very purpose.</p>
 
Benefits Beyond Security 
<p>While the primary purpose of phishing-resistant MFA is to bolster security, its benefits extend beyond just protection. Implementing advanced MFA can signal to customers and stakeholders that an organization is committed to safeguarding its data—a crucial factor in building trust.<br>
Moreover, in some industries, regulatory compliance necessitates specific security measures to prevent phishing,, including advanced phishing resistant MFA methods. Thus, by adopting phishing-resistant MFA, organizations can avoid potential fines from federal agencies and position themselves favorably in the market as trustworthy entities.</p>
 
BlockID’s Role in Strengthening Phishing-Resistant Security 
<p>In the ongoing fight against phishing and cyber threats, robust security like BlockID is crucial. BlockID advances beyond traditional authentication methods of what you know or have, to a more secure paradigm of who you are, thereby enhancing an organization’s phishing-resistant security posture.</p>

				  Remove the need to set up and manage your own mediator so you can focus on helping your customers benefit from verifiable data and identity.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Indicio Proven® provides customers with powerful, scalable communication features that allow them to cryptographically authenticate the parties in any interaction before data is shared.</p>
<p>This secure, bidirectional communication between people and organizations using mobile devices is made possible by a mediator. It’s like a post office for a decentralized ecosystem: every message goes to the mediator, which is then able to find individual end users to create a secure connection and deliver the message. Mediation drives decentralized communication — and in a privacy-preserving way too, as the “Post Office” can’t open the messages, even if it wanted to.</p>
<p>With a hosted mediator in Indicio Proven®, customers can choose to let Indicio run the Post Office, which makes deploying a verifiable data solution faster, scaling it easier, and managing it simpler.</p>
<p>It’s also important to note that while we say “message,” we are not confined to simple texts or written messages. How you use this secure connection is largely limited by your imagination. Among the use cases Indicio has helped facilitate are offering proof of funds for financial transactions, sharing proof of membership for an organization or rewards program, and sharing proof of age for purchasing goods, without actually sharing birthdate or other personal information.</p>
<p>Historically, Indicio has helped customers set up their own mediator for management by their internal teams. Due to customer feedback, Indicio Proven® now provides this feature as a professionally-managed service. This makes Indicio Proven an even simpler and more powerful way to implement decentralized identity technology, enhancing scalability, ensuring uptime, and freeing users to focus on delivering transformative verifiable data solutions to their customers.</p>
<p>Whether your mediator is hosted and managed by your team or Indicio, the messages it delivers are private by design. Each message is encrypted to the end recipient, and is not visible to the mediator.</p>
<p>Who its for</p>
<p>This mediator service is for customers that just want to “set and forget” their decentralized identity solution. Indicio will handle the day-to-day management of any mediation your solution requires and ensure the mediator has the latest updates.</p>
<p>Why use Indicio’s mediator services</p>
<p>Professionally managed: Indicio has years of experience in the decentralized identity field and boasts a 99.97% uptime on our network. You won’t need to worry about the day-to-day specifics of mediation, but should any problems come to your attention you will have a direct line to a team that leads the development of the technology.</p>
<p>Built for scale: The new mediator service has been tested with up to fifty thousand simultaneous connections per customer, and our team can easily scale it to as many connections as you need.</p>
<p>Live message delivery: Often mediators will only allow for a momentary connection to an end user to deliver a message and then sever that connection. Indicio’s mediator service allows for users to stay connected to your service for a set amount of time, resulting in receiving messages faster and a better customer experience.</p>
<p>How to get started</p>
<p>Our team prides itself on setting our customers up for success. We have found a <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">quick consultation with our team</a> to align on goals for your solution to be the most effective way to learn more about Indicio Proven® and how you can best use the Hosted Mediator Service.</p>

				 <p>In today’s interconnected world, trust in the digital landscape is more crucial than ever. A secure and trustworthy online environment becomes paramount as we increasingly intertwine our lives with the internet, from personal interactions to complex financial transactions and healthcare decisions. Recognizing this critical need, Continuum Loop, in collaboration with CIRA, has authored a new report, “<a href="https://www.cira.ca/en/resources/documents/state-of-internet/a-trust-layer-for-the-internet-is-emerging-a-2023-report/">A Trust Layer for the Internet is Emerging.</a>”&nbsp;</p>
<p>This report, the result of the collaboration between <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/darrellodonnell/">Darrell O’Donnell</a> of Continuum Loop and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacqueslatour/">Jacques Latour</a> from CIRA, emerges as an essential resource for those innovators and early adopters leading the charge in digital innovation and strategy. It offers a comprehensive exploration of the challenges and solutions in building trust online, tailored to meet the needs of technical and business professionals in internet-centric organizations.</p>
<p>This pioneering document addresses the growing trust crisis in the digital realm, where the proliferation of fakes, frauds, and forgeries has significantly eroded public confidence. Our report highlights the path forward to restore and enhance trust in the internet, ensuring its role as a reliable and safe platform for future generations.</p>
 The Decline of Trust: A Wake-Up Call 
<p>It’s a concerning reality: trust in the internet is at an all-time low. In recent years, Canadians’ trust in the internet has plummeted from 71% to 57%, mirroring a global trend. The increase of fakes, frauds, and forgeries fuels this erosion of trust. This isn’t just a statistic; it has become a call to action. Organizations suffer when trust wanes, with some experiencing dramatic decreases in market capitalization after trust-related incidents.</p>
 Unveiling the Emerging Trust Layer 
<p>The report introduces an innovative concept: developing a ‘trust layer’ for the internet. This layer is a harmonious blend of technical trust (like encryption and signing) and human trust (like governance). It’s about creating a digital environment where parties can mutually authenticate each other, knowing confidently who they’re dealing with.</p>
 Trust Registries: Anchoring Digital Trust 
<p>A pivotal aspect of this trust layer is the role of trust registries. Trust registries provide authoritative answers within digital ecosystems, bridging the gap between technology and human trust. Furthermore, the concept of Registry of Registries (RoR) is explored to create an interconnected web of trust across various ecosystems.</p>
 From Wallets to Trust: A Paradigm Shift 
<p>Originally intended as an update to the 2019 “The Wallet Report,” the focus of this study shifted to the more critical issue of building trustworthy systems on the internet. It’s a response to the growing awareness that while security is essential, more is needed for establishing trust.</p>
 Navigating the Path to an Enhanced Trust Layer 
<p>The journey to build a trust layer on the internet, as outlined in the report, is challenging but vital. It requires a delicate balance of technical trust and human trust. The report underscores the importance of governance in maintaining trust and the critical role of trust registries in anchoring trust within digital ecosystems.</p>
 A Call to Action 
<p>The report concludes with a powerful message: we can reverse the decline in internet trust. By developing a trust layer, we can once again rely on the internet as a secure and trustworthy platform. It’s a shared responsibility to build and maintain this trust layer, not just for the benefit of digital ecosystems but for society as a whole.</p>
 Rebuilding Trust in Our Digital World 
<p>While the path ahead is challenging, the blueprint for a trustworthy internet is becoming clearer. Through the collaborative efforts of Continuum Loop and CIRA, we have charted a course towards an internet that balances technical trust with human trust, underpinned by the essential role of trust registries. These components are not just parts of a system but the pillars upon which we can construct an inherently reliable and secure digital realm.</p>
 Technical and Human Synergy: The Heart of the Emerging Trust Layer 
<p>The success of the emerging trust layer will not be measured solely by its technical strength but by the trust it fosters in our digital relationships. Developing and nurturing this trust layer is a collective responsibility with significant promise for revolutionizing digital ecosystems and enriching our society.</p>
<p>As we embark on this journey to reforge trust in the digital landscape, we do so with a clear understanding of the transformative potential of the trust layer and trust registries. This report is more than an analysis; it is a call to action for creating a future where trust is the cornerstone of our digital interactions. The time to act is now – to shape a functional and fundamentally trustworthy internet.</p>
 Key Takeaways 
 
 The Internet’s Trust Deficit Needs to Be Repaid: Key trust-related decisions in the internet’s evolution were delayed or ignored, leaving the digital realm needing more essential capabilities to establish trust. 
 The Necessity of Trust Registries: Trust registries, including the innovative concept of a Registry of Registries (RoR), are crucial in creating a web of trust across ecosystems and anchoring the trust layer. 
 Ecosystem Diversity: Each digital ecosystem operates uniquely, and trust registries help unify diverse players and governance structures. 
 Leveraging Existing Systems: Existing systems hold the answers needed to establish trust; the challenge lies in accessing and integrating this information. 
 The Value of Trusted Interactions: Trusted interactions are increasingly valuable, and trust registries are pivotal in driving value up and costs down in the digital landscape.

Make the blockchain safe or lose&nbsp;it Vinay Gupta as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raguel_(angel)#:~:text=XXIII%2C%20Raguel%20is%20one%20of,across%20Jewish%20and%20Christian%20traditions.">Raguel</a><p>I have recounted the history and prehistory of crypto <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-road-to-rwa-f99cac31361d">elsewhere</a> — the path from PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) through e-gold to Bitcoin. Now I want to take a look at what happened next, what went wrong with the Ethereum vision of the future, and how we can turn things around to make the blockchain the powerhouse of the future that it was always meant to be. I need to talk about magic and rules. I’ve seen a fair bit of magic over the years, and I understand when it needs&nbsp;rules.</p><blockquote>I’ve seen a fair bit of magic over the years, and I understand when it needs&nbsp;rules</blockquote><p>Let’s start with a short recap; the first great crypto innovation was<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy"> PGP,</a> which tried to bring true privacy to online communications, then there was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1997/0908/6005172a.html">https </a>that gave us the ecommerce revolution, Amazon and all that. Then, the third innovation came with the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-paper">Bitcoin white paper</a> that ushered in cryptocurrency. Bitcoin was commonly believed to be a response to e-gold being shut down by the American government; if we want to ask “who is Satoshi?”, then the answer is that somewhere within two handshakes of the e-gold organisations is almost certainly where you find the origin of the Satoshi group — I have my theories, other people have theirs. Anyway, Bitcoin trundles along for a while as an interesting geek thing where a few Bitcoin can get you a pizza, if you know the right nerds, but it’s not much use for anything yet; until Wikileaks. When Wikileaks gets seriously effective at embarrassing governments, banks and various other payment routes shut them out so no one can donate funds to them. Suddenly, the only functional method that can get cash to Wikileaks and can’t be shut down is Bitcoin; people take notice, its value skyrockets to the level where one will buy you a very decent car instead of a fraction of a pizza, and people start to get politically interested in&nbsp;it.</p><p>Now though, we need to think about what was really going on with Bitcoin. What people wanted from the blockchain — and what a lot of them got — was magic, and new&nbsp;rules:</p><p>Magic: “internet money machine go brrrrrr” and folks that were futuristic and lucky got very rich. A real vanguard movement.</p><p>Rules: 1 BTC is always worth 1 BTC. Uncensorable. Free.</p><p>This idea that new rules can make you rich and the money isn’t really coming from anywhere is, unfortunately, the devil’s bargain. Here’s why: printing money makes the other money worth&nbsp;less.</p><blockquote>Printing money makes the other money worth&nbsp;less</blockquote><p>Bitcoin is converting fiat money into Bitcoin, and it’s just increasing the money supply. It’s exactly the same as a central bank printing money. It’s just that bitcoin is printed and handed out to the miners, instead of having a government write enormous bailout cheques to banks under a cover like “quantitative easing”. Bitcoin slowly makes the dollar worth less just as something like quantitative easing (QE) ultimately does. All that QE money invented and dumped onto the market in 2008 to stave off financial collapse eventually fed through to the increase in inflation and so on today — it made the dollar worth less because there was more money circulating. Same happens with Bitcoin. Bitcoin may not be the same as dollars, but it is doing the same thing; ultimately, it is used to buy things so it has the same effect — more money circulating. Now bitcoiners will tell you that’s fine. And, within the scope of human beings exercising their freedom to compute it certainly is. Bitcoin is arguably a free speech issue. I’m good with that, but the money is coming from the dollar getting slightly weaker every time BTC moons. I don’t like this way of making money. I don’t mind people doing it, but let’s call it what it is: crypto-fiat. Bitcoin is a “decentral bank” of the internet. It’s crazy that it works, but it’s another central bank printing money at the end of the&nbsp;day.</p><blockquote>Let’s call it what it is: crypto-fiat. Bitcoin is a “decentral bank” of the&nbsp;internet</blockquote><p>Something else was&nbsp;needed.</p><p>So, people start asking <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/mastercoin-a-second-generation-protocol-on-the-bitcoin-blockchain-1383603310">“Why doesn’t Bitcoin implement smart contracts?</a>”, which would make it more than just crypto-fiat, and that question of “Why doesn’t Bitcoin implement smart contracts?” is, to me, the great religious issue of the day. Because if Bitcoin had said “yes” to smart contracts, then there would not be a need for a <a href="https://blockchainlab.com/pdf/Ethereum_white_paper-a_next_generation_smart_contract_and_decentralized_application_platform-vitalik-buterin.pdf">second system.</a> All of the energy behind Bitcoin, all of the energy behind Ethereum, all of the energy behind everything else…It would be the single point of an enormous driven spear. We did not get that, because Bitcoin said “no” to progress, they said “no” to transformation, they said “no” to change. Bitcoin decided that they had evolved as far as they needed to, and that they were going to stay right there. As a result, we have an avant-garde that comes along to do the smart contracts thing, which is Ethereum and all of the things that came after Ethereum, while the old-school Bitcoiners stay with Bitcoin. Whether they turn out to be smart people that stuck to fundamentals, or Neanderthals who evolution ploughed under, is too soon to tell — give it another 20 years, maybe even another&nbsp;50.</p><blockquote>if Bitcoin had said “yes” to smart contracts…it would be the single point of an enormous driven&nbsp;spear.</blockquote><p>The great hope from Ethereum is that Ethereum is more than a central bank. Ether is not money per se: Ether is a tokenized right to future transactions on the World Computer. Watch this 2015 video from the Ethereum Foundation to understand the&nbsp;story.</p><p>Does software create wealth? YES! What we do with spreadsheets can be done by accountants on paper but it takes weeks rather than seconds to run a new financial model. A payment instrument does not create wealth, it just moves wealth around. That’s why ETH &gt; BTC for sure. What we’ve seen for the last 8 years, since Ethereum was launched, is a mad scramble to figure out what to do with the World Computer.</p><p>Generation after generation of cultish new ideas have been pitched as revolutions: ICOs, DeFi, NFTs were the largest waves. All of them, failed experiments. Folks will argue that these things have not failed but here’s a way to think about it: was more money put into these things than taken out? The answer is YES in all cases. Every penny made in DeFi was lost by somebody else, minus some friction which pays for creation of the tech. This is not wealth generating, any more than Bitcoin is wealth generating. Sophisticated mechanisms for moving money around do not CREATE wealth. The financial system does not create wealth other than by investing in the creation of goods and services that people actually need. And, right now, Ethereum is the financial system on bottom-up decentralised individually-superempowered turbo steroids. So, what happened?</p><blockquote>Sophisticated mechanisms for moving money around do not CREATE&nbsp;wealth</blockquote><p>Inside of Ethereum there developed three generations of political vision: these are what I would call the Nouveau Bitcoiners, the Radicalised Canadians, and the heartless Scammers. The Nouveau Bitcoiners are the people who think that Ether is going to be the global currency instead of Bitcoin, they think in terms of freedom to transact and are very much about the idea of a direct takeover from the nation state and a direct takeover from the dollar. It’s “Ethereum is just like Bitcoin, but with smart contracts”. Their vision is “The Ether price climbs and climbs and climbs, until every asset is denominated in Ether”. That is the generation-one political vision of Ethereum. Not many people think like that now, but there are a few of&nbsp;them.</p><blockquote>Inside of Ethereum there developed… the Nouveau Bitcoiners, the Radicalised Canadians, and the heartless Scammers</blockquote><p>The next generation are the Radicalised Canadians, and I would see Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin as one of these. The vision here involves things like quadratic voting: you reduce the cost of building new social structures because you can use Ethereum smart contracts to do it. Those social structures control assets and the control of assets using these new social structures enables the transformation of the way society works. This means you can do much cheaper experiments in an evolving society because you use software to run the bureaucracy — you don’t need to build a new government department; you just need the right smart contract and you can do it now. This is expressed particularly well in a book called <a href="https://amzn.eu/d/iRqutFx">Radical Markets</a> by Eric Posner and Glen Weyl. This idea that we can incrementally improve the functioning of the world by putting more and more load on automated bureaucracy rather than attempting political transformation through the ballot box is the “build your way to your own utopia”&nbsp;model.</p><p>I would suggest that the apex of the “build your way to your own utopia” model is all the stuff on network states coming from <a href="https://amzn.eu/d/huUv3pN">Balaji Srinivasan</a>. I went to the network states conference in Amsterdam, and there’s a huge amount of enthusiasm about building what I would call weakly state-like entities (<a href="https://athousandnations.com/2009/04/21/free-guptastan/">WSLEs,</a> or “Weasels”) on the blockchain, You have a cryptocurrency, you have a community, you buy a bunch of land, and you put all of that stuff together into a bundle, and it creates a sort of miniature state-like thing. Of course, there are major potential pitfalls inherent in all this; e.g. depending on where you have your land, your network state DIY utopia can look a lot like reinventing colonialism for the digital age — a bunch of Americans setting up a<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pr%C3%B3spera#:~:text=Pr%C3%B3spera%20is%20a%20private%20city,%2C%20regulatory%2C%20and%20legal%20architecture."> “utopia” in Honduras</a> raises a lot more questions than, say, a bunch of Hondurans setting one up in the US. But a network state doesn’t necessarily need the land, it can have a <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-network-state-and-the-digital-hansa-bfccf8df0097">completely virtual existence</a>, there’s lots of enthusiasm about that, and I would say that is the final embodiment of the Radicalised Canadian vision: kind of libertarian, kind of utopian, but a lot more egalitarian than the hard line, currency-driven Bitcoin generation. The DAO people are a big part of that as well, lots of work on DAOs, lots of work on quadratic funding, Gitcoin… All of that is in this bucket that I would call the Radicalised Canadians.</p><p>Finally we have the third generation, the Scammers. A big problem in the space is that the Radicalised Canadians have been unable to fight off the Scammers. I remember when the Scammers arrived: our conferences went from being a bunch of nerds in various-kinds-of-band T-shirts, standing around in their big black boots and yapping to each other about consensus algorithms, to slick computer graphics and really impressive slide presentations fronted by people that had been trained to speak in the Tony Robbins school of sincerity. And when those folks arrived, what you wound up with was a problem; because when you had people coming to find out what Ethereum was, the slick, sincere-sounding guys were the ones they listened to because they knew how to capture attention. The people who understood what Ethereum was truly about, the Nouveau Bitcoiners and Radical Canaidans, were, generally speaking, poor presenters, and they were pushed aside by the people that understood how to sell scams. Those people didn’t really understand what it was they were selling, and they didn’t have to, they just needed to understand what people were buying. All they had to have was a plausible enough story to separate rubes from their money, and those people went through the space like dysentery through a refugee camp. I would suggest that they have destroyed 99% of the value in the Ethereum space over the last, say, 4–5&nbsp;years.</p><blockquote>Scammers went through Ethereum like dysentery through a refugee&nbsp;camp</blockquote><p>I want to repeat that: I would suggest that scammers have destroyed 99% of the value in the Ethereum space… You wonder why the coin is floating around $2,000 rather than $20,000? You wonder why there are only $120bn of stablecoins rather than half the global financial system being on chain? The answer is Ethereum has become synonymous with fraud. If you hear that your cousin has gotten super into crypto, do you think “My god, that’s going to be amazing!” or do you think they’re going to lose their house and their car and you’re going to have to bail them out pretty soon? The fear that we have, that being involved in the blockchain is now a bad thing, that is fear of the grifters. It’s fear that people who don’t really understand the technology are going to be sucked in by slick marketing for a deal that should be illegal, and probably is. That they’re going to get ripped off for everything they own if the Scammers can manage it, and we’ve become so tolerant of this that the culture has terms like “rug pull”. Rug pull means fraud and people should go to jail — rug pull! We have smart contracts that are perfectly capable of making it technically impossible for people to rug-pull, but the general Ethereum user population are so ignorant about what the technology is and how it can protect them that they don’t even insist that the contracts are structured in a way that means they cannot get rug-pulled.</p><blockquote>Ethereum has become synonymous with&nbsp;fraud</blockquote><p>It’s finance minus all RULES and deprived of all MORALITY. In Ethereum right now you are literally seeing what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929#:~:text=On%20September%2020%2C%201929%2C%20top,on%20the%20London%20Stock%20Exchange">Wall Street was like in 1929</a>, rug pulls and all. Finance without RULES and MORALITY is net negative. It’s the fast being predatory and eating the life savings of the slow, over and over and over&nbsp;again.</p><p>It’s violent.</p><p>“No Force, No Fraud” says the Libertarian Golden Rule, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle">Non-Aggression Principle (NAP</a>).</p><p>Does Ethereum live up to that&nbsp;today?</p><p>No. Remember I’m the former Release Coordinator for the 2015 launch. I also wrote the definitive blog post&nbsp;, <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/by-the-end-of-this-article-youre-going-to-understand-blockchains-in-general-and-ethereum-a-next-e11df6a1d7cf">Programmable Blockchains in Context</a>, for the Ethereum launch. I’ve been around. I’ve done cryptographic applications development (against and then for multiple governments) since 1997.&nbsp;. I’m not pleased at how Ethereum is turning&nbsp;out.</p><p>We can do better. We can do a lot&nbsp;better.</p><p>So how did we wind up with epidemic fraud on Ethereum, a technology which was meant to produce an incorruptible global record of who owned what so that we could build a fairer, better global&nbsp;economy?</p><p>It’s your fault: you all got greedy and lazy and believed crappy NFTs had value. They are <a href="https://cheezburger.com/16719877/funny-memes-tweets-that-roast-nfts-crypto">literally laughing at&nbsp;us.</a></p><p>Wilful ignorance of the law created the entire cycle of destruction around NFTs. If there had been a single decent intellectual property licence, commissioned by OpenSea and attached to everything by default then NFTs might not have hard crashed in value as they have. Proper use of law would have protected value which is, after all, the fundamental function of&nbsp;law.</p><blockquote>Wilful ignorance of the law created the entire cycle of destruction around&nbsp;NFTs</blockquote><p>Imagine how different it would have been if they could have said “here’s the OpenSea public licence and the Bored Ape licence, anything which is going to get done on the blockchain with images or art, you have that built in copyright licence by default. If you want a different licence, feel free to upload it, but you will have to have a licence…”</p><p>If they’d done that for intellectual property, then OpenSea would be the world hub for clearing intellectual property rights today, and it would probably still be doing hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of transactions a month, and it would have created enormously powerful global liquid markets for IP. You would be able to literally licence a Bored Ape to Disney to do a TV show, rather than the situation right now where nobody can really pin down <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/nfts-and-intellectual-property-what-do-you-actually-own/">what you buy when you buy an NFT</a>. That is the result of a lackadaisical attitude towards the deal; because if you don’t clearly define the terms, then what the hell is somebody&nbsp;buying?</p><p>We went out to build an incorruptible global economy, and what we got was overrun by scammers that subverted that vital global vision and delivered a wasteland of Ponzi schemes and delusional fake assets. The Eloi had a wonderful world full of sunlight and flowers, but the Morlocks still ate them. Ethereum needs a moral upgrade. Maybe instead of moral I should say political. “No force, no fraud” only works if we have a mechanism for punishing those who attempt or commit fraud. Financial products sold by Anonymous Aardvark twitter accounts do not have any meaningful ability to punish fraud. So we get fraud. A lot of really hardcore criminal shit is getting done in the financial markets running on Ethereum.</p><blockquote>Ethereum needs a moral&nbsp;upgrade</blockquote><p>It’s a massive market failure: in a Libertarian society in theory the “Free Market” is meant to self-regulate and create free market justice systems to make trade possible. What we have learned in this near-perfect experiment is that Libertarianism is bullshit.</p><p>Let me say that again: Libertarianism is bullshit, and we’ve proven&nbsp;it.</p><p>What we got on Ethereum was violent, destructive anarchy not a self-regulating borderless global&nbsp;economy.</p><p>It’s bad. To fix this we need to build governance structures on the blockchain which have the ability to impose rules and force good conduct on people. The violent anarchy we have created is so dangerous that ordinary people are getting mugged for everything they&nbsp;own</p><p>Is that acceptable?</p><p>Well, if it is acceptable, we wind up with Ethereum as a <a href="https://screenrant.com/eve-online-largest-pvp-battle-ever/">“Player-Versus-Player (PVP)</a> part of the Great Global Massive Multiplayer Online game (MMO) in which we all participate. All the serious players will only interact with Ethereum when they’re heavily armed, and it’ll be filled with predators feeding on each-other. This is a bad scene; “PVP Ethereum” — the violent, destructive anarchy that we have now — is not fit for running the global economy. It would be a disaster if we took a system this amoral and tried to run the world on&nbsp;it.</p><blockquote>It would be a disaster if we took a system this amoral and tried to run the world on&nbsp;it.</blockquote><p>Well, if you don’t believe me, look at what happened when someone did try to run the world on it. It is indicative of the age of most blockchain people — they are young — that Russia in the ’90s is ancient history to them, they don’t remember it; but we are old, and some of us used to be Russian; we remember. There, then, communism collapsed, and while the state struggled to catch up, a new kind of money, dollars, flooded in, and Russia became the poster boy for the kind of unfettered free market capitalism that gave Ayn Rand libertarians spontaneous orgasms. No state interference, just money and business. What happened? Oligarchs happened; without effective law to enforce contracts, you only paid the people who would kill you if you didn’t, and killed your creditors if the opportunity arose. As a result the most ruthless, the hardest, and those with access to serious muscle and hardware (basically ex-KGB) cleaned up while everyone else got thoroughly rinsed and ended up near destitute. This only ended basically when the biggest, most ruthless bastard of all, Putin, got the upper hand, ran the oligarchs out of town and co-opted their methods for himself, resulting in a gangster capitalist mafia dictatorship, which is not the outcome anyone else wanted. Libertarianism in practice turns out to be essentially property without rights, it boils down to “it’s mine because I’ve got the biggest gun”, and that’s it. For 90s Russia, read Ethereum; for the oligarchs read the Scammers. Fraud is a form of force, at the end of the day. When scammers deceive people they remove that person’s will and replace it with the scammer’s own&nbsp;will.</p><p>So we have a choice to make: does Ethereum have a productive real future, or does it end up as a nasty, destructive “PVP” wasteland in which predators feed on predators and scammers scam scammers driving out all the perfectly ordinary and legitimate users until there’s nobody but criminals left on the chain. This could become a cultural race to the bottom that transfers all of the public good value of the blockchain directly into the private good pockets of the&nbsp;thieves.</p><blockquote>This could become a cultural race to the&nbsp;bottom</blockquote><p>You think I’m joking. I’m not joking. The future of finance, and the future of the internet, cannot be to create a more dangerous, less fair, more predator-dominated version of the world and then tell people that it’s good for them. It’s not good for them. We’re creating a hell and calling it a&nbsp;heaven.</p><p>Now I did not come into this thing to facilitate the creation of a destructive hell realm and to super-empower predators and thieves. I came into this looking for an international aid transparency technology to help me build my <a href="http://myhopeforthe.world">climate refugee projects</a>.</p><blockquote>I did not come into this thing to facilitate the creation of a destructive hell&nbsp;realm</blockquote><p>We need to turn this thing around. We need to do it now because this Bull Run (if it materialises) looks like it will be the <a href="https://www.altcoinbuzz.io/defi/why-the-rwa-sector-accumulated-5-8-billion-in-3-months/">Real World Assets (RWA) bull run</a>. If people try the same games with RWA that they did with NFTs, if we get runaway fraud, people will start going to jail. The authorities will start prosecuting. If you sell somebody an NFT and tell them it’s “blue chip” and will hold its value you’re probably not committing fraud, it’s what the art world does all the time after all. But when it’s real estate? Cops understand it. If we get any significant amount of actual fraud in the RWA industry, people who have been sold bogus tokens will go and talk to the police. “I was sold this car online and they defrauded me” is a message a cop can understand. It’s not about magic internet $. And it’s not financial regulators looking at mis-sold financial instruments. It’s not the SEC pointing the finger and trying to grab turf from CFTC etc. No, it’s the fucking FBI investigating wire fraud. It’s local police forces dealing with straight up thefts. It’s simple criminal enforcement in many or most cases. Primitive, primal law. “You took my money. You sold me garbage.” We have examples of that dispute going back <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complaint_tablet_to_Ea-n%C4%81%E1%B9%A3ir">4000 years</a>. Believe me, the police know how to act on it by&nbsp;now.</p><blockquote>We need to turn this thing around. We need to do it&nbsp;now</blockquote><p>Real World Asset scams are going to face criminal prosecution very&nbsp;fast.</p><p>Wow, that’s going to hurt the rest of us. Are we going to have Ethereum be a “PVP” corner of the internet in which scam artists con the general public, and the authorities keep throwing people in jail for blockchain scams? Is THAT the future that we’ve co-created together?</p><p>We have to get our shit together to avoid&nbsp;it</p><p>I want to propose an idea: I think we really screwed up horribly when we decided that decentralisation is what the blockchain was&nbsp;about.</p><p>I think that was a fundamental error of judgement, and I think it is not too late to fix&nbsp;it.</p><p>What we wanted was systems that were incorruptible, and we thought decentralised meant incorruptible.</p><p>We were wrong: incorruptible trade is the goal, and decentralisation is just one&nbsp;tool.</p><p>We believed and still believe that if you gave the power to the people, then the power would be used wisely. But in fact, what we have discovered is that if you give the power to the people, then the small number of people who are really good at being predators take advantage of the goodwill or ignorance of the rest to cut in and take the power: the scammers, the grifters, they take the power… We worked hard to give the power to the people, and then the scammers and the grifters took it right back off them&nbsp;again.</p><p>It all goes back to the idea of utopias — the internet has always been a utopian idea, a cool, free space, away from regulation and government where people can be excellent to each other and make a new world of equality and self-fulfilment for nerds. Every ten years, another generation tries to create the latest iteration of that, then get burned. Unfortunately something that works purely on mutual trust falls foul of (at least) two fundamental problems. Firstly, assumptions; if the two people in a deal come to it with different unspoken assumptions, grief results. Secondly, the Scammers, if one of the people in the deal isn’t playing fair, more grief results. There needs to be some basic capability that allows for formal agreements that makes the terms of a deal absolutely clear, and will punish scams. Smart contracts only provide one part of what is necessary to make this work in reality: FTX was not a technology problem. Failure to provide scam proofing is what has caused trust to collapse and allowed scams to proliferate, allowed the system to be corrupted. The lack of effective law is what screwed Russia in the 90s, and it will screw Ethereum now. Violent anarchy serves nobody. The locusts move on eventually.</p><blockquote>Every ten years, another generation tries to create utopia, then get&nbsp;burned</blockquote><p>I think that we need to start thinking in terms of the blockchain being about creating incorruptible systems: you get exactly what you pay for, nobody gets in the way, and if they do, the crypto economics or the legals squash them like bugs. That was the original vision of Ethereum, that was what we promised to ourselves that we were going to create back in 2015. If you look at the early Ethereum Foundation communications, incorruptibility is the core theme. That video I embedded earlier, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j23HnORQXv">Ethereum: the World Computer</a>, really expresses this notion of an incorruptible system. An Ethereum where the scammers get crushed like bugs, that is the future, one where you know that if it happened on Ethereum it’s a square and you will get&nbsp;paid.</p><blockquote>We need an Ethereum where the scammers get crushed like&nbsp;bugs</blockquote><p>That is what I’m working towards creating with my company <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a>. We have spent years and a ton of money creating a way to build legals into smart contracts in a way that is enforceable in 172 jurisdictions. The Mattereum system makes it possible to buy something on the blockchain and prove you own it in a court of law almost anywhere in the world. It removes misunderstandings and, yes, squashes scammers like bugs. We are mainly using it to ensure someone buying a real world asset like gold or real estate on the blockchain has an enforceable claim to the physical asset in the real world, but it can be used for IP licences for NFTs, almost anything sold on the blockchain. It’s a way of baking incorruptibility into the system to ensure every transaction is&nbsp;safe.</p><blockquote>The Mattereum system removes misunderstandings and squashes scammers like&nbsp;bugs</blockquote><p>So, Mattereum is doing magic with real estate, gold bars, and so on. The NFTs that people buy linked to their RWAs come with legal machinery that behaves properly, so they get what they paid for or get appropriate compensation. Magic. But that magic comes from rules. The Mattereum Asset Passport is a legally binding documentation stack which parcels out the risk associated with an RWA purchase and places the load on knowledgeable, solvent, deal-protecting underwriters. The magic is the rules. And we did not do this alone. The English judiciary (the judges) are very fond of the blockchain as a mechanism for storing legal evidence which can be used in court cases. They see the blockchain as an <a href="http://judiciary.uk/wp-content/upl%E2%80%A6">economic opportunity</a> for the British economy in&nbsp;fact.</p><blockquote>Many people do not realise that English law governs trading in €600 trillion of OTC derivatives annually, in €11.6 trillion in metals trading, in £250 billion in M&amp;A deals, and in £80 billion in insurance contracts every year — just to take a few examples. My hope is that English law will prove to be the law of choice for borderless blockchain technology as its take up grows exponentially in the months and years to&nbsp;come.</blockquote><blockquote>– Sir Geoffry Vos, Master of the&nbsp;Rolls</blockquote><p>Now, you say, “but Vinay, centralisation is the devil”. Well, turns out decentralisation is the devil&nbsp;too.</p><p>If everybody is responsible, then nobody is. Value is bleeding through decentralised systems like coffee through a paper filter. It’s the <a href="https://w.wiki/LdS">Tragedy of the Commons</a> basically.</p><p>Think about that. We could have Ethereum be the world’s most trusted trade environment instead of the destructive shitshow that we have these days. I want this thing to work. The world needs this thing to&nbsp;work.</p><p>We have a limited number of chances to make this thing work because — eventually — the world will simply give up on Ethereum as a fraud-ridden wasteland. That perception is already becoming a&nbsp;problem.</p><p>Every fraud on Ethereum profits the scammers and harms/damages the rest of the ecosystem. It’s the scammers or us: and that’s the real zero sum game&nbsp;here.</p><p>We have an absolute imperative to get the scammers out of the Ethereum ecosystem, we have to do this or the ecosystem is eventually going to&nbsp;die.</p><p>To do this the focus has to be on incorruptibility, not decentralisation because incorruptible systems can be used to identify the scammers and kick them off. “Is this thing that you’re doing incorruptible or not?” — “Well, no. It’s really decentralised, but…” — “We don’t care: bam, get off the blockchain, we’re not going to do this!”. It’s that simple — raise the bar. Demand incorruptibility.</p><p>If you’re going to put any money behind any project, then demand incorruptibility; if you’re working on a project, then demand incorruptibility. Take the power away from the administrators so it’s impossible to rug, use smart contracts to lock up all of the value, nail them to the legals — there are excellent law firms that are fully functional now to actually get you what you need for that quickly and at a reasonable price. We can make the blockchain live up to its potential, but if we fail to do it, then it’s going to wind up as another dead&nbsp;end.</p><blockquote>Take the power away from the administrators so it’s impossible to&nbsp;rug</blockquote><p>I’ve seen two waves of crypto innovation wind up in dead ends. The only thing that survived from crypto in the 1990s, even though we had fully functional digital currencies, was e-commerce, and e-commerce did not fundamentally make the world a better place — it made it more convenient, but it did not improve it. The first big wave of crypto innovation is all of the stuff that happened with secure communications — PGP and all that, secure email. Does anybody feel like their communications are genuinely secure? Nope. You don’t trust the software you’re using, you don’t trust the hardware. Most of that innovation was also lost. So if we’re going to make this round of crypto innovation stick, if we are going to make the blockchain work, if we’re going to get power of “These are my keys, nobody else can pretend to be me and nobody else can read my comms…” then we have to change our values. We have to go back to the original vision of Ethereum, we have to focus on the incorruptibility more than the decentralisation, and we have to absolutely stop tolerating the scams. If you see somebody on stage pitching something that you think is a scam, then you call it out, you do what you can to stop it. We need to be Judge Dredd bringing law to the Cursed&nbsp;Earth.</p><blockquote>If we’re going to make this round of crypto innovation stick… then we have to change our&nbsp;values</blockquote><p>Tolerating the scams means giving up on the blockchain because while scams are allowed to thrive unopposed they metastasise and consume all the available space. One reason people largely gave up on email is that for every email from family, there were 10 from Nigerian princes, alleged friends needing you to urgently send money (and possibly lawyers and guns) to get them out of a jam, cute strangers wanting to be your girlfriend, and so on. The same with “The Artist Formerly Known as Twitter”, people are leaving in droves because of Nazis, dropshippers and people shilling blockchain scams. No one is going to find it worthwhile to stay in a space where 90% of the activity is scammers eating people alive, even if it does have the potential to revolutionise the&nbsp;world.</p><blockquote>Tolerating the scams means giving up on the blockchain</blockquote><p>We should be revolutionising the world, we should be operating the world’s most honest trade environment — that’s the ETH brand promise. If we can deliver on the Brand Promise of Ethereum: “incorruptible transactions” we have friends all over the world. Everybody that wants to do honest business, to buy and sell in a transparent, honest and fair way, is our friend. You can’t get incorruptible trade with VISA cards and bank wires, so Mattereum is out here building the bridges necessary for incorruptible trade and our objectives are:</p><p>* Save&nbsp;Ethereum</p><p>* Use Ethereum to save the&nbsp;world</p><p>An incorruptible system is a safe system, and the fundamental thing people need is to be safe, on the blockchain, just as much as anywhere&nbsp;else.</p><p>We’re going to need your support to make this happen. I’m hoping to rapidly scale our operations fast in 2024 and bring near-incorruptible systems for real world asset transactions to all of&nbsp;you.</p> Be realistic!

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p><p>In our Artificial Intelligence (AI) journey, much like the timeless question "Quo vadis, Domine?"-meaning "Where are you going, Lord?"-we find ourselves at a crossroads, questioning the direction of our technological trajectory. So as we traverse the AI landscape, we should ask ourselves, "Where is our AI going, and what are the implications for us?"</p>
<p>At this critical juncture, when the path forward may seem uncertain, well-structured legal frameworks provide a basic roadmap. These frameworks not only provide clarity on the permissible boundaries of AI development and application, but also serve as foresight tools that anticipate potential challenges and pitfalls. As I argued in a previous <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/leal/balancing-innovation-and-regulation">blog</a>, law generates a dialectical process wherein the tech industry, responding to legal constraints, presents its antithesis by seeking new solutions, ultimately leading to a synthesis that reconciles legal requirements and fosters human agency.</p>
<p>Consequently, nations around the world are trying to figure out how to adapt to and capitalize on these evolving technologies. Unfortunately, while the impact of AI is global, many countries have yet to publish comprehensive AI regulations and policies. This gap presents both challenges and opportunities.</p>
<p>On the one hand, embracing standardized regulations could foster global collaboration, addressing ethical concerns and privacy issues. On the other hand, the absence of clear guidelines may hinder the progress of global AI initiatives, potentially leading to misuse, fragmented approaches, and inconsistencies.</p>
<p>Therefore, by exploring and comparing recently published AI regulations, individuals and organizations can proactively navigate the evolving landscape. This approach allows them to stay ahead of the curve, respond resiliently to change, and integrate practices and solutions that may not have been adopted in their home countries.</p>
 Implications of the EU’s AI Act 
<p>On December 8, 2023, after more than 36 hours of negotiations, a political agreement was reached on the EU's Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act. The AI Act adopts a "risk-based approach" that prioritizes the regulation of the use of AI over the technology itself, with the aim of protecting European values and the rule of law. The <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20231206IPR15699/artificial-intelligence-act-deal-on-comprehensive-rules-for-trustworthy-ai">legislation</a> sets clear obligations based on the potential risks and impact of AI systems.</p>
<p>Key provisions include:</p>
 
 Prohibition of biometric categorization systems using sensitive characteristics (for example, political, religious, philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation, race) 
 Restriction on untargeted scraping of facial images for facial recognition databases 
 Ban on emotion recognition in workplaces and educational institutions 
 Prohibition of social scoring based on personal characteristics 
 Prohibition of AI exploiting vulnerabilities based on age, disability, or socioeconomic status 
 Use of biometric identification systems (RBI) in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes 
 Citizens' right to launch complaints and receive explanations about decisions based on high-risk AI systems 
 Transparency requirements for general-purpose AI systems, including technical documentation and compliance with EU copyright law 
 
<p>The AI Act focuses on risk assessments for AI systems, with obligations increasing based on the potential risk to individual rights or health. The agreement introduces transparency requirements for all general-purpose AI models and imposes tougher regulations on more powerful models. In essence, the EU AI Act strategically adapts its regulatory intensity based on the perceived risk levels associated with different AI systems.</p>
<p>By doing so, the legislation seeks to strike a balance between fostering innovation, ensuring transparency, and mitigating potential harms arising from advanced AI technologies. This nuanced approach reflects the EU's commitment to responsible AI governance and aligns with its broader initiatives to establish a trustworthy and ethical AI landscape.</p>
<p>The AI Act won't take effect until two years after final approval by European lawmakers, expected sometime in early 2024. Moreover, the AI Act will apply to the EU's nearly 450 million residents, but experts say its impact could be felt far beyond that because of the EU's leadership role in creating regulations and policies that serve as a global standard.</p>
<p>The law's global influence is expected to extend as a blueprint for other nations navigating AI regulations. However, by not fully banning live facial recognition, the EU's decision has drawn <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/12/eu-blocs-decision-to-not-ban-public-mass-surveillance-in-ai-act-sets-a-devastating-global-precedent/">criticism</a>, with Amnesty International deeming it a "hugely missed opportunity" and expressing concerns about potential global repercussions, particularly in the realm of human rights and civil liberties.</p>
 Decoding the American AI Regulatory Landscape 
<p>The U.S. AI regulatory landscape is characterized by a mix of existing federal and state laws, frameworks from various federal agencies, and a growing number of state-specific laws. It is also characterized by a decentralized approach, in contrast to the EU's top-down approach.</p>
<p>The legislative approach to AI is centered on an "incentive-based" strategy, with policymakers seeking to create conditions that will retain AI developers. The emphasis on incentives reflects a concerted effort to prevent the potential shift of AI development to competing nations, highlighting the delicate balance between promoting innovation and avoiding national security issues.</p>
<p>Despite the polarized and challenging political environment in the U.S. in recent years, both parties in Congress have consistently supported AI governance efforts. This bipartisan commitment reflects a shared recognition of the transformative potential and strategic importance of AI.</p>
<p>While the EU's AI law is in its final stages, the U.S. is unlikely to pass a comprehensive national AI law in the near future. Instead, a flurry of executive actions is expected. The outcome may not be a broad national AI law, but rather a nuanced, domain-specific regulatory landscape that navigates the complexities of AI governance.</p>
<p>For example, in October 2023, U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/">order</a> on AI. The order mandates prominent AI developers to disclose safety test results and pertinent information to the government. Furthermore, government agencies will establish standards to guarantee the safety of AI tools before their public release, accompanied by guidelines for labeling AI-generated content.</p>
<p>Biden's directive extends the momentum generated by voluntary commitments from major tech companies, such as Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, which had pledged to ensure the safety of their products before launch. In addition, the U.S. government is expected to increase spending on AI and AI research, especially in the defense and intelligence sectors.</p>
<p>At KuppingerCole, we foresee that while private companies may implement their "responsible AI" initiatives, potential AI trade frictions with the EU may arise. Moreover, concerns linger about enforceability and binding measures, with critics highlighting potential disparities with the more stringent measures adopted by the EU in the recently adopted AI Act.</p>
 Balancing Acts: Concluding Thoughts 
<p>The dominance of major AI players in the US raises concerns about the delayed availability of powerful AI models in the EU, potentially impacting technological and economic development in the region. This dichotomy also underscores the global competition in AI, with China and Russia potentially adopting different, and less democratic-oriented, approaches. The question arises: can safety be adequately ensured through legal frameworks alone, especially when considering the divergent strategies employed by major players in the AI arena?</p>
<p>Exploring this critical angle prompts a deeper reflection on the effectiveness of legal frameworks in balancing safety concerns with the rapid development and deployment of advanced AI technologies, especially in the context of varying global approaches. The global AI debate involves geopolitical competition, national security, and economic competitiveness. Therefore, the answer to ensuring safety in AI may involve a multifaceted approach that goes beyond legal regulations, incorporating international collaboration, ethical standards, and shared best practices</p>
<p>Despite differing approaches to AI regulation, both the US and EU share the common goal of ensuring safe and democratic AI, fostering the potential for aligned transatlantic regulatory approaches. The EU-US Trade and Technology Council demonstrates early success in collaborating on trustworthy AI metrics and methodologies, emphasizing the need for further alignment and knowledge sharing. It is therefore essential that the EU and the U.S. align their approaches in key areas, given their combined influence on global AI governance.</p>

We will answer them below. But first, one a backgrounder to provide&nbsp;context.</p> Background: Focus of Ocean Predictoor / DF&nbsp;Team <p>The main goal of the Ocean Predictoor / DF team right now is: make it easy &amp; obvious to earn $ as a trader, using Predictoor.</p>  Once it happens, there will be strong organic demand for the feeds, which in turn drives sales, which in turn drives predictoor income  This also means we’re spending less time on other potential things: detailed blogs, AMAs, webapp, analytics. Focus&nbsp;focus.  In short, $ success for traders will drive success everywhere else.   Questions &amp;&nbsp;Answers <p>Here are the Q’s, along with our A’s. Some answers won’t have full detail; that’s because we’re focusing on the “make it easy to make $”. Success there will drive the&nbsp;rest.</p><blockquote>How is a transaction counted?</blockquote><p>We submitted a list of smart contract addresses to dappradar.com. Whenever one of those has a tx against it, it’s&nbsp;counted.</p><p>The addresses we submitted are: the Ocean datatoken contracts for each of the 20 prediction feeds, plus a couple&nbsp;more.</p><blockquote>Are the Ocean predictoor ‘farming’ rewards part of the transactions if so how much do they account&nbsp;for?</blockquote><p>Payout of Predictoor Data Farming rewards is a small fraction of txs. However the $ incentive is likely a key driver for near-term traction.</p><p>If you’re a predictoor submitting prediction transactions, you can make $&nbsp;via:</p>  Organic sales  Sales from Predictoor Data Farming&nbsp;rewards  Others’ stake slashed when they are&nbsp;wrong.  <p>Of these:</p>  (3) evens out to about zero if your accuracy is about the same as others, and your <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/rewards-mechanisms-of-ocean-predictoor-6f76c942baf7">stake doesn’t exceed your cut of expected&nbsp;sales</a>.  (2) is currently the biggest amount. We expect this in the early days, as it’s kickstarting the usage. (How to see: Compare “Autobot: Volumes” for all $ sales, to DF $ budget in Predictoor DF&nbsp;docs)  (1) will ultimately be the biggest amount by far, once it becomes easy &amp; obvious to earn $ as a&nbsp;trader.  <p><a href="https://autobotocean.com/volumes">“AutoBot: Volumes” page</a> shows volumes for each&nbsp;feed.</p><blockquote>How many unique addresses are paying for&nbsp;feeds?</blockquote><p>We haven’t computed analytics for that yet. You *could* query the subgraph for yourself, see link&nbsp;above.</p><blockquote>Are there return&nbsp;users?</blockquote><p>For predictoors: Yes. In fact, it seems to be a high % predictoors returning, ie low churn.&nbsp;See</p><p>For traders: We haven’t computed analytics for that yet. What will really make a difference is traders easily &amp; obviously earning $; hence our focus on&nbsp;that.</p><blockquote>Is the overall number of users increasing?</blockquote><p>Yes. See <a href="https://dappradar.com/dapp/ocean-predictoor">“DappRadar&nbsp;: Predictoor” page</a>, the “UAW” line on the plot. UAW = Unique Active&nbsp;Wallets.</p><p>&gt; How much revenue are these transactions giving to the Ocean Protocol?</p><p>Fees details: (from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/predictoor/pdr-parameters">Predictoor docs</a>)<br>- 0.1% community swap fee<br>- 20% to Ocean Protocol Foundation. (Will be used to further drive Predictoor, and to burn&nbsp;OCEAN.)</p><blockquote>What numbers would need to be met before another say 100 price feeds are added to predictoor (1, 15, 30 min feeds), more token pairs including Ocean (helping increase Ocean volume)&nbsp;etc.</blockquote><p>As mentioned above, we see that the biggest driver of traction will be traders making $. Our focus is to make that easy &amp; obvious. As part of our work, we are exploring other trading venues &amp; pairs. We’re also professionalizing our internal data engineering pipeline, and starting to build an analytics app inspired by my <a href="http://www.trent.st/">previous work</a> on Computer-Aided Design. All of this is already open-source; you can track our progress in&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend">GitHub</a>.</p><p>Once “making $” is established, then we will scale up accordingly.

That’s great news! It’s the sign of a growing ecosystem of predictoors and&nbsp;traders.</p><p>To really take this to the next level, the Ocean Predictoor / DF team is working to make it easy &amp; obvious to earn $ as a trader, using Predictoor.

<p>On November 8th, the European Council and Parliament reached a provisional agreement on the new framework for a European digital identity (eID).</p>
<p>Over a decade in the making, we Europeans are now finally taking a fundamental step so that all EU citizens can have a unique and secure digital identity. This is a key advancement for the European Union to be a global leader in the digital identity field, enabling all 27 member states to reap the benefits of digitalisation.</p>
<p>The new European digital identity wallets will enable all Europeans to access online services throughout Europe with their own national digital ID, without having to use private identification methods or unnecessarily sharing personal data. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) principles help to assure that only information that needs to be shared will be shared. Security and privacy are paramount to any electronic identity ecosystem, and I have previously highlighted some of the concerns and trade-offs in the first of this EUDI blog series; <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/standards/introducing-european-digital-identity-eudi/" title="Introducing European Digital Identity (EUDI): The Future of Secure and Accessible Identity">Introducing European Digital Identity (EUDI): The Future of Secure and Accessible Identity</a>.</p>
 Understanding the EUDI Wallet Pilots 
<p>Running in parallel with the legislative track are the actual pilots of the EUDI wallets and end-user services. This is a great advantage from many perspectives, not least striving to avoid the fate of eIDAS v1, which suffered from the ‘chicken-and-egg’ problem from the start. It is surprising how the pilots have flown under the radar despite there being over 250 private corporations and public authorities participating in the four largest pilots alone, supported with €46 million investment from the EU Commission, as discussed in the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_3556">Provisional Political Agreement EU Commission article</a>.</p>
 EUDI Pilot Categories 
<p>The pilots can be broadly divided into three categories: User Authentication, e-Signing, and Website Authentication or Qualified Web Authentication Certificates (QWACs). As the last category is outside European control and looking increasingly unimplementable, I will focus initially on the User Authentication and E-Signing.</p>
<p>Beside the QWACs, a wide range of use cases are part of the EUDI pilot projects. These include:</p>
 
 Using the wallets to host user credentials for accessing government services 
 Activating SIM cards for mobile network services – in those countries which forbid anonymous SIM cards 
 Signing B2C and G2C contracts 
 Facilitating travel via digital driving licences and identity documents 
 Presenting educational credentials previously standardised under the Bologna agreement 
 
<p>All together, these use cases highlight the broad applicability of the EUDI. Basic user authentication is but a small part of its capabilities.</p>
<p>The European Commission has acknowledged that a digital identity can be used for much more than authentication to existing services. It frequently plays a part in the EUDI’s wide capabilities, as convenience features even at the highest level. For example, in the <a href="https://state-of-the-union.ec.europa.eu/state-union-2020_en">2020 State of the Union address</a>, the European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, highlighted how users will be able to use the EUDI wallets to file tax returns, check into hotels, rent cars, and securely open bank accounts across borders. Looking further, a <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/groups/pdf/efip/Digital_identity_update.pdf">European Central Bank policy brief on the European Digital Identity Framework</a> suggests that the EUDI wallet will include support for the Digital Euro.</p>
 The Four Major EUDI Pilots 
<p>There are several multi-year pilot projects running, of which the four largest are introduced below. In the first phase, which is currently ongoing, the pilots are centred on individual identities and the most common B2C use cases. After the launch of the EUDI for private persons, it’s expected that it will (at last) be the turn of organisational identity.</p>
 <a href="https://eudiwalletconsortium.org/">EWC</a> – EU Digital Identity Wallet Consortium 
<p>The EWC pilot is coordinated by Sweden with the involvement of 18 Member States and Ukraine. It is a major undertaking that involves 15 public entities and 40 private organisations. The pilot is centred around travel and tests the storage and display of digital travel credentials and instant payments. First becoming an alternative to, and later replacing, European passports is not a realistic goal at present. But since a national identity card is a valid travel document within the EU, accepting EUDI as a travel document within the Schengen zone (the 27 European countries that have removed the need for passports and many other types of border control at their mutual borders) would be a much more realistic development.</p>
<p>The Digital Euro will be a central component of the EUDI instant payment system, scheduled to launch in 2027+. The Digital Euro seeks to bring instant electronic payments to the masses. However, it will not be as big of a change in the Nordics as in other countries, due to electronic payments already being the default. The Euro represents not value but debt; most of the European money supply exists purely in the digital domain already.</p>
 <a href="https://www.digital-identity-wallet.eu/">POTENTIAL</a> – Pilots for European Digital Identity Wallet Consortium 
<p>The POTENTIAL Pilot is coordinated by Germany and France with the involvement of 17 Member States and Ukraine. It is the largest of the pilots and involves over 50 public entities and over 80 private organisations. The pilot will use the EUDI wallet for several use cases around user authentication including; accessing government services, opening a bank account, e-prescriptions and Digital Driving Licences.</p>
<p>The Digital Driving License is a good example of how having a widely available, strong digital identity opens up a whole range of possibilities for enriching the identity with additional attributes. In this case, using the Digital Driving License to operate motor vehicles within the EU. Every country already has a database of valid licenses granted by the national authorities, so enabling the end user to present this data alongside their digital identity replicates the function of a dedicated physical driver’s license card. This makes tasks like car rental a faster and less error-prone process. It also allows end users to prove both their identity and their vehicle operation licenses online, without the need to send photos of their documents alongside selfies holding those documents to the third party – a goldmine for any identity thief.</p>
 <a href="https://www.nobidconsortium.com/">NOBID</a> – Nordic-Baltic eID Wallet Consortium 
<p>Interestingly the NOBID Pilot is led by Norway, a non-EU country, with eight member states also involved. Overall, it involves 5 public entities and over 15 private organisations.</p>
<p>The pilot will focus on a single use case: the use of the EUDI wallet for the authorisation of payments for products and services by the end user. Unlike the EWC, it will concentrate on addressing the issuance of wallets, the provision of payment means by financial institutions, and the secure and convenient acceptance of payment in a retail (B2C) context.</p>
 <a href="https://www.dc4eu.eu/">DC4EU</a> – Digital Credentials for Europe Consortium 
<p>The DC4EU Pilot is led by Spain and involves nearly all other member states, as the pilot trials the use of the EUDI wallet in the educational sector and the social security domain. The pilot project aligns with the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSI/ESSPASS">European Social Security Pass</a> and <a href="https://europa.eu/europass/en/node/2128">the European Learning Model</a>.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.dc4eu.eu/consortium/">tens of universities</a> from around Europe together with government officials and research associations, the pilot is clearly focused on the higher education sector. Technically it is very different from the other pilots, as it trials the use of the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSI/Home">European Blockchain Services Infrastructure</a> (EBSI) in the context of the EUDI wallet. Educational records could be especially suitable for a distributed database model, because educational degrees are revoked only under extraordinary circumstances and the range of educational institutions is very broad – from small private institutions to massive state-run universities and polytechnics. The project is scheduled to run until April 2025, and they also maintain a handy list of <a href="https://www.dc4eu.eu/outputs/">related acronyms</a> on the project site.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EUDI pilots are well underway and will continue to late 2024 with some even heading into 2025. It is clear then that the original 2024 launch date for the EUDI is not tenable, at least when talking about a mass launch. But I do hope that by this time next year, there will be a limited release available in order to truly start exploring the capabilities and practical features of the EUDI ecosystem. The potential scale of the EUDI is immense but is certainly doable – as the credit card industry has proven, for example.</p>
<p>In addition, I cannot wait to see <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/organisation-identity/" title="organisation identity">organisation identity</a>, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/general/the-value-of-identity-context/" title="identity context ">identity context </a>and right to represent included in the EUDI Pilots as soon as possible, but perhaps this is one of the occasions where even in the modern world it’s worthwhile to measure twice and cut once.</p>

 We sit down with our Brazilian-born, Regional Senior Sales Manager at IDnow, Francisco Martins to discuss what’s next for the Brazilian gambling market, and how gambling platforms can prepare for the new era of gambling regulation. 



 



 In December 2023, the Brazilian Senate finally passed its gambling regulations for sports betting and online casinos. What took so long?&nbsp; 



<p>Until this week, there had been no enforceable or documented Brazilian gambling regulations due to a blanket ban on gambling in the country since the 1940s.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before the ban, however, gambling was a prevalent pastime, and casinos were big businesses that pulled in celebrities worldwide. The ban, introduced in 1946, came from President Eurico Gaspar Dutra; a man heavily influenced by his wife, who was a devout Catholic, and thought poorly of games of chance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Continued pressure from the general populace saw some restrictions lifted in intervening years, such as:&nbsp;</p>



  Legalization of a non-commercial bingo in 1971.<br>  Legalization of horse racing and the betting associated with it in 1984.<br>  Creation of a state-owned lottery system in 1996.&nbsp;  



<p>Poker was exempt from the 1946 ban as it was deemed a game of skill. Alongside the above, social betting and fantasy betting are legal under Brazilian gambling laws; however, they are entirely unregulated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ban was met with strong resistance, and underground gambling soon became a thing. The game of choice to this day is Jogo do Bicho, a simple lottery-style game that began in 1892. Jogo do Bicho began as a fun game played outside a zoo but is now an unofficial yet popular numbers game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Brazilian gambling restrictions only ever applied to gambling operators headquartered in Brazil, the domestic ban essentially provided a window of opportunity operators headquartered abroad to target Brazilian customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Introducing this new regulatory framework has therefore been fraught with difficulties for new and existing operators across the globe. To help meet some of these challenges, a nonprofit organization called ABRADIE was created to ensure the Brazilian gambling and iGaming landscape remained safe and free from corruption.</p>



 What would you say was the main catalyst for change? 



<p>I think there were two main reasons for change: public opinion, and the realization that the Brazilian economy was missing out on major tax revenue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding the first, as online gambling and iGaming grew in popularity, so too did public sentiment toward regulation revision. People began to regard the regulations as archaic, and openly challenged that online gambling should be exempt. In a way, it was, as online gambling and iGaming have been allowed in Brazil, provided the operators were headquartered outside the country. In 2018, the winds of change began to blow in Brazil’s way, and a plan was proposed to introduce new gaming legislation in Brazil. The proposed project allowed basic fixed odds sports betting, but with the caveat that actual legislation was a work in progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The income generated from online gambling in Brazil is predicted to be more than <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/eservices/online-gambling/brazil#:~:text=Revenue%20in%20the%20Online%20Gambling,US%243.23bn%20by%202027.">$1.5 billion in 2023</a> – an increase of over 200% from 2022. Understandably, that’s a lot of tax revenue that the Brazilian authorities are missing out on. Predictions now point toward a sustained period of rapid growth. The Brazilian economy is struggling (having dropped from the <a href="https://brazilian.report/liveblog/2022/03/04/world-biggest-economies/">world’s 7th largest to 13th in just over a decade</a>), and the revenue boost from opening the country up to the iGaming sector is too good to not take advantage of.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s also worth mentioning that besides the economic boost, the regulation will also have a positive effect on:&nbsp;</p>



  Safer gambling: Invariably, when regulations are deemed necessary, it is an indication of inherent risk in the industry, for example fraud and other criminal activities. Enforcing strict and well-documented regulations will make the Brazilian gaming space safer and more secure.  



  Attract investors: Establishing online gambling and sports betting regulations opens the Brazil market to new and diverse investors. Setting a framework for gambling regulations ensures a competitive and fair landscape, for new and old entrants, while preventing companies from running unethical practices and promotions to build their iGaming brands.  



 What are your thoughts on the new regulations? Do you think they are clear enough? 



<p>The regulations for sports betting and online casinos are a significant step toward Brazil’s modern online gambling landscape. Casinos will also remain illegal for the time being, but further changes are expected in the coming years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think the ban on bonus bets is an interesting decision. Sign-up bonuses are often used by operators to entice customers to register for their platform, however they are also exploited by criminals. [Read more about <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/bonus-abuse-gambling/">bonus abuse in our blog here</a>].&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new rules also prohibit companies without a license from advertising. The content of advertisements must follow new guidelines, and any company found to be in breach of guidelines will have it removed from the internet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What I do think is smart are the new payment rules that have been designed to try and dismantle Brazil’s huge illegal gambling market. Only operators authorized by the Central Bank can offer payment services, and players are only able to send money to a bank account that is headquartered in Brazil.</p>



 So, what’s new? How can operators comply with the new Brazilian gambling regulations? 



<p>The first requirement is for an operator to be based in Brazil. Foreign operators will be barred from offering regulated gambling. This will ensure the Brazilian government is able to collect the taxable revenue (operators will be liable to pay 12% revenue tax.) Operators are also mandated to meet a range of integrity, responsibility and honesty requirements as proposed by the ABRADIE and IBJR and are therefore required to be a member of a sports integrity body.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other requirements operators will be forced to comply with include having a minimum value of share capital and being able to pass several technical requirements.</p>



<p>Players will also be pleased to learn that there will be 15% tax on the amount that bettors win, which is a major reduction on the 30% tax that Brazilian Minister of Finance Fernando Haddad originally said he wanted.</p>



<p>Operators that wish to comply with the new sports betting regulations can do so by getting a Brazilian gambling license, which will set them back BR$30 million (US$6.1 million) for five years of validity. Learn more about the complexities of the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-gambling-license-structure/#:~:text=The%20only%20forms%20of%20permitted,to%20be%20active%20in%20Brazil.">Brazilian gambling license structure in our blog, here</a>.</p>



 What challenges do you foresee regarding the opening of the Brazilian market? 



<p>Introducing sports betting regulations in Brazil will not be without its challenges and risks. As the illegal and unregulated gambling industry is already thoroughly established, one of the primary issues that must be confronted is underground gambling and removing the risk of fraud or match-fixing. Brazilian sports have seen their share of scandals and controversies that would make anybody nervous about entering this newly opened market without a rigid and protective framework.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The world of iGaming is driven by the financial aspect. The challenge will be to balance the economic benefits of online betting legislation with the social responsibility to keep everybody safe. Safety relates to being safe from fraud and other financial crime, but also to ensure they engage in responsible gambling. </p>



 How does Brazil’s gambling regulations compare to other markets? 



<p>The best way to understand how to thrive in a new market is to study the landscape of existing markets. The<a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/"> UK Gambling Commission</a> has created an established model that makes an excellent study for the Brazilian authorities. Malta is another location that has created a great regulatory model to tackle the challenges of being a smaller location with a heavy reliance on international business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each country in LATAM is adopting and updating its regulations at a different place. Argentina, Bolivia, and Nicaragua are three countries with various existing regulations and are actively working to expand them. Mexico is another that has the framework in place for rapid iGaming growth and would present good case studies, offering realistic region-proof market entry strategies that can be easily customized for the Brazilian landscape.</p>



 What role will technology play in the&nbsp;new era of online gambling in Brazil? 



<p>As further regulatory changes come into play, and new global markets continue to slowly but surely open, one key way that operators can prepare for the future is by incorporating robust identity verification technology. This enables operators to conduct thorough <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">Know Your Customer checks</a> and process international and local documents and data, such as the Cadastro de Pessoa Física (Brazilian tax number).&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Brazil, gaming operators in Brazil must now adopt identification procedures&nbsp;that verify players’&nbsp;identity. As such, the use of facial recognition technology in identifying the identities of bettors and the amount of  taxation to be paid will become standard practice. Operators must also be able to verify and validate the authenticity of ID, by comparing with available data from public and private databases. </p>



<p>Navigating the online world and covering the range of potential issues is mission-critical for anybody looking to create a new set of iGaming regulations. An online business is present in many countries and, therefore, must be aware of and compliant with the relevant regulations and legislations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Working with a solid system that can accommodate the different requirements of different regulatory bodies is essential. Anti-money-laundering compliant identity verification and fraud prevention are hot topics and even more prevalent when entering a new market that has been active but unregulated for several years.<a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/south-america/)"> IDnow has the tools</a> that help make the transition into the Brazilian iGaming space as seamless as possible.</p>



 What’s next for Brazil’s gambling regime? 



<p>Revenue is already up by 200% from 2022 and is expected to double again by 2027. As the industry expands and technology advances, regulations must adapt to remain ahead of the curve, where possible, to maintain player and operator safety. As these laws change and people’s views toward online gambling evolve, so will the different definitions of what is covered. Many Brazilians would love to see casinos return.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By implementing a Brazilian gambling regulation process, the initial upturn for the economy will be immediate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The road ahead of the iGaming culture in Brazil is not without its challenges. Initiating change takes time and knowledge.&nbsp;The online gaming sphere is fraught with complexities, such as ensuring that a solid multi-jurisdictional identity verification platform is in place to protect anything entering the space. Solid identity-proofing systems are imperative for anybody looking to enter the emerging LATAM market, as each new jurisdiction will bring its own requirements. Having a dependable system programmed to deal with a region’s requirements means setting a solid foundation for safe and stable growth in that market.</p>

 Owning Your Digital Identity in the Age of Self-Sovereignty 



<p>Imagine a world where your digital self isn’t imprisoned within the walled gardens of tech giants and government databases. No more surrendering your data for a flicker of online convenience. Instead, picture a universe where you hold the keys to your identity, selectively unlocking doors with verifiable credentials, navigating the digital landscape with unparalleled privacy and security. This isn’t a utopian dream; it’s the dawn of decentralized digital identity (DDID) and self-sovereign identity (SSI), revolutions quietly reshaping the digital landscape.</p>



<p>DDID and SSI stand in stark contrast to the traditional identity model controlled by centralized authorities. In this outdated paradigm, our digital footprints are scattered across the web, vulnerable to breaches and subject to the whims of corporations and governments. DDID and SSI empower individuals to reclaim ownership of their identity data, building a fortress of privacy brick by blockchain brick.</p>



 Breaking Free from the Siloed Self: 



<p>At the heart of this revolution lies the concept of verifiable credentials: tamper-proof digital badges issued by trusted entities (think universities, banks, or healthcare providers) and stored securely on your own device or decentralized networks. No more handing over your entire identity to access a service; with SSI, you simply present the relevant credential, demonstrating your eligibility without revealing anything else.</p>



<p>Imagine applying for a loan without your entire financial history laid bare, or renting an apartment without relinquishing your social media life. SSI grants you granular control, empowering you to choose what you share and with whom.</p>



 The Global Band of Identity Solutions: 



<p>The DDID (Decentralized Digital Identity) and SSI (Self Sovereign Identity) symphony is playing on a global stage, with diverse protocols harmonizing their efforts:</p>



 
 Canada:&nbsp;SecureKey Technologies leads the charge, forging an SSI network powered by blockchain, where governments, corporations, and individuals collaborate to build a privacy-centric future. 



 USA:&nbsp;The Sovrin Foundation champions SSI adoption, while NIST sets the beat of digital identity management through standardized guidelines. 



 Europe:&nbsp;The SSI eIDAS Bridge project acts as a conductor, bridging the gap between traditional eIDAS infrastructure and the dynamic world of decentralized identities. 



 Latin America:&nbsp;Extrimian, powered by the nimble notes of zkSync, partners with QuarkID, a versatile instrument enabling users to manage their credentials on a secure, multi-chain platform. 



 Asia:&nbsp;Japan takes center stage with the “My Number Card” project, showcasing the power of SSI at the national level. 



 Australia and New Zealand:&nbsp;The DTA pilots SSI for government services, testing the melody in real-world scenarios. 
 



 Challenges of the Decentralized Identity System: 



<p>While the tech behind DDID and SSI is captivating, challenges remain. Standardizing the language of identity across different protocols is crucial to ensure harmony. Navigating the evolving regulatory landscape requires careful orchestration. And encouraging individuals to embrace this new paradigm demands education and trust-building.</p>



<p>Yet, the potential melody outweighs the dissonance. As awareness grows and technical advancements diminish the volume of challenges, DDID and SSI are poised to rewrite the identity score.</p>



 Extrimian and QuarkID: A Latin American Protocol 



<p>In Latin America, Extrimian and <a href="https://quarkid.org">QuarkID </a>showcase the power of collaboration. <a href="https://extrimian.io">Extrimian </a>leverages <a href="https://zksync.io/">zkSync</a>‘s zero-knowledge proofs, playing a quiet yet powerful note in privacy preservation. QuarkID, a dynamic multi-chain protocol, offers a versatile platform for managing credentials, empowering individuals to take control of their digital selves.</p>



<p>Their partnership, like a captivating duet, brings the promise of SSI closer to reality in Argentina, demonstrating the global reach and transformative potential of this identity revolution.</p>



 The future of Self-Sovereignty: 



<p>The future of identity is decentralized, with individuals conducting the symphony of their digital lives. DDID and SSI offer a transformative score, where privacy and security harmonize with control and convenience. As Extrimian and QuarkID exemplify, innovative collaborations are fueling this revolution, ensuring that every individual can claim their rightful place as the protagonist of their digital narrative.</p>



<p>So, put down the baton of centralized control and pick up the instrument of self-sovereignty. The future of identity is yours to compose, one verifiable credential at a time.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving in the U.S. signals the start of the holiday shopping season, stretching all the way to Christmas. During this time, businesses offer various deals and incentives, triggering a surge in orders, deliveries, and returns of goods. Unfortunately, this season is also a prime opportunity for attackers seeking to capitalize on unsuspecting individuals, employing identity-based cyberattacks such as phishing to compromise users’ credentials and take control of their accounts.</p>
<p>In fact, the <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2023/PSA231115#:~:text=The%20FBI%20warns%20of%20criminals,in%20losses%20over%20%2473%20million.">FBI reported almost 12,000 victims reporting non-payment/non-delivery scams during the 2022 holiday shopping season, resulting in losses over $73 million</a>. This number doesn’t account for organizations that have experienced breaches due to employees falling victim to phishing while using corporate devices for online shopping. Additionally, it doesn’t acknowledge the number of victims who never report these incidents. While education on phishing scams and how to stay safe is a necessary step in helping protect users against account takeover (ATO) and other identity-based attacks, it is not a foolproof way to secure your users and their data.</p>
<p>Most organizations have implemented some form of multi-factor authentication (MFA), which is usually based on SMS/email one-time passcode (OTP) or mobile soft tokens to improve security for their users and customers. At the same time, attackers are becoming increasingly sophisticated, using tools such as phishing-as-a-service and generative AI. These technologies enable the creation of phishing emails and campaigns that look alarmingly authentic, often evading the most well-trained and vigilant security-aware individuals. In addition, MFA bypass attacks like SIM swap and MFA fatigue/prompt bombing render traditional MFA options vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>Organizations need to implement phishing-resistant and MFA bypass-resistant multi-factor authentication to protect their users and customers.</p>
<p>Types of Holiday Scams</p>
<p>Most holiday phishing attacks exploit users’ distractions amid holiday festivities and shopping. This leads to financial losses and identity theft, causing long-term repercussions such as damage to credit scores, mortgages, and more.</p>
 
 Fake promotions – These are emails or advertisements that offer attractive discounts, leading victims to phishing sites that replicate genuine retail websites. Users unknowingly make purchases using their credit cards, only to never receive the items they paid for. 
 Delivery notifications – As online holiday shopping increases, cybercriminals exploit it by sending fake delivery notifications. These messages pressure victims to click on links to resolve supposed issues, such as delivery address or payment of additional fees, often leading to compromised credentials. 
 Fake charities – Preying on the goodwill of people during the holidays, attackers create deceptive websites impersonating charities to solicit donations. 
 Fake order receipts – Cybercriminals mimic well-known, reputable retailers by sending fake order receipts through email. These emails contain links supposedly allowing the recipient to cancel or modify their order, tricking them into visiting phishing sites where their credentials are compromised. 
 
<p>While most attacks are targeted toward consumers, organizations should also be alert. Employees often use corporate devices such as laptops and mobile phones for holiday shopping, potentially risking the compromise of business accounts and applications. In addition, many users reuse passwords across personal and corporate accounts, making them susceptible to credential stuffing attacks.</p>
<p>Phishing-Resistant Passwordless MFA</p>
<p>Certificate-based authentication (CBA) with Bluetooth proximity is the highest assurance phishing-resistant MFA option available in the market. It is the most recommended approach to securing access to organizational resources and data for users including employees, contractors, and B2B customers.</p>
<p>For most consumer use cases, passkeys are starting to gain adoption as the phishing-resistant MFA that utilizes a user’s smartphone to utilize cryptographic key pairs when authenticating users to applications or services. Passkeys are generally multi-device enabled with the private key stored across a user’s device ecosystem and in their platform’s cloud account (i.e. iCloud, etc.).</p>
<p>Risk-Based Adaptive Authentication (RBA)</p>
<p>While phishing-resistant passwordless MFA provides enhanced security and protection against ATO attacks, enforcing a risk-based approach can help add additional layers of security while balancing security with user experience, only introducing friction in the process when necessary. Risk inputs like travel velocity, behavioral biometrics, and other external risk feeds such as threat feeds, etc. can help evaluate the risk score of a user during an authentication event, allowing for access to be blocked or requiring the user to use a different 2FA based on risk score thresholds.</p>
<p>Identity Verification (IDV)</p>
<p>Another common entry point for attackers is during password/MFA reset, where they can gain access to a user’s account by triggering a reset and adding additional authenticators to the account. Using identity verification solutions can help combat these attacks. Requiring users to verify their identity with physical credentials such as a driver’s license, passport, etc. can add another layer of defense in securing users against ATO attacks. IDV as a step-up authentication can help protect high-value transactions or out-of-policy/out-of-compliance users.</p>
<p>Combining phishing-resistant MFA with RBA and IDV offers a layered approach with defense in depth against identity-based attacks.

 Making a Human Rights Based Approach to Personal Data&nbsp;Work <p>We (Mydex CIC) have just published a new Paper on how to practically implement <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/">a human rights approach to personal data</a>. It’s important because implementing a human rights to personal data does two things: it involves implementing a human rights approach to the person that the data relates to and to the service that the data is being used to deliver. It’s key to actually making human rights happen on the ground, day-to-day rather than just talk about (which tends to happen quite&nbsp;often).</p><p>You might think that peoples’ rights in relation to their data is already covered, dealt with by legislation such as GDPR. To be sure, GDPR lays important foundations creating a number of rights such as the right to access, to data portability, to transparency in how, to object to processing and to be forgotten, for&nbsp;example.</p><p>But in many ways these are just formal rights which have very little impact on what happens day to day. We think a human rights approach to personal data goes much further than formal compliance to GDPR into the nitty gritty of how themes such as Control, Agency and Guardianship work (hence the title of the <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/">Paper</a>). Here are some of its key&nbsp;points.</p> Is user-centricity a good&nbsp;thing? <p>First off, almost always, slogans like ‘user centric service design’ are a sure-fire sign that a human rights approach to personal data is not being implemented. This is because of the way ‘user centric’ logic works. By definition, a ‘user’ is a person using a particular service. In focusing solely on the interface between the organisational and the individual, it actually ignores the context and circumstances of the individual’s life, quickly turning the attention back to itself. ‘User-centric’ thus becomes a way in which organisations keep examining themselves in their own mirrors: high-sounding rhetoric for their continued focus on their own needs in relation to their&nbsp;users.</p><p>A simple example: a user-centric approach to designing forms will focus on one particular organisation’s attempts to make filling in its particular forms easier, clearer and simpler. This is fine as it goes, but it’s not very far because most individuals needing services need to fill in lots of different forms, many of them completely different in their design, presentation and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>Time and time again we have seen projects where ‘user-centric’ service design loses sight of the people it is supposed to serve: the human beings whose lives are much richer, more complicated and difficult than just their one single interface with one particular organisation and one particular service.</p><p>So, for example, a service that is person-centric rather than user-centric might ask ‘how to eliminate the need to fill in forms at all?’ (by, for example, enabling automated API-based processes of data sharing). Or, failing that, how to design forms so that they all look and feel the same no matter what organisation they come from, so that we as human beings don’t have to learn how to navigate our way through, each different form, every&nbsp;time?</p> Is ‘control’ a good&nbsp;thing? <p>‘Control’ over data is another word to be suspicious about. That’s because service providers usually interpret ‘control’ in a very narrow, organisation-centric way. ‘Control’ is interpreted as an individual being able to exercise a little more control over the data that that particular organisation collects about them. This is very different to an individual having genuine, full control over the data by, for example, being able to aggregate data from all the different organisations they deal with, in their own database (such as a personal data store), and to use and share this data as they wish, outside of the systems, restrictions and controls placed upon this data by the organisation concerned.</p><p>A truly human rights approach to data embraces the second, genuine, full interpretation of ‘control’; something that, after 16 years of development, we are now implementing in a number of projects, particularly in health and&nbsp;care.</p> Why agency is&nbsp;critical <p>‘Agency’ is another key concept when it comes to the practical implementation of a human rights approach to personal data. If you can’t actually access and use your data to actually do stuff in your life — to get stuff done — then your ‘rights’ are just formal, not real; and ‘control’ is close to meaningless.</p><p>The locus of such agency isn’t within the systems of this or that organisation; it is within the individual’s life, when they are trying to access, use and share data to better manage the issues that matter to them. This, we believe, is creating a completely different agenda.</p><p>What’s really needed to enhance and enable citizen agency is a personalised experience layer that enables individuals to interoperate with many different schemes and ecosystems via a familiar, consistent interface that becomes second nature to them. Like driving a&nbsp;car.</p><p>Practically speaking, this means each individual should have their own personalised cockpits or dashboards that display the data about their life, their transactions, their accumulated proof points and so on, in the ways that they find intuitive and easy to&nbsp;use.</p><p>Within this, agency means being able to use your data where and when you want, and to be able to share it easily with whomever you want safely and securely. Seen from this perspective, our society has hardly even begun adopting or implementing a human rights approach to personal data: we have a long way to&nbsp;go.</p> Agency and guardianship: two sides of the same&nbsp;coin <p>Finally, ‘guardianship’ is crucial to both real life control and agency. There are millions of people in the UK today, such as the old, frail or ill, who are not able to act fully and completely on their own behalf: who need help; someone to act for them in ways big and&nbsp;small.</p><p>Perhaps ironically, it is precisely in such situations of real or threatened loss of control and agency that, very often, they become all the more important to the person concerned. They want, as it were, to exercise control over what others are doing for them, when and&nbsp;how.</p><p>This is complex to manage and current ways of handling this complexity struggle with a chasm between highly formal, legal and bureaucratic powers of attorney and the myriad of informal ways that powers are delegated in real life: “Oh love, when you go to the shops, could you buy these items for me? Here’s my&nbsp;card!”</p><p>People need systems and infrastructure that let them handle this formal/informal spectrum quickly, simply and safely. Our Paper explains some of the mechanisms, such as Circles of Support, that we have developed to deal with these issues in a practical way.</p><p>This underlines a key point about most current debates on human rights. What’s needed above all is infrastructure, tools and capabilities that make it possible to embed and crystallise a human rights approach to data in a way that works at the level of daily, practical details. The focus needs to be on practical implementation, not just rhetoric.</p><p>To conclude, change is in the air. Our (Mydex’s) day-to-day work is showing that it is possible to build a personal data ecosystem that is interoperable, flexible, certifiable, scalable and that is also safe, secure and consensual, taking a human rights based approach that results in genuine personal, social and economic benefits. The opportunity is to make a human rights approach to personal data — and therefore to all data-driven services — something that actually does happen, every&nbsp;day.</p><p>P.S.

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>As we look towards 2024, the air travel industry is poised for a historic milestone. The latest forecasts suggest that 2024 is set to be the biggest year ever in terms of global passenger traffic volume. This is a remarkable turnaround from the significant downturn experienced in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>For many of us, including myself, this year has been marked by frequent flights. Whether for business or leisure, it seems like we’ve been in the air more often than not.</p>
<p>As air travel volumes continue to soar, the question arises: how can we further improve and streamline travel processes for travelers and various stakeholders? A key component in this evolution is the role of digital identity.</p>
<p>In this latest podcast episode, Dan and I engage in a conversation focusing on the concept of ‘travel credentials’. We delve into how digital identity can revolutionize the travel experience, making it more efficient and seamless for everyone involved.</p>
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Daniel and I in this podcast include:</p>
 
 Governance of International Air Travel: Inquiry about the organization responsible for developing international standards and specifications for smooth airport experiences across different countries. 
 ICAO’s Role and Dynamics: Exploration of ICAO’s governance and business interactions with countries like the United States and Canada. Discussion on the creation and alignment of passports through ICAO’s collaboration with various countries. 
 Machine Authentication and Passport Digitization: Examination of the trend towards machine authentication at airports and its impact on the digitization of physical passports. 
 Biometrics in International Travel: Inquiry about the alignment of biometric standards and technologies across countries for travel purposes. 
 Photo Accuracy in Travel Documents: Discussion on the accuracy of photos in travel documents and their comparison across different locations. 
 Integrity of Various Travel Documents: Comparison of the integrity and standards of images in passports, visas, and driver’s licenses for biometric assessments. 
 Digital Travel Credential (DTC): Introduction to the concept of the digital travel credential and its relation to current travel processes. Exploration of the benefits of moving towards a digital travel credential. Discussion on the standards and application integration of digital travel credentials. 
 Benefits of DTC for Travelers: Analysis of how DTCs could streamline travel processes and their comparison to existing programs like Clear and Nexus. 
 Future of DTC Adoption: Inquiry into the current state of DTC pilot projects and predictions for future adoption trends. 
 Integration of DTCs in Wallets and Applications: Consideration of the logical placement of DTCs in digital wallets and applications, and their potential impact on travel efficiency.

<p>The Verida Network is a self-sovereign database network for storing private data. The network creates a decentralized and hyper-efficient tokenized data economy for personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Verida is now inviting storage node providers to participate in our foundational release.</p><p>Check out our <a href="https://www.verida.network/storage-node-providers">new website landing page</a> specifically for Storage Node providers.</p> Why run a Verida Storage&nbsp;Node? <p>Verida is the leading privacy focused storage solution for web3. We believe private storage infrastructure is the next growth area for&nbsp;web3.</p><p>Web2 offers abundant storage options, but web3’s unique needs demand specific solutions.</p><p>Existing decentralized storage models such as Filecoin, Sia, and Arweave are robust for public data, but fall short for private personal data. <a href="http://verida.network">Verida</a> fills this gap by addressing speed, authentication, encryption, and regulatory issues in private data&nbsp;storage.</p><p>This is a chance for node operators to gain exposure to emerging, high growth use cases such as compliant DeFi, RWAs, credentials, healthcare and enterprise data management.</p><p>We are working with a growing <a href="https://www.verida.network/ecosystem">ecosystem</a> of partners such as Polygon ID, Redbelly Network, zkPass, cheqd and others to make this&nbsp;happen.</p> The Verida Storage Node&nbsp;Network <p>The Verida protocol provides an open source <a href="https://github.com/verida/storage-node">Storage Node</a> server that provides encrypted, authenticated database storage for Verida accounts on the&nbsp;network.</p><p>The Storage Node network is global with a region-aware design. It empowers users to control their data storage location in accordance with their geographic preference and regulatory needs.</p><p>By default, the <a href="http://verida.io">Verida Wallet </a>selects storage nodes in the user’s country or region, ensuring regulatory compliance. Users, however, have the freedom to change these nodes or even host their own, allowing for true data sovereignty.</p><p>The technology also enables the “right to be forgotten.” Users can delete their data from storage nodes or remove their identity and data entirely from the&nbsp;network.</p><p>This level of control over data storage and deletion is unprecedented and vital for the widespread adoption of this technology in mature, regulated industries. For instance, social media and health&nbsp;care.</p> The Storage Node Foundational Release <p>Storage nodes are currently operated across multiple global regions by the Verida Foundation. You can track node statistics on the <a href="https://explorer.verida.network/">Network Explorer</a>.</p><p>This has allowed the Verida team to monitor performance, gather analytics and rapidly improve reliability on the <a href="https://news.verida.io/the-decentralized-verida-acacia-testnet-is-live-81503c119d9f">Acacia Testnet</a>. We are now preparing to open up the network to third party node operators.</p><p>The foundational release will target a mixture of node operators across different data centres, different regions. We aim to accommodate and incorporate both small, medium and large operators to support the Verida&nbsp;network.</p><p>These foundational members will be rewarded for their participation and are expected to work closely with the Verida team to ensure our documentation, tooling and protocol are meeting our delivery objectives of the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Storage nodes will be brought online in staged cohorts as the Verida team learns and receives feedback on deployment processes, availability, security, real world usage, payments and incentives.</p> Apply now to be a Storage Node&nbsp;Operator <p>You can <a href="https://www.verida.network/storage-node-providers">apply here</a> to become a foundational node operator.</p><p>If you have questions or feedback please chat with us in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/664594912460668960/1092274729328574464">#storage-nodes channel</a> in the Verida&nbsp;discord.</p> Learn more about&nbsp;Verida   Website: <a href="https://www.verida.io/">https://www.verida.io</a>  Subscribe: <a href="https://dashboard.mailerlite.com/forms/97344/60309864285472178/share">Verida Newsletter</a>  LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/verida-technology/">https://www.linkedin.com/company/verida-technology/</a>  Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/verida_io">https://twitter.com/verida_io</a>  Discord: <a href="https://discord.verida.io/">https://discord.verida.io</a>  Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/verida_community">https://t.me/verida_community</a>  Reddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Verida/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Verida/</a>  Medium: <a href="https://news.verida.io/">https://news.verida.io/</a>  YouTube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@verida_io">https://www.youtube.com/@verida_io</a>   <p><a href="https://news.verida.io/decentralizing-the-verida-network-become-a-node-operator-e31a6a31daf1">Decentralizing the Verida Network: Become a Node Operator</a> was originally published in <a href="https://news.verida.io">Verida</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Onboarding and offboarding employees includes managing which SaaS applications they need access to and which they need to be removed from. Many small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) do this with something lovingly (or not so lovingly) called The SpreadsheetTM.</p>
<p>A new employee joins the company? Update The Spreadsheet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An employee left the company? Update The Spreadsheet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An employee changed their name? Update The Spreadsheet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, when the annual access review comes along, everyone asks: How accurate is The Spreadsheet? And as your company grows, the more employees you have, the more applications you use, the more digitally connected you are — the more complicated The Spreadsheet gets.</p>
<p>The spreadsheet method had its day, but you can see how it might prevent SMBs from leveling up and even unintentionally add operational, technical, and security debt to take care of later. It is possible to automate granting and revoking access and permissions by using APIs for many applications. But there are some substantial barriers:</p>
<p>It’s nobody’s job (yet). Small companies are often strapped, and maybe you don’t have a dedicated headcount that can own the process of <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">updating employee application access</a>.</p>
<p>The app doesn’t have an API. With some applications, the only way to update permissions is in the app itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/the-history-of-sso-and-why-its-time-for-a-change/">expensive SSO tax</a> gets in the way. Using automation software like Okta, for example, forces you to implement technological protocols you just don’t need yet. It’s expensive and can be disruptive to users.&nbsp;</p>
 A better way to automate IT permissions 
<p>Because it’s so easy to implement, more modern application vendors have adopted “Sign in with Google,” and they don’t charge for it. This means that if you use Google Workspace, the need for SAML-based SSO (like Okta) is nearly obsolete. And get this — 70% of startups and SMBs already operate on Google Workspace to begin with!</p>
<p>YeshID helps Google Super Admins create a streamlined, repeatable, efficient, and compliant way to manage identities and applications. Using templates, you can automate creating a Google user and putting them in the proper organization and groups. This also triggers the creation of a task list of apps they need access to and automatically sends requests for provisioning to the proper admins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now, we’re testing an even easier way to do this: If the application offers the ability to read the list of users on lower subscription tiers, we’ll actually keep the list up to date for you. And soon, we’ll have the ability to add the user for you too (if that capability exists in lower subscription tiers).&nbsp;</p>
<p>To start, we have integrations with Slack, Notion, and Hubspot. Once enabled, syncing users from those applications to YeshID can be done with a click of a button.&nbsp;</p>
 Give it a go 
<p>YeshID is in beta and looking for folks who sit in that sweet spot where you want to ditch The Spreadsheet but don’t want to go all in on Okta. If this is you, <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">learn more</a>! We’re already <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/a-new-era-of-secure-it-identity-management-yeshid-soc-ii-and-you/">SOC II compliant</a>, we’re in the <a href="https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/yeshid_onboard/456377342688">Google Workspace Marketplace</a>, and you have a big ol’ DELETE button if you decide it’s not for you. </p>

DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF68 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 100,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 100k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.

  <p>Microsoft Entra Permissions Management is a Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM) solution that helps organizations manage the permissions of any identity across organizations’ multicloud infrastructure. With Permissions Management, organizations can assess, manage, and monitor identities and their permissions continuously and right-size them based on past activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, we’re thrilled to unveil the details of our Ignite announcement and introduce new features and APIs for Permissions Management, enhancing your overall permissions management experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Permissions Management app in the ServiceNow app store (Generally Available) 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users can now request time-bound, on-demand permissions for multicloud environments (Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP)) via the ServiceNow portal. This integration will strengthen organizations’ Zero Trust posture by adding permission requests to existing approval workflows in ServiceNow, making it possible to enforce the principle of least privilege in multicloud environments. To learn more about this, please visit <a href="http://aka.ms/ServiceNowPoD">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Integration with Microsoft Defender for Cloud (Public Preview)&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are enhancing our cloud-native application protection program (CNAPP) by delivering basic permissions management insights through Microsoft Defender for Cloud. This integration strengthens the prevention of security breaches that can occur due to excessive permissions or misconfigurations in cloud environments. This enables organizations to implement the principle of least privilege for cloud resources and receive actionable recommendations for resolving permissions risks across Azure, AWS, and GCP. To learn more, please visit <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/permissions-management/permissions-management-for-defender-for-cloud">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Okta and AWS IAM Identity Center support (Public Preview) 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Permissions Management customers can now detect identities originating from Okta and AWS IAM Identity Center.&nbsp; This will help customers gain a centralized view of all identities and their permissions, regardless of the identity provider solutions they are using. Organizations can easily configure Okta, and AWS IAM Identity Center with just a few clicks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Permissions Analytic Report (Public Preview) 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This report lists findings across identities and resources in Permissions Management. This report can be directly viewed on the Permissions Management page, downloaded in Excel format, and exported as a PDF. It’s available for all supported cloud environments, which include Microsoft Azure, AWS, and GCP. To learn more, please visit <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/permissions-management/product-permissions-analytics-reports#download-the-permissions-analytics-report-in-pdf-format">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 New APIs&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Permissions Management has introduced multiple MS-Graph APIs in public preview, addressing key use cases based on customer feedback. With these new APIs, organizations can retrieve the inventory of onboarded AWS accounts, Azure subscriptions, and GCP projects, incorporate permissions analytics insights into dashboards in SIEM tools, and enable access reviews in existing ticketing systems. In addition, the Permission on Demand API provides flexibility to elevate the permissions of users or workload identities as necessary, either through automation or by integrating with an IT Service Management (ITSM) solution. To learn more, please visit <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/permissions-management-api-overview?view=graph-rest-beta">here</a>.</p>

 TL;DR 



 
 Extrimian and zkSync partner to bring QuarkID and decentralized, self-sovereign digital identity to the citizens of Buenos Aires. 



 The pioneering initiative will enable citizens to claim ownership of their documents and personal data and provide greater security and privacy. 



 QuarkID, an open source digital identity protocol, will use zkSync Era to empower users and ensure privacy. 



 The collaboration establishes the City of Buenos Aires as a leader in the adoption of blockchain technologies for the benefit of its citizens. 



 The project aims to expand nationwide, benefiting more than 45 million people in Argentina.

 What is QuarkID? 



<p><a href="https://quarkid.org">QuarkID </a>is the Decentralized Digital Identity protocol anchored on <a href="https://zksync.io/">zkSync Era</a>, developed by <a href="https://extrimian.io">Extrimian</a>, and driven by the Government of the City of Buenos Aires and other companies with extensive experience in decentralized technologies and data security. This initiative seeks to put the power of data in the hands of citizens.</p>



 Latin America’s leading Decentralized Identity protocol partners with zkSync to transform Digital Identity in the region, starting with the City of Buenos Aires. 



<p>In the ever-changing blockchain technology landscape, the quest for a billion users remains a constant goal. So what technology or use cases should we push to achieve greater adoption of blockchain technology?</p>



<p>And is that, considering the privacy and digital security needs due to the increase in cybercrime and identity theft that is occurring these days, an identity and private data verification system that puts the user at the center, is imperative.</p>



 What drives this development? 



<p>At the heart of the Web3 ethic is personal ownership and decentralization, principles that extend far beyond financial assets to encompass broader, more practical applications. Today, we are pleased to announce a groundbreaking initiative in this direction: citizen-owned digital identity. Buenos Aires, Argentina, is poised to lead the charge, gradually introducing Web3 identity solutions powered by zkSync Era’s privacy-centric properties.</p>



<p>In the effort to bring Web3 identity solutions to the global stage, it is imperative that privacy remains a paramount concern in technologies that enable personal data ownership. A decentralized world that neglects privacy considerations goes against the very essence of Web3.</p>



<p>We envision a future in which personal freedom and autonomous digital identity empower individuals to securely manage their data.</p>



 Empowering Buenos Aires Citizens with Decentralized and Self-Sovereign Digital Identity. 



<p>Under Argentina’s blockchain-based identification initiative, citizens will gain control over their personal documents, health data and, in the future, payment processing. To build the infrastructure for this transformative program, Buenos Aires has partnered with QuarkID, an open source digital identity protocol developed by Extrimian, Latin America’s leading decentralized identity company. QuarkID uses zkSync Era as its anchor protocol, powering the wallets through which individuals will claim their documents.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“This marks a monumental leap toward a more secure and efficient future for government services in Latin America,” ; “QuarkID fosters closer ties between governments and citizens while introducing digital identity practices and security standards in Latin America.”, expressed <a href="https://ar.linkedin.com/in/guillevillanueva">Guillermo Villanueva, CEO of Extrimian</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The data stored in QuarkID wallets is autonomous, allowing citizens to control the delivery of their credentials when interacting with administrative services. zkSync Era serves as a settlement layer for QuarkID, ensuring that each participating citizen maintains ownership of their legitimate credentials.</p>



<p>While QuarkID makes its debut in Buenos Aires, its architecture is designed to scale globally. Complying with international standards such as W3C, Trust Over IP and Sovrin Foundation, QuarkID is interoperable with networks around the world.</p>



 Leveraging ZK Technology to Empower 650 Million People in Latin America 



<p>While blockchain-based digital identity promises a revolutionary change in data ownership, it often generates controversy as to the true decentralization of these processes. Recent events, such as the Kenyan government’s concerns about data privacy in a biometric cryptocurrency project, highlight these issues.</p>



<p>However, the transparency and security inherent in the cutting edge of Zero Knowledge (ZK) technology, combined with Ethereum, have the potential to dispel such concerns. This partnership unlocks privacy-preserving digital identity enforcement for entire nations.</p>

<p>With zkSync and Ethereum as the backbone of this initiative, personal data stored on-chain mitigates identity theft and personal information attacks commonly associated with centralized data storage technologies. zkSync ensures that digital property is trusted, trustless and secure, while prioritizing privacy.</p>



<p>The Argentine government and the City of Buenos Aires aim to establish its digital identity framework as a public good, enabling individuals to seamlessly transact information between government, businesses and their peers.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhfernandez/?locale=es_ES">Diego Fernandez, Secretary of Innovation of the Government of the City of Buenos Aires</a>, emphasizes, “With this development, Buenos Aires becomes the first city in Latin America and one of the first in the world to integrate and promote this new technology and set the standard for how other countries in the region should use blockchain technology for the benefit of their people.”</p>



<p>Read this <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/09/28/buenos-aires-government-blockchain-birth-certificate-zero-knowledge-proofs/">Note to Diego Fernandez in Fortune Crypto</a> to learn more about this alliance and how it will be carried out.</p>



QuarkID decentralized digital trust protocol, and verification of private data



 QuarkID Roadmap 



<p>Beginning in October, residents of Buenos Aires will be able to download a QuarkID wallet to claim personal identification documents, including birth and marriage certificates. QuarkID will be available to all Argentine citizens and will eventually become mandatory nationwide. In November, documents such as proof of income and academic verifications will be available to obtain in QuarkID wallets. By the end of 2023, the government will establish QuarkID’s future roadmap and outline expansion milestones to initially provide its services to more than 3 million citizens.</p>



<p>Buenos Aires is leading this initiative, ushering in a new era of Internet through digital ownership. We hope that nations around the world will look to Argentina as an example of how Web3 identity can thrive at the government level.</p>

 What’s going on with Hollywood and AI or Artificial Intelligence? 



<p>Hollywood has a problem with artificial intelligence and the lack of humanity and individuality it breeds in the industry. The latest outcry from actors has underscored the importance of safeguarding authenticity in the film and television industry. In this context, the use of a decentralized Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) system can be important. This system helps to verify data and identities and to avoid scams and impersonations.</p>



<p>It is time to protect authenticity and identity in Hollywood, preserving the essence of human performance in the digital age. identities and, in the case of Hollywood, preserving the essence of human performance in the digital age.</p>



<p>A Self-Sovereign Identity system ensures reliable verification of data and identities, making a difference in the control of personal data. With Self-Sovereign Identity, we could avoid impersonalization and negative uses of Artificial Intelligence, such as scams and identity theft.</p>



<p>At Extrimian, we are working to promote more sovereign, decentralized and cybercrime-preventing models. Find out what we are doing at Extrimian to promote these models at Extrimian.io Products.</p>



 The Present Conflict and the Relevance of Authenticity: Hollywood and Artificial Intelligence 



<p>In Hollywood, actors who are authentic and convey genuine emotions are key to the success of movies and TV shows. However, the emergence of artificial intelligence has presented significant challenges in terms of impersonation and the generation of fraudulent content. The actor strike shows the concern about losing authenticity and being replaced by technology.</p>



 Data protection with SSI vs. AI 



 Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and the importance of authenticity. 



<p>How can this model solve the problems with breaching people’s identities?<br>SSI is a system that gives individuals full control over their digital identity and the data associated with it. Using SSI, actors and other individuals can create verifiable digital identities that support their authenticity in the entertainment industry. This system uses cryptography and blockchain to protect and validate information, preventing changes and forgeries.</p>



 Data security: Avoiding deception and forgery. 



<p>Using a decentralized, self-sovereign identity system in Hollywood could prevent scams and spoofing when validating identities. This system would enable the creation of verifiable digital certifications that would evidence the effective participation of participants in specific projects.</p>



<p>Such certifications could be employed by production studios and audiences to corroborate the veracity of content, fostering trust and preventing fraud.</p>



 Safeguarding authenticity in the Hollywood industry in the age of AI 



<p>In an age of technological advancements, it is important to address the entertainment industry’s challenges in terms of authenticity and truthfulness. What do you think is the effect of deepfakes and impersonations in the entertainment industry? In what ways do you think identity and data verification can help address these issues? What additional actions do you think should be put in place to safeguard the privacy and rights of actors?</p>



<p>What measures can we implement with respect to this? Self-Sovereign Identity as a tool for AI.<br>It is time to safeguard the authenticity of identities and, in the Hollywood context, maintain the essence of human performance in the digital age. The adoption of a Self-Sovereign Identity system can be crucial to ensure reliable verification of data and identities.</p>



<p>With SSI, we could prevent impersonation and harmful uses of AI, such as fraud and identity theft.</p>

  Under Singapore’s Payment Services Act, cryptocurrencies are recognized as digital payment tokens, requiring businesses to obtain a license to offer crypto services in the city-state.  In 2020, Singapore’s Monetary Authority introduced a licensing system for crypto exchanges and wallet providers to align with anti-money laundering (AML) and CTF (counter-terrorist financing) regulations.  The crypto Travel Rule threshold in Singapore is SGD 1,500, yet certain information must still be shared for transactions below this&nbsp;value.  <p>As crypto adoption continues to rise, Singapore is seeing growing traction, coming in at 2nd place in the Crypto Hubs 2023 list. The country plays a key role in crypto’s adoption in the Asia-Pacific region, which it strengthens through a focus on digital innovation, raising awareness of crypto usage, the absence of capital gains tax, the government’s close cooperation with industry stakeholders, and most importantly, favorable crypto regulation in Singapore.</p><p><a href="https://www.fortuneindia.com/macro/singapore-emerges-as-top-crypto-hub-switzerland-uae-follow-suit/114010">According to Henley &amp; Partners</a>, Singapore leads as the top crypto hub across the world with a score of 50.2 out of 60, a reflection of its well-established crypto infrastructure and reputation for privacy and security. This standing in the global arena naturally leads to an interest in the specifics of its legal framework, particularly how Singapore applies <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule#:~:text=A%20VASP%20is%20a%20cryptocurrency,lowered%20the%20threshold%20to%20zero.">the FATF Travel Rule</a> in its burgeoning crypto&nbsp;sector.</p><p>So, let’s take a closer look at Singapore’s crypto law and the application of the FATF travel rule in the&nbsp;country!</p> Overview of Crypto Regulations in Singapore <p>In 2020, the country’s central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), introduced a licensing system for crypto exchanges and wallet providers under the Payment Services Act (PSA). With this move, the agency ensured that crypto-related activities within the country adhere to <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) regulations</a>.</p><p>Under this framework, cryptocurrencies are classified as digital payment tokens (DPTs), effectively making approved cryptocurrencies legal assets in Singapore and allowing them to be treated on par with other asset&nbsp;classes.</p><p>The act stipulates that any business offering crypto services must obtain a payment institution license, which means having a registered office in Singapore.</p><p>The country’s financial regulatory body also incorporated cryptocurrencies under the Securities and Futures Act (SFA) in the same year. This move essentially categorized certain approved tokens as capital market products.</p><p>Singapore also mandates that cryptocurrency exchanges and other virtual asset service providers secure a capital market services (CMS) license for issuing digital tokens. With this requirement, the country is ensuring that these entities meet specific financial standards and maintain a clear demarcation between firms engaged in market-making activities and those focusing on developing blockchain-based innovations in the crypto&nbsp;space.</p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-state-of-global-crypto-regulations">Click here to learn about the current state of global crypto regulations.</a></p> Specifics of the Singapore Crypto Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>The <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/regulation/notices/psn02-aml-cft-notice---digital-payment-token-service">MAS published PSN02</a>, also known as the Crypto Travel Rule Singapore, which came into force in January 2020 to address money laundering and terror financing risks. It is a part of Singapore’s broader cryptocurrency regulation framework, where MAS mandates that crypto service providers comply with the FATF’s Travel Rule to bolster the resilience of the country’s financial system.</p><p>Notably, these rules don’t apply when transactions are between crypto service providers and non-custodial or self-hosted wallets.</p><p>However, according to the stipulations of the Crypto Travel Rule Singapore, VASPs are obligated to collect and share originator and beneficiary information with the beneficiary crypto service providers for all transactions, regardless of the amount involved.</p><p>For transactions below or equal to SGD 1,500, the information required includes:</p>  The name of the value transfer originator  The value transfer originator’s account number or unique transaction reference number  The name of the value transfer beneficiary  The value transfer beneficiary’s account number or unique transaction reference number.  <p>And when the crypto transaction amount exceeds S$1,500, a wider scope of information must be collated and shared. This includes:</p>  Name of the transaction originator and their account number or unique transaction reference number  Originator’s address, date and place of birth, and a unique identification number, which can be a birth certificate number or passport number and an identity card number or the registration number in case it’s a&nbsp;business  Name of the beneficiary and their account number or unique transaction reference number  If it’s a legal entity, then its ultimate beneficiary owner (UBO) must be identified and verified.  <p>Under Crypto Travel Rule Singapore, financial institutions, too, are required to implement a robust risk management system that includes:</p>  Risk assessment and Risk mitigation  Customer due diligence (CDD)  Enhanced due diligence (EDD)  Sanctions list screening  Politically exposed persons (PEP) screening  Ongoing transaction monitoring  Reliance on third&nbsp;parties  Correspondent accounts and wire transfers  Audit, employee training, and internal&nbsp;policies  Record-keeping for at least five&nbsp;years  Compliance reporting, including suspicious transactions to&nbsp;MAS   Is Crypto Legal in Singapore? <p>Yes, crypto is legal in Singapore and open to innovation through the Payment Services Act (PSA), which was passed in&nbsp;2019.</p><p>This Act clarifies the legal status of crypto and governs a wide range of payment service companies, including account issuance, local and international money transfer services, e-money issuers, merchant acquisition, foreign exchange, and Digital Payment Token Services.</p><p>Companies dealing with crypto transmission, exchange, or storage are subject to the MAS regulatory control. Due to Singapore’s strict crypto AML/CFT laws, VASPs need to register for a trading license and adhere to AML/CFT&nbsp;rules.</p> Crypto Taxes in Singapore <p>Singapore is often regarded as a crypto tax haven for both individuals and businesses, primarily because it <a href="https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/etaxguide_cit_income-tax-treatment-of-digital-tokens_091020.pdf?sfvrsn=91dbe1f7_17">does not impose a capital gains tax</a> on cryptocurrency investments. This policy facilitates favorable conditions for long-term crypto investments.</p><p>However, the tax scenario differs for those who engage in professional crypto trading. In such cases, profits from trading are treated as income from business activity and are, therefore, subject to income tax. This taxation applies irrespective of whether the trading is short-term or long-term as long as it is conducted in a professional capacity.</p><p>In instances where crypto trading is subject to income tax, losses incurred can be deducted for tax purposes, offering some relief in the event of a downturn in the&nbsp;market.</p><p>For businesses that accept cryptocurrencies as a form of payment, the value received is treated as income and is subject to income&nbsp;tax.</p><p>It’s important to note that while transactions involving the purchase or sale of goods and services using cryptocurrencies are not subject to the standard 8% Goods and Services Tax (GST), the act of buying, selling, or converting cryptocurrencies is subject to GST on the fees involved in these transactions.</p><p>In terms of accounting for these transactions, Singapore typically employs methods such as FIFO (First-In, First-Out), LIFO (Last-In, First-Out), and Weighted Average, providing different approaches to calculating profits or losses for tax reporting.</p> Singapore Stablecoin Regulation <p>In Q3 of 2023, Singapore finalized the rules for stablecoins, which are payment tokens that maintain a constant value against one or more fiat currencies, to become one of the first jurisdictions globally to do&nbsp;so.</p><p>These rules aim to “facilitate the use of stablecoins as a credible digital medium of exchange and as a bridge between the fiat and digital asset ecosystems.”</p><p>As per Singapore stablecoin regulation, some key requirements to ensure value stability at all times&nbsp;include:</p>  Holding a minimum of 1 million Singapore dollars (SGD) in base&nbsp;capital  Stablecoin reserves must be held in low-risk and highly liquid&nbsp;assets  Reserves backing the stablecoin must be equal to or exceed the value of the stablecoin in circulation at all&nbsp;times  Stablecoin issuers must return the stablecoin’s par value to holders within five business days of a redemption request  Stablecoin issuers must provide “appropriate disclosures,” including value stabilizing mechanisms and reserve audits to&nbsp;users.  <p>These rules will apply to single‑currency stablecoins issued in the country and pegged to the local fiat currency, Singapore dollar (SGD), or any G10 currency, such as the USD. Stablecoins that fulfill these requirements will be recognized by the regulator as “MAS-regulated stablecoins,” distinguishing them from non-regulated tokens.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>Singapore is one of the only countries in the world to provide a clear and robust legal framework for crypto assets. And when this regulatory clarity is combined with higher than average cryptocurrency ownership of <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/10584/cryptocurrency-in-singapore/#topicOverview">19%</a>, it makes Singapore a prime location for dealing with cryptocurrencies.</p><p>However, virtual asset service providers need to understand both the FATF Travel Rule and the broader crypto regulatory framework in Singapore in order to take full advantage of Singapore’s crypto adoption, tax benefits, and regulatory support for blockchain and fintech innovation and&nbsp;thrive.</p> Frequently Asked Questions  Q1: What is the Payment Services Act in Singapore and How Does It Affect Cryptocurrencies? <p>The Payment Services Act, enacted in Singapore in 2019 (often referred to as the PSA Act Singapore or simply the Singapore Payment Act), modernizes the regulatory framework for digital payment services, directly impacting cryptocurrency-related businesses.</p> Q2: How Does Singapore’s Monetary Authority Regulate Crypto Exchanges and Wallet Providers? <p>In 2020, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) mandated a licensing regime under the Payment Services Act specifically for crypto exchanges and wallet providers. This initiative, part of Singapore’s crypto exchange regulation, ensures these entities comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) standards. Consequently, only MAS-approved crypto exchanges and wallet services that adhere to these regulations are permitted to operate in Singapore.</p> Q3: What is the Crypto Travel Rule in Singapore, and What are its Thresholds? <p>The Crypto Travel Rule in Singapore is a regulatory measure for cryptocurrency transactions, in line with FATF Recommendation 16, which mandates the sharing of transaction information to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing.</p><p>When a transaction exceeds SGD 1,500, detailed information about both the sender and recipient must be disclosed. This requirement, part of the broader Singapore Travel Rule Crypto regulations, is also applicable for transactions below this threshold. However, the information required is not that detailed, unlike when the transactions exceed SGD&nbsp;1,500.</p> Q4: How are Cryptocurrencies Classified and Regulated Under Singapore’s Laws? <p>Cryptocurrencies in Singapore are classified as digital payment tokens under the Payment Services Act and are included under the Securities and Futures Act. This classification allows them to be legally treated as assets, requiring businesses to comply with various regulatory requirements, including obtaining relevant licenses.</p> Q5: What Specific Requirements are Imposed on Crypto Transactions in Singapore Under the Travel&nbsp;Rule? <p>The MAS mandates the collection and sharing of detailed originator and beneficiary information for all crypto transactions, with more comprehensive data required for transactions exceeding SGD 1,500. This includes personal identification and account&nbsp;details.</p> Q6: Is Cryptocurrency Legal in Singapore, and What are the Regulatory Requirements? <p>Yes, cryptocurrency is legal in Singapore. The Payment Services Act governs crypto transactions, with businesses needing to register for a trading license and adhere to stringent AML/CFT&nbsp;laws.</p> Q7: What is the Singapore Stablecoin Regulation? <p>Singapore stablecoin regulation is established rules for stablecoins in the city-state. Its goal is to ensure that stablecoins maintain consistent value stability. The key requirements for stablecoin issuers include a minimum base capital, liquid asset reserves, and clear disclosures to users, among&nbsp;others.</p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>It’s been a busy few months at Ubisecure with a number of presentations at various events throughout Europe – some of which are available on-demand on our <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/video-resources/" title="<span>Video Resources page</span>">Video Resources page</a>. It is great to be at the events, hearing from other industry experts, meeting new people, and not least getting direct feedback from live audiences as you present. &nbsp;</p>
<p>One of our core topics we’ve been presenting is getting great interest and engagement, and that is the notion of Identity Context.</p>
 What is Identity Context? 
<p>In business transactions, Identity Context helps to understand the parties involved in a transaction, including their roles, representative rights, responsibilities, and the nature of their engagement in a specific transaction.</p>
<p>Our work at Ubisecure is driven by our shared vision on the future of digital identity:</p>
<blockquote><p>Combine a highly assured organisation identity with a strongly authenticated individual identity to show who you are, who you represent and the rights you have when representing them.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve written in depth about <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-platform/true-b2b-iam/" title="highly assured organisation identity">highly assured organisation identity</a>, and how the value of strongly authenticated individual identity is well known. However, it is the act of combining those two identity classes that gives actual context to the potential interaction and defines the rights of the individual. It is this resultant combined identity that defines the Identity Context and enables the presentation of an aggregated/generated set of rights that are appropriate in that context.</p>
 The Value of Context 
<p>We all use the value of Identity Context implicitly, often without realising it, but in those circumstances, it is almost always ‘manually’ or at best with administrative control.</p>
<p>In direct interactions we often add context automatically – consider introducing yourself to a new teacher at your child’s school: ‘Hi I’m X, mother/father of Y’. Adding the parental relationship immediately adds context to the interaction and context to your presented identity. Alternatively, it’s almost certain that the first slide of any presentation you have given has established your Identity Context with the audience by including your name and your job title.</p>
<p>The context allows bounds to be known in the scope of the interaction. Additionally, that context will define rights that the individual can assert because they are acting in that context.</p>
 The Complexity of Context 
<p>Identity Context has value, and we use it already. So, how complex can it be? In short, very complex.</p>
<p>Context is, well, contextual. For a given individual they will operate in many differing contexts at differing times; they may even operate in multiple contexts at the same time. When operating in multiple contexts these can be independent or combined.</p>
<p>Add to this that the rate of change of contexts can be high; either as demanded by external changes, or as demanded by the process itself. A great example of this is privilege application management, where best security practice calls for least privilege by default and shortest possible time of increased privilege. The broader context might not change for several hours, but within that there will be fast-moving point in time contexts (with associated rights) that need to take effect in real time.</p>
<p>The idea of fast-moving context actually meshes very well with the current ‘buzz’ around Zero Trust. Zero Trust is often described as ‘authenticate always, authenticate often’ but in implementation ‘authenticate’ becomes ‘authorise’, noting that you must be known (authenticated) to be authorised.</p>
<p>Authorising often allows for rights to be modified as time and context change.</p>
 The Risks of Context 
<p>Context defines rights, and often responsibilities. In the previous two examples the context was self-declared. Self-declaration is ‘efficient’, but also sits as the root cause for most fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>Referring back to our vision, discussed at the start of this blog, for a moment:</p>
<blockquote><p>Combine a highly assured organisation identity with a strongly authenticated individual identity to show who you are, who you represent and the rights you have when representing them.</p></blockquote>
<p>We talk about a highly assured organisation identity and a strongly authenticated individual identity – we actually get most value when that individual identity is highly assured as well. But there is a third item that needs to have an assurance level – the ‘combination’.</p>
<p>The combination is the linkage between the two identity types. In the examples above, we have Parent and Employee as the specific linkage.</p>
<p>The linkage can be self-declared, verbally – “I am the parent of” – which is a low assurance declaration and therefore, a low assurance combination. Alternatively, that linkage can be verified, for example through a birth certificate and passports.</p>
<p>The assurance level of the linkage directly affects the value of the Identity Context.</p>
<p>For a given eco-system, the assurance levels of identities and linkage will be defined by a Governance Framework. We see a great example of this in the <a href="https://rapidlei.com/vlei/">vLEI</a> eco-system (based on verifiable credentials), defined by the GLEIF and supported by Ubisecure. The assurance levels of the organisation, individual and the linkage between the two are prescribed along with process definitions that will, when executed, preserve that assurance level.</p>
 In summary… 
<p>Identity Context enables significant value – we have seen and talked about a Northern European Government case study (see below) that realised a 99% saving from establishing a highly assured Identity Context and then allowing that to be delegated.</p>
<p>Knowing ‘who you are’ is not sufficient, we need to know the rights you have for the given ‘interaction’.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Small</a></p> 
 Why you should Regularly Review your Cyber Security 
 
<p>Cyber security is never done – you need to constantly work to improve your organization’s cyber security readiness.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kclive-wahlefeld-cyber-threat-landscape">Cyber adversaries never sleep</a> and the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an80854/cyber-risks-from-china-how-contract-negotiations-can-mitigate-it-risks">geopolitical tensions across the world</a> are raising the cyber security threat levels.</p>
 
 Technology is evolving 
 
<p>The technology landscape is evolving creating new opportunities as well as new threats.&nbsp; Lange Language Models (LLMs) have evolved beyond what was thought practical only a few years ago and conversational Artificial Intelligence engines are now a commodity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations are adopting these to provide improved efficiency and effectiveness of their operations and a better connection with their customers, partners, and suppliers.&nbsp; However, while LLMs provide <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2021-lichtenthaler-human-and-artificial-intelligence">great opportunities</a>, they also bring <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/artificial-intelligence-cre23">new cyber threats</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI involves a new kind of development pipeline and current system development methodologies and tools are not yet adapted to this.&nbsp; Can you be sure of the provenance of your training data? Can you trust the shared LLM?&nbsp; Can you be sure that the deployed inference engine has not been poisoned?</p>
<p>LLMs represent an entirely new form of cloud workload.&nbsp; Current Cloud Native Application Platforms (CNAPP) and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc81219/cloud-security-posture-management">Cloud Security Posture Management&nbsp; (CSPM)</a> do not cover these.</p>
<p>However, LLMs provide powerful capabilities to enhance the identification of cyber risks, the detection of active threats and the response to and recovery from cyber-attacks.</p>
<p>Organizations cannot afford to neglect the new opportunities but must prepare for these new threats. &nbsp;They must also exploit these new capabilities to improve their cyber security.</p>
 
 Standards and Regulations are Developing 
 
<p>The standards and best practice frameworks for cyber security are changing to respond to the increasing level of cyber threats and to incorporate the latest industry insights into how to best respond to these.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ISO/IEC 27001 The widely used information <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/27001">security standard ISO/IEC 27001</a> was updated in 2022. &nbsp;This new standard includes completely new controls covering - Threat intelligence, Information security for use of Cloud services, ICT readiness for business continuity, Physical security monitoring, Configuration management, Information deletion, Data masking, Data leakage prevention, Monitoring activities, Web filtering and Secure coding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your organization complies with ISO 27001 you will be required to update your controls to meet the new standard when next certified.&nbsp; Are your IT service providers and cloud services certified to the new standard?</p>
<p>NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) v2.0 &nbsp;- On <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/News/2023/nist-releases-cybersecurity-framework-2-0-draft#:~:text=The%20CSF%202.0%20draft%20reflects,CSF%E2%80%94especially%20for%20creating%20profiles.">August 8, 2023</a>, NIST released a draft of the NIST CSF 2.0, making the most significant revision to the framework since its inception in 2014. The draft includes the CSF itself and a discussion draft of implementation examples. NIST intends to release the final version in early 2024 without issuing another version for public comments.</p>
<p>NIST’s CSF 2.0 version 2.0 introduces significant changes to the cybersecurity landscape to address evolving threats and make the framework more accessible to all types of organizations. The draft reflects community feedback and industry shifts, emphasizes the role of cybersecurity as a key enterprise risk, and expands its scope beyond critical infrastructure. The CSF now includes six core functions: identify, protect, detect, respond, recover and the new “govern” function, which focuses on decision making in support of a cybersecurity strategy.</p>
<p>If your organization bases its approach to cyber security on this framework you need to plan for transition to the updated version.&nbsp; Are you ready for this transition?</p>
<p>EU NIS 2 - In the wake of increased cyber-attacks on national critical infrastructure, authorities around the world are imposing stricter requirements on organizations that their populations rely on for a wide range of essential services, which includes a wide and growing number of private companies that should be preparing now to meet their new obligations.</p>
<p>Notably the EU issued the&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/1148/oj">Network and Information Systems (NIS) Directive in 2016</a>&nbsp;and the US saw the introduction of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">Executive Order 14028</a>&nbsp;on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity in 2021. But European authorities are now seeking to go even further with an update to the NIS Directive, known as NIS2, which is expected to go into force by the second half of 2024.</p>
<p>Unlike its predecessor, NIS2 has a much wider scope, going beyond the traditional critical national infrastructure providers to include a range of organizations that are essential for the normal functioning of society, which include both EU and non-EU organizations that will have to ensure their compliance in future.</p>
<p>Is your organization <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/securing-the-digital-frontier-cre23">ready to comply with its obligations</a> under these new regulations.</p>
 
 Reviewing your cyber security 
 
<p>Business objectives, organizational best practices, and technologies are constantly evolving.&nbsp; It is essential to continuously review your organization’s performance in the light of these changes. To support these reviews, KuppingerCole provides Maturity Level Matrices that are specifically targeted to distinct areas of cyber security.</p>
<p>These are based on the five-point maturity scale formulated using the Carnegie Mellon Maturity Index (CMMI).&nbsp; Note that this is currently <a href="https://cmmiinstitute.com/products/cmmi/content-release">being enhanced</a> to &nbsp;include best practices for measuring capability and improving performance in the areas of people management, data management, and virtual work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assessing maturity based on this model is complex and to organizations to accomplish this task for cyber security <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an80839/maturity-level-matrix-for-cyber-security">we publish two matrixes</a> that describe the key areas that must be considered when assessing cyber security maturity.&nbsp; There are two matrices one covering cyber security organizational and management maturity and the other technological maturity. These are summarized below.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1: Cyber security organizational and management maturity</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 2: Cyber Security Technological maturity levels</p>
<p>KuppingerCole provides deep research into all the areas of cyber security.&nbsp; There also are many useful sessions from our cyberevolution event including how the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5421/1">hackers can exploit AI</a>, the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5430/1">regulatory challenges to the financial industry from DORA</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5469/1">practical advice on cloud security.</a></p>

<p>Let’s face it, organizations face many barriers to offering privacy products.</p>



<p>For companies that offer consumers pieces of the privacy and security puzzle, innovating and expanding offerings to adjacent – and in-demand – capabilities is often too expensive, takes too long, and falls outside of the core strength of the company offering the solution.</p>



<p>There’s a wide range of solutions that consumers “should” be using, but rarely are they motivated enough to do the hard work necessary to research, select, purchase, implement, and use all those solutions. Consequently, they use what they have been forced to use because of a security incident or they use the tools that come with their mainstream technology purchases or broader offerings.</p>



<p>Organizations playing in the privacy and online safety arena could benefit enormously from expanding their product offerings to cover adjacent areas – creating an easily acquired and easily implemented “one-stop-shop” where consumers get all they need from a brand they already trust.<br><br>Take these examples:</p>



 
 Insurance companies that offer identity theft insurance could package it with the technological solutions customers need to avoid falling victim in the first place. 



 Technology companies that offer cybersecurity capabilities, such as antivirus and malware protection, could add adjacent privacy and security offerings to complete the picture for consumers. 



 Vendors of specific privacy and online security services, such as credit monitoring, could boost customer loyalty and accelerate customer acquisition by also offering services their customers know they need but haven’t yet found an easy way to adopt. 



 Trusted general providers of goods and services, such as big box retailers and popular associations, could conveniently also offer online security products and services under the one roof, significantly increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty.<br>

 The challenge is real 



<p><br>Most organizations are not equipped to re-direct development resources to new products that fall outside of their established sweet spot. While they certainly could hire, ramp-up, and build these types of solutions from scratch, the time to a viable and profitable product offering may be too much.</p>



<p>But what if there was a way to add attractive and necessary privacy and online safety capabilities to existing products – or even as new products – quickly, easily, and completely and without the burden of developing them in house?</p>



 The solution is Sudo Platform 



<p>Anonyome Labs’ Sudo Platform is an API-first, developer-focused ecosystem that delivers the tools companies need to quickly and completely deliver to their customers the capabilities they need to protect and control their personal information while navigating the digital world. It is a powerful, modular, and quick-to-implement collection of the most important digital privacy and cyber safety tools for either mobile or desktop, and covering:</p>



 
 safe and private browsing including ad and tracker blocking and site reputation services 



 password management, automation, and security 



 virtual private network services 



 safe online commerce through virtual cards 



 a platform for decentralized identity including identity wallets, verifiable credentials services, and all the infrastructure necessary to make it real today 



 compartmentalization across all services so customers can easily partition their online interactions into purpose-specific identities (for example, one each for shopping, socializing, medical, travel, and so on). 
 







<p>Organizations use the set of scalable hosted services at the heart of Sudo Platform to quickly integrate these tools into any of their products or offerings and give their customers seamless access to them.</p>



<p></p>



 Sudo Platform is feature-packed 



<p>Developer-focused documentation</p>



<p>Thorough direction for how to build each of the Sudo Platform capabilities into applications are included in the <a href="https://docs.sudoplatform.com/">documentation site</a>.</p>



<p>API-first ecosystem</p>



<p>Sudo Platform APIs power next-generation customer apps with privacy, cyber safety, and decentralized identity capabilities, to empower organizations to quickly put privacy in their customers’ hands.</p>



<p>SDK source code</p>



<p>Mobile, web and desktop SDKs can be easily incorporated into an existing application or used as building blocks for new applications. Each SDK is built to run natively on all supported platforms, so they have the highest chance of compatibility with a vendor’s applications, independent of the frameworks and architecture they employ.</p>



<p>Available <a href="https://github.com/sudoplatform">SDKs via GitHub</a> include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Sudos SDK&nbsp; 



 Telephony SDK&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Virtual Cards SDK&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Secure ID Verification SDK&nbsp; 



 Email SDK&nbsp; 



 Site Reputation SDK&nbsp; 



 VPN SDK&nbsp; 



 Password Manager SDK.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Sample apps</p>



<p>Using a sample app is the fastest way to see how the Sudo Platform services work and the value they deliver. Vendors can easily explore the technology and imagine the potential for their products, either as an enhancement or brand new offering.</p>



<p>Sample apps are intended to be lightweight reference apps that demonstrate to application developers basic SDK capabilities. <a href="https://github.com/search?q=org%3Asudoplatform+sample">Sample iOS, Android, and web apps available include</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Telephony Sample App&nbsp;

<p>For generations, teams have <a href="https://doodle.com/en/resources/blog/a-brief-history-of-meetings/?ref=blog.holochain.org">collaborated in physical rooms</a> using materials like whiteboards, sticky notes, and printed documents laid out on tables. While collaboration can be one of those “suitcase words” that is full of different meanings depending on the person you ask, it’s an enduring part of most of our work lives.&nbsp;</p><p>Dedicated spaces enabled the kinds of fluid interaction and embodied cognition which, in turn, drives complex projects forward.</p><p>With today's increasingly distributed digital work environments and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/01/why-labor-economists-say-the-remote-work-revolution-is-here-to-stay.html?ref=blog.holochain.org">work from home</a> setups, can elements of dynamic in-person teamwork successfully be recreated online?</p><p>As video meetings and productivity suites become default remote work tools, teams strive to <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/revolutionizing-the-workspace/">recreate collaborative dynamics digitally</a>. However, experts argue purely digital collaboration has inherent limits.</p><p>This article explores: lessons from physical group flow, key aspects to replicate collaboration digitally, remaining gaps, and the potential of immersive and distributed platforms still on the horizon, like Holochain.&nbsp;</p> The Magic of Physical Spaces <p>For Hailey Cooperrider, game designer and co-founder of collaborative consultancy <a href="https://amble.studio/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Amble</a>, physical spaces enable a “magic” that digital platforms struggle to recreate.&nbsp;</p><p>She argues spatial dynamics like rooms allow more holistic group participation than 2D screens, stating, “I think being in a space with the whiteboard and having room to collaborate together isn’t just for the creative piece. It’s about dealing with complexity.”</p><p>Cooperrider also discusses how “literally, we think, with movement, with our hands, and with other parts of our bodies. And that cognition happens throughout the body.”&nbsp;</p><p>While this radiating, embodied cognition isn’t limited virtually, it certainly thrives in environments where teams can gather together physically.</p><p>When complex creativity and collaboration is required (such as in large groups), in-person spaces currently provide a fluidity that digital tools have difficulty replicating. Large meetings require quick back-and-forth communication among a large number of people — which is more time-consuming on the computer.&nbsp;</p> Bridging Physical &amp; Digital Workflows <p>When considering how to translate collaborative dynamics online, Cooperrider discusses the importance of preserving certain familiar artifacts digitally. For example, she notes that her team relies heavily on Trello's digital task boards to mimic physical sticky notes for project management.</p><p>“We love it, because it just smooths out what would normally be sticky notes, and allows us to bring our own meaning to the lists and the columns," she explains. Rather than prescribe complex new workflows, Trello provides flexibility for groups to organize work their own way.</p><p>Cooperrider also discusses how engineers often focus on operational challenges like reducing friction in workflows. However, she argues digital tools actually work best when preserving existing collaborative platforms and workflows that teams are already familiar with.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, the Google Suite took traditional formats for documents, slides, and spreadsheets, and made them editable in real-time by multiple users online. Rather than adding complicated features to these tools, it kept them simple — and added the utility of collaboration.</p><p>Cooperrider concludes that "the most revolutionary, powerful, and most popular collaboration tool, it’s the Google Suite.”</p><p>While new technologies open new possibilities, they must also integrate the traditional techniques teams have relied on for years, in order to maximize adoption and usage. The future likely involves blending physical “magic” with virtual capabilities.</p> People-First Tools in a Hybrid Future <p>While digital collaboration tools have delivered immense progress, the next horizons explore decentralized and distributed models giving users more control, as with Holochain. Rather than enforce rigid conformity, the ideal future blends customizable peer-to-peer frameworks with thoughtfully designed physical spaces.</p><p>Tools must smooth, not obstruct, the rituals sustaining teams. And digital interactive spaces should spark the embodied cognition inherent to human collaboration. As remote and hybrid work expand, integrating the digital connectivity teams need with the in-person magic they crave is essential.</p><p>The frontier of collaboration technology puts people before platforms, deepening what is uniquely precious about gathering in rooms with resonant virtual capabilities. In the end, innovation emerges from groups in flow — whether particles across cables or shoulder-to-shoulder around whiteboards</p>

<p>In the wake of the hack at MOVEit and far too many other organizations this year, the secure, user-controlled, privacy-preserving benefits of distributed ledger technology (DLT) make it a critical component of a modern identity and access management (IAM) architecture.</p>
<p>That <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/1248857/moveit-carnage-continues-with-over-2600-organizations-and-77m-people-impacted-so-far.html">one breach</a> alone has impacted 2,620 organizations—including Genworth, antivirus providers Avast and Norton, and the US Department of Energy—and 77.2 million people worldwide. The sheer volume of credentials and personal information compromised through downstream attacks is yet to be determined. But the incident and so many others like it drive home one of the biggest challenges of the digital age.</p>
<p>While centralized IAM consolidated the storage and management of identity data and enabled login credentials to be associated with user roles and permissions easily, it also created a single point of failure that cybercriminals continue to exploit to gain access to all the resources those credentials are authorized to access. Call us crazy, but at 1Kosmos, we believe a big part of preventing threat actors from stealing and weaponizing credentials and personally identifiable information (PII) is to avoid centrally storing them in the first place.</p>
 IAM Private &amp; Permissioned: Why DLT Is a BFD 
<p>In Parts <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/possession-is-nine-tenths-of-the-flaw-why-device-based-biometrics-dont-cut-it-for-iam/">2</a> and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blockchain/ditching-the-feds-why-decentralized-digital-identity-is-key-to-effective-iam/">3</a> in this series, we look at how the <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/what-a-difference-identity-makes-why-iam-keeps-falling-short-and-how-to-fix-it/">1Kosmos architecture</a> provides a reliable and secure way to verify the identity of users and<a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication-platform/"> biometrically authenticate</a> them via decentralized digital identity (DID) mechanisms in our BlockID solution—including a reusable <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/decentralized-digital-identity/">digital identity wallet</a>. The next pillar of our architectural advantage is distributed ledger technology for providing a private and permissioned blockchain that eliminates the centralized PII honeypot for good.</p>
<p>Blockchain technology has several security features that provide a proven way to manage and maintain digital property rights. Think user-controlled data, peer-to-peer, cryptographically secure sharing without an administrative intermediary, and an immutable digital “chain of custody” containing a detailed digital audit log of all user authentications. That makes it an ideal technology for managing and protecting users’ digital identity wallets, which can store a wide range of information—personal details, legal and educational credentials, financial accounts, digital health records, and more. The private and permissioned distributed ledger within BlockID delivers several key advantages, including the following.</p>
<p>Privacy by Design</p>
<p>Without a centralized administration authority, our private and permissioned blockchain technology gives individuals sole access and control of all personally identifiable information. This privacy-by-design approach enables end users to view and approve or reject the sharing of any and all information requested by online services or systems they seek to access. All PII is encrypted end-to-end, so it’s never exposed. Users approve or reject sharing requests directly with the applications and systems they connect to—without a third-party intermediary accessing their data. No external public key server, host messaging server, or other entity can access the keys or plaintext messages.</p>
<p>An Immutable Audit Trail</p>
<p>Like a public blockchain, our private and permissioned ledger retains a detailed, immutable audit trail of all events, enabling visibility to all logins, access attempts, information updates, and shared information related to a digital identity. This private ledger acts as a closed network where information from separate organizations or lines of business can be stored separately—each with its own private ledger. This extraordinary level of audit and visibility helps prevent unauthorized access and fraudulent transactions, providing a high level of assurance for the identity behind the device.</p>
<p>Industry Certification for Unrivaled Performance</p>
<p>We built the first (and only) architecture designed to support and exceed the industry’s strictest standards for security and convenience. Because BlockID follows the W3C specifications and is certified to <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST 800-63-3</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-identity-attributes-trust-framework-updated-version">UK DIATF</a>, and <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">FIDO2</a>, it uses public-private key cryptography to record and access all information. The private keys are stored in the secure enclave or TPM chip of the endpoint or the user’s device, which can be secured to the very highest digital standard of IAL2/AAL2 supported by NIST—ensuring credentials never leave the user’s device and are never stored on a server, eliminating the risk of credentials theft, replay attacks, or even user tracking. The next highest level of IAL3/AAL3 is generally reserved for human verification but can be achieved via agent-assisted authentication through 1Kosmos partners.</p>
<p>Security That Gives the PII Honeypot the Heave-Ho</p>

  <p>At Ignite 2022, we announced the general availability of Microsoft Entra certificate-based authentication (CBA) as part of Microsoft’s commitment to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">Executive Order 14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity</a>. Based on our experience working with government customers, PIV/CAC cards are the most common authentication method used within the federal government. While valuable for all customers, the ability to use X.509 certificate for authentication directly against Entra ID is particularly critical for federal government organizations using PIV/CAC cards and looking to easily comply with the Executive Order 14028 requirements as well as customers who want to migrate from a federated server like Active Directory Federated Server to Entra ID for CBA.  &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Since then, we’ve added many new features and enhancements, which made CBA available on all platforms, including mobile, with support for certificates on devices as well as external security keys like YubiKeys. Customers now have more control and flexibility to tailor authentication policies by certificate and resource type, as well as user group and select certificate strength for different users, use CBA with other methods for multi-factor or step-up authentication, and set high affinity (strong) binding for either the entire tenant or by user group.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vimala Ranganathan, Product Manager on Microsoft Entra, will now talk about how these new features will help in your journey toward phishing-resistant MFA.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>  &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, and please let us know your thoughts!  &nbsp;</p>
<p>Alex Weinert &nbsp;</p>

<p>  &nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello everyone,   &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m Vimala from the Microsoft Entra PM team, and I’m excited to walk you through all the new features and enhancements to CBA in detail. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>CBA username bindings CBA added support for three remaining username bindings and is now at parity with on-premises Active Directory. The three bindings that are being added are: &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 IssuerAndSerialNumber  &nbsp; 
 IssuerAndSubject  &nbsp; 
 Subject Only  &nbsp; 
 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>The username binding policy allows admins to customize how Entra ID will match the certificate being presented by the user with their user account in Entra ID. By default, we map Principal Name in the subject Alternative Name (SAN) attribute of the certificate to UserPrincipalName in the user object. An admin can override the default and create a custom mapping. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CBA Authentication policy rules help determine the strength of authentication as either single-factor or multi-factor.&nbsp;Unlike other authentication methods available in Entra ID, which are either always, CBA is capable of being either. We like to refer to this as CBA being a multi-factor capable authentication method, and the authentication policy rules allow the admin to configure protection levels to determine when Entra ID should consider a certificate to be single-factor or multi-factor. Multiple custom authentication binding rules can be created to assign default protection level for certificates based on the certificate attributes (Issuer or Policy OID or by combining the Issuer and OID).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CBA Affinity Binding refers to certificate attributes used for validating a certificate for user authentication. As we introduced earlier, there are several ways a certificate can be bound or matched to a user object. Some methods rely on properties of a user’s certificate that are easily reusable. This reusability characteristic is the key indicator to whether a particular user binding method is High (strong) or Low (weak) affinity. For example, implementing a user binding based on SAN Principal Name would be low affinity, whereas a user binding policy based on Issuer+SerialNumber would be high affinity. Entra ID allows admins to set affinity binding at tenant level, as well as create custom rules to use high affinity or low affinity mapping for covering many potential scenarios our customers have in use today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>CBA as Most Recently Used (MRU) method is set once a user authenticates successfully using CBA, and the user's MRU authentication method is set to CBA. Next time, when the user enters their UPN and clicks&nbsp;Next, the user is taken to the CBA method directly and need not select&nbsp;‘Use the certificate or smart card.’ To reset the MRU method, the user needs to cancel the certificate picker, click&nbsp;‘Other ways to sign in,’ and select another method available to the user and authenticate successfully.

<p>Digital wallets have emerged as a preferred payment method in the Middle East and Africa, and customers are willing to leave their wallets at home rather than their phones. Offering digital payment solutions and pursuing a digital transformation is key for banks to stay competitive.</p>
<p>On November 7, 2023, we hosted a <a href="https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/17380/593634?utm_source=Entrust&amp;utm_medium=brighttalk&amp;utm_campaign=593634">webinar</a> with Izabela Morriss, Vice President of Global Channel Sales &amp; Tech Partnerships at CR2, and Andy Cease, Director of Product Marketing Financial Issuance at Entrust. During this engaging thought leadership discussion, we gained valuable insights into the payment preferences of cardholders in the Middle East and Africa, as well as the challenges financial institutions face in offering a digital-first customer experience.</p>
<p>Here is what we heard from them:</p>
 
 Adoption of digital payments in the Middle East and Africa 
 
 
<p>Contactless payments are rapidly gaining popularity in the Middle East and Africa. People love the convenience and speed of making payments with contactless cards and digital wallets.</p>
<p>This drive for convenience is advancing the convergence of speed and simplicity, alongside elevated security measures. Contactless payments, appreciated for their convenience and speed, are quickly gaining popularity in the Middle East and Africa. Globally, demand is also increasing, but it’s particularly flourishing in this region.</p>
<p>In a 2022 McKinsey report, 60% of global respondents said they prefer to leverage mobile wallets for their digital payments. With an 80%-90% smartphone penetration, it’s no wonder customers in the Middle East are seeking out seamless digital payment experiences (<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/the-future-of-payments-in-the-middle-east">McKinsey, The future of payments in the Middle East, 2022</a>). Offering digital payment options is a way for banks and credit unions to answer this demand, differentiate themselves, and be perceived as modern and innovative leaders. If they don’t, they’ll be left behind and viewed as archaic and out of touch.</p>
<p>With quick and secure transactions, customers can easily pay anytime, anywhere, without the need for cash or physical cards. Digital cards are especially relevant for in-store use, but near field communication (NFC) payment from the banking app is a way of answering the need for instant and contactless digital payments.</p>
<p>Izabela from CR2 explained that they see a strong demand for customer-centric digital payment solutions. In both the Middle East and Africa, customers are showing an increasing interest in different payment solutions. They want innovative options and are looking at what is being proposed outside of the region. Customers are seeking secure, convenient, seamless digital payment experiences that align with their diverse requirements, be it for e-commerce, mobile apps, or in-store transactions. This shift highlights the urgency for banks to evolve and cater to these changing needs.</p>
<p>We see the rise of financial inclusion in Africa, characterized by its young population, is at the forefront of the continent’s mobile money transformation. This rise is underscored by a high penetration of mobile devices. Eighty four percent of internet users in Kenya used their mobile phones for payments, mirroring a similar trend where 60% of internet users in Nigeria and across Africa did the same. In 2021, East Africa reported 296 million registered mobile money accounts (<a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/27017/mobile-payment-in-africa/">2021 Statista Global Consumer Survey</a>).</p>
<p>These statistics highlight the profound impact mobile payments have on driving financial inclusion, particularly in Africa where there’s a need to reach the unbanked. This trend also presents a significant marketing opportunity for financial institutions. The push toward digital payments in the Middle East and Africa is largely driven by the intent to support financial inclusion. Facilitating banking services through digital channels allows even the unbanked and underserved populations to actively participate in the financial landscape, paving the way for empowered communities and fostering economic growth. In a world where 1.4 billion individuals remain unbanked (<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2022/07/21/covid-19-boosted-the-adoption-of-digital-financial-services">World Bank Global Findex 2021 database</a>), the need for a significant shift is necessary.</p>
<p>In Africa, Izabela observes a market dynamic driven by the goal of reaching the unbanked population. There’s a noticeable trend of transitioning directly from mobile phone operator/money transfer services to mobile wallets, bypassing traditional physical payment cards.</p>
<p>The digital-first transformation in the Middle East stems from a demand for convenience, security, and a desire for financial institutions to provide a seamless customer journey. Mobile banking enables them to do that.</p>
 
 
 Why financial institutions want to offer contactless payments and digital card issuance 
 
 
<p>The innovation of tokenization has made digital card issuance possible. Banks want to innovate, keep their customers, and enhance convenience for their customers, ensuring satisfaction at every turn. Security is top of mind for cardholders as well as banks.</p>
<p>Izabela explains that banks in regions such as Ethiopia or Nigeria are particularly sensitive to questions of sustainability. Using tokenization for digital card issuance allows them to reduce their plastic usage, aligning with their sustainability goals.</p>
<p>The economy in Africa is still very cash-driven: 90% of transactions are made with cash (<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/the-future-of-payments-in-africa">McKinsey, The future of payments in Africa, 2022</a>). There is a huge opportunity for banks to shift from cash-based transactions and pave the way for digital transactions. Again, this will also allow them to promote financial inclusion and transparency. Many countries have not fully adopted the physical payment card, and they are expected to skip the issuance of physical cards and directly adopt digital cards. Banks must be ready for this change. Izabela expects that digital wallets will dominate the payment landscape within the next two years. Several African central banks, such as those in Rwanda and Nigeria, are driving a vision of a cashless economy.</p>
<p>Differences in demand can be observed across diverse age groups. However, banks recognize that to stay competitive, they must offer very targeted, personalized customer journeys that cater to the varying demands of all demographics. Offering more capabilities within the mobile banking app ensures that it is at the core of the bank-customer relationship.</p>
<p>Banks can expect increased usage of their card portfolio, earlier activations, and broader outreach to diverse demographics, ultimately leading to higher customer satisfaction. Additionally, cost-saving incentives serve as an important motivator compelling financial institutions to provide digital payment solutions.</p>
<p>Moreover, traditional banks are increasingly feeling the competitive pressure from emerging players like neobanks, which continue to obtain banking licenses, compelling traditional institutions to remain relevant.</p>
 
 
 Challenges for banks to implement this 
 
 
<p>Answering the very diverse demands of cardholders has been made possible by innovations in the payment space during the last few years.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, security is top of mind, both for financial institutions and cardholders. Tokenized cards offer the highest level of security when it comes to payments. Andy from Entrust explained that tokenization enables the consumer to take control again, as the tokens are device-bound or market-bound, offering cardholders a very convenient experience. Tokenization technology, championed by major schemes like Visa and Mastercard, is a necessary prerequisite for the issuance of digital cards. To give a quick explanation: Tokenization substitutes sensitive card data with unique tokens tied to specific devices and use cases. This ensures secure transactions while enabling banks to minimize the risk of fraud. <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/03/tokenization-enabling-the-intersection-of-data-security-and-exceptional-user-experiences/">This article</a> explains the functioning and value of tokenization more in detail.</p>
<p>And of course, <a href="https://www.entrust.com/issuance-systems/products/software/entrust-digital-card-solution">digital card issuance</a> allows financial institutions to offer a digital-first user and payment experience.</p>
<p>While banks in the Middle East and Africa now want to take active steps toward a digital transformation, they also realize that it is not as simple as it may seem. They want to be innovative, but do not know where to start. Most banks struggle to combine a seamless, digital-first, innovative payment experience with the highest level of security, while keeping integration and maintenance of such a solution lightweight.</p>
<p>Izabela notes that most banks are starting to have a good understanding of tokenization; current operational discussions are around identifying the correct next steps and implementing technology for the benefit of the cardholder. Addressing legacy technology and infrastructure presents a significant challenge for banks. How can they leverage their existing resources to enable a digital wallet effectively? What role does the card management system play? Which tokenization partner should they choose? How can the digital wallet be embedded within the existing banking application?</p>
 
 
 Technology alliance partnership between CR2 and Entrust 
 
 
<p>We know that the digital revolution is here, and that banks need to transform their service model to meet the expectations for convenient banking that offers anywhere, anytime access.

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Oscar: Is this the right time to invest in Identity and Access Management? This week Jesse Kurtto from Ubisecure has joined us to answer this question and discuss the current economic situation. Stay tuned to find out more.</p>
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar: Today’s guest is Jesse Kurtto. Jesse’s career has gradually arched from the Wild West world of finance, to his current position as a Data Protection Officer and Data Scientist at Ubisecure. Learning Program before learning to read Finnish and visiting 25 countries before 25. He is no stranger to exploring unchartered waters and discovering connections that others might miss. Surrounded by a delicate balance of the latest technology and dozens of carefully tended houseplants, his secret hobby is writing to his beloved snail mail friends across the world. Welcome Jesse.</p>
<p>Jesse: Thank you for the invite, Oscar. Nice to be here.</p>
<p>Oscar: Great having you, Jesse, definitely. We’re going to have a super interesting conversation about the market in Digital Identity and Identity and Access Management.</p>
<p>First of all, we always want to hear more about our guests. So please tell us a bit about yourself and your journey to the world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Jesse: All right. So, like many or even most of us in the digital identity field, I actually never really actively sought to be a specialist, IAM specialist, on purpose. And my personal background is actually nothing technology even, but in finance and investing more specifically. So, a chance encounter and I liked the people who interviewed me and decided to stay for a while, and that while has been over seven years now. And I’m still learning something new every day, checking out how we really the world of digital identity like and frankly haven’t ever regretted decision. No two days have really been the same and the field continues to evolve and develop quite a bit every year.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent and definitely hearing at Ubisecure, we definitely appreciate having this – well call it, like a blend of knowledge – the financial market, not lesser than what you bring with the security and digital identity knowledge, very practical knowledge you also had. So, it’s always super interesting having those conversation with you.</p>
<p>And for the first time here on the podcast, we are going to have that, a bit more financial touch on that – What is coming, especially in this well this year, and I think also the years to come. The previous year and the year to come I think, we are already end of 2023 in which – well the financial situation is not good we’re going to talk about. But of course, no matter how the economy is, the companies organisation has to protect their services, have to upgrade the services, maintain them, so they have to invest some money in that.</p>
<p>So, from the perspective of companies who today need to upgrade their digital capabilities, what would you say is the piece of the current macroeconomic situation that they should know well? So that was at least what they should know well, from what is happening now?</p>
<p>Jesse: Well, first of all, we all know the macroeconomic situation hasn’t really been dancing on the roses over the past few years. But first, we had a massive shock with the COVID pandemic starting from spring 2020. Then we got massive economic stimulus to recover from that slump. And right after we were starting to climb up, then the war in Ukraine saw that all kinds of new problems everywhere around the world seemed to emerge just within three or four months.</p>
<p>The energy uncertainty in Europe and the economy went down the drain, and macroeconomic in quite a difficult situation here in Europe. But we would actually want to have some kind of stimulus in order to recover. But at the same time, we are suffering from quite persistently high inflation, which makes any kind of stimulus package basically equal to pouring more gasoline to the flames.</p>
<p>So, the European bank is really between a rock and a hard place here. And I can only look over the Atlantic to the States and be very jealous how they are able to both fight inflation and with high interest rates, five and a half percent this talking and meanwhile still have a blisteringly red-hot labour market all but there.</p>
<p>So, my first point would be that not all markets are equal. And the second important point is that now is actually a really great time to invest in any digital capabilities, including digital identities. Because now, we are in the middle of a small recession in Europe and investing in recession has historically been the very best time to invest in growth.</p>
<p>And if we think for a while, it actually makes perfect sense. After all, the alternative is to invest in the middle of a growth season when everybody else wants to invest in growth as well. Pushing prices even higher and reducing the availability of experts to help with these transformation projects. But now it’s still for a while kind of a buyer’s market.</p>
<p>So best time to invest in future growth is now.</p>
<p>Oscar: So, time to invest is now.</p>
<p>Jesse: Yes.</p>
<p>Oscar: Okay. So, let’s go into what – because there are many things that the company can invest now and many things that many companies might need. But if you were one of the – chief executive, like CISO, or someone who is top decision makers in companies and there has to be some budget for digital identity. Thinking of – first of all broadly. Broadly but in digital identity, what would be the most important products that today would be the top priority for buying now?</p>
<p>Jesse: Today I would say that the absolute top priority would be – to establish really low friction user journeys from the very beginning account registration to the actual purchase, including solid online self-service. And now this low friction user journey is no way exclusive with security or compliance, but it is actually reaping the benefits of digitalisation. Digitalisation is ongoing, it’s accelerating, it’s unstoppable.</p>
<p>So, the question is for every organisation – should they try to fight this change to the last or embrace it and be among the first to actually reap its benefits. It’s actually interesting because my background in finance, the many finance sector operators were among the first to embrace digital identities, but they kind of stopped it halfway there; “Okay, we can build self-service portals for our users, but for many, many procedures we still require hand signed paper documents being sent via physical mail.” And this is really only reaping a very small part of the benefits of digitalisation. So, there is plenty to go.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. Interesting what you say in finance services. That’s correct. For reasons of security had to be always in the latest of technology for security. But some of the process has been, as you say, very old fashioned like the old school, many paper fax I think still use or cheques. So, these kind of.</p>
<p>Jesse: Oh yes, those ones to.</p>
<p>Oscar: Still alive.</p>
<p>Jesse: Yes. And it truly hurts the user experience a lot. It even causes direct missed opportunities. Let’s say new bond is coming to a market and you wish to buy a piece of it and participate. But if it takes three or four days just to do all the paperwork, then the opportunity has simply passed.</p>
<p>Oscar: And indeed, the price changed completely. Okay, so you say that the top is to – the user journey has to be digitalised. So, what is the category of products that address that?</p>
<p>Jesse: Would say a real CIAM system would be the one to go here, and not try to build the user journey from, let’s say 4 to 6-point solutions and then somehow glue them together. I think the best solution would be an IAM solution that’s designed for a whole user journey from the scratch and not something homemade or batched together.</p>
<p>Because when business grows, as it will eventually grow, no recession will last forever. And to user numbers pick up and suddenly there’s a nightmare of issues of having 4 to 6 different vendors and trying to keep their products up and running with ever increasing user numbers. And that again, is doing digitalisation the wrong way, if I may say.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. CIAM being – so how, well the evolution of the more broadly speaking, Identity and Access Management. Maybe you can give us an overview of that evolution of the Identity and Access Management, what – how we started and what we have today.</p>
<p>Jesse: Yeah, that’s a very interesting topic. Through the IAM are from big enterprise internal needs at once to employee numbers just grow to a certain level, they can’t be managed with excel sheets or pen and paper before that. But these kind of internal IAM solutions scale and fit really badly for end customer facing journeys. Internal users can always be taught how to use some kind of system, even if it’s not immediately logical or it feels unwieldy.</p>
<p>But for the customers, it’s not realistic to expect that they would spend tens of minutes or even hours to learn how to use some kind of system to log in. And no, they would simply instead put down their laptops, pick up the phone and call your customer service. So, it will actually just cost you more money to have this kind of system.</p>
<p>And now, in the past ten years, there have been massive uptake of different CIAM systems. And lately, let’s say after the pandemic, it’s interesting to see that now the full circle is coming back towards internal users with remote working. Remote working, different kind of partnerships, there are more kind of internal and kind of external users than ever, and trying to keep these as fully separate groups is very challenging.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. So, what about the investment of a company in Identity and Access Management? So what does that imply if the company does not have even, let’s say, a first personal CIAM or open source, something that they started, if they if the company really doesn’t, which actually to me surprise me that, you discover companies don’t have it, don’t have it, almost anything like identity access management and they are looking for some solutions or they are or they know that they need it. Maybe the decision has not come.</p>
<p>So why would you say is important for the buyers to know about the product, the Identity and Access Management product?</p>
<p>Jesse: That’s an interesting detail what you said that there’s still about 20-25% of companies in Europe that do not have any kind of Identity and Access Management system in place. So, one could argue that every IAM’s companies’ worst competitor is doing nothing. But to the question at hand, I’d say scalability is one very important thing, and compliance. If one doesn’t have any kind of identity management system in place, then it’s extremely hard to tell where and by who are the user identities actually stored.</p>
<p>And of course, that is a massive no in the eyes of the GDPR and this kind of adventures just don’t usually end up well. So first job would be to map out how many identities there are in the first place, how it has evolved over the recent quarters and where they are located, how many systems actually are connected, including partners, including systems like let’s say payroll providers, insurance providers, and usually the number is quite surprising. It can often be more than ten individual systems.</p>
<p>And now managing all these identities from a single centralised place is frankly a godsend compared to trying to manage this and plus sprawling network identity some here, some there. And of course, it also brings centralised identity management, also brings massive security benefits. For example, if you wish to revoke the access for, let’s say some external consultants that have already finished their projects, you only have one place to do it or you can even automate it.</p>
<p>But if the identities are in ten systems, 15 systems, then it’s really easy to forget just one. And who knows, maybe five, ten years later, one of those passwords will get breached and now the attacker gets to your system for free.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, what is normally called silos, identity silos. Having so many data repositories and it’s -through the years it’s easy to forget at least couple of those are forgotten but they are still there somewhere in there in some machine, in some server. So, the data is there.</p>
<p>Jesse: Yes. And of course, I’ve heard many times the counterargument that it’s not wise to put all eggs in one basket, but when it comes to information security, we as the defenders must secure every single system that we use. But the attacker only needs to find one weak system to exploit.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, yeah, exactly. They can just find the forgotten one, the one that nobody remembers that.</p>
<p>So, what the company – the buyers should ask for a technology vendor? So, for a CIAM vendor? So, what are the most important things that’s should be – has to be asked to the vendors?</p>
<p>Jesse: I would ask them to demonstrate the self-service capabilities first. What exactly the users can and cannot accept less without external help? Meaning customer service assistance. Because that sets quite stringent limits on the benefits of digitalisation. And of course, all the usual user journeys should be handled by the system automatically. So, I would guess that any IAM project touches deeply.</p>
<p>So, I would first describe the challenges we are facing. And then I’d ask vendor to explain, just in plain English, that – how does the solution work and how does it actually solve the challenge that we just presented? And after all, one should never invest in anything that one doesn’t understand.</p>
<p>Another point I would like to address early in any IAM project is to what is actually included in the price and what isn’t. In order to actually accurately measure the TCO and how it would evolve as internal and external user base grows. And for example, there are many vendors out that charge ten to even hundred times for internal users compared to external users, and that’s not usually put on a large print on the front page.</p>
<p>And finally, I would discuss any coming changes in legislation because I would be very interested to know whether any changes will be covered under the current proposal or will it occur additional project and additional costs in the future. Change is, after all, inevitable.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I think that’s very important. We know in – in the European Union it’s coming the digital wallet that’s going to come in. Well, how many years do you predict at this moment?</p>
<p>Jesse: I’m optimistic and say late ‘24 launch for some countries. ‘25 mass adoption and hopefully organisational identities soon after.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, and that’s something that I think very few people would argue that that will be – that will not have some considerable success because there’s a lot of time invested in people preparing all these new standards in this part of the evolution. What we have been seeing before with Self Sovereign Identity (SSI), the wallet itself is something that is already becoming very popular in the commercial side. So that will come in.</p>
<p>Similarly, in other geographies, there will be similar initiatives, there will be new regulations. So that, through all this, the vendor has to offer that, has to tell whether we offer or not. So that’s definitely a good, good aspect you mentioned.</p>
<p>Jesse: Yes. And the commission has made clear goals here to avoid repeating the mistakes of the eIDAS 1.0, that was supposed to bring cross-border digital identities to Europe. Well, we all know that it was a commercial failure, but they have really learned from that, and I have great hopes for the EUDI. Both for personal identities and for organisational identities, and especially for the latter one.</p>
<p>I believe that the market is currently suffering from a kind of chicken and egg problem here, that everybody’s waiting for cross-border organisational identities and not building services because they aren’t here yet. So, we might see the floodgates open in the late 2020s.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. I also believe that as a lot will change in more or less like the, as you say in the next 12-24 months is going to change a lot, in a good way I believe. So definitely exciting to be at this moment. We’ve been talking a lot about Identity and Access Management, other aspects, other type of technology that are also in the minds of the executives who are going to upgrade their technologies. We hear a lot about passwords in the last year. Well, ‘cryptocurrencies’ is getting a bit more quiet. Today we hear a lot about artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Would you recognise some technology that is actually underrated, that not many people are talking about? But these business buyers should be aware, because the impact will be even bigger than those buzzwords. So, what would you say?</p>
<p>Jesse: I would say that the coming EUDI and its principle of Self-Sovereign Identities is something that might cause quite big ripples in the identity landscape. The very basic idea that it’s the end user themselves who collect attributes and control to whom and when they release those attributes. That that is very different from the usual data repository centric view that – okay, we have this database, and we control everything here. Everything is set in stone.</p>
<p>But when the end users actually decide which attributes to release and which not. Then one can’t take for granted that, “Okay, we always have every single field in our database field. Every user record looks similar in a structural level.” That is no longer true and that might cause some changes.</p>
<p>As for technology, I have great hopes for machine learning and especially how it can help accomplish not zero trust, no. But zero friction user journeys. And I don’t mean a strong AI that is still decades into future, if ever. But simple things like; is the user using a different device to log in or the same device as before? And so on.</p>
<p>For example, I have a recently having a quick holiday in the US, and I was frankly quite shocked when I logged into some financial services – using a completely different device that I had never used, on completely opposite time of the day. I was even physically located on a different continent. And no MFA prompts, nothing. Just inputting my password, I was in.</p>
<p>And that’s a lot of missed risk management there, for both parties. For me as an end user and for the financial service provider. And I believe this is something that will change sooner or later. And of course, I would like, as an end user, for this to work for the opposite way as well. That if I’m logging in using the same device, about the same time of the day, from same city that I’ve done it for hundreds and hundreds of times – then perhaps I could be spared the MFA fatigue and just get in with my password managers embraced password.</p>
<p>Oscar: The technology doesn’t bother you when you are in the habitual way of interacting with, let’s say, the banks.</p>
<p>Jesse: Yeah, exactly. It should take always the context of the transaction into account. And frankly, what I would like to see many companies to do is; do a more thorough risk analysis at what they are actually trying to defend against. I can give a real-world example.</p>
<p>About a month ago, I drove to a gas station, put my car to charge, decided that I’ll have a coffee there. Opened the app and saw, hey, there’s an offer for a coffee and a doughnut €1 off. Great.</p>
<p>Okay, it seems that first, I needed to update the app to actually buy. Okay, well, I’ll do it.</p>
<p>Then they wanted to add the credit card directly to the app, alright. Got an MFA from that.</p>
<p>Then when I actually wanted to make the purchase, I got yet another prompt and confirmation, this time from my bank. That – ‘Hey, in order to buy this €3.50 product, would you please update our app again, and use it as an MFA to confirm this purchase’. For the third time.</p>
<p>And by that time, I already got notification that, ‘hey, your car has charged’, and my coffee was called by then and left it there.</p>
<p>So that was the opposite of Zero Friction. That was more of a zero trust like game. But the security solution that’s very fitting for, let’s say, authorising nuclear missile launch, is very different than the security that’s needed to confirm a €3 coffee purchased at the gas station.</p>
<p>And as discussed earlier, I believe this problem stems – that solution was built from very small parts and every individual vendor only looked after their own interest, only want to save their back in case of any kind of misuse. But nobody took a step backwards to actually see; What we are trying to defend against here? What is the attack vector here? That okay, somebody misuses this app and clones this coupon and gets two coffees and doughnuts for a €3 each. Okay, so how much is an attacker willing to put time and money into such attack? I guess nobody stop to think about it. And as a result, the whole user journey was just failure.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, complete failure indeed. Very good way to bring back the very first thing you said, User Journey. Yeah, that’s a specific example how things can happen. Sounds like a marvellous opportunity, not to get a deal nice and then becomes complete failure.</p>
<p>Jesse, one final question I would like to ask you is – for all business leaders listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Jesse: I would dream that every executive would dedicate one day, one whole day to actually be an end user for a day and go through their company’s entire flow. All the way from account registration to actually purchasing to product or service that they’re selling. And if there’s time trying out things like forgotten password resets. And then the next day repeating the same procedure for the top competitor and even more importantly, their newest competitor, because that is where the threat of digitalisation is coming.</p>
<p>Oscar: Going to be very revealing.</p>
<p>Jesse: Yes, and it’s important to go through the entire journey. If one, simply takes it piecemeal. And of course, every piece may look perfectly fine. Okay, this works like this. It has confirmations like this. Great. Next piece. Next piece, Next piece. All right. Everything looks fine. But then actually going through the process, one gets hit by four or five different confirmations, forced updates, all kinds of non-user-friendly things, and that won’t fly.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely a very good experiment, actionable idea. Absolutely. Well, thank you very much, Jesse for telling us all this about the – how the companies and why companies should invest in the digital identity and why today.</p>
<p>Let us know why people would like to get in touch with you or follow you or learn more about what we are doing. What are the best ways for that?</p>
<p>Jesse: All right. Thank you. First, I would ask everybody to check out <a href="http://www.ubisecure.com/" title="ubisecure.com">ubisecure.com</a>, and see how we are approaching these problems on the market. And if needed, I would be very happy to have a chat, over a virtual or real coffee, and I can be contacted at <a href="mailto:jesse.kurtto@ubisecure.com">jesse.kurtto@ubisecure.com</a> at anytime.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Marius Goeddert</a></p><p>With our first speakers release, we are letting loose four tech experts from the finance industry. Despite some of the industry-specific challenges, IAM and cybersecurity professionals from finance can offer valuable insights and lessons learned that can be translated to other sectors seeking to enhance their identity and access management practices.</p>
<p>The relevance of identity management in finance</p>
<p>Identity management is integral to financial services for various reasons. Robust systems enhance security by verifying and authenticating user identities, employing methods like multi-factor authentication and biometrics to prevent unauthorized access and reduce fraud. Compliance with regulatory requirements, such as KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (anti-money laundering), is ensured through effective identity management.</p>
<p>Building customer trust is another crucial aspect, because secure identities foster confidence in engaging with digital financial services. Personalized offerings based on accurate customer data, operational efficiency, and streamlined transactions are facilitated by sound identity management practices. In the context of digital transformation, identity management is foundational for seamless and secure digital experiences, including online banking and mobile payments.</p>
<p>Risk management benefits from effective identity verification, helping to identify and mitigate potential risks. Furthermore, in the globalized financial landscape, proper identity management supports cross-border transactions by ensuring compliance with international regulations and standards, fostering trust in transactions across different jurisdictions.</p>
<p>In summary, identity management in financial services is not just about verifying who someone is; it's a fundamental aspect of ensuring security, compliance, and efficiency in an increasingly digital and interconnected financial world.</p>

 COVID-19 Test data leak: Strengthening data security with decentralized identity and verifiable digital credentials <p>Without sensationalizing the recent breach that claims to have leaked the data of millions of citizens, this blog delves into what a perfect future can safeguard from such breaches.</p><p>In today’s rapidly evolving digital landscape, concerns over data breaches and identity theft have reached alarming levels, exemplified by the recently claimed leak of COVID-19 test information of approximately 81.5 crore Indian citizens online. This incident underscores the pressing need for robust solutions to safeguard sensitive and personally identifiable information.</p><blockquote>In this blog post, we will explore the technologies currently employed to protect centralized data, the methods hackers use to breach these technologies, and how decentralized identity or Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) offer a promising solution to prevent such data breaches.</blockquote><p>The Breach Unveiled:</p><p>The breach, orchestrated by an entity known as ‘pwn001,’ claims to have exposed sensitive data sourced from the Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) database. As we get to know from the <a href="https://www.news18.com/india/indias-biggest-data-leak-so-far-covid-19-test-info-of-81-5cr-citizens-with-icmr-up-for-sale-exclusive-8637743.html">News 18 Report</a>, this leaked data included Aadhaar and passport numbers, names, phone numbers, and addresses, highlighting the magnitude of the incident.</p><p>Centralized Data — A Honey&nbsp;Pot?:</p><p>Central agencies such as the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) employ several cutting-edge technologies to protect citizen data. Encryption, multi-factor authentication, access control, and regular security assessments are among the strategies in place. However, all this data is centrally stored. Despite these measures, hackers continue to find ways to breach these defenses, particularly in safeguarding personally identifiable information (PII). Cybercriminals, armed with social engineering tactics and insider information, persistently exploit vulnerabilities in existing security systems. These challenges necessitate innovative solutions to ensure comprehensive data protection.</p><p>How Hackers Breach Current Security Measures:</p><p>In the ever-evolving digital landscape, hackers employ a variety of techniques to breach existing security protocols, posing a significant threat to sensitive data like citizen information. One common method involves Exploiting Vulnerabilities, where cybercriminals target weaknesses in software, networks, or user behavior. Systems left unpatched or outdated software become vulnerable entry points, granting unauthorized access to malicious actors. Another prevalent tactic is Social Engineering, which encompasses phishing attacks and manipulative strategies to deceive individuals into revealing confidential information, including login credentials. By exploiting human psychology and trust, hackers sidestep security measures, gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data. Moreover, Insider Threats present an internal challenge, as employees or contractors with access to Aadhaar data may misuse their privileges intentionally, leading to detrimental data breaches from within organizational boundaries.</p><p>Safeguarding COVID Vaccination Data: A Decentralized Identity&nbsp;Approach</p><p>The vulnerabilities inherent in centralized databases that house COVID-19 vaccination information have become increasingly evident. To enhance the security of vaccination certificates and mitigate the risks associated with centralized systems, a decentralized identity solution is imperative. Notably, centralized databases like the one employed by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) are susceptible to substantial data breaches, putting the privacy of millions at&nbsp;risk.</p><p>Proposed Solution:</p><p>Implement a system wherein unique Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are assigned to individuals, securely anchored on a blockchain. Acting as an issuer, pathology entities provide Verifiable Credentials for COVID vaccinations to individual DIDs. These digital Verifiable Credentials are stored in decentralized identity wallets, containing specific vaccination details. Grant individuals control over their Verifiable Credentials, empowering them to selectively share information. Facilitate selective disclosure through Verifiable Presentations, enabling individuals to share pertinent details as required.</p><p>Leverage blockchain technology to anchor DIDs and store decentralized identity transactions, ensuring data immutability. Incorporate zero-knowledge proofs for privacy, allowing for proof of vaccination without unnecessary data exposure. Distribute data across a decentralized network to effectively mitigate the risk of large-scale breaches. This comprehensive approach aims to establish a robust and secure framework for managing COVID-19 vaccination information, safeguarding individual privacy and data integrity.</p><p>The Promise of Decentralized Identity and SSI (Self-Sovereign Identity):</p><p>Addressing these sophisticated threats requires a proactive approach. Since hackers innovate new ways to exploit vulnerabilities, it is the need of the hour for Data Controllers to also explore new ways and innovative solutions to safeguard such&nbsp;data.</p><p>Exploring innovative security solutions, such as Decentralized Identity and <a href="https://ayanworks.com/services/decentralized-digital-identity-and-verifiable-credentials">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a>, becomes crucial. These advanced technologies empower individuals, enhance control over personal data, and significantly mitigate the risks associated with vulnerabilities, social engineering, and insider threats. These technologies present a paradigm shift in the following ways:</p>  User-Centric Security: Decentralized Identity and SSI prioritize user empowerment, allowing individuals to take control of their own digital identities and personally identifiable information (PII). Users can manage their data, granting or revoking access as needed, thus enhancing privacy and consent management.  Immutable Blockchain Technology: Leveraging blockchain, these solutions ensure data integrity and immutability. By recording transactions in a tamper-proof ledger, the authenticity of user identities is preserved, mitigating the risk of unauthorized alterations and ensuring the credibility of stored information.  Eliminating Centralized Vulnerabilities: Unlike conventional systems reliant on centralized databases, Decentralized Identity and SSI distribute identity information across a decentralized network. This decentralization significantly reduces the appeal of data breaches for malicious actors. Hacking into a single centralized repository becomes virtually futile, enhancing overall security for stored personally identifiable information (PII). Further extending to this, Decentralized Identity or SSI uses state-of-the-art cryptography to encrypt the data at rest and data in flight, resulting in a significant reduction in data breaches.  <p>Conclusion:</p><p>The recent data breach incident highlights the urgent need for advanced solutions in safeguarding data privacy. While current technologies offer robust security measures, they are not foolproof. Incorporating <a href="https://ayanworks.com/services/decentralized-digital-identity-and-verifiable-credentials">Decentralized Identity</a> and SSI solutions into existing security frameworks not only fortifies defenses against cyber threats but also ensures that personally identifiable information (PII) remains secure and under the control of its rightful owners. By embracing these transformative technologies, organizations and individuals can navigate the evolving threat landscape with confidence, safeguarding sensitive data and preserving the privacy and trust of all stakeholders involved.</p><p><a href="https://ayanworks.com/">AyanWorks</a> offers user-friendly solutions to safeguard your digital identity and data.

<p>In today’s digital age, online authentication has become increasingly challenging. Traditional passwords have proven to be inefficient and under constant cyber-attacks. However, today we have a new way to manage our authentication: self-sovereign identity (SSI). SSI is a model that enables authentication by empowering users by giving them full control over their digital identity.</p>



<p>In this article, we will explore how self-sovereign identity will redefine online authentication, providing a much more secure and efficient solution for protecting our data and privacy in an increasingly digital world.</p>



 The problem with traditional passwords and centralized databases 



<p>One of the main problems with traditional passwords lies in the fact that they are stored in centralized databases. This poses a significant risk because, if an attacker gains access to this database, they can easily obtain the passwords of multiple users.<br>Over the years, we have witnessed many, many cases where centralized databases have been hacked and millions of users’ passwords and private data stolen. </p>



<p>These cyber attacks have exposed the inherent vulnerability of this system. Even if users choose strong and unique passwords, if the central databases do not have adequate security measures in place, they may still be vulnerable to hacking.</p>



<p>In addition, these security measures to protect centralized databases are becoming more and more costly, as attack techniques are becoming more refined, more efficient and more difficult to prevent. If we add to this the explosion of artificial intelligence that we are experiencing, it will soon be almost unfeasible to prevent cyber attacks and fraud on the Internet.</p>



 Self-Sovereign Identity as a method of authentication 



<p>Self-sovereign identity is a revolutionary approach to online authentication that puts privacy and security at the center of its design. Instead of relying on centralized third parties, such as companies or government institutions, self-sovereign identity gives individuals full control over their digital identity. It uses decentralized technologies such as blockchain to provide a secure and trusted system.</p>



<p>In a self-sovereign identity system, users have the ability to create, own and manage their own digital identity. This involves the generation of unique cryptographic keys that are used to sign and verify transactions. These cryptographic keys are stored in a personal digital wallet, which is protected with a strong password or even biometrics.</p>



 Benefits of self-sovereign identity (SSI) 



<p>Self-sovereign identity offers a number of benefits compared to traditional passwords and other authentication systems. </p>



 Some of these benefits include: 



 
 Increased security: by decentralizing identity control, the possibility of cyber attacks is significantly reduced. Cryptographic keys and blockchain technology provide an additional level of security. 



 Enhanced privacy: With self-sovereign identity, users have the power to share only the information needed for each online interaction, without revealing more personal data than necessary. 



 Elimination of passwords: By using cryptographic keys, self-sovereign identity eliminates the need for traditional passwords, which not only reduces the possibility of theft and password-based attacks, but also vastly improves the user experience. 



 Increased convenience: Self-sovereign identity simplifies the authentication process by allowing users to access multiple online services with a single identity, eliminating the need to remember multiple passwords. 
 



 The future of authentication with SSI 



<p>Self-sovereign identity is a promising approach that is redefining the way we authenticate online. By giving individuals full control over their digital identity and eliminating the reliance on traditional passwords, self-sovereign identity offers a more secure, private and convenient solution. While there are still challenges to overcome, the potential of self-sovereign identity to transform online authentication is clear.</p>

 Zencity: This is a decentralized platform that allows scientists to collaborate on research projects and to share data in a secure and transparent manner. The platform uses blockchain technology to track the provenance of data and to ensure that it has been properly reviewed and validated. 
 



 DeSci future potential and importance: 



<p>Decentralized science has the potential to revolutionize the way that scientific research is conducted. DeSci utilizes decentralized technologies, such as blockchain and peer-to-peer networks, to facilitate collaboration and data sharing among scientists. Some of the reasons why DeSci is important include:</p>



 
 Increased collaboration: DeSci allows for greater collaboration among scientists from different institutions and countries. This can lead to faster and more impactful research, as scientists can more easily share ideas and data. 



 Increased transparency: DeSci can create a more open and transparent scientific process by making it easier to track the provenance of data and to ensure that it has been properly reviewed and validated. 



 Greater accessibility: DeSci can democratize the scientific process by making it more accessible to a wider range of researchers. For example, scientists in developing countries may not have access to the same resources and funding as those in developed countries. DeSci can help to level the playing field and allow these researchers to more easily collaborate with their counterparts around the world. 



 Reduced risk of scientific misconduct: DeSci can help to reduce the risk of scientific misconduct, such as data fabrication or plagiarism, by making it easier to track the provenance of data and to ensure that it has been properly reviewed and validated. 
 



 Overall 



<p>DeSci has the potential to significantly improve the way that scientific research is conducted, leading to faster and more impactful research that benefits society as a whole.</p>



<p>However, there are also challenges that need to be addressed in order to ensure the success of decentralized science.</p><p>The post <a href="https://extrimian.io/resources/blog/an-introduction-to-decentralized-science-desci/">An introduction to Decentralized Science (DeSci)</a> first appeared on <a href="https://extrimian.io">Extrimian</a>.</p>

 Let’s talk about Optimistics &amp; ZK-Rollups 



 But first: What Rollup&nbsp;Mean: 



<p>If you are familiar and have been moving for a while in the environment of decentralized technologies, blockchain, crypto, and especially if you are involved in the Ethereum ecosystem and have heard about the recent Merge that the Blockchain did, it is very likely that you have heard about the concept of rollups. But almost certainly also, we said “Oh no, yet another term I have to learn…”. Well, here we are to help you understand it fast, easy and on time so you look like a genius at the meeting with your friends. Here we go:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>A rollup is a type of scaling solution that works by executing transactions outside of Layer 1 but posting transaction data on Layer 1.</p>
</blockquote>



 But…Why Rollups? 



<p>First things first. We must understand that blockchains, like Ethereum, can be slow and expensive because the higher the demand, the higher the fee to pay. Having to spend several extra dollars in gas fee, for a single transaction. This in DeFi is a major drawback.</p>



<p>This is where the need for layer 2’s like rollups is born. So, we could say that, rollups process the transactions from layer 1, in another faster blockchain, layer 2. Well, in this system, after processing the information, the transaction data is carried back to layer 1 (mainnet), but at a fraction of the price. In short, this means that we save the waiting time and processing cost of the mainnet. Therefore, and very importantly, users can benefit from the speed and low cost of the rollup, but without giving up the security of the layer 1 blockchain.</p>



 Rollups and the Ethereum scalability solution 



<p>Rollups are one of several scaling systems, which are nothing more than methods to make a slow blockchain faster and cheaper. Other scaling systems are sidechains and stateful channels.</p>



<p>Most scaling products are specifically related to Ethereum, as it is the largest blockchain with smart contracts developed on it. In the recent Merge (successfully completed in September of this year), Ethereum’s main developers sought to improve the speed and costs of the blockchain with a series of updates. These updates will not necessarily diminish the importance of scaling solutions. On the contrary, scaling solutions are likely to complement Ethereum’s updates, so they are not going away.</p>

 What&nbsp;types of rollups&nbsp;are there? 



<p>We could say that there are mainly two types of rollups, Optimistic and Zero Knowledge (ZK). Both, as we said, decrease transaction costs and waiting time. This works in such a way that, instead of waiting for the processing of each particular transaction in Ethereum (for example), several tens of transactions are recorded in layer 2, and then “rolled up” into a single transaction, which then returns as a packet to layer 1 or main blockchain. As you might guess, by returning like this, the cost of that transaction is divided among many users who have their transaction in that “rolled up” packet.</p>



 
 Optimistic Rollups:It is called Optimistic because it is optimistically assumed that all transactions contained in the rollup are valid. Therefore, in these types of rollups, users are given a certain number of days to challenge fraudulent transactions.Because they are all assumed to be correct, processing is faster because the network does not have to waste time confirming things. The disadvantage is that it takes about a week (the time given to dispute the transaction), to officially withdraw your funds from an Optimistic Rollups, as in the well-known Arbirtrum or Optimism. 



 ZK-rollups:ZK-rollups or Zero-Knowledge Rollups&nbsp;use&nbsp;Zero Knowledge Proof&nbsp;to cryptographically determine if a transaction is valid, using only a minimum of information about that transaction.<br>This is an off-chain protocol that operates on top of the Ethereum blockchain and is managed by on-chain Ethereum smart contracts.<br>As we have seen in other articles, Zero Knowledge Proof, or ZKP, is a privacy-preserving, fast and inexpensive method.<br>Compared to an optimistic rollup, which requires the funds to remain in the network until the dispute resolution or challenge period closes, ZK-rollups allow users to withdraw their funds without so much delay.<br>We can say then, that ZK rollups have an advantage in terms of speed and security over Optimistic rollups. But not everything is so easy, ZK-rollups are more complex in their application and type of technology. 
 



<p>For now, ZK-rollups are used for specific functions or applications. One of the major use cases of these rollups, and the most seen, is the exchange of non-fungible tokens or the transfer of cryptography between addresses.</p>



<p>Read also:&nbsp;<a href="https://extrimian.io/resources/blog/zero-knowledge-proof-and-self-sovereign-identity/">Zero Knowledge Proof and Self Sovereign Identity</a></p>



<p>But there are many advances we see in this area, and many teams are looking to develop tools linked to ZK-rollups. For example Polygon, Scroll and Matter Labs are working on their&nbsp;zkEVMs, which is a ZK-rollup that works identically to Ethereum’s mainnet. The idea then, is that these rollups can support any kind of applications that users want to develop on that layer 2.</p>



 What are the&nbsp;dangers of rollups? 



<p>We have to take into account some security considerations. And is that, while they take many of the security features of Ethereum, not everything is equal.</p>



<p>First of all, we have to take into account that being tools that are in their initial stage, the networks in which they operate are usually still somewhat centralized as there is a development team that maintains partial control, being able to have certain decisions such as turning on and off the network as they deem necessary.</p>



<p>Smart contracts in a rollup is not as finicky as that of a program developed in Ethereum. It may contain bugs because although there are audits and reviews to improve these bugs, if we rely on an external program to manage the transactions that go through the rollup, we can expect certain risks.</p>



<p>Another thing to keep in mind, is that some rollups also still use centralized “sequencers” to successfully coordinate transactions on the layer 2 chain. While a sequencer cannot forge or alter transactions, it technically has the ability to censor or reorder them for profit. This does not mean that it will happen, but we should know that it is possible in some cases.</p>



 How to use&nbsp;rollups in Ethereum: 



<p>We could say that Optimistic rollups and ZK-rollups work in an almost identical way in their use.<br>What should happen, is that they can bridge your funds to layer 2, and complete the transactions you need to perform in the rollup (buy and sell cryptocurrencies/NFTs, interact with protocols, move funds between wallets, or any DeFi transaction).</p>



<p>Note that to get started, you must fund your crypto wallet (Metamask, Coinbase, Binance, etc.), with any Ethereum compatible token (ether (ETH) or ERC-20 tokens).<br>Next, you need to change your wallet to operate on layer 2, so you can bridge your tokens to move them from one network to another. Of course, there is an Ethereum transaction fee to pay to move your funds to a rollup.</p>



<p>Once you have completed the transactions, you can then transfer your funds back to Ethereum. This requires you to convert the rollup funds into ERC-20 tokens that are native to the Ethereum mainnet.</p>



 In conclusion: 



<p>Rollups in general are going, if they didn’t make it yet towards decentralization, in some way or another. It is believed that the rollup market will continue to grow due to its economic, time and security benefits for users.</p><p>The post <a href="https://extrimian.io/resources/blog/what-are-rollups-and-what-are-they-for/">What are Rollups and what are they for?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://extrimian.io">Extrimian</a>.</p>

<p>Sacramento – The State of California Department of Motor Vehicles Open Source Mobile Wallet for Decentralized Digital Credentials <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/about/awards/government-eye-on-innovation?utm_source=int-mktg&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=RM_GB_2023_ITDIS_SOC_SOC1_EOI23SOCIALBUNDLE">has been awarded</a> by Gartner for the Eye on Innovation Awards in Government in the category of provisional, state, or regional for 2023. Gartner is an American technological research and consulting firm that conducts research on technology.</p><p>Wayne Chang, Co-Founder and CEO of SpruceID, said: “We are thrilled that California’s mDL pilot was recognized by the reputable Gartner, Inc. for the 2023 Innovation Award. Working closely with the state DMV, we brought Californians a reliable digital credential that is privacy-first and open source to maintain the utmost reliability and interoperability. California is leading the way in delivering high-quality digital services to its constituents; we commend the state for taking this approach, and we appreciate their partnership.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Assemblymember Miguel Santiago (D-Los Angeles), said: “I am thrilled to see the California DMV’s mDL pilot receive Gartner’s award for public sector innovation. Since fighting for digital driver’s licenses back in 2021 with AB 1503, I have been proud to see the program come to life so that any Californian can store their driver’s license on their phone. Congratulations to the DMV and their technology partner SpruceID.”</p><p>SpruceID has been working with the State of California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to bring mobile driver's licenses to residents of California. Earlier this fall, the State of California expanded the initial pilot program to allow California residents <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/ca-dmv-wallet/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">to download a mobile driver’s license (mDL)</a> on their smartphone through the California DMV Wallet mobile app (compatible with iOS and Android devices).</p><p>The mobile driver’s license is powered by SpruceID’s SpruceKit components and Credible product. SpruceKit is an open-source toolkit for decentralized identity that enables secure wallet construction, and Credible provides entire credential life cycle management–from issuance and presentations to updates and revocation. Both are modular solutions that are made to integrate into existing high-assurance environments with security and privacy at the core.</p><p>The <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/credible-introducing-mobile-drivers-licenses/">privacy-first mobile driver's license</a> can be used at participating TSA airport security checkpoints and select retail locations. In the future, the mobile driver’s license can help residents prove their identity online, operate motor vehicles, access health care, secure financial assistance, and verify their age–both in-person and online–while selectively disclosing only the necessary information. <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruceid-partners-with-ca-dmv-on-mdl/">Learn more</a>.</p><p><br>NOTE: GovTech to Host Live Webinar this Wednesday, 12/13 on “Getting Started with Digital Identity” Featuring Ajay Gupta, the Chief Digital Transformation Officer for the <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">State of California DMV</a>,&nbsp; and Wayne Chang, <a href="https://spruceid.com/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">SpruceID</a> CEO.

				  Governing generates an enormous amount of paperwork, so much so, the US employs an <a href="https://www.zippia.com/auditor-jobs/demographics/">estimated 228,000 auditors</a> to keep track of it. Here, we look at how governments can save millions on issuing documents, licenses and permits, while providing a much better experience for citizens.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>A key function of government is issuing permission, either so that citizens are allowed to do certain things — to build, drive, hunt, run a business, travel, or vote — or perform certain jobs according to certain standards, such as food handling. Governments issue a lot of these documents; for example, the US government issued <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/about-us/reports-and-statistics.html">24 million passports</a> in 2023, each of which&nbsp; took an average processing time of seven-to-ten weeks, and cost the person applying $130 dollars.</p>
<p>By issuing these same documents as verifiable digital credentials, governments can not only reduce the cost of creating the passport, and eliminate shipping costs and the waiting time for shipping, it can also simplify the process of renewing and replacing these documents.</p>
<p>The scale of cost reduction rapidly escalates as we move into state-level documents. In the US, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/191653/number-of-licensed-drivers-in-the-us-since-1988/#:~:text=Number%20of%20licensed%20drivers%20-%20United%20States%201990-2021&amp;text=Around%20233%20million%20people%20held,female%20licensees%20than%20male%20drivers">223 million people</a> held valid driver’s licenses in 2021, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/253615/number-of-hunting-licenses-and-permits-in-the-us/#:~:text=Hunting%20is%20generally%20regulated%20on,amounted%20to%20almost%2039%20million">38.7 million hunting licenses</a> were issued in 2023, and <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/687993/fishing-license-holders-by-us-state/">over 126 million fishing licenses</a> were issued in California alone in 2023. Each of these documents takes seven-to-ten days to process and ship. Even if the only thing verifiable credentials eliminated was the <a href="https://www.usps.com/business/prices.htm">66-cent cost of mailing the document</a>, they could have saved the government $147 million on driver’s licenses, $25 million on hunting licenses, and California $83 million on fishing licenses. And people would have received their verifiable credential versions instantly.</p>
<p>But verifiable digital credentials offer more benefits than saving on shipping while arriving faster. They can also save time and therefore money when it comes time to audit the holders of these credentials. For example, you need <a href="https://www.lightspeedhq.com/blog/restaurant-licenses-and-permits/">up to 16 permits and licenses to open a restaurant</a>, each of which can be misplaced or lost. Because verifiable credentials are stored securely on a mobile device, they are easy to keep track of and share when they need to be checked. Mobile verification software makes inspection easy, and the tamper-proof way data is stored means that everyone can be sure key documents haven’t been altered or faked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It isn’t just government inspectors who benefit from this feature. Anyone can easily verify the authenticity and data of someone else’s official documents. This eliminates what is now time-consuming and challenging research and sometimes a fee. For example, it costs <a href="https://washington.licenselookup.org/medical/">$50 and takes five-to-seven business days</a> to verify a Washington state medical license, while verifying a law license requires <a href="https://www.lawyerlegion.com/promote-your-law-practice/directories-by-state-bar#:~:text=Lawyer%20Licensing%20-%20American%20Bar%20Association,practice%20in%20a%20particular%20state">combing the state bar directory yourself.</a></p>
<p>If you would like to see an example of how governments are already adopting this technology with the Digital Travel Credential (DTC)&nbsp;you can read about how the government of Aruba has implemented it to <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-sita-and-aruba-deliver-verifiable-credentials-for-digital-travel/">speed up border crossings</a> or watch a video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcu76JEaqwI">here.</a></p>

The best of both worlds: digital and cryptographically verified — or analog, if that’s your&nbsp;fancy.<p>Global supply chains span millions of different interacting parties. This challenges the adoption of digitization; the industry is largely held back by lowest common denominators. Conscious tooling will allow digital front runners to maintain an advantage without disrupting their&nbsp;network.</p><p>Transmute is happy to announce a new platform feature, enabling users to “switch” between analog and digital interfaces. Transmute’s Verifiable Data Platform is now primed to bridge the gap between links of varying digital maturity along the supply&nbsp;chain.</p> Transitional Digitization <p>It is remarkable how much paper is passed around supply chains. Very often, emailing a PDF is considered “digital”, despite still depending on human consumption. The standard has arrived to change this: the globally recognized W3C internet standard for Verifiable Credentials enables a scalable approach to digitally signed, structured data.</p><p>Our <a href="https://platform.transmute.industries/">Verifiable Data Platform</a> is laser-focused on this mission, enabling actors to digitize their processes and establish cryptography-based trust networks.</p><p>But the world will not suddenly flip a switch and go digital overnight. Differences in legislative environments, infrastructure and general digital maturity will make the transition period a long one — years, if not decades. This is the basis of our new platform feature: enabling modern digitization technologies to spread gradually. You can digitize; your network can follow when they are&nbsp;ready.</p> “Going Analog” Switching from digital to analog and back along the supply&nbsp;chain.<p>The diagram above illustrates a simple example of bridging a non-digital link of the supply&nbsp;chain:</p>  A Manufacturer digitally issues a trade document as a Verifiable Credential.  Down the chain, the origin country customs authority only allows for paper filings. So the VC is converted into a PDF, printed and filed manually.  The analog document continues downstream the supply chain to the Trade Finance bank. Digitally savvy, the bank scans the QR code, cryptographically verifies the data and injects the structured data into its operational systems.  For the remainder of the supply chain, the document is exchanged digitally, cryptographically tracing back to the issuing Manufacturer.  <p>This approach was introduced in the UN/CEFACT <a href="https://unece.org/sites/default/files/2023-08/WhitePaper_VerifiableCredentials-CrossBorderTrade_September2022.pdf">Verifiable Credentials for Cross Border Trade</a> White&nbsp;Paper:</p><blockquote>In a VC based solution to digitising origin claims, certificates and declarations would be issued as VCs but the digital version would also be accessible via a QR on the paper / PDF version so that the same certificate can support different verifier technical maturity. Some verifiers may simply scan the QR with their phone. Others may integrate with their systems and consume the full certificate data.</blockquote><p>The security principle here is that the QR encodes a capability URL: anyone holding the PDF or paper version is also granted access to the Verifiable Credential. A data sharing model well suited to supply chain use&nbsp;cases.</p> Verifiable Trade Documents <p>Below is an example of such an “analog”, printable trade document. You can access it digitally <a href="https://platform.transmute.industries/credentials/urn:transmute:credential:818b95fa-85ef-455d-a8ba-35f8a9697850">here</a> — or go ahead and scan the QR code to verify its&nbsp;data!</p>Commercial Invoice PDF generated from a Verifiable Credential on the Transmute Verifiable Data Platform. Scanning the QR code links back to the digital, verifiable twin.<p>We are very proud at Transmute to take an active role in the practical transition towards scalable, verifiable supply chain digitization!</p><p>Are you ready to digitize, and still respect the pace of your business partners?

 How IDnow’s latest collaborative research project, MAMMOth, is making the connected world a safer and fairer place for everyone. 



 



<p>While the ability of AI to optimize efficiencies and improve processes is well documented, there are also genuine concerns regarding its susceptibility to human bias and how unfair data processing can lead to the perpetuation of discriminatory practices and social inequality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow leverages AI in its proprietary algorithms to automate three critical tasks:</p>



<p>1. Capturing and parsing identity documents.</p>



<p>2. Ensuring document compliance and authenticity.</p>



<p>3. Verifying the document holder’s identity, including a facial verification step.</p>



<p>Research conducted by IDnow has revealed demographic biases in facial verification algorithms, primarily linked to underrepresentation of certain ethnic groups. &nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Although a manual analysis performed after an automated check can rectify erroneous verdicts, addressing bias in AI-powered services is a priority for IDnow as we want to ensure our clients and their customers have access to reliable and fair tools.</p>Lara Younes, Engineering Team Lead at&nbsp;IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>In a bid to break down the barriers of bias, IDnow has been collaborating with 12 European partners, including academic institutions, associations and private companies, as part of the MAMMOth project, for about a year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Funded by the European Research Executive Agency, the goal of the three-year long project is to study existing biases and offer a toolkit for AI engineers, developers and data scientists so that they may better identify and mitigate biases in datasets and algorithm outputs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three use cases have been identified:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  Assessment of loan applications.&nbsp;  



  Academic evaluation and visibility of academic work. In the academic world, the reputation of a researcher is often tied to the visibility of their scientific papers, and how frequently they are cited. Studies have shown that on certain search engines, women and authors coming from less prestigious countries/universities tend to be less represented.&nbsp;  



  Face verification applied to identity verification.&nbsp;  



<p>IDnow will predominantly be&nbsp;focusing on the face verification use case, with the aim of implementing methods to mitigate biases found in algorithms.&nbsp;</p>



 Hearing the voice of the under-represented.&nbsp; 



<p>In an effort to provide a tool that meets the needs of those affected by bias, the project has the support of social science researchers at UNIBO, and three associations working to promote the voice of under-represented groups: <a href="https://www.iasismed.eu/">IASIS</a>, <a href="https://donaactiva.org/">DAF</a>, and <a href="https://www.diversitygroup.lt/en/">DDG</a>. Their involvement in MAMMOth enables IDnow to understand the needs and expectations of under-represented groups. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Through a series of questionnaires and workshops, the above partners have collected input from underrepresented groups, especially women and ethnic minorities. Gathered information has revealed apprehensions about being discriminated against by identity verification algorithms, emphasizing the necessity of ensuring algorithm reliability before use. These groups also advocated for human oversight of algorithm decisions. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Other concerns included possible data leakage, highlighting the need to address privacy-and-security-related issues when systems are developed. It’s also worth noting that some participants highlighted that human input could also be biased and that responsible AI use could reduce this risk.&nbsp;</p>



 AI for a responsible future.&nbsp; 



<p>At IDnow, we believe the importance of innovation lies in finding solutions to problems that do not yet exist but are sure to impact the future. That is why we have invested heavily in research and AI technologies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are proud to be a part of such an important collaborative research project. These studies underscore the need for trustworthy, unbiased facial verification algorithms. This is the challenge that IDnow and MAMMOth partners aim to overcome during the remaining two years of the project,” said Lara.&nbsp;</p>

 The next generation wants control over their data for a more transparent lending experience 



<p>Having grown up with the internet, smart phones, and social media, young Millennials and Gen-Z borrowers are particularly savvy about using their digital footprints for their own benefit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>They embrace technology to streamline everyday tasks and they want to make informed decisions about transactions. As they increase their presence in the workforce, they are becoming the generations poised to drive the future of lending. &nbsp;</p>



<p>When Mastercard surveyed 7,600 consumers across the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Germany and Spain about their recent financial experiences, young people’s voices came through: They want a more transparent, simpler, digitally-enabled lending process. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And open banking can make this a reality. Using secure APIs, advanced data analytics, and machine learning, open banking technology allows consumers to safely share their financial data, giving a more up-to-date and holistic view of their ability to repay a loan or afford a line of credit.</p>







<p>Most borrowers are already on board. According to our survey, 77% of those ages 45 to 60 and 68% of those over 60 are willing to grant access to their banking data to secure a credit or loan. Among respondents 18 to 29, the number shoots up to 84%.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>Nearly 60% of younger customers have already linked their accounts while applying for a loan. And, as digital natives, nine out of ten would prefer a loan option with a digital application or approval process.</p>







<p>The consumer base is changing, opening a window for the industry to evolve in step. Today’s borrowers are calling for a new, digital-first era of lending, giving applicants more control over the information used to determine their creditworthiness.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>By allowing consumers to share access to their financial data, open banking can provides a current view of their ability to repay a loan or afford a line of credit for more transparent lending decisions – and a more financially inclusive economy.</p>



 Younger borrowers are embracing digital lending

<p>Welcome to our latest edition of Veriscope Regulatory Recap, where we explore recent crypto regulatory shifts from around the world. In this edition, we are analyzing the recent blockchain regulatory moves from Spain, Kenya, Ghana, and the United States. Join us as we examine these changes and their implications for the global digital asset&nbsp;market.</p> Crypto Legislation Continues Gaining&nbsp;Momentum <p>Europe: In Spain, Agencia Tributaria, the country’s tax administration agency, made it compulsory for Spanish residents to declare crypto-assets held on non-Spanish platforms. However, it will only apply to individuals who cross a certain threshold, a balance exceeding US$55,000 in crypto assets. The new regulations will be effective from January 1,&nbsp;2024.</p>(<a href="https://x.com/shyftnetwork/status/1731732352047386661?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>Africa: Meanwhile, in a similar vein, last week, Kenya witnessed similar potential enforcement of regulations when the country’s National Assembly’s Finance and National Planning Committee approved the publication of the Capital Markets (Amendment) Bill, seeking to bring crypto trading under taxation.</p><p>The bill came as a proposal from a local Kenyan legislator, seeking taxation of crypto exchanges and digital wallets. If effective, the proposed amendment bill will allow the Kenya Revenue Authority to tax Kenyans who hold crypto&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Efforts to regulate the digital assets space could also be seen in Ghana, where Daniel Ogbambey-Tetteh, the Director-General of the Securities and Exchange Commission of the country, recently announced the commissioning of a task force to look after efforts towards regulating the space and minimizing potential harm to investors.</p><p>The Director-General announced investments in human capital development to meet the needs of the task force and related plans, along with a digitalization program. He also spoke of setting up a risk-based supervision framework to seamlessly migrate from the compliance-based supervision mode.</p><p>North America: Amidst worldwide talks of compliance, regulation, and supervision, the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce unanimously passed a blockchain bill titled “Deploying American Blockchain Act of 2023.” And while the Committee has already passed the draft bill 46 votes to 0, it is awaiting a full house&nbsp;vote.</p> Kenya’s Digital Currency Bill: A Detailed&nbsp;Look <p>A primary aspect of Kenya’s Digital Currency Bill is the requirement for digital currency licensees to register with the Capital Markets Authority. If approved, licensees will have to maintain detailed transaction records and pay taxes on capital gains from these transactions, promoting transparency and contributing to the national&nbsp;revenue.</p><p>Another significant measure that the proposed bill will enforce is requiring crypto holders to disclose comprehensive details for taxation purposes, such as the amount and types of cryptocurrencies owned, dates of acquisition and sale, transaction proceeds, and associated costs. While this does promote fiscal responsibility and prevent tax evasion, it also imposes an administrative burden on crypto holders and could be seen as an invasion of&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Additionally, the bill proposes a capital gains tax on the increased market value of crypto during transactions, aligning with the existing practice where banks deduct a 20% excise duty on all transaction commissions and fees. This could potentially stabilize revenue from fluctuating market values but may also discourage investment in digital currencies due to increased taxation.</p><p>Overall, while the bill seeks to bring order and accountability to the burgeoning digital currency market in Kenya, it also introduces complexities and potential deterrents for crypto investors and users. Hence, the balance between regulation and innovation will be key to the bill’s success and its impact on Kenya’s digital asset landscape.</p> US Lawmakers Introduce Blockchain Bills: What’s in&nbsp;Store <p>In the United States, Representatives Larry Bucshon and Lisa Blunt Rochester have introduced two key pieces of legislation aimed at enhancing blockchain technology use.</p><p>The first, backed by Rep. Bucshon, focuses on better identifying supply chain risks to keep the US competitive in emerging technologies. This act promises improved national security and economic stability but may require significant resources and increased regulatory oversight.</p><p>The second bill proposes the Secretary of Commerce to be the primary advisor to the President on blockchain and DLT policies, with the authority to form advisory committees. This could centralize and streamline blockchain strategy, fostering innovation. However, it raises concerns about potential bureaucratic inefficiencies and over-regulation.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/RepLarryBucshon/status/1732058642864578574">Image Source</a>)<p>Under the Deploying American Blockchains Act, the Secretary of Commerce would establish best practices for blockchain deployment, assisting both the public and private sectors. Although this initiative could drive technological advancement, it also faces challenges in balancing innovation with regulation and privacy concerns.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/new-european-crypto-transfer-rules-in-2024">New European Crypto Transfer Rules in&nbsp;2024</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-uae">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in the&nbsp;UAE</a></p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>If asked what job role is most associated with Identity and Access Management (IAM), what would you say?</p>
<p>Most of you might think a highly technical specialist, or an “IT person”. However, many CEOs, CFOs, Customer Service team leaders, HR analysts and other professionals across companies are involved in IAM decision making. But why is this? This blog will explore why it is important for companies to invest more time and effort in ensuring that Identity and Access Management is well understood across various job functions.</p>
<p>Firstly, let’s understand what Identity and Access Management is.</p>
 What is IAM? 
<blockquote><p>“Identity and Access management is the people, processes and systems used to manage digital identities and their entitlements throughout their life-cycle.” ~ <a href="https://open-measure.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DIC/pages/1409143/Identity+and+Access+Management">Open Measure Dictionary</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Organisations use IAM software to manage and secure the identities of both internal and external users for their services and applications. There are &nbsp;two main styles of IAM systems, that are currently in use:</p>
 Traditional IAM or Internal IAM 
<p>Traditional IAM takes care of the internal identities, mainly employees but also can include other groups of individuals such as subcontractors and representatives from partners and suppliers. Think of an employee, from their user account creation, granting the right access to perform their job, until the account deletion when the person leaves the company.</p>
 Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) 
<p>CIAM forked from IAM when the number of Internet applications in every company’s data environment exploded in numbers. Such growth was clearly reflected in the number of screen icons in our devices. Companies of all kinds expect that their applications will be accessed by thousands or millions of consumers, citizens, remote workers, and other types of users. These “customers” could be B2C or B2B. Particularly with the innovations in the LEI world, B2B IAM is becoming a hot topic that will bring massive benefits to the B2B world.</p>
 Why IAM matters to everyone 
<p>Not long ago, when you started a new job or became a university student, someone from IT would provide you with access to necessary systems, and a username and password that needs to be changed after the first login. All identity and access management processes were semi-manual and done by the IT team. Today, we have modern identity standards, but often IAM is an area that only a small group of people in the organisation are involved in. With companies embarking on digital transformation, a larger percentage of the companies’ staff is now becoming involved in building new web and mobile services. But unless everyone has an adequate understanding of IAM, these projects are doomed to fail. Therefore, knowing IAM is not only for the IT folks as it was at the beginning of the millennium.</p>
 Who normally sees Identity and Access management on their desk? 
<p>Identity and Access Management is not an everyday task for many professionals beyond the IT team (or IAM team if it exists). However, when the time comes for strategic decisions, there are several people who will have a voice and decision power in how IAM is acquired, planned, deployed, maintained and expanded.</p>
<p>Especially for the biggest decisions involving risk and money, several sub-organisations and functions have the responsibility to build consensus with the IAM team in order to get their own business objectives met. The most critical of these stakeholders are:</p>
 
 Compliance Officers. There is no software that magically makes a company GDPR-compliant. Same with PCI DSS, CCPA and other regulations. Compliance officers use IAM among other tools and processes to fulfil their audits. Undoubtedly the compliance team will have clear requirements about what IAM must offer. 
 The Chief Information and Security Officer. With a large portion of employees working from their home offices, the risks of attacks to the companies’ systems have drastically increased. The Chief Information and Security Officer is well aware that IAM has taken a leading role in the organisation’s security. 
 Customer Service. Since the concept of self-service account management appeared, CIAM has made a tremendous impact on customer service, and there are multiple ways that CIAM can help. Even in a utopian passwordless world, users will need account recovery and might end up panickily calling customer service. And customer service will ask CIAM to help. Find out more about <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/about/resources/ciam-customer-experience-marketing/" title="leveraging CIAM for more effective customer service and marketing here">leveraging CIAM for more effective customer service and marketing here</a>. 
 Business Development / Umbrella Organisations. New student portals, patient portals, citizen portals, new mobile apps, improved authentication methods for existing applications…; for every new or existing web service, every day a new service is being created or improved, and IAM needs to be in place. That’s why business units must understand IAM very well in order to reach their set goals. 
 Human Resources. Today any HR information system (e.g., SAP SuccessFactors, Workday) is in one way or another connected with the IAM systems, both Traditional IAM and CIAM. There again, several persons in the HR team will have a lot to say about what IAM should do and shouldn’t do. 
 The CFO. We know it well, that IAM is a necessary but also hefty investment for organisations. The Chief Financial Officer will carefully evaluate the financial impact and will ask both the IAM vendor and the aforementioned stakeholders for a clear Return On Investment (ROI). 
 
<p>Most of these people unfortunately only truly care about IAM when an issue arises for them.</p>
 Let’s educate everyone on IAM 
<p>Seeing how relevant IAM is across the functions, shouldn’t we start a crusade to educate more people about it?</p>
<blockquote><p>“30% of the time for an IAM team should be dedicated to education and knowledge transfer to people who are outside of the IAM team, and the rest of the organisation.” ~ <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/iam-uk-public-sector-richard-slater-amido/" title="Richard Slater on Let’s Talk About Digital Identity.">Richard Slater on Let’s Talk About Digital Identity.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>With my personal experience, spending time on educating around IAM is realistic and crucial. There are commonplace and unconventional ways to make this happen: presentations, pre-recorded demos, mini workshops, discussions on hot topics. The executive who leads IAM in the organisation has to become a persuasive agent and make sure that these activities happen, and that more people will be converted into IAM ambassadors. Everyone in the company will benefit from it. After all, times have changed, and there is no digital transformation without CIAM.</p>

 Summary 
<p>The concept of digital identity has been adopted worldwide as a means for people to present themselves and operate in the online space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether it’s for work, studying, or simply communicating, individuals are able to engage with one another from any corner of the world. But, because of the elusive nature of the internet, it’s difficult to tell whether an individual is who they claim to be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This could make engaging with others in the online space rather challenging, even if they are verified. Users may unintentionally share their private information with bad players who could use them for personal gain. Malicious individuals may get access to services or carry out illegal activities in the victim’s name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more, identity fraud or fake, AI-generated digital identities could influence polls and the decision-making process of a system. All of this could lead to devastating consequences for those whose digital identity has been compromised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To prevent this, SelfKey proposes the following online identity verification solutions: SelfKey iD and Credential Locking, or proof of humanity locking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD is an innovative online identity verification method which may provide several benefits compared to traditional KYC checks. The process may be less costly, safer and more secure, so that every individual can benefit from its advantages.</p>
<p>This article will be focusing on how SelfKey iD and credential locking may provide a more accessible means for individuals to authenticate themselves online from all over the world. Through this method, and with privacy and security in mind, SelfKey is aiming to contribute to the development of a safer, decentralized future.&nbsp;</p>

 Conclusions&nbsp; 
 
 The Importance of Digital Identity Security 
 Why the safety of digital identity is crucial 
<p>Similar to our physical identities, our digital identities encompass all the information that describe us as individuals, such as: name, birth dates, full addresses, social security numbers, personally identifiable information (PII), or personal health information (PHI).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nowadays, digital identities have become an integral part of our lives. From social media accounts to online banking, we rely on digital identities to conduct our daily activities. Thanks to the speed and efficiency of the internet, we are able to do these activities at a much faster pace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, with the convenience of digital identities comes the risk of identity theft, which can have severe consequences for individuals and organizations alike. Digital identities can be compromised at any moment, either by:&nbsp;</p>
 
 cyberattacks which lead to data breaches, or 
 accidentally clicking on a link messaged by a friend or family. 
 
<p>Browsing the internet from the comfort of our own homes may give us the illusion of safety. However, the theft of our digital identities is as alarming as having our physical wallets, with all of our personal documents inside, stolen.</p>
<p>Let us explore some of the negative impacts identity theft can leave us with.</p>
 The consequences of identity theft 
<p>Identity theft occurs when someone steals another person's personal information, such as their name, address, social security number, or financial details, with the intention of using it for fraudulent purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consequences of identity theft can be devastating for the victim, including financial losses, damaged credit scores, and reputational harm.</p>
<p>Moreover, bad players can use stolen digital identities for a wide range of criminal activities. For instance: accessing sensitive information, opening fraudulent bank accounts, and committing tax fraud. These activities can have severe outcomes for the victim and even lead to legal consequences for the perpetrator.</p>
 The dangers of sharing private information online 
<p>Sharing private information with unknown individuals is also a significant danger when it comes to digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cybercriminals often use social engineering tactics to trick individuals into sharing their personal information. Some methods include phishing emails or fake websites. Once they obtain this information, they can use it to commit identity theft or other fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>This leads us to a serious concern that individuals all around the world are facing nowadays: a lack of proper security measures.&nbsp;</p>
 What can be done, then? 
<p>Identity theft and fraud are becoming more common in the digital world, and many individuals struggle to confidently operate online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite privacy and security being fundamental human rights, most centralized systems still lack adequate security measures. Ideally, a decentralized environment where individuals can exercise their <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">Self Sovereign Identity</a> rights would help prevent data theft. By giving individuals ownership of their private information, cyberattacks would be less likely to succeed.</p>
<p>Given this, SelfKey recognizes the importance of developing decentralized solutions that may allow individuals to operate safely in the digital world. Below, we will thoroughly touch upon SelfKey’s proposed solutions.</p>
 SelfKey’s Proposed Online Identity Verification Solutions 
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/the_benefits_of_selfkey_id/">SelfKey iD</a> is an innovative and cost-effective online identity verification method designed to be more accessible than traditional KYC checks. The lack of recurring fees makes it accessible to every individual who wishes to authenticate themselves online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD uses the power of <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) in its online verification process, providing an extra layer of security. In addition to AI-powered verification, SelfKey iD offers credential locking as a possible solution that may prevent identity fraud and access by fake, AI-generated digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, with its focus on security, accessibility, and innovation, SelfKey iD may become a leading solution for online identity verification.</p>
 SelfKey iD and Credential Locking: How it works 
<p>SelfKey aims to develop a simple and quick online identity verification method. That is why SelfKey ID is meant to be not only cost-effective, but also user-friendly. This way, individuals may find it more accessible and easy to use.</p>
<p>Credential Locking, or proof of humanity, is a digital identity verification method used to establish that an individual is unique and real. It is used as part of the online identity verification process to confirm that an individual is not a bot, a fake account, or an identity thief.</p>
 The process 
<p>In the context of SelfKey iD, Credential Locking may be used as an additional security measure for online identity verification. The following steps may be required:</p>
 
 Users must provide a selfie during the initial KYC process.&nbsp; 
 To access SelfKey services, users are required to go through additional selfie checks. Their selfies will be compared to the original one taken during the KYC process.&nbsp; 
 If the selfies match, users will be granted a Credential&nbsp;that can be locked with KEY. This verification process ensures that users' identities are authenticated and that they have a secure digital identity.&nbsp; 
 
<p>By locking KEY on their Credential, users contribute to the security of the SelfKey ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
 How will this provide security on the web? 
<p>SelfKey's Credential Locking method may not only provide a secure identity verification process but it may also offer several additional benefits to users. For instance:</p>
 
 By locking their credentials, users may access exclusive features and services within the SelfKey ecosystem. This means that users who have locked their credentials may have a higher level of trust and reputation within the network. This may allow them to benefit from additional functionalities that are not available to all users. 
 Moreover, locking credentials may also allow users to accrue SELF tokens&nbsp;as a sign of their reputation within the SelfKey ecosystem. Users can mint SELF tokens only if they can prove their identity by providing a matching selfie during the verification process. This will maintain the security of users’ digital identity and ensure that the SelfKey ecosystem remains robust and secure. 
 Furthermore, users can only withdraw their original KEY tokens if they can provide a matching selfie during the withdrawal process. This may provide an additional layer of security and ensure that unauthorized users cannot access a user's tokens.&nbsp; 
 
 Why provide selfies? 
<p>The purpose of providing selfies for the actions stated above is to ensure the users’ digital safety by verifying that they truly are who they claim to be. KEY and SELF tokens can thus be withdrawn or minted only after the user will have been able to successfully verify their identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal is to create a system in which users won’t have to worry about identity thieves or fake, AI-generated images being used to compromise their digital assets. By providing selfies, users may ensure that their accounts are secure and their privacy is not violated. SelfKey’s AI-powered proof of individuality method may be the ideal solution in achieving this goal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Credential Locking method, therefore, may provide a secure and reliable system for identity verification, which benefits both users and the SelfKey ecosystem as a whole. By locking their credentials, users may:</p>
 
 protect their digital identity. 
 access exclusive features. 
 contribute to the security of the SelfKey network. 
 
 The part AI plays 
<p>To enhance security in its online identity verification solutions, SelfKey uses <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">AI-Powered Proof of Individuality</a> to facilitate the selfie matching process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI may prove to be particularly advantageous in this context, as its precision allows for the detection of several crucial factors:</p>
 
 an individual's liveness. 
 identity forgery. 
 fake, AI-generated images. 
 
<p>This ensures that the identity verification process is secure and reliable. And that's because AI technology is capable of detecting any fraudulent attempts to game the system. Additionally, it can make sure that the selfies provided during the verification process are authentic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By using AI-Powered Proof of Individuality, SelfKey may be able to provide a trustworthy and robust system for digital identity verification, which is critical in today's digital world.</p>
 The Benefits of SelfKey iD Credential Locking  
<p>As stated above, digital identities have become a target for malicious players that seek to exploit others for personal gain. And, with the weak security in some centralized systems, it’s crucial that we look for alternatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given this, SelfKey's credential locking method may provide a robust, reliable, and decentralized method for identity verification. It may offer the level of security and privacy that is critical in today’s digital world. Individuals may benefit from peace of mind and ensure that their digital identities are protected from fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>Even more, unlawful access to one’s personal accounts may become very challenging due to the extra layer of protection added by AI. Simply providing a true, authentic selfie can achieve all of this.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>The rise of data breaches and identity theft has highlighted the need for a trustless and secure environment for online interactions. Individuals need to have confidence in the systems they use to protect their personal information to ensure the security of their digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, centralized systems may fail to provide proper security measures, which often lead to data breaches involving identity theft.</p>
<p>With the use of SelfKey iD Credential Locking, a much safer network may be available in the future. By locking their credentials, users may prevent identity theft and fraud. Not only that, but they may gain access to exclusive features and services within the SelfKey ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey's goal is to develop a secure and trustless environment for online interactions. And that is highly important nowadays, as we become more and more accustomed to operating in the digital world.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Neuenschwander</a></p><p>In my research for this blog post, I wondered where the proverb about glass houses and throwing stones originated. I'm unsure whether there will ever be a definitive answer, but <a href="https://www.almanac.com/fact/where-did-the-saying-people-who-live">this one</a> appealed to my education as an English major:</p>
<p>The proverb appeared in Chaucer’s Troilus and Criseyde, written in 1385. Later, George Herbert modified it this way: “Whose house is of glass, must not throw stones at another.” And in 1736, Benjamin Franklin wrote, “Don’t throw stones at your neighbors, if your own windows are glass.”</p>
<p>Then I decided I’d give DALL-E a go at it. I like that it turned out so dramatically:</p>
<p></p>
<p>This image captures quite well the point I’d like to make about breach revelations—piling on the schadenfreude provides little solace when you become the target. And let’s face it, we are all targets now.</p>
 For whom the bell tolls 
<p>When the closing bell rang at the NASDAQ on November 29, 2023, Okta shares (NASDAQ:OKTA) had been devalued by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/29/okta-hackers-stole-data-on-all-customer-support-users-company-says.html">nearly 7%</a> and received <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/okta-hit-with-6-downgrades-following-q3-earnings-4-big-analyst-cuts-3246837">six downgrades</a> from previous estimates, despite the company’s better-than-expected <a href="https://investor.okta.com/news-releases/news-release-details/okta-announces-third-quarter-fiscal-year-2024-financial-results">earnings report</a>. According to a <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20231130546/oktas-stock-falls-amid-wave-of-downgrades-now-is-not-the-time-for-profit-push">TD Cowen analyst report</a>, OKTA's financial performance is reflecting “the impact of recent high-profile breaches involving the company’s solutions.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>In reaction, part practical, part penance, Okta stated it would <a href="https://www.crn.com/news/security/okta-s-90-day-delay-on-product-releases-is-a-critical-step-analyst">halt product releases</a> for 90 days (presumably, the time it takes to get one’s security glasshouse in order). Such news may seem like a holiday gift to Okta’s competitors. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But, continuing to draw on my English major, John Donne had this <a href="https://allpoetry.com/No-man-is-an-island">great poem</a> a while back about a bell tolling and then Hemingway went on to develop the concept into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Whom_the_Bell_Tolls">novel</a>. This sentiment rings true today, as we step collectively into an era of hyper-exposure to cyber-attacks: everybody’s going to take their turn. From Donne’s poem:</p>
<p>Any man's death diminishes me,<br>Because I am involved in mankind.<br>And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;<br>It tolls for thee.</p>
<p>Speaking of humanity, it turns out the initial account that was compromised was a non-human—or service—account. These types of accounts can be unruly, and they don’t use multi-factor authentication. In a <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@dangoodin/111348246005935166">discussion</a> on infosec.exhange (with Adam Shostack and friends, no less!) commentors offer various summaries on what had just occurred and who was to shame. This one, I think, summarizes it up best:</p>
<p>Yes, let’s all agree, the one-word technical summary is accurate. But—to paraphrase a security professional I discussed the matter with—as large as the providers are these days, you can never be certain you’ll have your bases covered everyone takes a turn, even open-source providers.</p>
<p>And—talk about the mother of all identity providers—the DNA research company 23andMe <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/04/23andme-confirms-hackers-stole-ancestry-data-on-6-9-million-users/">reported a breach</a> in October, as well—and likewise continues to realize new depths of the severity of the attack. And again, lest we forget, this cautionary tale is at least as old as 2011, when KuppingerCole Analysts reported similar findings from the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kuppinger/rsa-securid-it-will-never-be-the-same-again">RSA SecurID breach</a>.</p>
 Cyberculture and the culture of silence 
<p>So, what is the proper response to getting our security <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-retired-players-agree-to-concussion-lawsuit-settlement-0ap1000000235501">bell rung</a> (as the NFL calls it)? Well, first and foremost, it’s important to talk about it openly. That’s not an easy topic for discussion with investors, customers, and competitors looking on.</p>
<p></p>
<p>BeyondTrust, which <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/okta-support-unit-breach">reported</a> the breach on October 2nd 2023, was likely the first customer to speak up about it, because the attackers had finally showed up at the company’s door (front door in this case). Still, Okta took more than two weeks to admit to the breach. Oddly, even now, BeyondTrust’s detailed timeline of the breach provides a lot more specifics than you can find on Okta’s security blog.</p>
<p>There’s a reason the mantra of physical security states, “if you see something, say something”—the social alert draws in a community to restore safety. For example, BeyondTrust reveals that the attacker requested a HAR file archive (HTML backup) for the ostensible purpose of troubleshooting the website. Obtaining the file, the hacker then reused a session cookie from that HAR file to attempt a replay attack on a web service, which BeyondTrust easily blocked. Undeterred, the attacker then switched to using API calls instead. According to BeyondTrust:</p>
<p>API actions cannot be protected by policies in the same way as actual admin console access. Using the API, they [the attackers] <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/okta-support-unit-breach">created a backdoor user account</a> using a naming convention like existing service accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is great intel on how the threat actor conducts business and everyone should be put on notice. Still, valuable time was spent in a moment or two of silence. Why?</p>
<p>The culture of silence needs to go. We need to swap notes. Safety is a collaborative effort, because we can’t know in advance where the next threat will originate or where it will propagate.</p>
 Going to production requires oversight 
<p>The interesting thing about this breach is that it started with a service account and then moved to human accounts. One way this happens is by not hardening the system sufficiently when moving from development to production environments. The Okta Developer portal makes it easy for developers to get moving on projects but will need a thorough security review when deploying applications.</p>
<p>Also, the LDAP interface is typically enabled by default even when not in use, heightening the risk level. Access control policies for sensitive apps and admin accounts are often not adequately designed to limit risk exposure to breaches.</p>
<p>Okta is now critical infrastructure and needs a run book that ensures security is maintained. One of the shocking findings in the Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-08/CSRB_Lapsus%24_508c.pdf">report on Lapsus$</a> breaches “organizations did not always consider third parties and BPOs in their risk management programs.” Communication with third parties is necessary preparation for moving to production, as well.</p>
 How to learn from—rather that gloat over—others’ mishaps 
<p>Proposals for avoiding and dealing with breaches were plentiful at our recent <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023">Cyberevolution</a> conference. For example, we <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5434/1">heard from</a> Michiel Stoop of Philips, who spoke on “How to Minimize the Blast Radius of an Attack?” In this case, the approach was to minimize access from privileged accounts.</p>
<p>Jorge Monteiro of Ethiack pointed out that it’s actually a good idea to <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5439/2">attack yourself first</a>, in his presentation titled “Autonomous Ethical Hacking for Accurate and Continuous Security Testing.”</p>
<p>Emergency preparedness is often overlooked in cybersecurity, with the majority of the attention going to prevention and detection. But, if we already agree that we are all simply waiting our turn to be attacked, it seems only obvious that we prepare plans for that inevitable moment.</p>
<p>One proposal we covered at Cyberevolution is the practice of developing and training on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5468/3">tabletop exercises</a>, which was covered in a panel titled, “Arresting Disaster: Driving Incident Response in Cyber-Regulated Europe in an Age of AI Threats,” which included participants from ArmorText and the law firm of Crowell &amp; Moring.&nbsp;It’s important to recognize that even your messaging platforms like Teams, Slack, or Zoom become compromised in a breach and so your team will need an out of band “break glass” communication that also meets legal requirements of various governments.</p>
<p>Independent of the measures taken to reduce risk and mitigate cyber disasters, the common thread through all these measures is to communicate openly and quickly with the cyber security community. We’ll all fare much better against attackers as we open channels for honest, detailed, and actionable information.</p>

   Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a system architecture guiding tech choices, not a software or service. It prioritizes the individual, allowing them to control their own information. Blockchain technology, as a decentralized database with data spread across nodes, seems a fit for SSI as it ensures accuracy and security. However, it has limitations like being computationally expensive and complex.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>For many in the identity industry, hearing “self-sovereign identity” (SSI) automatically makes you think “blockchain.” And, if you’re like me, as soon as you hear blockchain, you think it’s too darn early to play the blockchain drinking game and move on. In the early days of SSI, most of the discussion was, in fact, about identity on a blockchain. That association did a disservice to the concept of SSI. SSI is no more dependent on using blockchain technologies than a passport is dependent on a particular type of paper.&nbsp;</p>



 What is SSI? 



<p>SSI is an architecture that guides technological decisions. It is not a piece of software to install or a service you can purchase. In an SSI model, the individual is the single most important entity in a transaction. That individual controls what happens with their information. For people to trust the individual’s information, there needs to be some measure of both technical and societal trust in the veracity of that information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s the puzzle the technology has to solve. How do you create a digital identity with information that has been verified (or possibly asserted) by a third party (like the government), that allows an individual to control what information is shared, does NOT allow the third party to know about the transaction, and yet can be verified as accurate by whoever is receiving the data from the individual?</p>



 What is a Blockchain? 



<p>Several features associated with blockchain technology suggest it is a good fit to solve that problem. At its most basic, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp">blockchain</a>&nbsp;is a distributed database with data spread across any number of nodes in a network. Enough math is involved to guarantee that the information in those nodes can only be altered with a clear record of who modified it and when.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the right technology, such as a digital identity wallet, an individual can share this cryptographically secure information with any other interested party. Suppose that information was initially issued by a known, trusted entity, and the data cannot be changed (only added to in a visible way). In that case, no one needs to check back with that issuer to see if the information is accurate. The issuer will, in fact, have no idea that this information was shared at all. The individual is in control, and privacy is preserved. Win!</p>



<p>You might find this article interesting if you’d like to read more about how SSI and blockchain can transform society.</p>



 Other Options for SSI 



<p>We have some obvious wins here by using blockchain technology to support SSI. Why isn’t it the One True Way? Because blockchain has some&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/04/14/the-5-biggest-problems-with-blockchain-technology-everyone-must-know-about/?sh=5c35504c55d2">significant limitations</a>. For one thing, it is computationally expensive (which means slow and power-hungry). It is also far more complicated than is actually required for most use cases (if you haven’t seen Figure 6 in this&nbsp;<a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2018/NIST.IR.8202.pdf">NIST publication</a>, it sums this argument up nicely).</p>



<p>Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are a fundamental part of the SSI model. There is an entire&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/">registry</a>&nbsp;of possible methods to use and support DIDs. Some are blockchain-based, but others rely on the&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/">OpenID for Verifiable Credentials</a>&nbsp;specifications. There are options; it is better to understand your current infrastructure, what problem you’re trying to solve, and decide what technology you need to support. Don’t try to make your problem fit the tool, especially when other tools are available.</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>SSI’s core principle is about enabling individuals to own and control their digital identities. This architecture can be implemented through various technologies, not limited to blockchain. Blockchain offers a way to decentralize and secure these identities, but it’s not the only method to achieve the principles of SSI.</p>



<p>And if you play the blockchain drinking game, too, I hope you read this late in your day and have a designated driver to get you home.</p>

 A Just Transition Plan for London Borough of&nbsp;Newham Chigwell Road in East London. Photograph: Jack Dredd/Rex/Shutterstock via the&nbsp;Guardian<p>The London Borough of Newham is one of over 300 of the UK’s total 382 local authorities to have declared a climate emergency since 2019. Following these declarations, many local authorities have adopted the Climate Action Plan as a format for translating recognition of risk into action and transformation. From June to October 2023, our team from Dark Matter Labs and colleagues at Arup collaborated with the London Borough of Newham to consider how a new generation of Climate Action Plans might increase the scale and pace of impact, in the face of the climate emergency.</p><p>Newham’s Just Transition Plan, the first outcome of our collaboration, explores innovative approaches to the document’s foundational principles, format, and scope. This article will present the Just Transition Plan as a model for future innovation around local authority climate action, and share what we found in working closely with those seeking to drive systemic change in&nbsp;Newham.</p> Centring justice in Newham’s climate transition <p>Newham, in East London, faces a unique intersection of climate and socioeconomic risks for a UK local authority area. Newham residents currently have the highest rate of death attributable to air pollution in London, and is among the six London boroughs most exposed to flood and overheating risks as temperatures rise. From March to May of 2020, Newham’s Covid-19 mortality rate was more than double England’s average. Today, about one quarter of Newham residents are paid below the London living wage, and one in two children live in poverty, with under-16s making up more than 20% of the population. More than half of residents were born outside of the UK (as of the 2021 census), and Newham is the UK’s most ethnically diverse borough. Newham also has the highest number of households in temporary and non-secure housing in the UK; average rent represents about 65% of wages, compared to the UK average of around 30%. These risks and vulnerabilities situate Newham’s 350,000 residents at the forefront of present and future needs across climate mitigation and adaptation. On the other hand is the sense of opportunity in the borough, on the basis of the youth and diversity of its population. The expansive thinking and leadership within Newham Council enabled a tangible understanding of how the climate emergency is already affecting residents.</p><p>Since 2021, London as a whole and Newham in particular have witnessed increasing evidence of the entanglement of climate risks. Everyday but profound stressors like growing heating bills, and extreme weather such as the July 2021 floods and 2022 heat waves, which resulted in over 3,000 deaths across the UK, have made plain the urgency of systemic action. When we began this work in June 2023, the prospect of another dangerously hot summer was hanging over our work. In each of these scenarios, the intersectionality of the lived experience of climate change was unmissable: people of colour in the UK are four times as likely to live in areas at high risk of extreme heat. The council’s existing Climate Action Plan, as with many others, focuses on a list of strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This, however, does not address the reality of Newham residents’ present critical needs and their likely, iminent intensification. A plan for a Just Transition would need to target intersectionality to increase equity in the borough through every single recommendation, while also reducing emissions.</p> Recalibrating our focus in the local authority context <p>With our colleagues in Newham Council, Dark Matter Labs and Arup adopted a cross-disciplinary lens driven by a particular focus on governance and urban climate risks. Early interviews with officers in the council, local leaders and experts from within our organisations outlined one of the defining tensions of this piece of work: local authorities have high and well-informed ambitions, but are working within an extremely challenging context, with limited resources. This dynamic makes system-scale innovation, sustained investment in transition causes, and transformative leadership by councils profoundly difficult. Recent research from <a href="https://www.arup.com/perspectives/publications/promotional-materials/section/youve-made-a-climate-action-plan-what-next-guidance-for-local-governments">Arup</a> outlines an alternative framing: while less than 5% of a borough’s emissions are typically directly attributable to council activities, it can influence as much as 70% of emissions through procurement, policy, jobs, place-shaping, partnerships and community engagement. Local authorities must act, but also influence and convene to affect emissions reduction, and so too the other elements of a Just Transition. In designing the plan, we highlighted ways Newham Council could further grow their influence and work with the borough’s committed community members and other stakeholders.</p><p>A few other shifts in focus were crucial to our efforts. Concepts such as emissions scopes are a poor fit for the scale and interconnectivity of urban boroughs, and can result in a blame game of emissions sources. A reliance on difficult-to-attain emissions data can undermine the ability of local authorities to pinpoint effective levers and enact meaningful climate action. We worked with Newham Council to understand their emissions holistically while they are compiling a nuanced borough-wide picture.</p><p>Estimates suggest that less than 10% of global climate investments go toward adaptation (source: <a href="https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/publication/global-landscape-of-climate-finance-2021/">Climate Policy Initiative</a>), but the case for adaptive measures is stronger than ever. We know that actions which integrate mitigation and adaptation create value, reduce risk and future costs, encourage future investment, and improve quality of living. In Newham, increasing the capacity for adaptation could be incorporated into the more expansive idea of future-readiness: where institutions, infrastructure and individuals are prepared for the volatile futures expected from a world that has warmed on average by 2°C or more. We similarly identified the need for longer-term, recurring, blended and strategic investment to enable whole-place transformation and reduce financial risk for the&nbsp;Council.</p><p>Ultimately, the plan needed to affirm and support Newham’s officers and politicians. We worked with the Council’s Climate Action Working Group and consulted findings from citizens’ meetings to ensure the plan helped to articulate and advocate for their everyday experience and existing programmes, rather than just another thing to do. As a result, we targeted the idea of a next-generation document committing to climate action in Newham: one which was ambitious and informed, reflective of the urgency of this moment, and oriented toward the potential of collective action.</p>Shifts that might define next-generation climate action by local authorities<p>The 3–6–5&nbsp;plan</p><p>Our plan was structured into three parts, each framed by a set of questions:</p> 3 Principles <p>How can a local authority address the entangled targets of a Just Transition: to increase equity, to build future-readiness, and to meaningfully reduce emissions?</p> 6 Futures <p>What specific risks does Newham face, and what levers will enable these to be addressed in order to bring about a Just Transition? What defines the positive place futures we want to bring to fruition?</p> 5 Enablers <p>How can this be accomplished? What action would enable the council and the borough to reach climate targets, support the work that’s already taking place, and maintain momentum in the Transition? How would we need to work differently and collaboratively to make this&nbsp;happen?</p><p>These three components give structure to our more detailed recommendations for Newham, each functioning differently within the context of the plan. While the principles emerged early in our research and guided the formation of the rest of the plan, the futures and enablers were the result of sustained engagement with council data and expertise.</p><p>The 6 Futures, which direct council departments toward visions of the transition in play, takes on some challenging areas, such as Newham’s property and social housing portfolio, which is associated with a majority of emissions in the council’s direct control. Equally important in this section was building on areas where Newham is already a leader, such as in its pioneering work around school meals, and the recent commissioning of micro-forests across the borough. Finally we were very aware that climate action plans can easily turn into lists of hundreds of actions. We sought to focus on the main actions where there would be significant impact across the principles if focused resources were brought to&nbsp;bear.</p><p>Our approach to the Just Transition was to recognise that much of the space for proposition was around capacity, resources, and governance within and between the council, civic society, businesses and institutions that had an interest in the borough. The 5 Enablers give shape to possible forms of governance and finance innovation for Newham, with a view toward capturing the maximum potential of the borough’s leaders across sectors and communities.</p><p>What’s next?</p><p>Since the plan’s launch by the Council on 5 December, it is available to examine more closely <a href="https://www.newham.gov.uk/council/just-transition-plan">here</a>. In <a href="https://www.arup.com/perspectives/publications/promotional-materials/section/youve-made-a-climate-action-plan-what-next-guidance-for-local-governments">“You’ve Made a Climate Action Plan, what next?”</a>, our colleagues at Arup pose the crucial question in the document’s title. For Newham, our collaboration to date represents tracks laid for the longer-term processes and effort which will be required to sustain momentum for the Just Transition. We look forward to continuing our collaboration, and developing future work to support the borough’s important work to increase equity, grow future-readiness, and reduce emissions.</p><p>Work by Emma Pfeiffer &amp; Dan Hill, in partnership with The London Borough of Newham&nbsp;Council</p>

 How open banking paints a more nuanced picture of borrowers  



<p>Even in the best economic circumstances, loans are often a necessity, especially for critical purchases like homes and cars.  &nbsp;</p>



<p> For some insight into the lending landscape, Mastercard surveyed 7,600 consumers across the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Germany and Spain about their recent financial experiences.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>The upshot: 89% have been adversely affected by economic pressures, and nearly half are struggling to get the loans and credit they need. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Traditional credit scores do not always reflect an applicant’s ability to make payments. Individuals with thin or no credit history can struggle to qualify for credit. Young adults on their own for the first time, gig workers who deal mostly in cash, new Americans and retirees with a single credit card and no loans can struggle to qualify for leases, credit cards and mobile phone contracts. </p>



<p>To most consumers, change is overdue — 87% believe the decisioning process should make it easier for responsible borrowers to prove their ability to repay. </p>







<p>Open banking could help provide that missing piece. By choosing to share their bank account data, applicants can paint a more complete picture of who they are. Real-time insights into their accounts — such as a thin credit borrower’s biweekly deposits, cash flow or consistent payments for bills like utilities — offer an up to date, more comprehensive view of their financial health. &nbsp;</p>







<p>This shift in consumer mindset opens new horizons for lenders, allowing them to champion more inclusive processes. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Open banking has the potential to accommodate millions of thin-credit applicants who have previously had difficulties accessing the benefits of the financial system. Consumers have spoken. They want the next evolution of lending to prioritize transparency, accessibility and empowerment for consumers worldwide to build a more inclusive digital economy where everyone thrives. &nbsp;</p>



 Digital lending is on the rise 



<p>The data revealed in Mastercard’s Lend Report shows global consumer support for a more transparent, digital-first approach to lending. Read more about the future of lending in Mastercard’s Lend Report&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finicity.com/future-of-lending-report/">here</a>.</p>

<p>While Identity and Access Management (IAM) long ago gave IT teams tighter controls against unauthorized access to digital services, it hasn’t exactly been bulletproof.</p>
<p>Yes, IAM consolidated the management and storage of user data and enabled login credentials to be associated with user roles and permissions easily. But it also created a single point of failure that hackers have proven painfully adept at exploiting to gain access to all the resources a user is authorized to access.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/journey-through-identity-models-centralized-federated-decentralized">Federated</a> identity management was supposed to fix that by involving a third party in the management of IAM. Instead, it retained all the dangers of centralized identity while extending the potential blast radius of compromised credentials to vast, interconnected networks. Meanwhile, the global cybercrime economy now tops $7.8 trillion a year. The good news: Decentralized digital identity (DID) management has emerged as a superior approach to managing user identity — if you have the right architecture to support it.</p>
 IAM More Than Just a Password or a Pretty Face 
<p>In <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/what-a-difference-identity-makes-why-iam-keeps-falling-short-and-how-to-fix-it/">Part One</a> of this series, we shared the contours of the <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/architectural-advantage/">1Kosmos architecture</a>, which employs automated, digitally verified identity to confirm user claims and credentials with up to 99.6% accuracy. In <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/possession-is-nine-tenths-of-the-flaw-why-device-based-biometrics-dont-cut-it-for-iam/">Part Two</a>, we showcased how we go above and beyond mere logins by binding identity to a biometric stored within a digital wallet. Yet, as solid as these architectural pillars are, we know that decentralized identity models offer a way to keep these and other personal identifiers and information far more secure than traditional user stores — centralized, federated, or otherwise.</p>
<p>To that end, let’s look at why we designed our architecture to support <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/decentralized-digital-identity/">a reusable identity wallet</a> that enables users to securely gain access to corporate systems using identity details that remain under their own control instead of being stored centrally on servers where they can be altered, misapplied, become inaccurate over time—or be swiped, ransomed, or leveraged to commit fraud.</p>
 Decentralized Identity: What’s In Your Wallet? 
<p>In our view, decentralized digital identity isn’t just important to modern IAM. It’s essential because: 1) it replaces platform-specific user stores that are hard to integrate because of proprietary technologies embedded deeply within those very same platforms, and 2) it replaces incomplete user personal identifiable information (PII) scattered across multiple business applications to one version of the truth managed directly by the user.</p>
<p>By leveraging advances in smartphones, cryptography, and blockchain technologies, our <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/verify/">BlockID solution</a> leverages the 1Kosmos architecture to establish high-assurance trust online in a way that balances security, privacy, and convenience. This enables organizations to confidently accelerate user onboarding and activation of digital services, protect digital accounts from unauthorized access (AKA account takeover), prevent transaction fraud, improve the user experience, and more. Specific features include:</p>
<p>A Reusable Identity Wallet</p>
<p>End users gain secure access not just to corporate accounts and systems but also to digital analogs of verified government-issued ID cards, driver licenses, passports, social security cards, and more—anytime, anywhere, from any device. Users also control what personal information they share with digital services in a manner consistent with emerging <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/ssi-eidas-bridge/about">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> frameworks.</p>
<p>Portability and Interoperability</p>
<p>1Kosmos offers the only solution certified to the highest FIDO, NIST, UKDAITF standards for interoperability and security and provides an SDK along with off-the-shelf APIs to simplify data sharing and integration.</p>
<p>Verifiable Claims &amp; Credentials</p>
<p>A way to digitally present in real time claims for a virtually limitless number and variety of machine-verified credentials and safely store them so they’re ready to reuse on-demand with user consent.</p>
<p>These features produce enormous benefits for organizations and end users, including the following.</p>
 Rapid Remote User Onboarding 
<p>The 1Kosmos digital identity wallet organizes and stores information gathered, triangulated, and validated during the identity-proofing stage of self-service user onboarding. This includes attributes from multiple, proof-able sources—and enables a wide variety of applications that require identity verification without requiring physical, in-person presence. Think worker and contractor onboarding, applications for government services and documents, and compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) mandates.</p>
 Security Backed by Public Key Cryptography 
<p>Our digital identity wallet consists of a decentralized identifier along with the cryptographic public-private key pair. Personal information about the user and their credentials are stored within the wallet and require the user’s private key and biometrics to read data from it. Because the private key never leaves the Secure Enclave within the device and the biometric can be authenticated with the highest digital standards available, this approach vastly exceeds the security achievable through passwords, traditional forms of multifactor authentication, and unverified device-level biometrics. In turn, this reduces cyber threats related to credentials stolen through phishing attacks, data breaches, and more.</p>
 User Convenience With Just the Right Friction 
<p>When data from the digital wallet needs to be presented—during login or in the event of step-up authentication—the wallet holder must present their biometric and consent to share that data. When approved, the private key is presented as a credential to unlock the wallet and share the data. The private key never leaves the device and hence the risk of compromise is dramatically minimized. Best of all: There are no passwords to remember or clumsy OTPs to enter.</p>
 Verifiable Credentials for a Zero-Trust World 
<p>Verifiable credentials are a standardized means of issuing and presenting claims about one’s identity—driver’s license, passport, college qualifications, gym membership, etc. Other types of information, such as educational certificates and vaccination records, for example, can also be added to the wallet to make the user’s identity-proofing process indisputable in any number of use cases. The identity wallet can make assertions about identity or credentials that are cryptographically verifiable by the receiving party—without the actual data being revealed. The major cryptographic element used by decentralized identities is known as a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/security-glossary/zero-knowledge-proof/">zero knowledge proof (ZKP)</a>. Zero Knowledge proof measures an information request while protecting user privacy.</p>
 Blockchain: This Is Just The Beginning 
<p>In Part Four, we’ll click further into how the 1Kosmos architecture leverages distributed ledger technologies (DLT) to eliminate the centralized PII honeypot while increasing business ability and speed.</p>

Residents in North East London who are part of the <a href="http://www.power.film">POWER</a> — a ‘show &amp; do’ project to kick start a “grassroots Green New Deal”. Photo credit — Hilary Powell and Dan&nbsp;Edelstyn We need to rethink our approach to retrofit. <p>If you know anything about <a href="https://www.cse.org.uk/news/what-is-retrofit/">retrofit</a>, you’ve probably heard this line plenty of times. The UK has one of the oldest and leakiest housing stocks in western Europe, and we need to retrofit 27 million homes by 2050 — approximately 1.5 homes per minute for the next 27&nbsp;years.</p><p>This is necessary not only to reach our legally binding Net Zero targets but to ensure healthy, comfortable and affordable homes in a rapidly changing&nbsp;climate.</p><p>You may also know that progress on retrofit is stalling. Each winter millions of UK residents experience the physical and mental health effects of living in damp, mouldy and expensive homes. Overheating is increasingly becoming an&nbsp;issue.</p><p>There’s a lot of discussion about the multiple barriers to retrofit and why it’s often left in the ‘too hard to do’ pile: it’s expensive, disruptive and even if we can afford it, many of us simply don’t have enough trust in a good outcome to start the journey. It’s also clear that existing government-funded retrofit programmes have under-delivered and under-spent.</p><p>Yet our research with HEAL and London Councils found that people up and down the country aren’t waiting for government action. Building on the existing fabric of community groups, cooperatives, community land trusts, neighbourhood regeneration initiatives and other social infrastructures, people are organising themselves to make their and their neighbours’ homes healthier and more climate resilient.</p><p>Communities are <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RetrofitBalsallHeath/">sharing information</a>, <a href="https://civicsquare.cc/">organising entire streets and neighbourhoods to retrofit together</a>, <a href="https://edinburghtoollibrary.org.uk/charitable-programmes/tooligan-initiatives/etl-retrofixers/">offering simple DIY retrofit measures for free</a>, <a href="https://www.power.film/about">turning their homes into power stations</a> and <a href="https://locohome.coop/">forming local cooperatives</a> that bring together householders, building professionals and tradespeople to generate retrofit demand and deliver high quality home improvements.</p> Putting residents and communities at the heart of&nbsp;retrofit <p>We believe that neighbourhoods can drive forward a nationwide movement to accelerate the uptake and delivery of retrofit and make our homes, communities and social infrastructure more fit for the future. Empowering people to retrofit together and transform their neighbourhood will provide significant other benefits, including good quality local jobs, better health and wellbeing, stronger local economies and community wealth and resilience.</p><p>A community-powered retrofit approach proposes four fundamental shifts in the way retrofit programmes are designed and delivered:</p><p>Individual customers → collective mobilisation</p><p>Design approaches that bring people&nbsp;together</p><p>Extractive finance and grants → local economic&nbsp;value</p><p>Invest in our local economies and communities</p><p>Standardised process → user centred&nbsp;journey</p><p>Design the retrofit offer around the resident experience, not around a Net Zero policy objective</p><p>Focus on ‘measures’ delivered → focus on&nbsp;outcomes</p><p>Contract for actual objectives — healthier and more comfortable homes and reduced carbon emissions</p><p>The focus of community powered retrofit is to mobilise local residents, communities, and stakeholders to be an integral part of designing and delivering retrofit programmes. At present most retrofit programmes view so called ‘community engagement’ as a cost line to be minimised. However there are significant benefits to investing in a place-based, community-powered approach:</p>  Significantly increased participation and power of collective action  Unlocking latent capacity, developing local skills and supply&nbsp;chains  Achieving replicability and economies of scale through co-location, bulk purchasing or typological approaches and potentially reduced disruption  Developing locally relevant responses that maximise co-benefits  Greater continuity and less dependence on (often inconsistent or shifting) policy  <p>Retrofit Balsall Heath is a partnership of local groups in the inner city neighbourhood in Birmingham. It has been incredibly successful in signing up households to participate in the City Council-led programme of ‘Local Area Development Scheme’ grant-funded retrofit works. The approach has involved mobilising a coalition of local community and faith organisations to galvanise support on a street-by-street basis and seeking to support the process throughout where feasible. Although the constraints of the programme design and funding has created issues, the approach has demonstrated that there is demand from residents for improvements to their homes. Traditional approaches using letter/leaflet drops typically achieve very low response rates and don’t build the trust that is needed for residents to stay the&nbsp;course.</p>A ‘street cake’ made by a resident of Link Rd. in Birmingham as part of a co-creation week around neighbourhood climate transitions hosted by CIVIC&nbsp;SQUARE<p>We propose five key building blocks to growing a community-powered retrofit movement. Each of these can — and should — be adapted to the unique context of each community and neighbourhood and its housing characteristics, history, ownership and local&nbsp;wishes.</p>  Movement building<br>Community members and leaders come together to set the vision and communicate the foundation for neighbourhood transformation and a shared mission for better homes and futures. This builds knowledge and trust, develops neighbourhood-level infrastructure for communication, engagement and action and encourages collective action. In <a href="https://oldhamenergyfutures.carbon.coop/">Oldham</a>, Carbon Coop worked with local people to establish a citizen-led approach to transform their neighbourhood and energy system. Groups also need to learn from each other. We’ve been working with many others in establishing the <a href="https://civicsquare.notion.site/Retrofit-Reimagined-2023-7aec7fbb992f4a4a97ca7d969a48b216">Retrofit Reimagined Festival</a> as a vehicle to build this movement.  Training and upskilling<br>Every community initiative integrates a plan for professional development of community members and upskilling of existing tradespeople to contribute to delivery of neighbourhood retrofit. This demonstrates that retrofit can support the local economy and provide good jobs, helps people to start on the journey to becoming skilled professionals and amplifies existing and latent talent among community members. Civic Square has initiated a <a href="https://civicsquare.notion.site/Neighbourhood-Trade-School-111b0cf89ad34e35aa7f64da612a03e1">local trade school</a> in Birmingham to develop both the ‘soft’ and ‘hard’ skills needed to support neighbourhood transitions. <a href="https://wecanmake.org/">We Can Make</a> has established a local factory to construct building components and a parallel skills programme. <a href="https://b4box.co.uk/">B4Box </a>is an integrated training provider retrofitting homes in areas affected by fuel poverty, training local people particularly those who face challenges in finding&nbsp;work.  Whole life design and journey planning<br>Residents, builders, planners, architects, building surveyors, placemaking and energy system professionals work together to design individual and collective neighbourhood transformations toward holistic long-term goals rather than quick fixes. There are many technology platforms to support this such as <a href="https://furbnow.com/">Furbnow</a>. For centralised grant-based programmes, successful delivery should be based on outcomes rather than on&nbsp;inputs.  Making finance work for places<br>Community groups can advocate for community wealth building approaches and explore options for local finance, including community energy, solar and other forms of cooperatives, collaborations with credit unions and fair and low-cost financing such as municipal bonds. There are successful <a href="https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/p/power-station">crowdfunding </a>and <a href="https://www.ethex.org.uk/invest/people-powered-retrofit">share&nbsp;offers</a>.  Local transition entities or coalitions<br>Retrofit programmes will take many years to deliver, and existing or new community-based entities should be established to support the area-based approach. These should be governed inclusively to provide access to all parts of the community and help to retain local control and economic benefits. Carbon Coop, Energy Communities Tipperary Coop and Cosy Homes Oxfordshire are demonstrating approaches in this space. Many community-owned energy cooperatives provide retrofit support to their areas, for example SELCE, West Oxford Community Renewables and Low Carbon West Oxford amongst&nbsp;others.  <p>There is no one-size-fits all approach to community-powered retrofit. However there are some concrete actions that can be taken&nbsp;now.</p>  Residents and existing community groups can establish forums to share knowledge and skills, approach their local authority and explore existing funding such as the <a href="https://energyredress.org.uk/">Energy Redress Scheme</a>. There are already over 400 community energy groups in the UK, many of which are involved in retrofit activities.  Local government and philanthropic funders should look to initiate or strengthen street or neighbourhood-scale projects&nbsp;by:    Identifying current community activity in retrofit or parallel domains (e.g. greening and gardening projects)  Working with local organisations and areas with known strong social networks to design, trial or build up existing street-scale schemes  Committing additional resource to support existing communities to build capacity and develop resilience for sustained action  Partnering with a broad range of cross-LA departments and agencies to develop skills, organisational and technical capacity  <p>3. All layers of government can enhance existing programmes by:</p>  Building trust and capacity in community partners and supporting new initiatives so that they are ready for future investment  Developing a spatial focus aligned to community partners  Including community partners in the bidding process from the&nbsp;outset  Understanding where CPR principles could integrate with grant programmes and in-house borough retrofit programmes  Partnering with trusted community-based intermediaries to expand the reach of existing programmes increasing uptake  Encouraging collaboration and co-design to ensure longevity of scheme measures and interventions available  Retrofit Balsall Heat — Neighbours attending a Housing protest march campaigning for retrofitting and better housing standards Working collectively is the only way to&nbsp;work <p>Retrofit is challenging. Acceptance of change accelerates when people see and experience change together, learn from each other and see the benefits that the change is bringing. By building momentum from the ground up across our cities, towns, villages and communities, we are planting the seeds for demand, building trust and shaping an approach to retrofit that will not only improve our homes and reduce carbon emissions but build social resilience and reframe the narrative around the climate transition as a pathway to a better&nbsp;future.</p><p>We are hoping that the next phase of Community Powered Retrofit will work with existing community groups to develop a replicable model and resource to enable and empower community retrofit groups around the country. We are looking for funders and existing groups to help bring this to life.
