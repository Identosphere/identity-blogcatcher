<p>Ontology’s innovative approach to tokenomics within the realm of cryptocurrency economics is epitomized through its dual-token system. This system, leveraging the foundational blockchain technology, distinguishes between utility tokens vs. security tokens, with ONT orchestrating governance and ONG driving utility. This separation allows for enhanced token liquidity and a balanced token distribution strategy.</p> Just want the basics — TLDR right&nbsp;here. <p>Dual-Token System: Ontology features a dual-token model for enhanced governance and utility within its ecosystem. ONT, the governance token, allows for staking and network decision-making, while ONG serves as the utility token, facilitating transactions and smart contracts.</p><p>ONT Utility: ONT is pivotal for securing the network and participating in its governance, offering stakeholders rewards in ONG for their contributions. For the current supply of ONT, visit CoinMarketCap.</p><p>ONG Utility: ONG, required for executing transactions and deploying smart contracts, incentivizes the active use of the network. Check the current supply of ONG at CoinMarketCap.</p><p>EVM Tokens: The integration into the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) enables ONT and ONG to function as ORC-20 tokens, broadening their applicability across Ethereum’s dApp ecosystem and enhancing Ontology’s interoperability within the blockchain landscape.</p><p>Want to know more — read&nbsp;on!</p> Introduction to Ontology’s Dual-Token Model <p>Ontology’s innovative blockchain technology introduces a dual-token system, enhancing both governance and utility within its ecosystem. ONT, the governance token, enables stakeholders to participate in network decision-making and secure the network through staking, epitomizing the concept of tokenomics in action. ONG, serving as the utility token, facilitates transactions and smart contracts, essential for the active use of the network. This division between utility tokens vs. security tokens ensures that participants can maintain their governance power without sacrificing their ability to engage in daily operations, creating a balanced economic model that fosters a stable and participatory ecosystem.</p> The Role of ONT in&nbsp;Ontology <p>ONT’s pivotal role in securing the network and providing governance underscores the importance of token supply and token allocation in cryptocurrency economics. With a total fixed supply of 1 billion tokens, ONT’s distribution strategy is a key aspect of Ontology’s tokenomics, ensuring a democratized and secure blockchain environment. This approach not only empowers ONT holders with significant influence over the network’s future direction but also aligns with the principles of blockchain staking, incentivizing long-term holding and active participation.</p> The Purpose of ONG in&nbsp;Ontology <p>As the ‘gas’ of the Ontology network, ONG exemplifies the utility token’s role in facilitating blockchain operations, from smart contracts to transactions. This dynamic incentive structure is central to Ontology’s tokenomics, ensuring that the network remains active and secure. The strategic cap on ONG’s total supply aligns with the network’s scalability requirements, showcasing the nuanced approach to cryptocurrency economics that Ontology employs to foster a healthy ecosystem.</p> Acquiring and Managing ONT and&nbsp;ONG <p>Accessible through various cryptocurrency exchanges, ONT and ONG offer flexibility and ease of entry for users looking to engage with the Ontology ecosystem. The ONTO Wallet simplifies the management of these tokens, enhancing token liquidity and streamlining the staking process. This ease of management is crucial for encouraging participation and governance within the network, reflecting the core principles of DeFi economics.</p> Staking with ONT: Benefits and Processes <p>Staking ONT not only contributes to the network’s security but also offers staking rewards, a compelling aspect of DeFi economics. This process is integral to the tokenomics model, incentivizing users to contribute to network stability and governance, and reflecting the broader trend towards yield farming and participation in liquidity pools.</p> Ontology’s Expansion to Ethereum Virtual Machine&nbsp;(EVM) <p>The integration of ONT and ONG as ORC-20 tokens into the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) marks a significant step towards enhancing Ontology’s interoperability and utility across the blockchain landscape. This move taps into the rich ecosystem of Ethereum’s dApps, broadening the applicability and reach of Ontology’s tokens, and underlining the importance of cross-chain collaboration in the evolving world of blockchain technology.</p> Conclusion: The Future of Ontology’s Tokens <p>ONT and ONG stand at the forefront of Ontology’s evolution, embodying the principles of tokenomics and cryptocurrency economics. As the blockchain sector continues to mature, the strategic application of these tokens within Ontology’s ecosystem will be crucial for maintaining its leading edge in blockchain-based identity and data management solutions. The ongoing development and expansion signal Ontology’s proactive approach to meeting the diverse needs of its user base, promising a bright future for these tokens in the realm of decentralized finance and governance.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/a-comprehensive-guide-to-ont-and-ong-ontologys-dual-token-system-417472d06345">A Comprehensive Guide to ONT and ONG: Ontology’s Dual-Token System</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Stakers can claim DF76 rewards. DF77 runs Feb 15— Feb 22, 2024. Bug fix in reward calculation  1. Overview <p>Ocean Data Farming (DF) is Ocean’s incentives program. In DF, you can earn OCEAN rewards by locking OCEAN, curating data, and making predictions (in Predictoor). <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">Here are DF&nbsp;docs</a>.</p><p>Data Farming Round 76 (DF76) has completed. 150K OCEAN + 20K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am Feb 8, 2024 and ended 12:01 am Feb 15. You can claim rewards at the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF77 is live today, Feb 15. It concludes on Feb 22. 150K OCEAN and 20K ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF77  <p>And, for this post we have a special section 5, about a bug fix in DF reward calculation. The summary is: some Data Farmers were underpaid in the last few rounds. We have fixed the issue. Data Farmers can claim their reimbursement in the usual way to claim, via the DF&nbsp;dapp.</p> 2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF77 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 20k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Passive DF applies to OCEAN locked on Ethereum mainnet. Predictoor DF applies to activity on Oasis Sapphire. Volume DF applies to data assets published on Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/discover/networks">Here</a> is more information about Ocean deployments to networks.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> 5. Bug fix in reward calculation  5.1 Overview <p>Some Data Farmers were underpaid in the last few rounds. They’ve now been compensated the difference. The rest of this section elaborates.</p> 5.2 The&nbsp;Issue <p>In early February 2024, we identified an issue affecting DF reward calculation. The part of code that limits reward based on DCV (data consume volume) was supposed to limit in units of OCEAN. However it limited in units of USD. This led to Volume DF rewards being lower than intended, starting in DF63 (start of Predictoor DF). There were 69 wallets affected, with a total of 64,501 OCEAN less than it should have&nbsp;been.</p> 5.3 Solution in&nbsp;Code <p>As soon as we discovered the issue, we fixed it by limiting using the correct units (OCEAN, not USD). Then we took steps to reimburse; see next&nbsp;section.</p> 5.4 Reimbursement <p>We always strive to do the right thing. Trust is of utmost importance to us.In this case, that means: ensuring that every DF participant receives the DF rewards they&nbsp;earned.</p><p>We carefully calculated the missed amounts for each affected wallet. Section 5.5 lists each affected wallet, and the amount of OCEAN that was&nbsp;missing.</p><p>We are pleased to announce that these reimbursements have been processed and are now available for claiming. Participants affected by this issue can claim their reimbursement in the same manner as they would typically claim their DF rewards via <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">https://df.oceandao.org/rewards</a>.</p> 5.5 OCEAN Reimbursed, per&nbsp;Wallet  +--------------------------------------------+-----------------+<br>| Address

 Stakers can claim DF75 rewards. DF76 runs Feb 8— Feb 15,&nbsp;2024 <p>[Note: this article was meant to be published on Feb 8,&nbsp;2024].</p> 1. Overview <p>Ocean Data Farming (DF) is Ocean’s incentives program. In DF, you can earn OCEAN rewards by locking OCEAN, curating data, and making predictions (in Predictoor). <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">Here are DF&nbsp;docs</a>.</p><p>Data Farming Round 75 (DF75) has completed. 150K OCEAN + 20K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am Feb 1, 2024 and ended 12:01 am Feb 8. You can claim rewards at the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards"> DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF76 is live as of Feb 8, 2024. It concludes on Feb 15. 150K OCEAN and 20K ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF76   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF76 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Passive DF applies to OCEAN locked on Ethereum mainnet. Predictoor DF applies to activity on Oasis Sapphire. Volume DF applies to data assets published on Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/discover/networks">Here</a> is more information about Ocean deployments to networks.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>When thinking of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> use cases, the question might be asked:&nbsp; What won’t AI be able to do? The easy answer is mostly manual labor, although the day might come when much of what is now manual labor will be accomplished by robotic devices controlled by AI. But right now, pure AI can be programmed for many tasks that require thought and intelligence, as long as that intelligence can be gathered digitally and used to train an AI system. AI is not yet loading the dishwasher after supper—but can help create a legal brief, a new product design, or a letter to grandma.</p>



<p>We’re all amazed by what AI can do. But the question for those of us in business is what are the best business uses? Assembling a version of the Mona Lisa in the style of Vincent van Gough is fun, but how often will that boost the bottom line? Here are 27 highly productive ways that AI use cases can help businesses improve their bottom line.</p>



 Customer-facing AI use cases 



 Deliver superior customer service 



<p>Customer interactions can now be assisted in real time with conversational AI. Voice-based queries use <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing">natural language processing</a> (NLP) and sentiment analysis for speech &nbsp;recognition so their conversations can begin immediately. Using <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning algorithms,</a> AI can understand what customers are saying as well as their tone—and can direct them to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/customer-service">customer service</a> agents when needed. With text to speech and NLP, AI can respond immediately to texted queries and instructions. There’s no need to make customers wait for the answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) or to take the next step to purchase. And digital customer service agents can boost customer satisfaction by offering advice and guidance to customer service agents.</p>



 Personalize customer experiences 



<p>The use of AI is effective for creating <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/take-advantage-of-ai-and-use-it-to-make-your-business-better/">personalized experiences</a> at scale through <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/chatbot-types/">chatbots, digital assistants and customer interfaces</a>, delivering tailored experiences and targeted advertisements to customers and end-users. For example, Amazon reminds customers to reorder their most often-purchased products, and shows them related products or suggestions. McDonald’s is building AI solutions for <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/Joint-Statement-from-McDonalds-and-IBM">customer care with IBM Watson AI technology</a> and NLP to accelerate the development of its automated order taking (AOT) technology. Not only will this help scale the AOT tech across markets, but it will also help tackle integrations including additional languages, dialects and menu variations. Over at Spotify, they’ll suggest a new artist for the customer’s listening pleasure. YouTube will deliver a curated feed of content suited to customer interests.</p>



 Promote cross- and up-selling 



<p>Recommendation engines use consumer behavior data and AI algorithms to help discover <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">data trends</a> to be used in the development of more effective up-selling and cross-selling strategies, resulting in more useful add-on recommendations for customers during checkout for online retailers. Other uses include Netflix offering viewing recommendations powered by models that process data sets collected from viewing history; LinkedIn uses ML to filter items in a newsfeed, making employment recommendations and suggestions on who to connect with; and Spotify uses ML models to generate its song recommendations.</p>



 Smarten up smartphones 



<p>Facial recognition turns on smartphones and voice assistants, powered by machine learning, while Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Google Assistant and Microsoft’s Copilot use NLP to recognize what we say and then respond appropriately. Companies also take advantage of ML in smartphone cameras to analyze and enhance photos using image classifiers, detect objects (or faces) in the images, and even use artificial neural networks to enhance or expand a photo by predicting what lies beyond its borders.</p>



 Introduce personal assistants 



<p>Virtual assistants or voice assistants, such as Amazon’s Alexa and Apple’s Siri, are powered by AI. When someone asks a question via speech or text, ML searches for the answer or recalls similar questions the person has asked before. The same technology can power messaging bots, such as those used by Facebook Messenger and Slack—while Google Assistant, Cortana and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-assistant">IBM watsonx Assistant</a> combine NLP to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/understanding-the-different-types-of-artificial-intelligence/">understand questions and requests</a>, take appropriate actions and compose responses.</p>



 Humanize Human Resources 



<p>AI can attract, develop and retain a skills-first <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-orchestrate/human-resources">workforce</a>. A flood of applications can be screened, sorted and passed to HR team members with precision. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/ibm-human-resources-watson-orchestrate">Manual promotion assessment</a> tasks can be automated, making it easier to gain important HR insights with a clearer view of, for example, employees up for promotion and assessing whether they’ve met <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/take-advantage-of-ai-and-use-it-to-make-your-business-better/">key benchmarks</a>. Routine questions from staff can be quickly answered using AI.</p>



 Creative AI use cases 



 Create with generative AI 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-ai-what-are-foundation-models-and-why-do-they-matter/">Generative AI</a> tools such as ChatGPT, Bard and DeepAI rely on limited memory AI capabilities to predict the next word, phrase or visual element within the content it’s generating. Generative AI can produce high-quality text, images and other content based on the data used for training.</p>



<p>IBM Research is working to help its customers use generative models to write high-quality&nbsp;<a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/codenet-ai-for-code">software code</a>&nbsp;faster, discover&nbsp;<a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/molecular-transformer-discovery">new molecules</a>, and train trustworthy <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watson-assistant">conversational chatbots</a>&nbsp;grounded on enterprise data. The IBM team is even using generative AI to create&nbsp;<a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-is-synthetic-data">synthetic data</a>&nbsp;to build more robust and trustworthy AI models and to stand in for real-world data protected by privacy and copyright laws.</p>



 Deliver new insights 



<p>Expert systems can be trained on a corpus—metadata used to train a machine learning model—to emulate the human decision-making process and apply this expertise to solve complex problems. These systems can evaluate vast amounts of data to uncover trends and patterns, and to make decisions. They can also help businesses predict future events and understand why past events occurred.</p>



 Clarify computer vision 



<p>AI-powered computer vision enables <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/image-segmentation">image segmentation</a>, which has a wide variety of &nbsp;use cases, including aiding diagnosis in medical imaging, automating locomotion for robotics and self-driving cars, identifying objects of interest in satellite images and photo tagging in social media. Running on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/neural-networks">neural networks</a>, computer vision enables systems to extract meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs.</p>



 Technical AI use cases 



 Speed operations with AIOps  



<p>There are many benefits to using&nbsp; <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/the-five-key-benefits-of-aiops-and-automation/">artificial intelligence for IT operations (AIOps)</a>. By infusing AI into <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/it-operations">IT operations</a>, companies can harness the considerable power of NLP, big data, and ML models to automate and streamline operational workflows, and monitor event correlation and causality determination.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/aiops">AIOps</a> is one of the fastest ways to boost ROI from digital transformation investments. Process automation is often centered on efforts to optimize spend, achieve greater operational efficiency and incorporate new and innovative technologies, which often translate into a better customer experience. More benefits from AI include building a more sustainable IT system and improving the continuous integration/continuous (CI/CD) delivery pipelines.</p>



 Automate coding and app modernization 



<p>Leading companies are now using generative AI for application modernization and enterprise IT operations, including automating coding, deploying and scaling. For coding, developers can input a coding command as a straightforward English sentence through a natural-language interface and get automatically generated <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-code-assistant">code</a>. Using generative AI with code generation capabilities can also enable hybrid cloud developers of all experience levels to migrate and modernize legacy application code at scale, to new target platforms with code consistency, fewer errors, and speed.</p>



 Boost application performance 



<p>Ensuring that apps perform consistently and constantly—without overprovisioning and overspending—is a critical <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/the-six-strategic-uses-cases-for-aiops/">AI operations (AIOps)</a> use case. Automation is key to optimizing cloud costs, and IT teams, no matter how skilled they are, don’t always have the capacity to continuously determine the exact compute, storage and database configurations needed to deliver performance at the lowest cost. AI software can identify when and how resources are used, and match actual demand in real time.</p>



 Strengthen end-to-end system resilience 



<p>To help ensure uninterrupted service availability, leading organizations use real-time <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/root-cause-analysis">root cause analysis</a> capabilities powered by AI and intelligent automation. AIOps can enable ITOps teams to swiftly identify the underlying causes of incidents and take immediate action to reduce both <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/mttr-vs-mtbf/">mean time between failures (MTBF)</a> and mean time to repair (MTTR) incidents.</p>



<p>AIOps platform solutions also consolidate data from multiple sources and correlate events into incidents, granting clear visibility into the entire IT environment through dynamic infrastructure visualizations, integrated AI capabilities and suggested remediation actions.</p>



<p>Using predictive IT management, IT teams can use AI to automate IT and network operations to resolve incidents swiftly and efficiently—and proactively prevent issues before they occur, enhance user experiences and cut the cost of and administrative tasks. To help eliminate tool sprawl, an enterprise-grade AIOps platform can provide a holistic view of IT operations on a central pane of glass for monitoring and management.</p>



 Lock in cybersecurity 



<p>There are many ways AI can use ML to deliver improved cybersecurity, including: facial recognition for authentication, fraud detection, antivirus programs to detect and block malware, reinforcement learning to train models that identify and respond to cyberattacks and detect intrusions and classification algorithms that label events as anomalies or phishing attacks.</p>



 Gear up robotics 



<p>AI is not just about asking for a haiku written by a cat. Robots handle and move physical objects. In industrial settings, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/strong-ai">narrow AI</a> can perform routine, repetitive tasks involving materials handling, assembly and quality inspections. AI can assist surgeons by monitoring vitals and detecting potential issues during procedures. Agricultural machines can engage in autonomous pruning, moving, thinning, seeding and spraying. Smart home devices such as the iRobot Roomba can navigate a home’s interior using computer vision and use data stored in memory to understand its progress. And if AI can guide a Roomba, it can also direct self-driving cars on the highway and <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/ibm-ai-edge-national-grid-monitoring">robots</a> moving merchandise in a distribution center or on patrol for security and safety protocols.</p>



 Clean up with predictive maintenance 



<p>AI can be used for <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/predictive-maintenance">predictive maintenance</a> by analyzing data directly from machinery to identify problems and flag required maintenance. AI has also been used to improve mechanical efficiency and reduce carbon emissions in engines. Maintenance schedules can use AI-powered predictive analytics to create greater efficiencies.</p>



 See what’s ahead 



<p>AI can assist with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/the-future-of-business-planning-with-generative-ai/">forecasting</a>. For example, a supply-chain function can use algorithms to predict future needs and the time products need to be shipped for timely arrival. This can help create new efficiencies, reduce overstocks and help make up for reordering oversights.</p>



 Industry AI use cases 



<p>AI can power tasks and tools for almost any industry to boost efficiency and productivity. AI can deliver <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/intelligent-automation">intelligent automation</a> to streamline business processes that were manual tasks or run on legacy systems—which can be resource-intensive, costly and prone to human error.

AI platforms can use machine learning and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/deep-learning-platform">deep learning</a> to spot suspicious or anomalous transactions. Banks and other lenders can use ML classification algorithms and predictive models to suggest loan decisions.</p>



<p>Many stock market transactions use ML with decades of stock market data to forecast trends and ultimately suggest whether and when to buy or sell. ML can also conduct algorithmic trading without human intervention. ML algorithms can predict patterns, improve accuracy, lower costs and reduce the risk of human error.</p>



 Healthcare 



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence-medicine">healthcare</a> industry is using&nbsp;intelligent automation&nbsp;with&nbsp;NLP to provide a consistent approach to data analysis, diagnosis and treatment. The use of&nbsp;chatbots&nbsp;in remote healthcare appointments requires less&nbsp;human intervention&nbsp;and often a shorter time to diagnosis.<br><br>On-site, ML can be used in radiology imaging, with AI-enabled computer vision often used to analyze mammograms and for early lung cancer screening. ML can also be trained to create treatment plans, classify tumors, find bone fractures and detect neurological disorders.</p>



<p>In genetic research, gene modification and genome sequencing, ML is used to identify how genes impact health. ML can identify genetic markers and genes that will or will not respond to a specific treatment or drug and may cause significant side effects in certain people.</p>



 Insurance 



<p>With AI, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-assistant/insurance">insurance</a> providers can virtually eliminate the need for manual rate calculations or payments and can simplify processing claims and appraisals. Intelligent automation also helps insurance companies adhere to compliance regulations more easily by ensuring that requirements are met. This way, they are also able to calculate the risk of an individual or entity and calculate the appropriate insurance rate.</p>



 Manufacturing 



<p>Advanced AI with analytics can help <a href="https://www.ibm.com/industries/manufacturing">manufacturers</a> create predictive insights on market trends. Generative AI can speed and optimize product design by helping companies create multiple design options. AI can also assist with suggestions for boosting production efficiency. Using historical data of production, generative AI can predict or locate equipment failures in real time—and then suggest equipment adjustments, repair options or needed spare parts.</p>



 Pharmaceuticals 



<p>For the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/delivering-responsible-ai-in-the-healthcare-and-life-sciences-industry/">life sciences</a> industry, drug discovery and production require an immense amount of data collection, collation, processing and analysis. A manual approach to development and testing could lead to calculation errors and require a huge volume of resources. By contrast, the production of Covid-19 vaccines in record time is an example of how intelligent automation enables processes that improve production speed and quality.</p>



 Retail 



<p>AI is becoming the secret weapon for <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/retailers-can-tap-generative-ai-to-enhance-support/">retailers</a> to better understand and cater to increasing consumer demands. With highly personalized online shopping, direct-to-consumer models and delivery services competing with retail, generative AI can help retailers and e-commerce firms improve customer care, plan marketing campaigns, and transform the capabilities of their talent and their applications.

<p>Generative AI excels at handling diverse data sources such as emails, images, videos, audio files and social media content. This unstructured data forms the backbone for creating models and the ongoing training of generative AI, so it can remain useful over time. Leveraging this unstructured data can extend benefits to various aspects of retail operations, including enhancing customer service through chatbots and facilitating more effective email routing. In practice, this could mean guiding users to the appropriate resources, whether that’s connecting them with the right agent or directing them to user guides and FAQs.</p>



 Transportation 



<p>AI informs many <a href="https://www.ibm.com/industries/travel-transportation">transportation</a> systems these days. For instance, Google Maps uses ML algorithms to check current traffic conditions, determine the fastest route, suggest places to “explore nearby” and estimate arrival times.</p>



<p>Ride-sharing applications such as Uber and Lyft use ML to match riders and drivers, set prices, examine traffic and, like Google Maps, analyze real-time traffic conditions to optimize driving routes and estimate arrival times.</p>



<p>Computer vision guides self-driving cars. An unsupervised ML algorithm enables self-driving cars to gather data from cameras and sensors to understand what’s happening around them, and enables real-time decision-making.</p>



 Delivering the promise of AI 



<p>Much of what AI can do seems miraculous, but much of what gets reported in the general media is frivolous fun or just plain scary. What is now available to business is a remarkably powerful tool that can help many industries and functions make great strides. The companies that do not explore and adopt the most beneficial AI use cases will soon be at a severe competitive disadvantage. Keeping an eye out for the most useful AI tools, such as IBM® watsonx.ai™, and mastering them now will pay great dividends.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/renewable-energy">Renewable energy</a> is energy produced from Earth’s natural resources, those that can be replenished faster than they are consumed. Common examples include solar power, hydropower and wind power. Shifting to these renewable energy sources is key to the fight against <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/climate-change">climate change</a>.</p>



<p>Today, a variety of incentives and subsidies help make it easier for companies to lean on renewable resources as a stable source of power to help alleviate the climate crisis. But the next generation of clean energy requires more than just incentive, it needs innovative technology to improve energy efficiency and power generation to help the world reach <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/net-zero">net-zero</a> emissions.</p>



 Solar 



<p>Converting sunlight to electrical energy happens in two ways—solar photovoltaics (PV) or concentrating solar-thermal power (CSP). The most common method, solar PV, collects sunlight using solar panels, converts it to electrical energy and stores it in batteries for a variety of uses.</p>



<p>Due to decreasing material prices and advancements in installation processes, the cost of solar power has dropped almost 90% over the past decade, making it more accessible and cost-effective.1 Fueling this further is the next generation of solar PV technology that’s producing lighter and more flexible, powerful and efficient solar panels that can generate electricity even during periods of low sunlight.</p>



<p>Solar energy generation relies on energy storage systems (ESS) for consistent distribution—so as generation capacity increases, storage systems must keep pace. For example, flow battery technology is being improved to support grid-scale energy storage. A low-cost, reliable and scalable form of ESS, flow batteries can hold hundreds of megawatt hours of electricity on a single charge. This enables utilities to store energy long-term for periods of low- or non-production, helping to manage load and create a stable and resilient power grid.</p>



<p>Extending ESS capabilities becomes increasingly important to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/decarbonization">decarbonization</a> efforts and a clean energy future as renewable power capacity expands. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), in 2023 alone, renewable energy increased its global capacity by 50%, with solar PV making up three-quarters of that capacity. And in the period between 2023 to 2028, renewable electricity capacity is expected to grow by 7,300 gigawatts with solar PV and onshore wind usage expected to at least double over current levels in India, Brazil, Europe and the US through 2028.2</p>



 Wind 



<p>Humans have been using wind power to generate mechanical and electrical energy for generations. As a clean, sustainable and cost-effective source of power, wind energy offers immense potential to increase the renewable energy transition across the globe with minimal impact to ecosystems. Based on the IEA forecast, wind electricity generation is expected to more than double to 350 gigawatts (GW) by 20283 with China’s renewable energy market increasing 66% in 2023 alone.4</p>



<p>Wind turbines have evolved from small-scale, such as windmills for household use, to utility-scale for wind farms. But some of the most exciting developments in wind technology are in offshore wind power generation, with many offshore wind projects navigating into deeper waters. Large-scale wind farms are being developed to harness stronger offshore winds to potentially double offshore wind power capacity. In September 2022, The White House announced plans to deploy 30 GW of floating offshore wind power by 2030. This initiative is set to provide 10 million more homes with clean energy, help lower energy costs, support clean energy jobs and further reduce the country’s reliance on fossil fuels.5</p>



<p>As more clean energy is integrated into power grids, forecasting renewable energy production becomes crucial to managing a stable, resilient electric supply. <a href="https://research.ibm.com/projects/renewables-forecasting">Renewables forecasting</a> is a solution built on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">AI</a>, sensors, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning?mhsrc=ibmsearch_a&amp;mhq=what%20is%20machine%20learning">machine learning</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/geospatial-data">geospatial data</a>, advanced analytics, best-in-class weather data and more to generate accurate, consistent forecasts for variable renewable energy resources like wind. More precise forecasts help operators integrate more renewable energy technologies into the electricity grid. They improve its efficiency and reliability by better projecting when to ramp production up or down, reducing operating costs. For example, Omega Energia <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/V3PG5DNY">increased renewables utilization by improving forecasting accuracy</a>—15% for wind and 30% for solar. These improvements helped boost maintenance efficiency and minimize operating costs.</p>



 Hydropower 



<p>Hydropower energy systems use water movement including river and stream flow, marine and tidal energy, reservoirs and dams to spin turbines to generate electricity. According to the IEA, hydro will remain the largest clean energy provider through 2030 with exciting new technologies on the horizon.6</p>



<p>For example, small-scale hydro uses mini-and micro-grids to provide renewable energy to rural areas and areas where larger infrastructure (such as dams) may not be feasible. Using a pump, turbine or waterwheel to convert the natural flow of small rivers and streams into electricity, small-scale hydro provides a sustainable energy source with minimal impact to local ecosystems. In many cases, communities can connect into a centralized grid and sell back excess power produced.</p>



<p>In 2021, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) placed three turbines made of a new thermoplastic composite material that’s less corrodible and more recyclable than traditional materials into New York City’s East River. The new turbines generated the same amount of energy in the same amount of time as their predecessors but with no discernable structural damage.7 Extreme condition testing is still necessary, but this low-cost, recyclable material has the potential to revolutionize the hydropower market if adopted for widespread use.</p>



 Geothermal 



<p>Geothermal power plants (large-scale) and geothermal heat pumps (GHPs) (small-scale) convert heat from the Earth’s interior into electricity using steam or hydrocarbon. Geothermal energy was once location dependent—requiring access to geothermal reservoirs deep under the Earth’s crust. The latest research is helping to make geothermal more location agnostic.</p>



<p>Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) bring the necessary water from below the Earth’s surface to where it isn’t, enabling geothermal energy production in places around the globe where it wasn’t previously possible. And as ESG technology evolves, tapping into the Earth’s inexhaustible supply of heat has the potential to provide limitless amounts of clean, low-cost energy for all.</p>



 Biomass 



<p>Bioenergy is generated from biomass which consists of organic material such as plants and algae. Although biomass is often disputed as truly renewable, today’s bioenergy is a near zero-emission source of energy.</p>



<p>Developments in biofuels including biodiesel and bioethanol are particularly exciting. Researchers in Australia are exploring converting organic material into sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). This could help reduce jet fuel carbon emissions by up to 80%.8 Stateside, the US Department of Energy’s (DOE) Bioenergy Technologies Office (BETO) is developing technology to help reduce the costs and environmental impacts of bioenergy and bioproduct production while improving their quality.9</p>



 Technology to support the future of renewable energy 



<p>A clean energy economy relies on renewable energy sources that are vulnerable to environmental factors and as more are incorporated into power grids, technology to help manage those risks is crucial. The IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite can help organizations boost resiliency and sustainability by anticipating potential disruptions and proactively reducing risk throughout operations and extended supply chains.</p>

 Towards multivalent currencies, bioregional monetary stewardship and a distributed global reserve&nbsp;currency <p>In Blogs 1–3 of this series we have been exploring the conceptual aspects of an alternative monetary system. In this final blog, we would like to shift gear and channel our thinking into a series of practical next&nbsp;steps.</p><p>The blog series is centred on the following enquiries and this reflection aims to address question&nbsp;four:</p>  What are the issues that make money (and our dominant monetary systems) so problematic? (<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-dac459dc844e">Blog&nbsp;1</a>)  Can we use design principles to help us imagine desirable future scenarios? (B<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-38ed3849395f">log&nbsp;2</a>)  What could a desirable future scenario actually look like? (<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-951ca09dd76d">Blog&nbsp;3</a>)  What can we start building and testing now to begin scaffolding a parallel&nbsp;system?  <p>Whilst writing this post, we began to feel a niggling sense of doubt. Something about it felt quite anticlimactic. In this initiative we started with a bold vision underpinned by some detailed research of the problem space. Now, as is so often the case we are grappling with the details of how to make things happen on the ground. In the messy reality of managing relationships, roles, time constraints and funding pressures, our suggestions for a way forward seem insubstantial. Rather than trying to pad them out or use technical language to shield the lack of clarity, we have decided to go ahead and share where we actually are, both in our thinking and in our aspiration for this&nbsp;work.</p> Questions we need to begin working&nbsp;on <p>We are publishing this Blog at an early stage of our thinking. At this point our ambitions far outweigh our intellectual ability and team capacity. This is overwhelming, exciting and humbling! To break through this paralysis we are sharing some open questions based on our initial internal brainstorming sessions and responses to the previous blogs (credited below). If you have reflections or questions of your own then then we would really welcome comments:</p>  What would a low tech, minimum viable proof of possibility look&nbsp;like?  How can we use existing technology meaningfully in different contexts (for example a rural area in the Global&nbsp;South)?¹  How can we account for different closed loop systems in their own rights without going down the data rabbit&nbsp;hole?  Can we build on the energy and intelligence of the Geospatial Community to leverage data in a richly contextual yet feasible&nbsp;format?²  How can we ensure that the idea of a Bioregion doesn’t perpetuate a fractured worldview?  How do we decide which cycles or measurements are the most important for a&nbsp;region?  What are we pegging a system’s health against? How can we estimate what the optimal regenerative potential might&nbsp;be?  What can people do with the individual tokens that they receive? Why would anyone want to take part in a&nbsp;project?  How will the main RegenCoins be exchanged both within and outside of the&nbsp;region?  What can we learn from previous attempts to implement local currencies such as those pioneered by the Transition Town Network?³  How can we make sure that the ability for different people to earn tokens is fair? For example, if somebody lives close to a river it might be easier to demonstrate acts of care than for somebody who lives further&nbsp;away.   Existing technology, tools and research that we can build&nbsp;on <p>We are both sure (and hugely relieved) that we are far from the first people to explore this subject. Many of the ideas outlined in the previous blogs have been inspired by the work of others, and we will continue to learn and incorporate as many diverse perspectives as possible. As we move towards our first prototype we have identified a number of initiatives that we think will provide invaluable insights:</p>  Using market based credit platforms as a basis for quantifying living systems: the level of data being collected is already significant. For example the<a href="https://seed-index.com/"> Seed Biocomplexity Index</a> has been developed to link geospatial satellite data with scientific literature. Another example is the <a href="https://www.regen.network/">Regen Network</a> which describes itself as ‘a platform to originate and invest in high-integrity carbon and biodiversity credits from ecological regeneration projects’. Although we are categorically not looking to price elements of the bioregion, the research underpinning some of the Network’s projects (e.g. pollinator health) could be a powerful learning framework. We are also interested to learn from less established initiatives such as land trust tokens being linked to river basin resilience programmes in South&nbsp;Africa¹.  Taxes pegged to positive activities: we hope to learn from proposals for tax incentive schemes that are specifically designed to encourage stewardship activities. An example is the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4524897">Malta Atlantica Restoration Currency</a> that is being proposed in&nbsp;Brazil.  Universal basic income / services pilots: there are a number of live and closed UBI/S pilots that we are intrigued to learn from. Of particular interest is to try to understand how people’s behaviour and perception of value is affected, when the link between monetary transactions and daily activities is less&nbsp;linear.³  Statistical forecasting models used in decision making: there is an exciting body of research emerging in the context of applying <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2022.1128055/full">Bayesian forecasting techniques to environmental modelling</a>. We are imagining that this might link closely to crypto economic research currently being conducted at hubs such as WU Vienna and ETH Zurich⁴. Partnering with an academic centre to bring their research into our prototype will be a priority.  Relational, flow based technology: the <a href="https://www.holochain.org/">Holochain Community</a> has developed a number of different peer-to-peer tools and resources that have strong value alignment with this proposal. In particular, the <a href="https://hrea.io/">hREA value flows specification</a> could provide a scaffold to connect the different activities that we would like to&nbsp;explore.  Currency and token design: community experts such as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/artbrock/">Arthur Brock</a> and <a href="https://www.voiceofhumanity.one/">Grace Rachmany</a> have deep knowledge and experience with alternative currency design. We would aim to consult and build on this expertise rather than trying to reinvent the&nbsp;wheel.  Thrutopia storytelling: the novelist and podcast host Manda Scott describes <a href="https://thrutopia.life/">Thrutopias</a> as ‘clear, engaging routes through to a world we’d all be proud to bequeath to future generations’. As we strive to test pathways in the present, we do not want to lose touch with the imaginative potential that we started to engage with in Blog 3. Prominent authors such as Kim Stanley Robinson⁵ and Yanis Varoufakis⁶ have explored ideas such as a carbon coin and free PerCap accounts within sci-fi narratives, and we will seek to engage with emerging writing in this&nbsp;field.⁷   A prototype proposition <p>As an initial call to action, we would like to partner with a community (or a number of communities) to build the foundations for the world’s first decentralised, bioregional bank. To make the project realistic we imagine that the areas involved will need to be small enough to make the data capture manageable. However they will also need to represent a number of different biophysical and social cycles to ensure a meaningful entangled value interaction is captured. It will also be important to engage with a supportive governance and legal environment for some stages of the work, to ground the prototype in the reality of the existing&nbsp;system.</p><p>We would invite interested communities and collaborators to self-select as high levels of trust and value alignment will be fundamental pillars of success. We will therefore be circulating these blogs and having conversations with a number of potential demonstrator locations. It feels important to clearly state that we do not have the financial resources at this point to pay people for their help. This is difficult and at times feels uncomfortable; the fear is that we may unwittingly perpetuate extractive behaviour in the pursuit of a regenerative goal. We are trying to balance our commitment to push this thinking forward, with a deep sense of respect for our ecosystem and will continually review the relationship between the two for signs of&nbsp;stress.</p>Credit: Eunji Kang, Dark Matter&nbsp;Labs<p>The prototype will be designed as 6 interlinked stages:</p>  Value mapping: here we will select a number of elements to visualise. The mix will depend on the location but could include a combination of air and water quality, soil health, biodiversity resilience, equity, care and trust. The mapping is likely to combine geospatial data with interviews, surveys and participatory workshops.  Real time sensory data gathering: based on the value mapping we will investigate the best ways of capturing the relational flows that define our selected elements. For some flows, sensors will already be in place whilst for others the process will be participatory.  Multivalent currency design and use: once we have an understanding of how value is being both created and eroded in our ecosystem, we will attempt to design self-regulating currencies to represent these multivalent flows.  Building a probabilistic model based on data inputs: this stage will combine the data and knowledge gained to simulate how the different elements are impacting on each other. The model will be interactive and infer each forecast from an updated understanding of the underlying systems.  Linking the model to governance decisions: this phase will focus on the interaction between the living agents and the value simulation. It will involve using the model to process multiple data inputs to inform a number of decisions. The outputs will be tested with the community to assess how accurately their views and values are being represented.  Creating a feedback loop between decisions and currency levels: as the system becomes more refined, the collective decisions can be used to adjust the currency levels of the base elements.  Grounding the results in regulatory or policy instruments: we will strive to link the multi-sensory decision making capabilities that have been co-developed with the community, to real world impacts. We hope that this might be achieved by testing a cross boundary tax payable in one (or a blend) of the new currencies. Another idea is to link the currencies to specific policy issues to elevate the agency and collective voice of the community. This second point has a strong link to the work that we have been prototyping in <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16vmzzaTFMUUyiwkwqVedZRA1QxChJ2UD/view?usp=sharing">Sweden</a>, Scotland and Canada to create multi-sensory, living indicators.  <p>We don’t know the exact details of how the above will be achieved but we are confident that the collective knowledge and tools are already available. The steps need not be taken consecutively and we imagine that different elements can be worked on across multiple contexts and time frames. A big part of this journey will be connecting people, ideas and technologies to work towards this common goal. If you would like to contribute or be kept up to date on progress then please do get in&nbsp;touch.</p><p>Thank you to everyone who has engaged with the project so far — we are honoured to be in community with&nbsp;you.</p><p>This blog was written by Emily Harris (<a href="mailto:emily@darkmatterlabs.org">emily@darkmatterlabs.org</a>) under Dark Matter’s Next Economics LAB.</p><p>Shifting from the We of Dark Matter to a more personal angle, I (Emily) would also like to acknowledge that I am probably a long way out of my depth in trying to seed this idea. I am a chartered accountant by background and spent the early part of my career working for Deloitte in corporate finance in the City of London. I am supported by amazing colleagues with diverse skills and backgrounds, but my own understanding of the technological (and other specialist fields) pointed to above is limited. My hope is that I can play a small role in bridging between these different worlds. I’m willing to try because it feels deeply important.</p><p>References and&nbsp;credits:</p>  Credit: question from Michael Haupt via Medium comments.

<p>The new year is always a time for reflection, and after a year shaped by AI, biometrics, and nation-state attacks there’s a lot to think about. So where are we headed from here? A utopian episode of Star Trek or a more dystopian Terminator 10 movie? The future as they say is up to us and that means reshaping trust and security for the realities of our brave new world.</p>
<p>The intensifying geopolitical landscape characterized by nation-sponsored attacks has made cyber the new battleground. Employing <a href="https://www.entrust.com/cybersecurity-institute/reports/building-a-solid-foundation-for-your-zero-trust-framework">Zero Trust</a> principles is a best practice, but not a cybersecurity guarantee in an era of AI-enhanced phishing, zero-day brokers, and malware-as-a-service. Adopting a term from U.S. Cold War simulations, <a href="https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/insights/what-is-red-teaming.html">red teaming</a> is back in vogue. The red team is a pretend enemy that attempts to mount a cyberattack acting under the direction of the target organization. One such example comes from the <a href="https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/european-central-bank-to-put-banks-through-cyber-stress-test-a-24012?rf=2024-01-03_ENEWS_SUB_BIS__Slot1_ART24012&amp;mkt_tok=MDUxLVpYSS0yMzcAAAGQbvkmv4W-kSt1bPEzX98HJHUg04qWbpdOLJZTWjt_FPgrLy6XKsAky0jtvHG2DOrkVD9V66UM28zIenSQA8_0Smm1P_k2nVRNxCR3ykteB8xV6BBlHQ">European Central Bank</a>, which has started to conduct vulnerability assessments and incident response tests on banks to assess their cyber resilience. Whether simulated or real, all organizations should seek to turn cyber breaches into a blueprint for future security with actionable strategies to strengthen their cyber posture.</p>
<p>One particular area of cyber exposure is <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/news/high-impact-attacks-on-critical-infrastructure-climb-140/">critical infrastructure</a>, from the power grid to water treatment plants to public service providers and beyond. We live in an “everything is connected to everything” world, making critical infrastructure a vulnerable and attractive target to bad actors. In 2024, it’s long past time to get serious about <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/certificate-solutions/products/pki/iot-security">IoT</a> and Industrial IoT (IIoT) security. As well, AI-enabled biometric identity verification of employees, partners, and customers is increasingly essential to flushing out <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/1251094/deepfakes-emerge-as-a-top-security-threat-ahead-of-the-2024-us-election.html">deepfakes</a> and keeping organizations and people safe.</p>
<p>There are also some encouraging signs that regulators around the globe are stepping up to the challenges ahead. Similar to data privacy, consumer protection, and digital identity legislation, Europe is on the vanguard once again with the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence">EU AI Act</a>. The White House has also issued the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/">Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence Executive Order</a> and the bipartisan <a href="https://www.schatz.senate.gov/news/press-releases/schatz-kennedy-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-provide-more-transparency-on-ai-generated-content">Schatz-Kennedy AI Labeling Act</a> has been tabled. However, being that it’s an election year in the U.S., it’s likely that big tech will be left largely to self-regulate over the next 12 months. That said, the tech sector is stepping up, with seven technology behemoths including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft agreeing to adopt <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-secures-voluntary-commitments-from-leading-artificial-intelligence-companies-to-manage-the-risks-posed-by-ai/">AI safeguards</a> with the Biden administration. As well, ChatGPT maker and close Microsoft collaborator OpenAI has released its <a href="https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/openai-formulates-framework-to-mitigate-catastrophic-risks-a-23930">framework to mitigate catastrophic risks</a> like using generative AI to build biological weapons, spread malware, or carry out social engineering attacks. Meanwhile, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been busy building out the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework">Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework </a> (AI RMF) in close collaboration with the private and public sector to continue to leverage the power of AI while mitigating the risk.</p>
<p>So, at the outset of 2024, I remain cautiously optimistic that the forces of good will prevail and it will be a utopian technology-fueled future.</p>

				  Save your organization valuable development time while building digital wallet functionality right into your existing applications.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>An organization’s digital app is often one of the most effective ways it engages customers. For example, the American Bankers Association found that <a href="https://www.aba.com/about-us/press-room/press-releases/consumer-survey-banking-methods-2023#:~:text=More%20than%20half%20of%20Generation,prefer%20to%20visit%20a%20branch.">48% of bank customers</a> prefer mobile apps as their method of choice for managing their finances.</p>
<p>Given this, you want to make sure of two things: One, that it offers easy-to-use features, and two,&nbsp; that your customers stay on your app spending their time and money with you rather than going elsewhere.</p>
<p>Indicio designed the Proven Mobile SDK specifically to help you do both of these things.</p>
<p>Faster App Feature Deployment</p>
<p>App design and construction is not a simple process: for applications with multiple features, most sources say the average development time is <a href="https://spdload.com/blog/how-long-does-it-take-to-develop-an-app/">nine months or longer.</a> With this much time and money at stake, adding new features that require complex code changes is daunting, and it can be tempting to simply add on a third party application to achieve the required functionality.</p>
<p>But relying on a third party to handle features means sending your customers to that third party, reducing their time spent on your platform, and — crucially — losing control of their customer experience. For example, if you run a business and the only way to purchase something on your website is a third-party payment platform that is constantly buggy, the experience will be tied to using your website and risk losing you customers. People do not reward complexity and hassle online.</p>
<p>This is where the Proven Mobile SDK comes in. It helps you build digital wallet functionality directly into your existing application without your team having to reinvent the wheel. Built with packages for Swift, Kotlin, and React Native, your developers can add decentralized identity to your applications without the time commitment of learning new programming languages or practices.</p>
<p>But what functionality and features does the SDK add to your application that will enhance the customer experience?</p>
<p>Faster interactions through pre-verified data</p>
<p>Full digital wallet functionality allows you to hold and share verifiable data and identity information inside a digital credential —&nbsp;a “verifiable” credential. With verifiable credentials you can be cryptographically confident in who you’re interacting with online. Unlike passwords, verifiable credentials automatically share who issued them and who is presenting them in a provable way, as well as whether any information has been altered since being created, making them impossible to copy or steal.</p>
<p>Because these credentials can prove who you are on their own, they remove the need for the customer to jump through hoops when accessing their account, such as passwords, MFA, security keys, and more, letting customers move right on to what they came for.</p>
<p>Indicio Proven Mobile SDK in action:</p>
<p>One powerful use case for verifiable credentials is Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations. A financial institution can do its full customer vetting for account creation, a business loan, or mortgage and issue them a credential containing the relevant information. This means that the customer can share that information in a way that is provable,&nbsp; removing the need to repeat the expensive KYC process.</p>
<p>Schools can <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-revolutionizes-adoption-of-open-badges/">issue credential-based diplomas</a> that allow students to share them without the need to reach back out to the school for verification; businesses can use them for both <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven-works-verifiable-credentials-for-frictionless-secure-employee-identification/">employee access management</a> and customer loyalty programs; countries can allow their citizens to share their resident status for all kinds of things from <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicios-digital-travel-credential-is-what-the-travel-industry-has-been-waiting-for/">travel</a> to paying bills to <a href="https://indicio.tech/digital-identity-and-the-public-sector-using-verifiable-credentials-to-manage-social-security/">proving residency</a>.</p>
<p>In short, once you’ve met your initial identity assurance requirements, verifiable credentials can eliminate redundant paperwork and data input, and provide a simpler, streamlined, better customer experience.</p>
<p>And the Proven Mobile SDK provides all the pieces you need. In a fraction of the time. On any application. In whatever language your team is familiar with.</p>

 System to achieve full compliance of Crypto Asset Service Providers and self-hosted wallets with AML regulations and the Transfer of Funds Regulation&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Munich, February 13, 2024 – IDnow, a leading identity verification platform provider in Europe, joins a consortium of five partners including the <a href="https://www.iota.org/">IOTA Foundation</a>, <a href="https://walt.id/">walt.id</a>, <a href="https://spyce5.com/">SPYCE.5</a>, and <a href="https://bloomwallet.io/">Bloom Labs</a> with the goal of making Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) and self-hosted wallets compliant with the European Anti-Money-Laundering Regulation and the Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new TFR regulation in the EU mandates that all cryptocurrency transactions will need to carry identifying data of the sender and the receiver. According to the new rule, compliance with TFR is mandatory for all CASPs. Additionally, the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0420">new AML Regulation</a> will require all CASPs to comply with similar AML rules as other financial institutions. For example, when a user opens an account and registers a wallet with a CASP, an identification process is required to comply with the new AML Regulation and TFR.</p>



<p>One challenge for CASPs to adhere to the new rules lies in GDPR compliance, as personal identifiable information (PII) should not be stored on blockchains or Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT). However, to comply with the new regulations, CASPs need to know with whom they are doing business and continuously verify this information.</p>



<p>Raising trust and transparency in crypto asset transactions</p>



<p>To address this challenge, the partners have formed a consortium to propose a system where a trusted party tokenizes an identification process it has witnessed, allowing CASPs to have confidence in this process, without revealing any PII. The resulting soul-bound token (SBT) can be used for blockchain processes, enabling web3 native interactions. Furthermore, the trusted party can reveal the identity information, if requested by an authorized party, such as law enforcement, as well as revoke the SBT, if needed.</p>



<p>Within the consortium, the IOTA Foundation, a non-profit foundation supporting the development of the IOTA protocol, will provide the underlying network as the proposed solution will be implemented on an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible IOTA Smart Contract Chain. walt.id, a leading open source vendor of decentralized identity and wallet infrastructure, will develop, provide, and maintain the trusted witness service for creating and verifying SBTs like identity proofs, while IDnow will deliver the identity verification solution to onboard users into the wallet solution. Bloom, an all-in-one wallet for the IOTA, Shimmer and EVM ecosystem, will provide the capabilities for users to store, present and prove ownership of the SBT. SPYCE.5, specializing in the integration of hybrid blockchain technologies, will provide the essential infrastructure for seamless interchain communication and transaction validation, ensuring the system’s overall efficiency and regulatory compliance.</p>



<p>Statements</p>



<p>“We are excited to be part of this forward-thinking consortium alongside highly esteemed crypto asset industry players to address a pressing need for crypto wallet solutions that comply with the latest EU regulations. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">Crypto companies</a> are facing a race against the clock to implement new requirements, which is why we wish to submit this proposed solution to the EU for consideration to address the technological and regulatory challenges around AML, KYC and TFR in crypto,” says Rayissa Armata, Director Global Regulatory and Government Affairs at IDnow.</p>



<p>“We are thrilled to be working with such incredible partners to create a truly seamless user experience and to provide the underlying distributed ledger technology. Identity verification in Web3 environments should be simple and straightforward, without sacrificing privacy or security. As regulatory requirements grow, we need innovative solutions that are easy to use for both businesses and everyday users,” says Dominik Schiener, Chairman of the Board of the IOTA Foundation.</p>



<p>“We have been building decentralized identity and wallet solutions for many clients across various industries, but this project is particularly interesting as it shows new ways of onboarding and verifying users for crypto and DeFi use cases that have traditionally been struggling with regulatory compliance,” says Dominik Beron, Founder of walt.id.</p>

<p>A campaign to privatise NHS health data — your data — is now under way and building momentum.</p><p>It started in earnest in November 2023, when the Government handed a £330m contract to the US spyware firm Palantir to build a ‘federated data platform’ that will enable NHS trusts and regional health systems to share confidential patient information. Then, last week, The Times ran a front page story calling for the creation of ‘digital health passports’ which would take this process much&nbsp;further.</p><p>The week before that, former prime minister Tony Blair and former Leader of the Conservative Party William Hague joined forces <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/75ila1cntaeh/3pN0p29FVT0XV1FV9Up4MV/d2eaa86f106369827c3eed1b113c92ff/Tony_Blair_Institute_A_New_National_Purpose_-_Leading_the_Biotech_Revolution_January_2024.pdf">in a report</a> calling for the creation of an NHS Data Trust. This Trust would gather individuals health data from many different sources (e.g. NHS Trusts, GPs, care services, pharmacists), assemble it in one place and sell it to Big Tech firms in the private&nbsp;sector.</p> How to build a bandwagon <p>Bandwagons wreak untold damage by following these basic four&nbsp;steps:</p><p>1) Admit there’s a problem with something you’ve been stubbornly ignoring for years. The NHS tells us that its new Federated Data Platform is needed because, historically, data was “held in different systems that didn’t speak to each other, creating burdens for staff and delays to patient care” and making it “difficult to work at scale and share information”. People (including us at Mydex) have been complaining about this for&nbsp;decades.</p><p>2) Wax lyrical about all the benefits that would flow if this problem was addressed. The NHS promises that improved data sharing will “bring big benefits for patients by ensuring more joined up care, greater choice and improved health outcomes”.</p><p>The Times <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24398476/times-health-commission_report_2024.pdf">Health Commission</a>, whose work is the subject of its front page article, tells us that by enabling patients to “have their health information digitally stored in one place any doctor treating them can access their records no matter where they are”. Patients would gain access to their own medical records, and be able to use the system as a gateway to book appointments, order prescriptions, view test results and contact&nbsp;doctors.</p><p>What’s not to like? We at Mydex CIC have been banging on about exactly these things for many years&nbsp;now.</p> Bait and&nbsp;switch <p>Then comes the crucial third step. 3) Propose a solution which seems to solve the problem but which doesn’t — which delivers an entirely different outcome instead. This is the crucial bait and switch; the secret sauce of every successful bandwagon.</p><p>The fourth step then follows so smoothly it’s almost automatic. 4) Use the excitement and enthusiasm generated for the benefits you are promising to implement the bait-and-switch solution — to deliver an entirely different outcome.</p><p>The likely end result in this case&nbsp;is:</p>  Huge amounts of available time, effort, energy and resources squandered on white elephant IT projects that never delivers their&nbsp;promise.  A raft of other ‘unintended’ consequences, such as handing over one of the country’s — and your — most valuable assets to big US tech monopolies.  <p>The trick with all such bandwagons is to exploit peoples’ best intentions — to harness their enthusiasm, commitment and energy — and to use this enthusiasm and energy for your own purposes, leaving them to suffer the consequences and clear up the&nbsp;mess.</p><p>In this case, it is absolutely right and necessary that available data is shared to generate more efficient joined up, seamless services that deliver better outcomes. But the solutions being proposed will do the exact opposite. Instead, they will neatly assemble our personal data into juicy packages and deliver them on a plate, ready and waiting for Big Tech vultures to&nbsp;pounce.</p> Real and pretend solutions <p>There are basically two different ways to share data: the centralised organisation-centric way, and the distributed, decentralised person-centric way.</p><p>This bandwagon is all about promising the benefits of the person-centric approach while delivering its opposite: recreating, deepening and extending the centralised approach that caused all of our current problems in the first place — only this time, at a higher, bigger&nbsp;level.</p><p>The organisation-centric centralised solution to the problem of data sharing has the following characteristics.</p>  It requires the Government to create vast new IT projects, which hand over hundreds of millions of pounds over to big US tech firms (such as Palantir). Such projects somehow never actually deliver what they were supposed to deliver, but always take far longer to complete and cost far more than their original projections.  It compounds rather than simplifies or eliminates the critical data logistics issues of how to move data from one provider to another (or provide access to this data) while a) ensuring its reliability and b) protecting the privacy of the individuals the data relates&nbsp;to.  It compounds rather than reduces the complexities and risks of managing consents, permissions and GDPR compliance, especially across borders. Proponents of these solutions always make a big point about patients being ‘in control’. But in reality, what they mean by this is that people will be bombarded with requests for permissions to access their data using processes that are both annoying and wide open to gaming — like the cookie pop-ups that plague our use of websites today. Meanwhile, they are disturbingly vague about who, exactly, would be able to access this data. (What do they mean, for example, by the word ‘researchers’?)  It limits the data that can be collected. As The Times Health Commission points out, one key problem with the current NHS Federated Data Platform is that it does not include GP or social care data, so even when it is implemented services will still not be properly integrated. The Health Commission therefore wants to go further, integrating data from GPs, NHS hospitals, pharmacies and social&nbsp;care.  <p>But even then, if your real goal is to address a person’s health, you would still be falling short. According to WHO, 60% of health outcomes are determined largely or mainly by lifestyle issues — data which health services do not collect. Which means that even if the Health Commission solution was implemented, many of its promises could never be realised.</p><p>But never mind. The bandwagoneers have an even better answer. In their proposals for the creation of an NHS Data Trust, Tony Blair and William Hague recognise this, talking of the need to integrate data about individuals’ “lifestyle, genetics, personality and physiology”, all of which could go into the individual’s ‘personal health account’&nbsp;… and put up for sale to private sector ‘researchers’ for the purposes of ‘commercialisation’!</p><p>What started out as a promise of citizen empowerment and seamless service provision somehow ends up as a Big Brother agenda for Big&nbsp;Tech.</p>  It limits the uses to which this data can be put. The biggest opportunity for improvement in health services today is not access to medical records per se but the organisation, coordination, planning, handovers and administration of all the activities that surround them. It’s about the ability to access and share exactly the right data at the right times. That requires a modular approach to data management, capable of instant and endless configuration and reconfiguration, that these centralised systems can never&nbsp;deliver.   Making real progress&nbsp;possible <p>Empowering citizens with their own data is the alternative approach to the problems the bandwagoneers are now claiming to address. Under this decentralised approach (which Mydex has been building for decades, and which is now live and operational) individuals are equipped with tools to collect all the data they need to manage their lives in their own database. This database remains directly under their control, in systems that work independently of the systems used by organisations that hold data about&nbsp;them.</p><p>These organisations deposit copies of key data in the individual’s personal data store. Individuals can choose to selectively share relevant portions of this data to service providers they trust and want to deal&nbsp;with.</p><p>This approach avoids all the problems associated with the new centralised systems now being campaigned for by the bandwagoneers.</p>  Far from requiring vast, expensive, time consuming new and risky IT contracts, the infrastructure already exists and can be implemented incrementally on a very low cost, case-by-case, test-and-learn basis.  It simplifies data logistics issues because it is designed at heart to enable automated data sharing (via APIs that create safe links between key data points) directly under the individual’s control (like a direct&nbsp;debit).  It simplifies issues relating to consents and permissions via standardised data sharing agreements that make it clear what data is being shared, with who, for what purposes. It builds implementation of human rights into the day-to-day operations of service provision.  It expands the range of data that can be collected, to include lifestyle data and data from other sources such as data from individuals’ own wearable devices. The only people able to see all of this data are the individuals themselves — because all the data is encrypted and only they have the encryption key that provides access to it. But they can share relevant bits of it whenever they need&nbsp;to.  It can simply be plugged into existing systems and services directly impacting operational delivery of health and care services, helping to heal the multiple flaws of the current organisation-centric approach.   Conclusion <p>It’s good that at last the great and good are beginning to acknowledge that instead of simply hoarding data, to streamline processes, create seamless services and deliver better outcomes, this data needs to be shared. The central question in health today is not whether we should do this, but&nbsp;how.</p><p>Elsewhere in Government, some genuine progress is being made. For example, the new UK Identity and Attributes Trust Framework envisages equipping people with their very own Personal Holder Service (personal data store) by which they can collect, receive, store and share data about their lives, where and when they want. These Holder Services give citizens agency and control while enabling safe, efficient, fit-for-purpose data&nbsp;sharing.</p><p>What’s needed is new citizen-empowering data infrastructure such as this — infrastructure that tackles data sharing challenges at their root. But this is not what the bandwagoneers are proposing. Instead, they are simply offering more of the same, only at a different, higher level. Our health services and citizens need and deserve much better than&nbsp;that.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/beware-a-new-data-bandwagon-is-rolling-5eebf8501a42">Beware!

<p>SAP ECC has been the ERP solution that runs the core business of many global enterprises&nbsp;for over two decades. While SAP released their next-generation ERP, S/4HANA, in 2015 and announced its plans to discontinue the support for ECC by 2027,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/11/sap_ecc_migration_s4hana/">more than 60% of customers</a> have yet to initiate their move to S/4HANA1. A key reason for this hesitancy is the complexity and cost of migrating to a new ERP platform. With ECC driving mission-critical processes, businesses cannot afford disruption to their day-to-day operations. Since 2021, SAP’s approach to simplifying this was to create a SaaS-based solution for S/4HANA on a single contract called&nbsp;RISE with SAP&nbsp;that includes software, infrastructure and services to migrate to S/4HANA. SAPinsider’s RISE with SAP 2023 report <a href="https://sapinsider.org/research-reports/rise-with-sap-2023/">identified</a> the primary benefit as the single contract that enables a cost-effective move2.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the approaching 2027 deadline to move to S/4HANA, now is the time for businesses to start executing their modernization strategy, considering their priorities, landscape and the ROI of the transformation. As with most enterprise IT modernization programs, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Moving to S/4HANA could involve modernizing the stack from application to database to infrastructure, depending on the current ERP landscape. The key to determining the most non-disruptive approach is identifying what needs to be changed and retained in your architecture, considering the short-term and long-term benefits.</p>



<p>SAP offers both cloud and on-prem deployment options for S/4HANA. However, SAP has announced that all their latest innovations around generative AI and sustainability capabilities will only be available on the cloud version of S/4HANA, which is only available through the RISE offering. This also means that any S/4HANA deployment on the Cloud other than through RISE is&nbsp;S/4HANA AnyPremise,&nbsp;that is, the on-premise license hosted in the Cloud and not&nbsp;S/4HANA Cloud. Whether businesses want to move to S/4HANA Cloud or host S/4HANA AnyPremise in the cloud, or continue to run SAP workloads in an on-premise environment, IBM® offers the flexibility and choice of hybrid cloud options and is the only IaaS provider that offers <a href="https://www.sap.com/dmc/exp/2014-09-02-hana-hardware/enEN/#/solutions?filters=v:deCertified;iaas">SAP-certified instances</a> on Power and Intel x86 architectures3.</p>

<p>Remember how cool it felt when you first held a smartphone in your hand? The compact design and touch-based interactivity seemed like a leap into the future. Before long, smartphones became a way of life for organizations worldwide because of all they offer for business productivity and communication. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/technology/generative-ai">Generative AI</a> (<a href="https://www.ibm.com/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>) promises a similar leap in productivity and the emergence of new modes of working and creating.</p>



<p>Tools such as Midjourney and ChatGPT are gaining attention for their capabilities in generating realistic images, video and sophisticated, human-like text, extending the limits of AI’s creative potential. Generative AI represents a significant advancement in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/deep-learning">deep learning </a>and AI development, with some suggesting it’s a move towards developing “<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/strong-ai">strong AI</a>.” This evolution demonstrates that computers have moved beyond mere number-crunching devices. They are now capable of natural language processing (<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing">NLP</a>), grasping context and exhibiting elements of creativity.</p>



<p>For example, organizations can use generative AI to:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Quickly turn mountains of unstructured text into specific and usable document summaries, paving the way for more informed decision-making. 



 Automate tedious, repetitive tasks. 



 Streamline workflows with personalized content creation, tailored product descriptions and market-ready copy. 



 Design content, ad campaigns and innovative products that build better customer experiences. 
 



 Demystifying generative AI 



<p>At the heart of Generative AI lie massive databases of texts, images, code and other data types. This data is fed into generational models, and there are a few to choose from, each developed to excel at a specific task. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) or variational autoencoders (VAEs) are used for images, videos, 3D models and music. Autoregressive models or large language models (LLMs) are used for text and language.</p>



<p>Like diligent students, these generative models soak up information and identify patterns, structures and relationships between data points, which is how they learn the grammar of poetry, artistic brushstrokes and musical melodies.</p>



<p>Generative AI uses advanced <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a> algorithms and techniques to analyze patterns and build statistical models. Imagine each data point as a glowing orb placed on a vast, multi-dimensional landscape. The model meticulously maps these orbs, calculating the relative heights, valleys, smooth slopes and jagged cliffs to create a probability map, a guidebook for predicting where the next orb (i.e., the generated content) should most likely land.</p>



<p>Now, when the user provides a prompt—a word, a sketch, a musical snippet or a line of code—the prompt acts like a beacon, drawing the model towards a specific region on that probability map; the model then navigates this landscape, probabilistically choosing the next element, the next and the next, guided by the patterns it learned and the nudge of the users’ prompt.</p>



<p>Each output is unique yet statistically tethered to the data the model learned from. It’s not just copying and pasting; it’s creatively building upon a foundation of knowledge fueled by probability and the guiding prompt. While advanced models can handle diverse data types, some excel at specific tasks, like text generation, information summary or image creation.</p>



<p>The quality of outputs depends heavily on training data, adjusting the model’s parameters and prompt engineering, so responsible data sourcing and bias mitigation are crucial. Imagine training a generative AI model on a dataset of only romance novels. The result will be unusable if a user prompts the model to write a factual news article.</p>



 Harnessing the value of generative AI 



<p>Generative AI is a potent tool, but how do organizations harness this power? There are two paths most businesses are traveling to realize the value of generative AI:</p>



 Ready-to-launch tools: 



<p>The “AI for everyone” option: Platforms like ChatGPT and Synthesia.io come pre-trained on vast datasets, allowing users to tap into their generative capabilities without building and training models from scratch. Organizations can fine-tune these models with specific data, nudging them towards outputs tailored to particular business needs. User-friendly interfaces and integration tools make them accessible even for non-technical folks.</p>



<p>These public options offer limited control, less customization of model behavior and outputs and the potential for bias inherited from the pre-trained models.</p>



 Custom-trained models: 



<p>Most organizations can’t produce or support AI without a strong partnership. Innovators who want a custom AI can pick a “foundation model” like OpenAI’s GPT-3 or BERT and feed it their data. This personalized training sculpts the model into bespoke generative AI perfectly aligned with business goals. The process demands high-level skills and resources, but the results are more likely to be compliant, custom-tailored and business-specific.</p>



<p>The best option for an enterprise organization depends on its specific needs, resources and technical capabilities. If speed, affordability and ease of use are priorities, ready-to-launch tools might be the best choice. Custom-trained models might improve if customization, control and bias mitigation are critical.</p>



 Adopt a use-case-driven approach to generative AI 



<p>The key to success lies in adopting a use-case-driven approach, focusing on your company’s problems and how generative AI can solve them.</p>



<p>Key considerations:</p>



 
 Tech stack: Ensure your existing technology infrastructure can handle the demands of AI models and data processing. 



 Model matchmaking: Choose a suitable generative AI model for your specific needs. 



 Teamwork: Assemble a team with expertise in AI, data science and your industry. This interdisciplinary team will help to ensure your generative AI is a success. 



 Data: High-quality, relevant data is the fuel that powers generative AI success. Invest in data hygiene and collection strategies to keep your engine running smoothly. Garbage in, garbage out. 
 



 Generative AI use cases 



<p>Excitement about this new technology has spread quickly throughout various industries and departments. Many marketing and sales leaders acted rapidly and are already infusing generative AI into their workflows. The speed and scale of generative AI’s ability to create new content and useful assets is difficult to pass up for any discipline that relies on producing high volumes of written or designed content. Healthcare, insurance and education are more hesitant due to the legal and compliance efforts to which they must adhere—and the lack of insight, transparency and regulation in generative AI.</p>



 
 Code generation: Software developers and programmers use generative AI to write code. Experienced developers are leaning on generative AI to advance complex coding tasks more efficiently. Generative AI is being used to automatically update and maintain code across different platforms. It also plays a significant role in identifying and fixing bugs in the code and to automate the testing of code; helping ensure the code works as intended and meets quality standards without requiring extensive manual testing. Generative AI proves highly useful in rapidly creating various types of documentation required by coders. This includes technical documentation, user manuals and other relevant materials that accompany software development. 
 



 
 Product development: Generative AI is increasingly utilized by product designers for optimizing design concepts on a large scale. This technology enables rapid evaluation and automatic adjustments, streamlining the design process significantly. It assists in structural optimization which ensures that products are strong, durable and use minimal material, leading to considerable cost reductions. To have the greatest impact, generative design must be integrated throughout the product development cycle, from the initial concept to manufacturing and procurement. Additionally, product managers are employing generative AI to synthesize user feedback, allowing for product improvements that are directly influenced by user needs and preferences. 
 



 
 Sales and marketing: Generative AI is assisting marketing campaigns by enabling hyper-personalized communication with both potential and existing customers across a variety of channels, including email, social media and SMS. This technology not only streamlines campaign execution but also enhances the ability to scale up content creation without sacrificing quality. In the realm of sales, generative AI boosts team performance by providing deep analytics and insights into customer behavior. Marketing departments are harnessing this technology to sift through data, understand consumer behavior patterns and craft content that truly connects with their audience, which often involves suggesting news stories or best practices that align with audience interests. Generative AI plays a crucial role in dynamically targeting and segmenting audiences and identifying high-quality leads, significantly improving the effectiveness of marketing strategies and outreach efforts. In addition, Well-developed prompts and inputs direct generative models to output creative content for emails, blogs, social media posts and websites. Existing content can be reimagined and edited using AI tools. Organizations can also create custom generative AI language generators trained on their brand’s tone and voice to match previous brand content more accurately.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Project management and operations: Generative AI tools can support project managers with automation within their platforms. Benefits include automatic task and subtask generation, leveraging historical project data to forecast timelines and requirements, note taking and risk prediction. Generative AI allows project managers to search through and create instant summaries of essential business documents. This use case saves time and enables users to focus on higher-level strategy rather than daily business management. 
 



 
 Graphic design and video: With its ability to create realistic images and streamline animation, generative AI will be the go-to tool for creating videos without needing actors, video equipment or editing expertise. AI video generators can instantly create videos in whatever languages they need to serve each region. It will be a while before generative AI-created videos can effectively replace human actors and directors, but organizations are already experimenting with the technology. Users also use image generators to edit personal photos to create professional-looking business headshots for business use on Slack or LinkedIn. 
 



 
 Business and employee management: In customer service, generative AI can be used throughout the call center. It can make necessary documentation easy to access and search, putting case-resolving information at the fingertips of support agents. Generative AI-powered tools can significantly improve employee-manager interactions. They can structure performance reviews, offering managers and employees a more transparent framework for feedback and growth. Additionally, generative <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/conversational-ai">conversational AI</a> portals can provide employees with feedback and identify areas for improvement without involving management. 
 



 
 Customer support and customer service: While chatbots are still widely used, organizations have started merging technologies to change how chatbots work. Generative AI advancements aid the creation of more innovative chatbots that can engage in naturally flowing conversations, enabling them to understand context and nuance similar to how a human representative would. Generative AI-powered chatbots can access and process vast amounts of information to answer customer and agent queries accurately; unlike human agents, AI chatbots can handle customer inquiries around the clock to provide a seamless user experience, night or day. The shift from traditional chatbots to generative AI-powered companions is still in its early stages, but the potential is undeniable. As technology evolves, we can expect even more sophisticated and engaging AI interactions, blurring the lines between virtual and human assistance. 
 



 
 Fraud detection and risk management: Generative AI can quickly scan and summarize large amounts of data to identify patterns or anomalies. Underwriters and claims adjusters can use generative AI tools to scour policies and claims to optimize client outcomes. Generative AI can generate custom reports and summaries tailored to specific needs and provide relevant information directly to underwriters, adjusters and risk managers, saving time and simplifying decision-making. However, human judgment and oversight are still necessary for making final decisions and ensuring fair outcomes. 
 



 
 Generating synthetic data for training and testing: Enterprises can leverage AI to generate synthetic data for training AI models, testing new products and simulating real-world scenarios. This can reduce reliance on actual data, which may be sensitive and must remain private or come from an expensive external data source. No longer bound by the limitations of gathering and preparing real-world data, development cycles can be accelerated. With readily available synthetic data sets, companies can rapidly iterate on AI models, test new features and bring solutions to market faster. 
 



<p>Here are key takeaways for the ethical implementation of your organization’s generative AI use cases:</p>



 
 Protect sensitive data:&nbsp;Use only depersonalized and nonsensitive data to avoid exposing vulnerable information and comply with regulations. 



 Stay informed:&nbsp;Follow industry news to identify reliable tools and avoid unethical AI practices. 



 Develop an AI policy:&nbsp;Create guidelines for internal AI use and investments in third-party tools, drawing from available templates. 



 Invest in upskilling: Investment in reskilling and upskilling programs is crucial, empowering workers to develop skills resistant to automation. 
 



<p>Best practices are evolving rapidly. While the potential of generative AI is exciting for many organizations, navigating this landscape requires a balancing act between progress and prudence.</p>



 Future of generative AI 



<p>According to&nbsp;McKinsey,1 generative AI will not likely outperform humans anytime this decade. However, we may see a significant leap in generative AI capabilities by 2040. McKinsey expects AI to reach a level where it can compete with the top 25% of human performers across a wide range of tasks. Meaning, AI will write high-quality creative content, solve complex scientific problems or make insightful business decisions on par with skilled professionals. Jobs that have historically been automation-proof will be further affected by generative AI. Professionals in education, law, technology and the arts will likely see generative AI touch their profession sooner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Panelists&nbsp;at an MIT symposium2 on AI tools&nbsp;explored various future research avenues in generative AI. One significant area of interest is the integration of perceptual systems into AI. This approach would enable AI to mimic human senses like touch and smell, moving beyond the conventional focus on language and imagery. The potential for generative AI models to surpass human capabilities was also discussed, particularly in the context of emotional recognition. These advanced models might use electromagnetic signals to interpret changes in a person’s breathing and heart rate, offering a deeper understanding of their emotional state.</p>



<p>Experts anticipate that bias will remain a persistent aspect of most generative AI models. This challenge is expected to give rise to new marketplaces centered around ethical data sets. Moreover, a dynamic scenario will likely unfold, characterized by ongoing competition between companies and content creators using generative tools.</p>



<p>As these tools become more widespread in the workplace, they will inevitably bring changes to job roles and necessitate new skills. Alongside these developments invariably comes increased misuse of generative capabilities. As users gain the power to create diverse forms of content, including images, audio, text and video, the likelihood of malicious misuse is anticipated to rise. This scenario underscores the importance of developing robust mechanisms to mitigate such risks and ensuring the responsible use of generative AI technologies.</p>



<p>Generative AI will continue transforming enterprise operations across various industries, much like the smartphone transformed business communication and productivity. From automating mundane tasks to fostering creativity in content creation and beyond, the potential of generative AI is vast and varied.</p>



<p>However, navigating ethical considerations, maximizing data security and adapting to evolving best practices are paramount.

<p>In this age of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/how-your-supply-chain-can-prepare-to-address-disruptions/">supply chain disruptions</a> that hold the power to upend entire industries, strength and resilience across the entire value chain is no longer a nice-to-have—it’s a survival tactic. For <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/sourcing">sourcing</a> teams, that means pivoting their mindset around selecting suppliers from a tactical, lowest-cost-above-all approach to a strategic one.</p>



<p>Where tactical sourcing is a short-term strategy, strategic sourcing is for long-term business goals. Sourcing and procurement professionals operating with a strategic sourcing mindset assess a supplier’s quality, reputation and service. They also factor in how a strong partnership could reduce <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/supply-chain-risk-management">supply chain risk</a> and advance <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/sustainability">sustainability</a>. Such analysis and decision-making are often optimized with the help of various technologies, including artificial intelligence tools and data analytics platforms. The benefits of strategic sourcing are vast, ranging from overall supply chain process optimization to more cost-effective, long-term relationships with partners.</p>



<p>The following are examples of strategic sourcing use cases:</p>



 Transparency and traceability 



<p>From <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/the-future-of-fashion-is-fashionably-transparent-and-sustainable/">fast fashion</a> to fluorite, consumers and stakeholders are keyed into product provenance—expecting brands to uphold ethical, responsible sourcing practices. In fact, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/2022-consumer-study">in a 2022 survey</a>, 73% of consumers said that traceability is important to them. And from that group, 71% would pay a premium for it. Outside consumer demand for traceability, new regulations may make it imperative for some businesses: the FDA’s&nbsp;<a href="https://community.ibm.com/community/user/supplychain/blogs/wiggs-civitillo1/2022/11/16/a-new-era-of-food-safety">Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA)</a>&nbsp;Rule 204 requires food companies that manufacture, process, pack or hold foods on the Food Traceability List (FTL) to use traceability systems and follow new record keeping requirements.</p>



<p>You can read more about preparing for the FSMA <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/ifoodds-and-ibm-forge-new-path-to-food-safety-with-ibm-food-trust/">here</a> or <a href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-52223">try our FSMA 204(d) compliance module</a> for free.</p>



<p>Meeting responsible sourcing demands will require strategic sourcing tactics and technology that enable transparency and traceability. Blockchain-based solutions can be leveraged to build a trusted ecosystem of suppliers and partners. How? The immutable ledger of blockchain authenticates a product’s origin and journey through the value chain.</p>



<p>For example, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/antonello-produce">Antonello Produce</a> wanted to provide food that its customers could trust. The company paired produce grown by its farming partners with blockchain-based traceability records using the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/supply-chain-intelligence-suite/food-trust">IBM Food Trust®</a> solution. Now, the full product history is available through just a batch or invoice number. Looking ahead, the Italian company is discussing the potential of in-store kiosks where consumers can scan QR codes on packaging to see the entire journey of their food.</p>



<p>In addition to ethical and responsible sourcing assurances, blockchain-based sourcing capabilities can also help guarantee high-quality products. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/coricelli-italian-partners">See how Pietro Coricelli used IBM FoodTrust</a> to guarantee the quality of its “Made in Italy” olive oil.</p>



 Sustainability 



<p>Together with traceability and transparency comes sustainability—and 60% of CEOs say they’re already feeling pressure to be more transparent about their organization’s sustainability performance.¹ With supply chains often accounting for more than 90% of the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/greenhouse-gas-emissions">greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions</a> associated with providing an enterprise’s products and services, strategic sourcing through the lens of sustainability is another way to reduce overall emissions and advance <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/environmental-social-and-governance">environmental, social and governance</a> (ESG) goals.2</p>



<p>For instance, through sustainable strategic sourcing, companies consider questions like: Do manufacturing plants minimize waste and effectively use resources? One method to ensure this is by sourcing primarily recycled materials, like Patagonia does in the production of its outdoor recreation clothing. Using recycled polyester reduces the brand’s reliance on petroleum, better utilizes waste and reduces GHG emissions. Other companies may choose to leverage a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/sourcing-types/">type of sourcing</a> called near-sourcing. This involves moving sourcing activities closer to where goods or services are sold, cutting the emissions costs that come with transporting products to their final destination.</p>



<p>Organizations may also choose to vet each supplier to ensure their own sustainability practices align—from the suppliers of raw materials for production to those who provide shipping boxes. For example, Patagonia asks its supplier base to be certified in third-party standards, including the Recycled Claim Standard (RCS) and Global Recycled Standard (GRS) certifications.3</p>



<p>Building a viable and sustainable ecosystem of partners is complex. The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/RKWM3MME">IBM Supply Chain Intelligence Suite</a>, powered by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) and blockchain, helps compile supplier data to drive <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/scope-3-emissions">Scope 3</a> accuracy, improve <a href="https://www.ibm.com/resources/business-operations/supply-chain-sustainability">circularity</a> by reducing waste and inform end consumers of carbon and other ESG impacts.</p>



 Cost savings 



<p>Selecting suitable suppliers to meet long-term business needs often results in contracts with more advantageous pricing and payment terms (like bulk pricing and reduced fees). While this is a cost reduction tactic for the business, a lower product or service price can translate to better prices for customers, yielding a competitive advantage.</p>



<p>Specific types of sourcing minimize costs in different ways. For example, insourcing, which is the opposite of outsourcing and leverages internal resources that may prove less expensive than external ones. Near-sourcing, in addition to lowering emissions, also cuts transportation costs and delivery times. &nbsp;And global sourcing provides businesses with access to less expensive resources in low-cost regions.</p>



<p>Another way to use strategic sourcing methods to reduce costs is through <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/digital-transformation">digital transformation</a>, such as automating manual processes. The cost of human error associated with manual processes can be steep, not to mention the toll it can take on trust within customer and vendor relationships. Technology that streamlines and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/transaction-manager">automates transactions</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/smart-contracts">contract </a>management can significantly reduce these errors and expedite sourcing processes.</p>



<p>Sourcing and procurement teams may also strategically leverage data and intelligence to determine which supplier will provide the most value and minimize the total cost-to-serve. Solutions like the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/intelligent-promising/fulfillment-optimizer">IBM Sterling Fulfillment Optimizer</a> help teams execute new sourcing decisions in real time to meet fluctuating customer demand. It also can help optimize transportation costs and service-level agreements as well as improve inventory management and visibility.</p>

 Risk management 



<p>Supply chains are under tremendous stress, facing challenges from supply, demand, logistics and shifting industry landscapes. Strategic sourcing can help mitigate some of that stress by reducing potential risks associated with supplier relationships.</p>



<p>To start, strategically creating a broad ecosystem of quality suppliers limits the potential risks that come from dependence on one source. A diversified supplier portfolio helps organizations avoid delays, cancellations and price fluctuations from disruption.</p>



<p>Leveraging supply chain risk management (SCRM) software can empower organizations to build a trusted network of suppliers with optimized information and complete transparency. This technology can also help reduce the risk of regulatory non-compliance. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/supply-chain-intelligence-suite/trust-your-supplier">IBM® Trust Your Supplier</a>, for example, uses AI to continuously monitor suppliers’ regulatory compliance.</p>



<p>Broader technologies like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/supply-chain-intelligence-suite/control-tower">supply chain control towers</a> may also help reduce supplier risk by providing visibility across the entire end-to-end network. They use AI and real-time data to identify the impact of external events, forecast potential disruptions and recommend actions to mitigate the effects.</p>



<p>For some organizations, reducing risk with strategic sourcing means moving towards deglobalization by using sourcing strategies like near-sourcing and vertical integration. Apple, Nike and Tesla, for instance, have deglobalized their supply chains to reduce their dependence on foreign suppliers and gain more control. While this can limit the risk of disruption from geopolitical instability and natural disasters to a degree, reducing risk likely requires <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/reshoring-the-risks-of-swinging-the-pendulum-too-far/">striking a balance between local and global suppliers</a>.</p>



 Strategic sourcing: Getting started 



<p>Strategic sourcing processes vary by business, industry, geography and more. Here are some common steps to building your own process:</p>



 
 Goal setting: Identify specific goals and metrics like cutting costs, improving quality control or better managing supplier risk. 



 Analyzing current sourcing activities: Examine historic sourcing and business process data to find areas to improve or cut inefficient spend. 



 Assessing the market: Look at&nbsp;market research and competitor data before making strategic sourcing decisions to benchmark your place in the market. 



 Vetting and supplier selection: Establish a process for evaluating and selecting potential suppliers using a combination of supplier interviews, request for proposals (RFPs), request for quotations (RFQs) and scorecards to help. 



 Ongoing supplier performance evaluation:&nbsp;Perform regular audits, KPI monitoring, supplier relationship management and supplier feedback collection.

<p>Application performance is not just a simple concern for most organizations; it’s a critical factor in their business’s success. Driving optimal application performance while minimizing costs has become paramount as organizations strive for positive user experiences. These experiences can make or break a business, that’s why prioritizing high performance among applications is non-negotiable. What’s needed is a solution that not only safeguards the performance of your mission-critical applications, but also goes above and beyond through reduced cost, time efficiency and monetary savings.</p>



 The significance of optimizing application performance 



<p>Optimizing application development and performance is a must in a world where a user’s experience can control a business’ trajectory. Poor application performance can negatively impact an organization and their users may become frustrated and distrustful, causing them to abandon ship and even switch to a competitor.&nbsp; An array of problems, anywhere from application bottlenecks to network latency to bugs can cause app performance issues. Striving to optimize application performance means taking a strategic approach to boosting baseline functionality and overall user experience.&nbsp;</p>



 A positive shift in application performance optimization &nbsp; 



<p>To optimize performance organizations will need to not only address their app performance concerns but also tackle the critical aspect of cost reduction. This approach paves the way for substantial savings, aligning resource allocation precisely with the demands of the application. There are three essential components that organizations need to master to achieve optimal application performance in the most cost-effective manner.&nbsp;</p>



 1. Dynamic resource allocation&nbsp;

<p>An evolution of customer experience (CX) was to be expected. Throughout modern history, organizations have encountered internal and external challenges that changed how they interact with customers and how customers view those organizations.</p>



<p>Advancements in technology mean customers can order virtually any product and receive it in less than a week. For software solutions, they can get access immediately and often in a seamless experience.</p>



<p>Across arguably every industry, business leaders view a great customer experience strategy as a key differentiator. Brand loyalty, already on the wane, became even weaker due to the pandemic. For example, McKinsey found that 50% of consumers reported they would switch brands if their preferred brand was unavailable due to shortages.</p>



<p>Customer needs changed. Customer retention is difficult to keep high. Today, providing a positive customer experience is more of a challenge, or more of a critical need, for companies. To achieve this, more organizations must prioritize being customer-centric.</p>



 How we arrived at this CX environment 



 Early days of retail 



<p>Before mass media, it was harder to know what other products were available outside of the ones offered by the local store. Before globalization, it was more difficult to purchase products from far-flung locations. Many customers were limited to the goods and services in their near vicinity. And if something went wrong with a product that could be fixed, they would go to a local mechanic. They likely had strong ties to their local merchants and trusted their opinions on which products they should buy. They were much less likely to have any meaningful relationship with the product manufacturer unless those products were made and sold locally.</p>



<p>As a result, brand loyalty was stronger and customer preferences changed less frequently. Today’s customers, however, have a wide range of options and are less loyal due to several external circumstances. It is harder to maintain customer satisfaction and increase customer loyalty.</p>



 The Internet and rise of e-commerce 



<p>It is no overstatement to say the Internet changed everything about business. Consumers could learn about new products and services without leaving their homes or turning on the TV. They could start shopping online and buying products directly without leaving their homes. For product manufacturers, this is perhaps the biggest leap forward for customer experience. Previously, their direct customers were mostly retailers or resellers, who sold to the end users in store.</p>



<p>Being able to sell directly to customers meant many of these companies had, for the first time, direct relationships with those end users. They could more directly influence customer loyalty beyond the quality and price of their solutions. They were more directly responsible for offering memorable experiences and providing customer support. And thanks to online metrics, specific customer feedback, and data analytics, these retailers had more information about their customers than ever before.</p>



<p>Increasingly organizations expanded what they offered. Look at Amazon, which started with books and moved into virtually everything else. Long-standing UK pharmacy Boots saw its website visitors rise from 7,000 people a minute to 19,000 during the pandemic, so it needed upgrade its entire infrastructure and tools. It turned to IBM to provide the solution, enabling Boots to easily handle, at peak, over 27,000 visitors without an issue.</p>



 Customer journey mapping 



<p>The customer journey is more complicated. Today, a customer could be influenced by one channel (e.g., out of home) and make their purchase through another channel (e.g., a mobile app). This omnichannel revolution means organizations must monitor multiple customer touchpoints and better understand which mediums feature more customer interactions. This means organizations need to devote more resources to improving their SEO, mobile apps and social media presences. They need to determine where they should spend their advertising dollars to reach the most persuadable prospects and create an organic inbound engine to capture them.</p>



 Consumer advocacy 



<p>The rise of social media platforms, chatrooms and message boards gave consumers a voice. They became more willing to express their interests and frustrations with brands, creating a scenario where those organizations needed to monitor conversations and triage responses based on the issue and the influence of the consumer. In some respects, this has given organizations valuable insights from real-time market research and customer feedback loops. But it also raises the bar for what organizations need to do to meet customer expectations. That extended the responsibilities of contact centers and social media or PR teams to respond in real-time.</p>



 Segmentation 



<p>The rise of cookies, digital media and third-party tracking created personalization and segmentation. This enabled organizations to send individual customers messages that felt tailored to them. Now organizations try to improve the user experience on their website by organizing information based on individual consumer preferences. Social ads can target specific users based on demographics. And they can segment which audiences they target based on purchasing power. A recent IBM Institute for Business Value survey found 57 percent of respondents said meeting customer demands for more personalized experiences was their top reason for adopting AI.</p>



 The next wave of technology driven CX 



<p>We’re entering a new age of customer experience driven by digital transformation. New technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) will drive automation and further enhance the CX suite. Chatbots using generative AI and natural language processing will encourage more customers to use self-service tools for their simplest problems. That frees up human customer service representatives to focus on the biggest issues that can create happier and more loyal customers.</p>



<p>AI will power predictive analytics that will help organizations understand better when customers may have an issue or when it would be an opportune time to reach out to them. Organizations that can create compelling customer experiences can use virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) to show potential customers a facsimile of their services.</p>



 Customer experience will continue to evolve 



<p>The future of customer experience is bright. Providing a positive customer experience can become a competitive advantage. IBM can help enterprises apply trusted AI in this space for more than a decade. Generative AI has further potential to significantly transform customer and field service with the ability to understand complex inquiries and generate more human-like, conversational responses.</p>



<p>IBM puts customer experience strategy at the center of your business, helping you position it as a competitive advantage. With deep expertise in customer journey mapping and design, platform implementation, and data and AI consulting, IBM can help you harness best-in-class technologies to drive transformation across the customer lifecycle.</p>

<p>In today’s rapidly evolving digital landscape, enterprises are facing the complexities of information overload. This leaves them grappling to extract meaningful insights from the vast digital footprints they leave behind.<br><br>Recognizing the need to harness real-time data, businesses are increasingly turning to event-driven architecture (EDA) as a strategic approach to stay ahead of the curve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Companies and executives are realizing how they need to stay ahead by deriving actionable insights from the sheer amount of data generated every minute in their digital operations. As IDC stated: as of 2022, 36% of IT leaders identified the&nbsp;use of technologies to achieve&nbsp;real-time decision-making as&nbsp;critical for business success, and 45%&nbsp;of IT leaders reported a&nbsp;general shortage of skilled personnel for&nbsp;real-time use cases.*<br><br>This trend grows stronger as organizations realize the benefits that come from the power of real-time data streaming. However, they need to find the right technologies that adapt to their organizational needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the forefront of this event-driven revolution is Apache Kafka, the widely recognized and dominant open-source technology for event streaming. It offers businesses the capability to capture and process real-time information from diverse sources, such as databases, software applications and cloud services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While most enterprises have already recognized how Apache Kafka provides a strong foundation for EDA, they often fall behind in unlocking its true potential. This occurs through the lack of advanced event processing and event endpoint management capabilities.</p>



 Socialization and management in EDA 



<p>While Apache Kafka enables businesses to construct resilient and scalable applications, helping to ensure prompt delivery of business events, businesses need to effectively manage and socialize these events.<br><br>To be productive, teams within an organization require access to events. But how can you help ensure that the right teams have access to the right events?&nbsp;An event endpoint management capability becomes paramount in addressing this need. It allows for sharing events through searchable and self-service catalogs while simultaneously maintaining proper governance and controls with access based on applied policies.<br><br>The importance is clear: you can protect your business events with custom policy-based controls, while also allowing your teams to safely work with events through credentials created for role-based access. Do you remember playing in the sandbox as a kid? Now, your teams can learn to build sandcastles within the box by allowing them to safely share events with certain guardrails, so they don’t exceed specified boundaries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore, your business maintains control of the events while also facilitating the sharing and reuse of events, allowing your teams to enhance their daily operations fueled by reliable access to the real-time data they need.<br>&nbsp;<br>Also, granting teams reliable access to relevant event catalogs allows them to reuse events to gain more benefits from individual streams. This allows businesses and teams to avoid duplication and siloing of data that might be immensely valuable. Teams innovate faster when they easily find reusable streams without being hindered by the need to source new streams for every task. This helps ensure that they not only access data but also use it efficiently across multiple streams, maximizing its potential positive impact on the business.&nbsp;</p>



 Level up: Build a transformative business strategy 



<p>A substantial technological investment demands tangible returns in the form of enhanced business operations, and enabling teams to access and use events is a critical aspect of this transformative journey.<br><br>However, Apache Kafka isn’t always enough. You might receive a flood of raw events, but you need Apache Flink to make them relevant to your business. When used together,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/apache-kafka-and-apache-flink-an-open-source-match-made-in-heaven/">Apache Kafka’s event streaming capabilities and Apache Flink’s event processing capabilities</a>&nbsp;smoothly empower organizations to gain critical real-time insights from their data.</p>



<p>Many platforms that use Apache Flink often come with complexities and a steep learning curve, requiring deep technical skills and extensive knowledge of this powerful real-time processing platform. This restricts real-time event accessibility to a select few, increasing costs for companies as they support highly technical teams. Businesses should maximize their investments by enabling a broad range of users to work with real-time events instead of being overwhelmed by intricate Apache Flink settings.</p>



<p>This is where a low-code event processing capability needs to remove this steep learning curve by simplifying these processes and allowing users across diverse roles to work with real-time events. Instead of requiring skilled Flink structured query language (SQL) programmers, other business teams can immediately extract actionable insights from relevant events.</p>



<p>When you remove the Apache Flink complexities, business teams can focus on driving transformative strategies with their newfound access to real-time data. Immediate insights can now fuel their projects, allowing them to experiment and iterate quickly to accelerate time to value. Properly informing your teams and providing them with the tools to promptly respond to events as they unfold gives your business a strategic advantage.&nbsp;</p>



 Finding the right strategic solution 



<p>As the need for building an EDA remains recognized as a strategic business imperative, the presence of EDA solutions increases. Platforms in the market have recognized the value of Apache Kafka, enabling them to build resilient, scalable solutions ready for the long term.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IBM Event Automation, in particular, stands out as a comprehensive solution that seamlessly integrates with Apache Kafka, offering an intuitive platform for event processing and event endpoint management.&nbsp;By simplifying complex tech-heavy processes,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/event-automation">IBM Event Automation</a> maximizes the accessibility of Kafka settings. This&nbsp;helps ensure that businesses can harness the true power of Apache Kafka and drive transformative value across their organization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Taking an open, community-based approach backed by multiple vendors reduces concerns about the need for future migrations as individual vendors make different strategic choices, for example, Confluent adopting Apache Flink instead of KSQL. Composability also plays a significant role here. As we face a world saturated with various technological solutions, businesses need the flexibility to find and integrate those that enhance their existing investments seamlessly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As enterprises continue to navigate the ever-evolving digital landscape, the integration of Apache Kafka with IBM Event Automation emerges as a strategic imperative. This integration is crucial for those aiming to stay at the forefront of technological innovation.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/customer-experience">Customer experience</a> (CX) defines a customer’s journey with a company, including both direct and indirect touchpoints. Businesses that place the emotional needs of the buyer persona at the forefront of the customer experience strategy fosters great relationships. Forrester reports that <a href="https://www.forrester.com/blogs/forrester-data-shows-high-crm-adoption-but-low-satisfaction/">customer experience is a high priority for about 75%</a> of global business and technology professionals and their organizations. However, finding ways to increase customer engagement and brand loyalty can be a challenge. Here are seven customer experience trends that can help business leaders elevate their companies and improve their CX strategies.</p>


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/info/ai-for-customer-service-guidebook">Get the ‘AI for Customer Service’ guidebook</a>



 Trend 1: Sustainability for customer satisfaction 



<p>A new generation of consumers creates a need for new approaches to customer relationships. While sustainability is a growing value aligned to business, the way companies approach customer-centric sustainability efforts ought to be different for their younger consumers.</p>



<p>A brand needs to implement sustainability as part of its identity to better connect with this new age of consumers. Gen Z and Millennial customers are <a href="https://hbr.org/2023/09/research-consumers-sustainability-demands-are-rising">27% more likely to purchase from a company</a> than older generations, if they believe that the brand cares about its impact on people and the planet. Even better, if the company’s product or solution is higher quality because of sustainable contributors, the brand might exceed customer expectations.</p>



<p>Reformation is a trendy clothing company that uses their commitment to sustainability as part of their business strategy. Unlike most e-commerce sites, Reformation has a dedicated navigation for customers to explore their sustainability efforts. The section headline of the site is their tagline, “<a href="https://www.thereformation.com/sustainability.html">being naked is the #1 most sustainable option. We’re #2</a>.” Along with punchy marketing, the brand details exactly how they’re providing sustainable products. They site their production process, material sourcing information, product care information, and even their sustainability reports. By providing transparency and communicating their mission, Reformation has become known for their commitment to social good among the younger generations.</p>



 Trend 2: Omnichannel CX: Meeting customers where they are&nbsp; 



<p>A customer interaction with a business often goes through multiple touchpoints before that customer decides to engage with the brand. By implementing an omnichannel CX strategy, companies can expedite this process through interacting with their customer base in different places like social media apps, streaming platforms, e-commerce sites and more.</p>



<p>It is important to understand customer behaviors on various channels. For example, brand recognition on a podcast episode is great for awareness, but how many times do you click out of a podcast to purchase something? It may not be the channel for driving the digital customer experience; however, it might be one touchpoint in the customer journey. Adjust messaging to best fit different platforms and adapt marketing strategies to create a seamless omnichannel experience for your customers.</p>



<p>A company that has a consistent omnichannel strategy is Disney. Along with a memorable logo and the slogan “The most magical place on earth,” Disney keeps the spirit of its brand alive across the various platforms they serve. The founder, Walt Disney, wanted to create a seamless experience for customers that emphasizes the themes of family, fun, and entertainment throughout all messaging.</p>



<p>Today, this strategy is visible in the My Disney Experience tool, which places the control in the hands of the customer to create their dream Disney trip. Keeping in mind a customer-centric omnichannel strategy, Disney considers each interaction that a child might have with the brand when positioning their messaging. This includes movies, TV ads, in-store costumes, and in-person character experiences.</p>


<a href="https://listen.casted.us/public/95/Business-Schooled-9c799f1a/9ace3ede">Listen now: Using AI for Marketing</a>



 Trend 3: Investing in a valuable loyalty program 



<p>The name states the benefit itself, loyalty programs reward customers for their continued business, but they are also shown to increase customer retention. <a href="https://medium.com/cappasity-blog/retail-trends-loyalty-programs-boost-customer-retention-9b33a467e660">79% of customers are more likely</a> to do business with a company because of their loyalty program. Many businesses are even personalizing their programs, adding a hierarchy of loyalty status, to highlight their most loyal customers. Given the correlation between customer retention and customer loyalty, it is important that companies have a proactive approach to improving on their loyalty program benefits.</p>



<p>Beauty retail giant Sephora is known for their <a href="https://www.sephora.com/profile/BeautyInsider">Beauty Insider Program</a>. Free to join, this program recognizes shoppers into tiers based on their annual store spending—Insiders, VIB, and Rouge. Each tier rewards shoppers for their spending by equating points amount to a given dollar, for example Insiders get one point for every dollar spent. Along with a free birthday gift, all members get access to free, trial-sized products. As you move up the tiers more rewards are given spanning from early access to new product launches, higher discounts, additional birthday perks, makeup training classes, and even complimentary full-sized products.</p>



 Trend 4: Prioritizing customer accessibility to information 



<p>Customers want to have control over their interactions with a company. AI-powered chatbots allow customers unlimited access to information via messaging. Also, optimizing search on webpages makes for an easier digital customer experience. Businesses should provide more of these self-service options for their customer experience—like booking appointments, order tracking, and customer support bots. Allowing your customer base access to this information gives them the functions to control their customer journey. Access to more information allows your customers to feel trusted, which is the foundation Airbnb build their business on.</p>



<p>For many reasons—building trust, including customers in decision making, and creating a belonging culture—Airbnb has great customer loyalty. The company connects strangers renting their properties with people looking to stay in different locations across the world. This model sounds like it can invite disaster; however, by providing a trusted 24/7 customer support program, Airbnb upholds their customer experience. The company uses an omnichannel experience, through providing bots, live agents, social media messaging, in-app messaging, and 24/7 phone and email support. Additionally, the <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/help">Airbnb Help Center</a> includes a plethora of resources at the customer’s disposal. They can choose their tailored experience, whether they’re a guest, host, experience host, or travel admin. Along with optimized search, the help center includes blogs, FAQs, contact information, and topic level organization.</p>



 Trend 5: Personalized experiences using data and generative AI 



<p>As stated, emotional connection with customers is a foundational element of customer experience. Using data, companies can implement hyper-personalization into their CX strategy. Enterprises can collect predictive analytics from customer relationship management (CRM) systems to better personalize experiences. CRM systems provide 360-degree customer data—from sales, marketing, and other functions—that can inform features like product recommendations, virtual cart reminders, SMS stock alerts, and even greeting customers by name when shopping online.</p>



<p>How can businesses differentiate their personalization efforts to better connect with their customers? Improving the hyper-personalization of customer experience was identified as a <a href="https://www.forrester.com/blogs/predictions-2024-customer-experience-cx/">top use case by 42%</a> of AI decision-makers. Through technology like generative AI, companies can better identify trends in individual’s behavior and create personalized experiences. AI is not a new territory for eBay. The company has been using the technology to create better experiences for both sellers and shoppers.</p>



<p>Along with their personalized shopping assistant, Shop Bot, eBay announced the release of a generative AI powered listing tool for sellers. The new tool, which is identified by eBay as a new “<a href="https://innovation.ebayinc.com/tech/features/magical-listing-tool-harnesses-the-power-of-ai-to-make-selling-on-ebay-faster-easier-and-more-accurate/">magical listing experience</a>,” can extract information pictures provided by the seller to create descriptions and optimize the selling experience. Another example of how this tool works is that a seller can give their item a title and use generative AI to get recommended categories and other information that describes the item. Overall creating a more streamlined listing process for eBay sellers.</p>



<p></p>



 Trend 6: Understanding new technologies 



<p>Just as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> can help with hyper-personalization, it can also help businesses to develop new experiential marketing strategies that better connect with customer expectations. IBV reported that <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/ceo-generative-ai/employee-customer-experience">78% of global executives have an approach</a> to scale generative AI into customer and employee experiences. Through creating memorable experiences, businesses can develop a more emotional connection to customers. Even exploring and understanding new technologies like virtual and augmented reality might help businesses create an immersive experience for their customers.</p>



<p>One example of this is IKEA teaming up with Apple’s iOS 11 and ARkit to launch <a href="https://www.ikea.com/ie/en/customer-service/mobile-apps/">IKEA Place</a> to equip their customers to be better interior designers. The app allows for furniture to be placed virtually in their residence via AR technology through their iPhone. According to IKEA the accuracy is at 98%, this allows customers to picture their products in their personal space before purchasing and eliminates the need to travel to a store location.</p>



 Trend 7: Ensuring data privacy for customers 



<p>Customers are willing to share personal information, especially knowing it can provide real-time solutions and hyper-personalization. In fact, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/customer-experience-trends/">50% of customers are willing to share personal information</a> to help create a tailored customer experience. These metrics can create advancements to relationships, products, and service experiences with a business. However, customers want to know how their data will be used and they want to trust that the company can protect their personal information against data breaches. It is important for companies to share usage and privacy intentions with clear messaging so users can better understand how their data is benefiting their customer journey.</p>



 Customer experience as a competitive advantage 



<p>A customer’s needs vary depending on the individual, and generative AI can support businesses in pleasing as many customers as possible through hyper-personalization. A proactive company implements a modern CX strategy accompanied by new technologies. IBM has been helping enterprises apply trusted AI in this space for more than a decade. Generative AI has further potential to significantly transform customer and field service with the ability to generate more human-like, conversational responses.

<p>2022 was the year that generative artificial intelligence (AI) exploded into the public consciousness, and 2023 was the year it began to take root in the business world. 2024 thus stands to be a pivotal year for the future of AI, as researchers and enterprises seek to establish how this evolutionary leap in technology can be most practically integrated into our everyday lives.</p>



<p>The evolution of generative AI has mirrored that of computers, albeit on a dramatically accelerated timeline. Massive, centrally operated mainframe computers from a few players gave way to smaller, more efficient machines accessible to enterprises and research institutions. In the decades that followed, incremental advances yielded home computers that hobbyists could tinker with. In time, powerful personal computers with intuitive no-code interfaces became ubiquitous.</p>



<p>Generative AI has already reached its “hobbyist” phase—and as with computers, further progress aims to attain greater performance in smaller packages. 2023 saw an explosion of increasingly efficient <a href="https://research.ibm.com/topics/foundation-models">foundation models</a> with open licenses, beginning with the launch of Meta’s LlaMa family of large language models (LLMs) and followed by the likes of StableLM, Falcon, Mistral, and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/llama-2">Llama 2</a>. DeepFloyd and Stable Diffusion have achieved relative parity with leading proprietary models. Enhanced with fine-tuning techniques and datasets developed by the open source community, many open models can now outperform all but the most powerful closed-source models on most benchmarks, despite far smaller parameter counts.</p>



<p>As the pace of progress accelerates, the ever-expanding capabilities of state-of-the-art models will garner the most media attention. But the most impactful developments may be those focused on governance, middleware, training techniques and data pipelines that make generative AI more <a href="https://research.ibm.com/topics/trustworthy-ai">trustworthy</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/how-ai-is-helping-companies-meet-sustainability-goals/">sustainable</a> and accessible, for enterprises and end users alike.</p>



<p>Here are some important current AI trends to look out for in the coming year.</p>



 
 Reality check: more realistic expectations 



 Multimodal AI 



 Small(er) language models and open source advancements 



 GPU shortages and cloud costs 



 Model optimization is getting more accessible 



 Customized local models and data pipelines 



 More powerful virtual agents 



 Regulation, copyright and ethical AI concerns 



 Shadow AI (and corporate AI policies) 
 



 Reality check: more realistic expectations 



<p>When generative AI first hit mass awareness, a typical business leader’s knowledge came mostly from marketing materials and breathless news coverage. Tangible experience (if any) was limited to messing around with ChatGPT and DALL-E. Now that the dust has settled, the business community now has a more refined understanding of AI-powered solutions.</p>



<p>The Gartner Hype Cycle positions Generative AI squarely at “Peak of Inflated Expectations,” on the cusp of a slide into the “Trough of Disillusionment”<a>[1]</a>—in other words, about to enter a (relatively) underwhelming transition period—while Deloitte’s “State of Generated AI in the Enterprise “ report from Q1 2024 indicated that many leaders “expect substantial transformative impacts in the short term.”<a>[2]</a> The reality will likely fall in between: generative AI offers unique opportunities and solutions, but it will not be everything to everyone.</p>



<p>How real-world results compare to the hype is partially a matter of perspective. Standalone tools like ChatGPT typically take center stage in the popular imagination, but smooth integration into established services often yields more staying power. Prior to the current hype cycle, generative machine learning tools like the “Smart Compose” feature rolled out by Google in 2018 weren’t heralded as a paradigm shift, despite being harbingers of today’s text generating services. Similarly, many high-impact generative AI tools are being implemented as integrated elements of enterprise environments that enhance and complement, rather than revolutionize or replace, existing tools: for example, “Copilot” features in Microsoft Office, “Generative Fill” features in Adobe Photoshop or <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-orchestrate/integrations">virtual agents in productivity and collaboration apps</a>.</p>



<p>Where generative AI first builds momentum in everyday workflows will have more influence on the future of AI tools than the hypothetical upside of any specific AI capabilities. According to a recent <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2024-01-10-Data-Suggests-Growth-in-Enterprise-Adoption-of-AI-is-Due-to-Widespread-Deployment-by-Early-Adopters">IBM survey of over 1,000 employees at enterprise-scale companies</a>, the top three factors driving AI adoption were advances in AI tools that make them more accessible, the need to reduce costs and automate key processes and the increasing amount of AI embedded into standard off-the-shelf business applications.</p>



 Multimodal AI (and video) 



<p>That being said, the ambition of state-of-the-art generative AI is growing. The next wave of advancements will focus not only on enhancing performance within a specific domain, but on multimodal models that can take multiple types of data as input. While models that operate across different data modalities are not a strictly new phenomenon—text-to-image models like CLIP and speech-to-text models like Wave2Vec have been around for years now—they’ve typically only operated in one direction, and were trained to accomplish a specific task.</p>



<p>The incoming generation of interdisciplinary models, comprising proprietary models like OpenAI’s GPT-4V or Google’s Gemini, as well as open source models like LLaVa, Adept or Qwen-VL, can move freely between natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision tasks. New models are also bringing video into the fold: in late January, Google announced Lumiere, a text-to-video diffusion model that can also perform image-to-video tasks or use images for style reference.</p>



<p>The most immediate benefit of multimodal AI is more intuitive, versatile AI applications and virtual assistants. Users can, for example, ask about an image and receive a natural language answer, or ask out loud for instructions to repair something and receive visual aids alongside step-by-step text instructions.</p>



<p>On a higher level, multimodal AI allows for a model to process more diverse data inputs, enriching and expanding the information available for training and inference. Video, in particular, offers great potential for holistic learning. “There are cameras that are on 24/7 and they’re capturing what happens just as it happens without any filtering, without any intentionality,” says Peter Norvig, Distinguished Education Fellow at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI).<a>[3]</a> “AI models haven’t had that kind of data before. Those models will just have a better understanding of everything.”</p>



 Small(er) language models and open source advancements 



<p>In domain-specific models—particularly LLMs—we’ve likely reached the point of diminishing returns from larger parameter counts. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI (whose GPT-4 model is rumored to have around 1.76 trillion parameters), suggested as much at MIT’s Imagination in Action event last April: “I think we’re at the end of the era where it’s going to be these giant models, and we’ll make them better in other ways,” he predicted. “I think there’s been way too much focus on parameter count.”</p>



<p>Massive models jumpstarted this ongoing AI golden age, but they’re not without drawbacks. Only the very largest companies have the funds and server space to train and maintain energy-hungry models with hundreds of billions of parameters. According to one estimate from the University of Washington, training a single GPT-3-sized model requires the yearly electricity consumption of over 1,000 households; a standard day of ChatGPT queries rivals the daily energy consumption of 33,000 U.S. households.<a>[4]</a></p>



<p>Smaller models, meanwhile, are far less resource-intensive. An influential <a href="https://huggingface.co/papers/2203.15556">March 2022 paper</a> from Deepmind demonstrated that training smaller models on more data yields better performance than training larger models on fewer data. Much of the ongoing innovation in LLMs has thus focused on yielding greater output from fewer parameters. As demonstrated by recent progress of models in the 3–70 billion parameter range, particularly those built upon LLaMa, Llama 2 and Mistral foundation models in 2023, models can be downsized without much performance sacrifice.</p>



<p>The power of open models will continue to grow. In December of 2023, Mistral released “Mixtral,” a mixture of experts (MoE) model integrating 8 neural networks, each with 7 billion parameters. Mistral claims that Mixtral not only outperforms the 70B parameter variant of Llama 2 on most benchmarks at 6 times faster inference speeds, but that it even matches or outperforms OpenAI’s far larger GPT-3.5 on most standard benchmarks. Shortly thereafter, Meta announced in January that it has already begun training of Llama 3 models, and confirmed that they will be open sourced. Though details (like model size) have not been confirmed, it’s reasonable to expect Llama 3 to follow the framework established in the two generations prior.</p>



<p>These advances in smaller models have three important benefits:</p>



 
 They help democratize AI: smaller models that can be run at lower cost on more attainable hardware empower more amateurs and institutions to study, train and improve existing models. 



 They can be run locally on smaller devices: this allows more sophisticated AI in scenarios like edge computing and the internet of things (IoT). Furthermore, running models locally—like on a user’s smartphone—helps to sidestep many privacy and cybersecurity concerns that arise from interaction with sensitive personal or proprietary data. 



 They make AI more explainable: the larger the model, the more difficult it is to pinpoint how and where it makes important decisions. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/explainable-ai">Explainable AI</a> is essential to understanding, improving and trusting the output of AI systems. 
 



 GPU shortages and cloud costs 



<p>The trend toward smaller models will be driven as much by necessity as by entrepreneurial vigor, as cloud computing costs increase as the availability of hardware decrease.</p>



<p>“The big companies (and more of them) are all trying to bring AI capabilities in-house, and there is a bit of a run on GPUs,” says James Landay, Vice-Director and Faculty Director of Research, Stanford HAI. “This will create a huge pressure not only for increased GPU production, but for innovators to come up with hardware solutions that are cheaper and easier to make and use.”1</p>



<p>As a late 2023 O’Reilly report explains, cloud providers currently bear much of the computing burden: relatively few AI adopters maintain their own infrastructure, and hardware shortages will only elevate the hurdles and costs of setting up on-premise servers. In the long term, this may put upward pressure on cloud costs as providers update and optimize their own infrastructure to effectively meet demand from generative AI.<a>[5]</a></p>



<p>For enterprises, navigating this uncertain landscape requires flexibility, in terms of both models–leaning on smaller, more efficient models where necessary or larger, more performant models when practical–and deployment environment. “We don’t want to constrain where people deploy [a model],” said IBM CEO Arvind Krishna in a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/07/ibm-ceo-arvind-krishna-cnbc-interview.html">December 2023 interview with CNBC</a>, in reference to IBM’s <a href="https://ibm.com/watsonx">watsonx</a> platform. “So [if] they want to deploy it on a large public cloud, we’ll do it there. If they want to deploy it at IBM, we’ll do it at IBM. If they want to do it on their own, and they happen to have enough infrastructure, we’ll do it there.”</p>



 Model optimization is getting more accessible 



<p>The trend towards maximizing the performance of more compact models is well served by the recent output of the open source community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many key advancements have been (and will continue to be) driven not just by new foundation models, but by new techniques and resources (like open source datasets) for training, tweaking, fine-tuning or aligning pre-trained models. Notable model-agnostic techniques that took hold in 2023 include:</p>



 
 Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA): Rather than directly fine-tuning billions of model parameters, LoRA entails freezing pre-trained model weights and injecting trainable layers—which represent the matrix of changes to model weights as 2 smaller (lower rank) matrices—in each transformer block. This dramatically reduces the number of parameters that need to be updated, which, in turn, dramatically speeds up fine-tuning and reduces memory needed to store model updates. 



 Quantization: Like lowering the bitrate of audio or video to reduce file size and latency, quantization lowers the precision used to represent model data points—for example, from 16-bit floating point to 8-bit integer—to reduce memory usage and speed up inference. QLoRA techniques combine quantization with LoRA. 



 Direct Preference Optimization (DPO): Chat models typically use <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/rlhf">reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)</a> to align model outputs to human preferences. Though powerful, RLHF is complex and unstable. DPO promises similar benefits while being computationally lightweight and substantially simpler. 
 



<p>Alongside parallel advances in open source models in the 3–70 billion parameter space,&nbsp;these evolving techniques could shift the dynamics of the AI landscape by providing smaller players, like startups and amateurs, with sophisticated AI capabilities that were previously out of reach.</p>



 Customized local models and data pipelines 



<p>Enterprises in 2024 can thus pursue differentiation through bespoke model development, rather than building wrappers around repackaged services from “Big AI.” With <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watsonx">the right data and development framework</a>, existing open source AI models and tools can be tailored to almost any real-world scenario, from customer support uses to supply chain management to complex document analysis.</p>



<p>Open source models afford organizations the opportunity to develop powerful custom AI models—trained on their proprietary data and fine-tuned for their specific needs—quickly, without prohibitively expensive infrastructure investments. This is especially relevant in domains like legal, healthcare or finance, where highly specialized vocabulary and concepts may not have been learned by foundation models in pre-training.</p>



<p>Legal, finance and healthcare are also prime examples of industries that can benefit from models small enough to be run locally on modest hardware. Keeping AI training, inference and <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-RAG">retrieval augmented generation (RAG)</a> local avoids the risk of proprietary data or sensitive personal information being used to train closed-source models or otherwise pass through the hands of third parties. And using RAG to access relevant information rather than storing all knowledge directly within the LLM itself helps reduce model size, further increasing speed and reducing costs.</p>



<p>As 2024 continues to level the model playing field, competitive advantage will increasingly be driven by proprietary data pipelines that enable industry-best fine-tuning.</p>



 More powerful virtual agents 



<p>With more sophisticated, efficient tools and a year’s worth of market feedback at their disposal, businesses are primed to expand the use cases for <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/virtual-agent">virtual agents</a> beyond just straightforward <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-assistant">customer experience chatbots</a>.</p>



<p>As AI systems speed up and incorporate new streams and formats of information, they expand the possibilities for not just communication and instruction following, but also task automation. “2023 was the year of being able to chat with an AI. Multiple companies launched something, but the interaction was always you type something in and it types something back,” says Stanford’s Norvig. “In 2024, we’ll see <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-orchestrate">the ability for agents to get stuff done for you</a>. Make reservations, plan a trip, connect to other services.”</p>



<p>Multimodal AI, in particular, significantly increases opportunities for seamless interaction with virtual agents. For example, rather than simply asking a bot for recipes, a user can point a camera at an open fridge and request recipes that can be made with available ingredients. Be My Eyes, a mobile app that connects blind and low vision individuals with volunteers to help with quick tasks, is piloting AI tools that help users directly interact with their surroundings through multimodal AI in lieu of awaiting a human volunteer.</p>

 Regulation, copyright and ethical AI concerns 



<p>Elevated multimodal capabilities and lowered barriers to entry also open up new doors for abuse: deepfakes, privacy issues, perpetuation of bias and even evasion of CAPTCHA safeguards may become increasingly easy for bad actors. In January of 2024, a wave of explicit celebrity deepfakes hit social media; research from May 2023 indicated that there had been 8 times as many voice deepfakes posted online compared to the same period in 2022.<a>[6]</a></p>



<p>Ambiguity in the regulatory environment may slow adoption, or at least more aggressive implementation, in the short to medium term. There is inherent risk to any major, irreversible investment in an emerging technology or practice that might require significant retooling—or even become illegal—following new legislation or changing political headwinds in the coming years.</p>



<p>In December 2023, the European Union (EU) reached <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20231206IPR15699/artificial-intelligence-act-deal-on-comprehensive-rules-for-trustworthy-ai">provisional agreement on the Artificial Intelligence Act</a>. Among other measures, it prohibits indiscriminate scraping of images to create facial recognition databases, biometric categorization systems with potential for discriminatory bias, “social scoring” systems and the use of AI for social or economic manipulation. It also seeks to define a category of “high-risk” AI systems, with potential to threaten safety, fundamental rights or rule of law, that will be subject to additional oversight. Likewise, it sets transparency requirements for what it calls “general-purpose AI (GPAI)” systems—foundation models—including technical documentation and systemic adversarial testing.</p>



<p>But while some key players, like Mistral, reside in the EU, the majority of groundbreaking AI development is happening in America, where substantive legislation of AI in the private sector will require action from Congress—which may be unlikely in an election year. On October 30, the Biden administration issued a <a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/news/numbers-tracking-ai-executive-order">comprehensive executive order</a> detailing 150 requirements for use of AI technologies by federal agencies; months prior, the administration secured <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-secures-voluntary-commitments-from-leading-artificial-intelligence-companies-to-manage-the-risks-posed-by-ai/">voluntary commitments from prominent AI developers</a> to adhere to certain guardrails for trust and security. Notably, both California and Colorado are actively pursuing their own legislation regarding individuals’ data privacy rights with regard to artificial intelligence.</p>



<p>China has moved more proactively toward formal AI restrictions, banning price discrimination by recommendation algorithms on social media and mandating the clear labeling of AI-generated content. Prospective regulations on generative AI seek to require the training data used to train LLMs and the content subsequently generated by models must be “true and accurate,” which experts have taken to indicate measures to censor LLM output.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the role of copyrighted material in the training of AI models used for content generation, from language models to image generators and video models, remains a hotly contested issue. The outcome of the high-profile <a href="https://nytco-assets.nytimes.com/2023/12/NYT_Complaint_Dec2023.pdf">lawsuit filed by the New York Times against OpenAI</a> may significantly affect the trajectory of AI legislation. Adversarial tools, like <a href="https://glaze.cs.uchicago.edu/what-is-glaze.html">Glaze</a> and <a href="https://nightshade.cs.uchicago.edu/">Nightshade</a>—both developed at the University of Chicago—have arisen in what may become an arms race of sorts between creators and model developers.</p>



<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-governance">Learn how IBM® watsonx.governance™ accelerates responsible, transparent and explainable AI workflows →</a></p>



 Shadow AI (and corporate AI policies) 



<p>For businesses, this escalating potential for legal, regulatory, economic or reputational consequences is compounded by how popular and accessible generative AI tools have become. Organizations must not only have a careful, coherent and clearly articulated corporate policy around generative AI, but also be wary of shadow AI: the “unofficial” personal use of AI in the workplace by employees.</p>



<p>Also dubbed “shadow IT” or “BYOAI,” shadow AI arises when impatient employees seeking quick solutions (or simply wanting to explore new tech faster than a cautious company policy allows) implement generative AI in the workplace without going through IT for approval or oversight. Many consumer-facing services, some free of charge, allow even nontechnical individuals to improvise the use of generative AI tools. In one study from Ernst &amp; Young, 90% of respondents said they use AI at work.<a>[7]</a></p>



<p>That enterprising spirit can be great, in a vacuum—but eager employees may lack relevant information or perspective regarding security, privacy or compliance. This can expose businesses to a great deal of risk. For example, an employee might unknowingly feed trade secrets to a public-facing AI model that continually trains on user input, or use copyright-protected material to train a proprietary model for content generation and expose their company to legal action.</p>



<p>Like many ongoing developments, this underscores how the dangers of generative AI rise almost linearly with its capabilities. With great power comes great responsibility.</p>



 Moving forward 



<p>As we proceed through a pivotal year in artificial intelligence, understanding and adapting to emerging trends is essential to maximizing potential, minimizing risk and responsibly scaling generative AI adoption.</p>

 We sit down with the romance fraud vigilante-turned-author to discuss the responsibility she feels for victims, why social media platforms need to be held more accountable, and why she put a photo of Keanu Reeves on the cover of her book. 



 



<p>Despite having a popular Twitter account (114,000 followers and growing), with the sole purpose of exposing romance scammers, Becky Holmes says she still gets contacted by hopeful, hapless fraudsters. In fact, she was contacted just 15 minutes before our interview.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Fortunately, a lot of them are not very observant, so I get to do what I do without too much recourse,” said Becky.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What Becky does is two-fold: She exposes the often-hilarious exchanges with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/romance-fraud/">romance scammers</a>, some of whom claim to be celebrities, and, more recently, provides a forum in which people can share their experiences and learn more about this increasingly common form of fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The conversation is clearly needed. Romance scams rose by <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202402/data-released-on-rise-in-romance-scams-as-valentines-day-looms">19% globally in 2023</a>. Considering only 58% of victims ever report the crime to law enforcement, that figure is likely to be much higher.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Becky has just released her debut book, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Keanu-Reeves-Not-Love-You/dp/1789651638">‘Keanu Reeves is Not in Love with You’</a>, featuring first-hand accounts of victims, examples of scripts used by fraudsters, and a look into the psychology of fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although the book itself only took nine months to write, the aim of helping people and raising awareness of the dangers of social media fraud began when Becky first joined Twitter (now X) in 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Almost immediately I got a flurry of messages from all these fabulously handsome men, and they were all immediately in love with me. They all said the same thing and were all from very similar looking men. Some were in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/army-romance-scam">army</a>, and some were in pilots’ uniforms, and it was very clear that there was a pattern.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“At first, I was blocking and deleting them and having a bit of fun by seeing how nonsensical I could be before they picked up on what I was saying. I began posting the exchanges on Twitter a few months later, and people found them funny and were laughing and we were all having a good time. Then, in 2021, quite a few victims of romance fraud got in touch with me and said that they’d been a victim and had lost a large amount of money. That’s when it all changed.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this interview, we discuss the different ways in which romance scammers tend to target men and women, the delicate balance in presenting information in a relatable, digestible format that does not undermine the danger and impact, and much more.</p>



 What were the main reasons behind becoming a ‘romance scam vigilante’? Did you ever become a victim yourself [i.e. transfer funds, or ‘fall in love’]? 



<p>So, I’m fortunate enough to have never been the victim of romance fraud. However, I was in a very coercively controlled relationship at one point, and the parallels between what victims of romance fraud go through and victims of coercive control are very similar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I ended up speaking on the phone with many victims and they said they hadn’t told anybody, and they didn’t know what to do. I hated the idea of people feeling lonely because I’ve been in that situation myself. So, I became kind of a sounding board for a few people and felt a responsibility.</p>



<p>Most had reported to Action Fraud but not heard anything back, so were in a very isolated place.&nbsp;I started realizing what a huge subject it was and how underreported it was, and it became like a passion project.</p>



<p>[Read more about the steps that the UK government is taking to address fraud, in our blog <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy/">‘UK declares war on fraud, calls on tech giants to join the fight.’</a>]</p>



 I see that many of the messages you share on Twitter are actual Twitter exchanges, in your personal experience, is this where romance fraud is most common? 



<p>No, I get messages on Instagram, on Twitter, and dating sites are, of course, rife with them. I’ve also heard about people receiving messages on TikTok, and bizarrely, if you play online games, romance fraudsters are lurking there too. Whatever platform it is, the one thing they immediately want to do is to take you to WhatsApp or Google Chat. I have a separate Google Chat account where I have these exchanges.</p>



 Romance scams target both men and women. Are there any differences in approaches? 



<p>Although I never view stats as&nbsp;wholly reliable, statistically, romance fraud targets men and women equally. I want to stress that not all women are approached with the promise of romance and men with the promise of sex, but more men do tend to be victims of sextortion. Sextortion is when you have exchanged intimate images with somebody, and that person then blackmails you. For example, a married man with kids or a high position at work will send images to someone [who is almost certainly not a Russian model], and the recipient will then reply and say that they’ve hacked into your Facebook and can now see your children’s Facebook accounts, and your colleagues’ accounts, and that’s when the requests for money start.</p>



 It’s the old adage, isn’t it, and, of course, there’s a danger of generalizing, but men are more led by what they see, and women by what they hear. 



<p>That’s right, although the example that I use in the book is of a lady who believed she was in a relationship with somebody, but very quickly realized it was a scam. When she ended the relationship, he said, “Yes, you’ve caught me. I’m not this person, but I’ve got your images. I know who your children are on Facebook.” He extorted about £14,000 from her. With that case, she never tried to get the money back, or go to the police as she had grown up children and grandchildren, and even though I assured her that the police would keep such investigations confidential, she was terrified her family would find out.</p>



 I once <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy-limitations-police/">interviewed an ex-police officer</a> who believed the danger of romance scams/ pig butchering is how it often leads to more serious forms of deception, and often spoke about the biggest hurdle being the perception of fraud, with many people not taking it as serious as, say, burglary. What is your opinion on how fraud is perceived in the UK? 



<p>So, as you’ll know, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pig-butchering-scams/">pig butchering scams</a> originate from Southeast Asia and this is an area where human trafficking is rife, because during COVID people with good computer skills were offered jobs and taken to scam compounds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, in some cases, it’s very cruel for both sides – even the name, ‘pig butchering’ and likening it to fattening up a pig for slaughter is just so repulsive.</p>



<p>However, it’s hard for me to think of the majority of romance fraudsters as victims. I’ve spoken to a couple of scammers and most of them are definitely not being trafficked. Sometimes it even becomes a racial issue. One scammer from Ghana told me it’s a way of getting back at the West for everything that’s happened to them over the centuries, which is a ridiculous excuse because he’s not putting the money into rebuilding parts of his home, he’s spending it on trainers and luxury goods.</p>



 Are there any anecdotes that have stuck with you and that you would like to share? 



<p>I’ve heard of people taking their own life, which you can understand if they’ve lost absolutely everything and are in the depths of depression. Some of the pig butchering scams, which leverage fake investment platforms are technologically very impressive. Regarding stories that have stuck with me, there was a lady who contacted me after seeing my Twitter and we spoke on the phone quickly after. She told me she had stage 4 cancer and had lost a fortune to this one guy. She knew that he was a fraudster; he’d admitted it, but she was still sending him money because she felt this bond with him. </p>



<blockquote><p>I remember her telling me that the only time her son will know what’s happened is when she dies, and he sees that he’s got no inheritance.</p> Becky Holmes, author of ‘Keanu Reeves is Not in Love with You’ </blockquote>



<p>I interviewed her, and then a few months later, as I was getting closer to submitting the book to the editors, I messaged her and asked if we could we meet up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>She replied and told me she was in a hospice, but that she really wanted to stay strong for the book launch, and I told her don’t worry, we can talk about this another time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A few days later, I received a message from her Twitter account, and it was from her son saying his mum had passed away, but that he had seen our exchanges, and knew she had lost money. He wanted to know what on Earth had happened. I remember calling him at about 9pm one Friday night and explaining what had happened to his mum and where this money had gone. The saddest thing for me was how lovely her son was. He said how he wasn’t angry with his mum; he was just devastated that she hadn’t confided in him. It’s heartbreaking to think how many people don’t confide in family and friends when they will probably get the same understanding reaction. There is nothing to be ashamed or embarrassed about.</p>



 



 
 
 It’s a delicate balance to strike, between presenting this information in a relatable, digestible format, and in a way that undermines the danger and impact of romance fraud.  



 How did you decide the best way to set the tone in raising awareness of the scourge of romance fraud? 



<p>So, the feedback to the book has been exactly what I’d hoped it would be. People have said they’ve been able to digest it because it’s readable and funny, but I’ve also shared the victim stories, and explained what happens in some of the countries.</p>



<p>Humor to me is a really good way of bringing to life what can be quite a dry subject. Often when people talk about fraud, everyone in the room switches off, and so I think as long as it’s never seen as humor at the expense of the victims [which I’ve never been accused of], then it’s fine.</p>
 



 
  Becky Holmes, romance fraud vigilante  
 
 



<p></p>



 One thing that surprised me from researching for this interview you was the sheer number of ‘celebrity’ scams. This has never happened to me [yet!]. How common is it? 



<p>Well, I never received a message from a celebrity on a dating site, but Twitter and Instagram are crammed full of them. My book is called ‘Keanu Reeves is Not in Love with You’ because Keanu Reeves is not on any form of social media, and yet he is the most impersonated celebrity. Particularly on Twitter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Something I always get asked is why anybody would send money to an apparent multi-millionaire. The fraudsters have come up with new ways of getting money from people under the guise of being a celebrity. One of the most common is that they will say they really want to meet the person, but their manager is a bit of a tyrant, and when the celebrity next comes to the UK, the manager wants to set up a series of meet and greets, all, of course, at a cost. Another effective approach is when they say that they are raising money for a charity. Then, even if you just send £10, you’re considered a viable target.</p>



 People exposing scams sometimes face repercussions. Do you ever fear for your safety? 



<p>I’ve had some death threats. Once, when a scammer asked me for money, I agreed and asked for him to send me his bank account details. Noticing it was registered in the United States, and obviously not his account, I contacted the bank and told them what it was being used for, and it was shut down. Obviously, as only a day had passed between him sharing his details with me and the account being closed, he knew it was my doing. So I received some horrific abuse and threats then.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, as I’ve spent so long researching this topic, I’m aware that a lot of these fraudsters are outside of the UK so have never been too concerned. Having said that, a lot of people will have links to the UK, so I never take my safety for granted.</p>



 How much do you hold these platforms accountable? Do you pass on the scammers’ details to relevant authorities, and how involved are you in the prosecution etc? Do you think enough is being done to crack down on this type of fraud? 



<p>Well, I mean certainly more could be done. It’s difficult, Jody, because a lot of the fraudsters are very technologically advanced and always seem to be one step ahead. I also hold the social media platforms accountable. In Nigeria, romance scammers are called the Yahoo Boys, and they even have their own Facebook group with almost 13,000 active members. Now I’ve reported the page, as have many other people, to Facebook, but it’s never been taken down. When the key word of the group is categorically associated with fraud, how is that allowed to stay up?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Facebook should be 100% be held accountable. I think it’s outrageous. Twitter and Instagram are slightly better because they’re quite good at taking accounts down when they’re reported.&nbsp;However, all you need is for somebody to set up a new email address, and they’re straight back on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Elon Musk removing the blue tick from Twitter is a fraudster’s dream. Suddenly you have an influx of people pretending to be celebrities who don’t need a blue tick anymore. I obviously hold the fraudsters most accountable, but I do think the platforms have a duty to be looking at this more carefully.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s pointless me pointing out Twitter profiles of people because they’ve been kicked off the platform before, and they don’t use their real names either. I’ve also been told by UK police that if a WhatsApp number, for example, is out of UK jurisdiction, there is pretty much nothing they can do.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>40% of all crime in this country is fraud, and yet police dedicate just 1% of resources to combat it,&nbsp;so, they’re not going to use that 1% trying to find somebody overseas.</p>



 Certain platforms, such as LinkedIn are experimenting with an identity verification step, although it is not yet a mandatory requirement. Perhaps because they do not want to alienate their customer base? 



<p>Yes, some dating platforms also require an identity verification step, where you have to wave your hand to show you’re a living person; however, what’s to stop a fraudster just doing that? So, more can be done, absolutely. I know the CEO of the <a href="https://theodda.org/">Online Dating &amp; Discovery Association</a>, and I do know that they take it very seriously, and steps are being taken. For example, if a fraudster is swiping right on every single woman’s profile in the hope that somebody connects, the ODDA will pick that up.</p>



 How much do you keep in contact with victims after they’ve messaged you? 



<p>I count three or four of them as friends now. A lot of these women that I speak to are people that I would naturally gravitate to. They are intelligent, interesting women, and people that I would like to be friends with, and they’re kind as well, and we could all do with some kind friends, couldn’t we?</p>



 Technology offers great opportunities to flag problematic behavior and identity users, thereby creating safer online environments, but it is also a double-edged sword. With the advent of AI-generated content like deepfakes, how optimistic are you regarding the future of romance fraud? 



<p>I fear for the future. A lot of romance fraudsters will pretend to be in the army or on an oil rig or a doctor or a surgeon working abroad, which they’ll use as an excuse for not being able to speak to somebody. This reluctance to video call can be a major red flag. But now, fraudsters will be able to transpose someone’s face over their own face and talk naturally. It’s terrifying.</p>

<p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is rightly considered a security upgrade on single-factor approaches like a simple username and password. MFA does a great job of reinforcing traditional login credentials, and in turn, is very effective at stopping fraudsters who take advantage of easy prey – such as the <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/content-library/misc/3743-2023-consumer-survey-brand-loyalty-digital-economy.html">12% of consumer</a>s who use one single password for every account across multiple platforms. In situations like these, where fraudsters rely solely on stolen credentials to perpetrate their crimes, MFA methods like SMS and email OTPs are very effective at <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/blog/posts/2024/account-takeover-ato-fraud.html">preventing account takeover (ATO)</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But although MFA makes organizations – and their users – feel safe, cybercriminals are constantly evolving their technologies and practices to get around this additional layer of security. Some of these methods rely on driving <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/blog/posts/2024/mfa-bombing-dismantled.html">MFA fatigue</a>, but others are more insidious and seek to bypass the protection offered by MFA altogether. All of this means that, while MFA is a great way to reinforce login credentials like usernames and passwords, it may not be enough to stop the latest types of ATO.</p>

<p>While breaches targeting identity as the initial attack vector are on the rise, with increasing success and significant financial and reputational damage inflicted, IdPs are quickly becoming the attack vector of choice. Attackers maximize the payload by infiltrating the most critical system in your organization designed to secure access to all your company and customer data.</p>
<p>The Threat in Context</p>
<p>Once a user with access to the organization’s IdP is compromised through an account takeover (ATO) attack, detection becomes increasingly difficult. The attacker gains persistence within the network, infiltrating multiple critical systems and applications. This enables them to cause damage over long periods of time.</p>
<p>One such <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/657106/what-you-need-to-know-about-oktas-security-breach.html">attack recently compromised an IdP vendor</a> through their customer support systems. The attack supposedly took place when a customer support user was logged in to their personal Google account and stored their username and password for their service account within Chrome. The attacker had compromised the employee’s Google account, thus gaining access to the credentials to the customer support system. Once access to the support system was gained, the attacker then used session tokens and cookies stored in the HTTP Archive (HAR) files (which were used to troubleshoot issues with the IdP) to access the customer’s network and deploy ransomware and/or exfiltrate data.</p>
<p>Another <a href="https://ca.news.yahoo.com/mgm-resorts-hackers-broke-tricking-111102542.html">attack took place at a large entertainment and hospitality chain</a> when an attacker used social engineering to gain access to information about a high-value target (user with privileged access to critical systems including their IdP). The attacker then contacted the IT support helpdesk requesting a reset of the high-value user’s MFA credentials. They provided all the required verification information obtained through the social engineering attack, enabling them to install their own MFA authenticator. The attacker was able to establish persistence within the organization’s network, gaining access to critical systems.</p>
<p>Securing Access to IdPs and Taking a Layered Approach</p>
<p>These examples showcase the need to secure access to IdPs with high assurance authentication. Privileged and high-value users with access to critical systems must use a high assurance passwordless authentication mechanism such as X.509 certificate-based authentication (CBA) when authenticating themselves. Enforcing CBA for users as well as devices ensures that the user is not logging in to critical systems on an unmanaged device. By enforcing CBA and eliminating passwords, organizations can defend against common identity-based attacks such as phishing and MFA bypass targeted at their privileged users. In addition, taking a layered approach to security is recommended, with risk-based adaptive access that can evaluate contextual information to dynamically grant or block access based on risk levels when authenticating to an application or service.</p>
<p>As we saw with the attack on the large entertainment and hospitality chain, protecting against these attacks during authentication is not enough; the processes of user registration or password/MFA reset requests must also be secure. By implementing identity proofing through identity verification of physical credentials such as passports and driver’s licenses, organizations enhance their security protocols. This is particularly valuable in processes such as resetting MFA credentials, registering or onboarding new users, or implementing step-up authentication for out-of-policy users or high-value transactions. By adopting these measures, organizations can further protect their critical systems and their existing IdP.</p>
<p>In addition to the above steps, organizations with on-premises environments can also secure their IdP with the use of <a href="https://www.entrust.com/use-case/why-use-an-hsm">hardware security modules (HSM)</a> that provide enhanced security for securely storing keys, secrets, and tokens.</p>

<p>Modern card issuance operations have embraced advanced technology, replacing outdated manual methods like clipboard monitoring. Today, operators and managers no longer jot down notes as they walk the floor; instead, they use digital platforms. Alerts, achievements, and operational details are instantly communicated across locations, giving operations executives real-time data to monitor machine performance and critical issues without leaving their offices. The shift to automated data analysis allows operators and technicians to access information from tablets anytime, anywhere, ending the need for manual charting. Additionally, aggregated machine intelligence provides a comprehensive view of plant productivity and cost-effectiveness in real time across multiple sites for an entire corporation.</p>
<p>These advancements are commonplace today, as <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/scm/industry-4-0/what-is-industry-4-0.html">Industry 4.0</a> cements itself in manufacturing history. It’s no surprise that digital intelligence brings increased efficiency and ROI opportunities to the forefront of smart card manufacturing. The <a href="https://www.entrust.com/issuance-systems/products/software/adaptive-issuance-production-analytics-solution">Entrust Adaptive Issuance™ Production Analytics Solution</a> is a software and technical consulting platform built on delivering this value proposition to card personalization operations through a customizable, real-time, aggregated architecture. It continues to drive next-generation smart manufacturing, bringing positive Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) and enhanced value to operations. OEE is expressed as a percentage sum of three key production indicators: availability, performance, and quality. Let us take a closer look at each and how they bring a deeper understanding to issuance environments, focusing on net losses:</p>
 
 Availability 
 
 Availability is the percentage of planned production time the operation is available to run. It is the ratio of Run Time to Planned Production Time and considers loss, which includes events that stop planned production. Run Time is defined as the total time when machines are used for production in a running state, excluding idle and pause. Planned Production Time is defined as the total calendar time for the measurement period minus planned downtime, such as maintenance tasks, changeover, holidays, and shift breaks. Availability Loss includes any unplanned stops such as idle time, equipment failure or material shortage, and planned stops as noted above. 
 
 Performance 
 
 Performance percentage is the actual total production output compared to theoretical perfect production output, which is calculated using the machine’s maximum cycle speed. A perfect performance score would mean machines are always running at maximum speed when active. Total Production is defined as the total number of cards processed, which includes both good and rejected cards. Maximum Machine Throughput is defined as the maximum machine speed in cards per hour, also considering that throughput could be reduced based on the total number of modules used. Performance Loss includes anything that causes the manufacturing process to run at less than the maximum possible speed when it is running. Examples of things that create Performance Loss include machine wear, inferior materials, line misfeeds, and jams. 
 
 Quality 
 
 Quality is the number of good units produced as a percentage of the total units started. A perfect quality score indicates that all products are good: successfully manufactured the first time, and no rejects were produced. Simply and more realistically, total production equals good production + rejected production. Quality Loss accounts for manufactured parts that do not meet quality standards as defined by the operation. Examples of Quality Loss include scrap and rework. 
<p>Net Losses</p>
<p>Net Losses for all three production indicators can be explored further here from <a href="https://www.oee.com/oee-factors/">Vorne</a> as variations in issuance type, facilities, and machines contribute to loss variability. <a href="https://www.oee.com/oee-six-big-losses/">The Six Big Losses</a> are also common in issuance operations and include: unplanned and planned stops, small stops, slow cycles, production rejects, and startup rejects.</p>

<p>The Future of Digital Intelligence and Production Analytics</p>
<p>Machine learning and artificial intelligence are expected to revolutionize the industry further. These technologies will be integral in production planning, inventory management, resource planning, and cost analysis. Next-generation Industry 4.0 subject matter experts will take the output from these technologies and use it to make improvements across operational architectures, building more efficiency into the process. Digital intelligence can be used to mitigate operational bottlenecks, quality gaps, and overall line inefficiencies by focusing on the three key production indicators.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Note: This episode isn’t an introduction to DIDs; for those new to the concept, we recommend revisiting <a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/decentralized-identifiers-did-methods-did-documents-did-resolution/">Episode 52</a> of the SSI Orbit Podcast for a foundational understanding.</p>
<p>In this podcast episode, we dive deeper into the world of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), moving beyond the basics to explore the critical aspects that will influence their trust and adoption.</p>
<p>Today, joined by Marcus, we embark on a detailed discussion framed around a SWOT analysis of DIDs, examining their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Our goal is to foster a comprehensive conversation that not only highlights the significant advantages of DIDs but also addresses the challenges and potential pathways to their widespread acceptance. We delve into the nuances of DIDs, aiming to contribute to the broader goal of promoting their adoption.</p>
<p>We aimed to follow the SWOT model, though it proved challenging at times due to the nuanced nature of many topics. Interestingly, what some may perceive as a strength could also be seen as a weakness, leading to a blend of perspectives. This complexity added depth to our discussion, making it particularly engaging!</p>
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Markus and I in this podcast include:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 [00:47] Comparison of DIDs to Other Verifiable Identifiers: Exploring how DIDs contrast with other types of verifiable identifiers and their benefits over traditional identifiers like email addresses and phone numbers. 
 [11:50] How to trust a DID?: Identifying the technical and governance aspects necessary for trusting DIDs. 
 [15:46] Building Trust Around DID Methods: Discussing the challenges and approaches to building trust in various DID methods, considering technical integrity and governance.

 Terminology 
<p>Digital Identity: An amorphous concept attempting the impossible job of capturing all that a human is in digital form, leading to many years of disappointing national projects and draft bills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital ID: A single attribute or fact about an entity, represented digitally, that is relevant in one or more specific contexts.</p>
 A big little shift in terminology&nbsp; 
<p>The draft Australian federal <a href="https://www.digitalidentity.gov.au/have-your-say/2023-digital-id-bill-and-rules-submissions">Digital ID Bill</a> no longer uses the phrase “digital identity”. The same shift in language has been made by the <a href="https://nab.com.au">National Australia Bank</a> (NAB) in its year-long <a href="https://news.nab.com.au/news/digital-id-trust-who-you-choose-and-choose-who-you-trust/">multi-sector design collaboration</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both the NAB and the Australian government now refer to Digital ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This change is much more than semantics. I hope it reflects a recognition by government that identification is different from identity, and there is no universal way of identifying people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NAB has highlighted that businesses and agencies are usually less interested in verifying “identity” than a particular attribute or eligibility. The bank’s <a href="https://news.nab.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NAB-Digital-Identity-Roundtable.pdf">roundtable report</a> states “it is very rare that individuals need to prove who they are” and instead suggests a reframing of digital identity around “what do we need to know about an individual for a particular purpose”; that is, the process of identification in all its local variations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what does Digital ID mean? Well, it’s just shorthand for a credential in a certain context.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I reckon everyone knows what it means to be asked to “show some ID”.&nbsp; We effortlessly interpret “ID” in context, whether it’s proof of age at a bar, a student card when sitting an exam, or an employee ID when entering the office.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re also familiar with the formal identification process carried out when opening a bank account or starting a new job. In these cases, we are generally asked to provide a number of IDs, from a pretty universal set of options including driver licence, birth certificate, Medicare card, passport and so on. And there are alternative forms of ID for people who need them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Fresh thinking; new precision 
<p>None of these IDs constitute our identity. And that’s how we like it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a rule, we should ask for and reveal as little personal information as possible, within the requirements of the transaction we’re doing. As the Canadian digital identity leader <a href="https://trbouma.medium.com/less-identity-65f65d87f56b">Tim Bouma once said</a>, “I want my identity to be less than the real me”.</p>
<p>Digital ID is concrete, specific and familiar. But “digital identity” is abstract and open-ended. It means different things to different people. Invariably, digital identity is interpreted as a new universal means of proving who we are. But there is no such thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So instead of imposing new identification standards and novel “digital identity” on Australians, the Digital ID Bill simply creates a governance regime to improve the quality and reliability of existing IDs when converted to digital form.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Australian Government Digital ID System (AGDIS) will conserve the meaning of existing IDs and leave businesses and agencies free to conduct identification as they see fit. The Digital ID regulator is being tasked to create rules and technology standards, with a view to fostering a marketplace of vastly improved digitised IDs.&nbsp;</p>
 Best in class 
<p>I believe the AGDIS represents world’s best practice in digital identification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The AGDIS rules (to be developed after the Bill is enacted) will almost certainly embrace mobile phone digital wallets as carriers of Digital IDs. A large and fast-growing proportion of Australians are now familiar with using their payment cards in mobile wallets to “tap and pay” and “click to pay” (the Reserve Bank reports that <a href="https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/annual-reports/psb/2023/the-evolving-retail-payments-landscape.html">35% of card payments are now made via mobile wallets</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The equivalent user experience of click-to-present any digital ID in context will be intuitive, widely available and vastly more secure than today’s plaintext handling of personal data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will be able to prove relevant facts about ourselves with the same security, safety and privacy as we prove our credit card details.&nbsp;</p>
 We’ve done this before 
<p>Smart payment cards (EMV chip cards) were introduced to replace magnetic stripe cards as they became vulnerable to skimming and counterfeiting. Chip-assisted presentation of cardholder IDs replaced the plaintext of a mag stripe and, as a result, essentially eradicated physical card fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the speed with which smart credit card IDs cut payment fraud, we can expect mobile technology Digital IDs to dramatically reduce identity crime via stolen personal data and, as a result, neutralise the personal data black market. </p>

<p>The modern work environment creates situations unthinkable a decade ago. Today, many employees will never step foot in an office or have face-to-face interactions with colleagues. While this flexible work model offers advantages for businesses as well as employees, it also presents significant security challenges, especially when it comes to reliable <a href="https://www.hypr.com/security-encyclopedia/identity-verification">identity verification</a>.</p>  
<p>Employee identity risk and fraud have skyrocketed in recent years. The <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA220628">FBI recently warned</a> that fraudulent job applicants are using deepfakes and stolen PII to obtain remote work positions. “Bait-and-switch” schemes are also on the rise, where the person interviewed by a company is not the person who is actually hired. In the best case, companies end up hiring someone completely unsuitable for the position. In the worst case, they onboard and provide access to cybercriminals who can install malware, steal confidential and privileged information, and more.</p> 
<p>The risks go far beyond hiring and onboarding. Just this week, a multinational finance firm revealed that an <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/04/asia/deepfake-cfo-scam-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html">employee was tricked into making a $25 million wire transfer</a> by deepfake video and audio. The thieves used AI-generated likenesses&nbsp; of the company’s CFO and other known colleagues in a live video conference with the finance worker.</p> 
<p>Know Your Employee (KYE) ensures that your employees are who they say they are.&nbsp;</p> 
 What Is Know Your Employee (KYE)?  
<p>Know Your Employee, commonly abbreviated as KYE, is the process of verifying the identities and backgrounds of an organization’s current workforce and prospective new employees. KYE aims to ensure that employees are who they claim to be, and do not have a criminal background that poses an undue risk.</p> 
<p>The KYE - Know Your Employee process continues past initial hiring and onboarding. Effective KYE involves continuous monitoring and regularly updating and reviewing employee information to identify any potential risks that may arise.</p> 
 KYE vs. KYC  
<p>Know Your Customer (KYC) and Know Your Employee (KYE) are two essential processes in the realm of compliance and risk management. KYC verifies customer identities to determine if they are who they claim to be and discover any potential risks, ensuring adherence to anti-money laundering (AML) and other regulations. In contrast, KYE involves verification of employee identities and thorough background checks to reduce the risk of employee fraud and theft, and address internal compliance needs.</p> 
<p>Both KYC and KYE share the common goal of mitigating risks, upholding legal standards and preventing fraud. The main distinction is in their focus: KYC is customer-oriented, while KYE centers on internal workforce dynamics. KYC is a point in time process, while KYE should be a continuous process, throughout an employee’s tenure. Integrating both processes is crucial for a comprehensive risk management framework in business.</p> 
 The Growing Importance of Know Your Employee (KYE)  
<p>Identity verification poses an ongoing challenge for organizations. In fact, 40% of IT security experts named it a top identity security challenge in the <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/report-workplace-identity-security-trends-2024">2024 Workplace Identity Security Trends report</a>. This is likely to climb as new attack and fraud tactics make accurate <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/best-practices-for-identity-proofing-in-the-workplace">identity proofing</a> and verification increasingly difficult. A recent report by Onfido found a 3000% increase in deepfake attempts in 2023, thanks to face-swapping apps, generative AI and other readily available fraud tools.</p> 
<p>The risks go far beyond non-compliance. Employee fraud tactics such as interview fraud, bait-and-switch scenarios, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/employee-fraud-how-companies-can-spot-employees-outsourcing-their-jobs-2022-8">unauthorized outsourcing</a>, mean that the person doing the work may not be the person you interviewed or hired. This creates massive security risks for organizations.</p> 
<p>Moreover, identity risks persist throughout the employee lifecycle – not just at hiring and onboarding. The recent breach of MGM resorts succeeded because attackers were able to impersonate an employee and convince the IT help desk to provide them with credential access to the corporate IAM service. Robust, continuous KYE processes could have prevented the attack. In this evolving landscape, a comprehensive KYE strategy is crucial for organizations to stay ahead of emerging threats, ensuring the integrity of their workforce and safeguarding against potential malicious activities.</p> 
 Tips for Implementing Know Your Employee (KYE)  
<p>While every organization will approach KYE differently depending on their specific needs and structure, there are basic principles that hold across all workplaces.</p> 
 Employ Multiple KYE Verification Methods  
<p>A thorough KYE approach requires layering multiple verification methods — which ones, and when to invoke them, will depend on the risk level of the employee verification scenario as well as organizational and environmental risks at play. Verification methods include document verification, facial biometric verification, live video, chat verification, as well as passive signals such as device/endpoint and location detection.</p> 
<p>As we’ve seen, identity fraud techniques evolve rapidly — it’s critical that your KYE methods keep up. A robust KYE strategy should incorporate advanced technologies such as liveness detection to detect deepfakes and other AI-aided fraud.</p> 
 Make It Easy for Your Admins and Employees  
<p>It’s human nature to circumvent processes that add an unreasonable burden. When done well, KYE - Know Your Employee processes should be fast and easy for both employees and administrators alike. This means automating processes as much as possible, requiring the right level of identity verification for the scenario, and using technologies that people are familiar with, like their smartphones. Of course security cannot be sacrificed for usability.</p> 
 Continuously Monitor for Risk  
<p>Employee identity risks do not end with secure onboarding. Higher risk scenarios arise throughout an employee’s career. Resetting credentials, getting a new phone, logging in from unknown locations, gaining increased access privileges, personal financial problems, active cyberattacks — all can be situations of elevated risk. Your KYE controls should be ready to address these, taking specific measures according to risk level.&nbsp;</p> 
 Don’t Operate in a Silo  
<p>It’s critical that your KYE processes and tools are connected and synchronized to your <a href="https://www.hypr.com/solutions/workforce-identity-assurance">workforce identity security</a> systems and HR system of record. The users accessing digital services may differ from the identities that IT believes they have. In other words, the digital identity may not match the real world identity. Your employee onboarding and identity verification procedures should be directly tied to your authentication processes, ideally using phishing-resistant, passwordless methods. As mentioned, it’s also important to invoke re-verification at certain times of increased risk. This means connecting your identity risk monitoring to your Know Your Employee (KYE) systems.</p> 
 Keep Up With Current Regulations and Compliance  
<p>In the current regulatory landscape, it's not just ethical but imperative for businesses across various industries to comply with applicable statutes and standards. The incorporation of a robust "Know Your Employee" (KYE) process is a key aspect of this compliance. These checks are vital for verifying credentials, ensuring workforce integrity, and meeting legal obligations.</p> 
<p>The consequences of non-compliance are severe, underlining the indispensability of KYE in any organization's overall compliance strategy. For example, a comprehensive KYE process is vital for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance, helping identify potential risks and preventing misuse of the financial system.</p>

<p>Holochain provides blockchains with auditable applications that can be tied to on-chain transactions, opening new possibilities for NFTs, DAO communities, and more.</p> Binding Wallets to Holochain Apps <p>We’ve developed a proof of concept for binding together Holochain agent keys with public keys on blockchains. Holochain uses a system of source chain validation to ensure that any action taken in an application is auditable, creating a secure environment for most application needs. By binding a Holochain agent with a public key in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), data created by the Holochain agent can be associated with the EVM key. This setup allows for unforgeable and bidirectional verifiability, facilitating provenance confirmation on both Ethereum and Holochain.</p> Validated Content for NFTs  <p>Rather than storing NFT payloads in unvalidated and/or centralized storage, with Holochain you can create and validate the payload and the reference for an NFT fully within a distributed context. The demo below shows that you can also manage the minting and transfer of the NFT from a Holochain app precisely because you can first bind your wallet to your Holochain agent. By storing payloads for NFTs in Holochain, you can circumnavigate the storage limits of blockchain, providing a more validated and ultimately more dynamic solution than other current implementations like IPFS. </p> Notaries and Oracles <p>Combining patterns from oracles and notaries with agent binding on Holochain opens up new ways to move between peer-to-peer systems via “cross-chain” proofs. </p><p>Smart contracts pre-authorize the public keys of agents from whom they will accept proofs. The proofs are signed verifications that reference actions or decisions taken in Holochain, all of which are also transparent and verifiable by any member of the application. This enables scalable but still verifiable sensemaking. </p><p>An example of how this could be used is with DAOs. Large scale voting on-chain is costly, both in gas fees and network traffic. But a voting app on Holochain can provide the trust and transparency of blockchain without the gas fees, and then the fully verifiable decision can be notarized creating a proof which is used to make a single on-chain transaction. The cost savings to both individual DAO members and the organization as a whole are potentially immense. This also provides greater flexibility as DAO’s can now afford to conduct all of their business in validated environments.</p><p><a href="https://blog.holochain.org/daos-why-sovereign-accountable-commons-might-be-better/">Explore other benefits Holochain brings to DAOs. </a></p> Data Storage  <p>Given the two examples above, you can see that what Holochain provides to blockchains is validated data storage. While the examples given talk about two major concerns for current blockchain development, you can store or interact with any data you choose to program into an application. Holochain is an incredibly flexible framework — the validation rules of each application can be customized based on the security and design needs of a particular use case. The combination of energy and cost efficiency, auditability, and flexibility makes Holochain a perfect choice for applications that need to interface with blockchain.</p><p>Plus, it’s all coded in Rust — with UIs using your favorite JavaScript framework — making it even easier for Ethereum devs to use and build with.</p> Learn More and Connect <p>Learn how Holochain can <a href="https://bit.ly/holochain-web3?ref=blog.holochain.org">extend Web3</a>, and get involved by introducing yourself to our team and community on <a href="https://bit.ly/A-New-Link-in-Web3-DEV-HC?ref=blog.holochain.org">Discord</a> or by joining one of our <a href="https://bit.ly/holochain-events?ref=blog.holochain.org">upcoming events</a>.</p>

<p>New technology is tough to explain sometimes. But Holochain isn’t reinventing the wheel. Rather, we are inventing the bicycle when all you have ever seen or used are wagons. </p><p>Holochain is built from familiar technical components and best practices, just as a bicycle is built from wheels, gears, frames, and steering mechanisms which all previously existed as basic forms or principles in other contexts. </p>Sum&gt;Parts: The key components of Holochain already existed, but we put them on a new frame<p>Our back wheel is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table?ref=blog.holochain.org">Distributed Hash Table</a>, similar to the ones used by <a href="https://www.bittorrent.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">BitTorrent</a> or <a href="https://ipfs.tech/?ref=blog.holochain.org">IPFS</a> to revolutionize peer-to-peer file sharing. This is the database structure that allows data to be transferred in the context of a distributed app.</p><p>Our front wheel is built on a lot of the same principles as <a href="https://git-scm.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Git</a> which pioneered <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-cloud-is-a-prison-can-the-local-first-software-movement-set-us-free/?ref=blog.holochain.org">local-first</a> version control as we know it today. While our local-first tools are built out of slightly different materials, the principle remains: Agents can always make local changes which then update the network when connected online. Not dissimilar to how the front wheel determines the direction of the bike. </p><p>These wheels are powered by a familiar device, the bike chain. Holochain’s <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/3_source_chain/?ref=blog.holochain.org">source chain</a> uses an implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_chain?ref=blog.holochain.org">hashchains</a>, which were popularized by blockchains, to connect one action to the next, every action containing the hash of the last. Each agent has their own bike and so they each update their own source chain, independent of the actions of other cyclists. This provides mobility compared to the wide wagon of a single central chain. The beauty of bikes is their independence, the ability to act without everyone needing to be in the same wagon. </p><p>The handlebars that steer this contraption are also familiar. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography?ref=blog.holochain.org">Public/private key cryptography</a> used for cryptographic signatures is a staple of most processes on the web, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS?ref=blog.holochain.org">HTTPS</a>, to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_Protocol?ref=blog.holochain.org">Signal Protocol</a>, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell?ref=blog.holochain.org">SSH</a> which is used by devs everywhere to access remote machines. Alongside encryption, these keys <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate?ref=blog.holochain.org">act as the identity tools</a> which connect the user, the human riding the bike, to their actions on the digital road. Every action they take is signed, controlled through those handlebars, and only the rider is able to steer. </p><p>Holochain pulls together all of these time tested tools and reconfigures them to do something none of them can do alone. </p><p>We’ve been talking about Holochain from the perspective of the agent — the rider and their bike. But Holochain is an application framework. In this analogy, every application is a unique path that controls where a rider can go, what actions can be taken, and how data is formatted. We talk about this from the perspective of the rider because they get to determine which paths they ride. Riders bridge between paths, connecting them into personalized neighborhoods. Each new app increases the area that the rider can travel and grows an ecosystem of potential routes. Different paths take you to different places, but Holochain lets you move between them seamlessly. </p><p>The affordances of each road dictate what can be done on it. Wide roads let many ride together, small curvy paths mean you slow down, etc. In the same way, the application rules are baked in. Changing them would be the same as changing roads. </p><p>As a framework for peer-to-peer applications, Holochain is taking on some of the toughest challenges of distributed computing. Ensuring data is validated and secure without central servers, allowing for asynchronous action across a network, and keeping agents honest, are all hard tasks. But each individual piece of this puzzle already exists, we are just recombining them to offer new possibilities. </p><p>Holochain is built to allow any group to come together, develop a bike path, and each with their own bike traveling at their own pace, ride the path together. Many different bike paths can overlap and intersect, and riders get to choose their route through them — traveling freely and at their own will.</p>

  ESMA’s latest guidelines clarify that non-EU crypto firms can only serve EU residents when they request it&nbsp;first.  It prohibits crypto firms from providing any additional services unrelated to the initial request from their EU&nbsp;clients.  The draft guidelines seek to thwart any attempts by third-country firms to bypass the rules while also encouraging stakeholders to provide feedback to improve ESMA’s approach.  <p>Recently, the European Securities and Markets Authority <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-01/ESMA35-1872330276-1619_Consultation_Paper_on_the_draft_guidelines_on_reverse_solicitation_under_MiCA.pdf">published a consultation paper</a> discussing the draft guidelines on reverse solicitation <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/eu-parliament-greenflags-mica-potential-impact-on-the-crypto-landscape">under MiCA</a>. Here, reverse solicitation refers to a situation where third-country firms solicit clients in the European Union, directly or indirectly.</p><p>The ESMA’s main purpose with these guidelines is to specify when third-country firms can offer crypto services to EU clients and to prevent firms from circumventing the reverse solicitation rule.</p><p>The agency also aims for these guidelines to be consistent, efficient, and effective when rolled out for implementation. For that, ESMA has urged all stakeholders, including crypto-asset service providers (including from third countries) and financial entities dealing with crypto-assets, to respond to this consultation paper.</p><p>Responses should address the questions asked, provide explanations, and suggest alternative options for the ESMA to consider.</p> When are Non-EU Crypto Firms Allowed to Offer Services to EU Residents? <p>The latest ESMA guidelines say that non-EU crypto firms can provide their services to EU residents only when they request it. However, after the initial contact, the firm can’t offer more cryptocurrencies or related services unless they are related to what the client asked for in the first&nbsp;place.</p> Instructions for Relevant National Regulators <p>To ensure an interaction is genuinely initiated by the EU-based client, the guideline suggests regulators look at how and when the client approached the firm. Was it truly on their own, without any nudges from ads or&nbsp;emails?</p><p>The draft guidelines also provide instructions to national agencies on how to decide if a third-country firm is marketing a new kind of crypto asset or service. They suggest that national authorities look at two&nbsp;things:</p>  The type of crypto asset or service being&nbsp;offered.  The risks involved with the new crypto asset or&nbsp;service.  <p>It also notes that MiCA only mentions three crypto asset types (asset-referenced tokens, electronic money tokens, and tokens that don’t fall into these categories), and such broad categories might enable third-country firms to <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/navigating-regulatory-challenges-mica-and-the-defi-landscape">circumvent the rules</a>. So, ESMA urges relevant national authorities through these guidelines to:</p>  Monitor the marketing efforts that third-country firms deploy in targeting EU-based&nbsp;clients.  Conduct relevant consumer&nbsp;surveys.  Keep a tab on clients’ complaints and whistleblowing.  Cooperate with authorities, including law enforcement, as and when required.   Concluding Thoughts <p>Overall, the draft guidelines offer insights and guidance on when third-country firms can approach clients in the EU and provide strategies for detecting any attempts to bypass these rules. And since it’s a consultation paper, stakeholders are invited to share their feedback on ESMA’s approach, identifying any potential gaps or effectiveness concerns. Responses are accepted until April 29,&nbsp;2024.</p><p>______________________________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

				  Governance enables ecosystems for sharing data — it’s the secret sauce driving value, and the permutations are limitless.

				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>One way to understand governance as a component of decentralized identity is to look at identity verification and data sharing as an “ecosystem.”</p>
<p>An ecosystem is any use case where you have:</p>
 
 One or more parties issuing verifiable credentials for digital identity to people, organizations, or devices. 
 People, organizations, or devices who then hold the credentials to prove their identity and share data within the credential to other parties. 
 People, organizations, or devices, that need to prove the identity of those presenting verifiable credentials, and the data within their credentials to accomplish some goal. 
 
<p>In an ecosystem, participants are interested in the same kind of data to solve the same kind of problems. This could be who is allowed to access a facility, an operational system, a software application.</p>
<p>Governance makes this happen.</p>
<p>The governance authority establishes who can issue credentials. If there is only one issuer, say in the case of a company issuing employee credentials, the company is the governance authority.</p>
<p>The authority establishes:</p>
 
 who can be issued a credential. 
 who else can issue credentials 
 What information is going to be issued in a credential. 
 How that information is to be interpreted — if x, then y 
 How that information can be shared in ways to comply with data privacy regulations. 
 
<p>While there are other technical aspects to governance (choosing credential formats, DID methods, protocols, cryptographic key management etc), the key governance actions can be reduced to two workflows:</p>
 
 Which credentials can I trust? 
 What data needs to be presented and authenticated and how does it need to be presented? 
 
<p>These questions are solved by machine-readable governance. The governance authority publishes a file in a format that can be read by the software required and held by each participant in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Once you have an ecosystem for a specific use case, you can extend the governance to other use cases, depending on how robustly you have authenticated the person, organization or device that you issued the credential to.</p>
<p>Governance would enable a credential issued to an employee to access a hospital to also access a specific database or device. Governance could allow this credential to be used as a proof of identity for specific organizations that provide employee benefits. So you’ve gone, just through a simple addition of code, from opening a door to opening an insurance policy.</p>
<p>Two different hospital systems could agree and use machine readable governance to authorize doctors in one system to work in another.</p>
<p>The fact that these rules can be rendered in a machine-readable format makes implementation and updating fast and simple. You can rapidly reconfigure your ecosystem to manage new data and requirements.</p>
<p>And once you are able to use verifiable identity and data, the permutations are limitless. Governance makes all these permutations work and enables expansion and scale.</p>
<p>It turns trust into an actionable, valuable commodity.</p>

<p>Everywhere you turn, it seems there’s a new process, a new technology, and a new consumer preference that is “going digital.” More and more cardholders around the globe are preferring, and expecting, a digital-first payment experience. Because of the technology behind it all, IT professionals are at the center of this digital transformation. The pandemic accelerated an awareness of and migration to contactless and digital payments, and the payments ecosystem is now one of the fastest movers when it comes to digitization.</p>
<p><a href="https://go.entrust.com/quick-pulse-survey-infographic?_ga=2.95126300.1605869982.1705256759-491805133.1665679376&amp;_gl=1*hc75j8*_ga*NDkxODA1MTMzLjE2NjU2NzkzNzY.*_ga_6QRW66BW5T*MTcwNTI1NjM1MS42MzQuMS4xNzA1MjU2Nzc0LjQ0LjAuMA..">51% of U.S. cardholders</a> state that their mobile banking app is their preferred method to engage with their financial institution. This data shows us that customers are looking for seamless, digital-first payment and card management experiences. With that data guiding us, it’s clear an elevated and enriched issuance and payment enablement process is now the gold standard to meet the demand of cardholders.</p>
<p>Bridging Physical and Digital Experiences for Cardholders</p>
<p>That gold standard experience – providing a compelling, seamless digital card and payment experience – can help a bank to achieve <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/07/maintain-your-top-of-wallet-status-with-advanced-card-controls/">top-of-wallet status</a>. We learned in a <a href="https://go.entrust.com/quick-pulse-survey-infographic?_ga=2.95126300.1605869982.1705256759-491805133.1665679376&amp;_gl=1*hc75j8*_ga*NDkxODA1MTMzLjE2NjU2NzkzNzY.*_ga_6QRW66BW5T*MTcwNTI1NjM1MS42MzQuMS4xNzA1MjU2Nzc0LjQ0LjAuMA..">recent survey</a> among 1,000 U.S. cardholders that digital card controls in the banking app make the cardholder more likely to use the card as a default payment method. This has led to some banks going all-in with fully featured, integrated digital card solutions. Others, especially small to midsize banks, have asked their IT teams to implement some fundamental digital features as building blocks to their digital card platform – a foundation that can be enhanced and expanded by partnering with a digital card solution provider to offer cardholders a truly digital-first payment experience.</p>
<p>But financial institutions have different challenges when it comes to enabling intuitive yet secure digital payment options for their cardholders. The building blocks themselves, like choosing the right digital features, knowing which features are most requested by cardholders, and meeting the demands of different demographic groups, can be challenging to organize and understand. Similarly, it’s important to consider a solution that is scalable and future-proof to ensure the biggest ROI. Most IT teams have heavy resource constraints with a multitude of existing projects. Smaller financial institutions may find it difficult to build out their own digital card solution, while bigger institutions will think closely about the existing infrastructure in place.

<p>As digital transformation accelerates across industries, technology thought leader Philip Sheldrake brings an urgent yet nuanced perspective on constructing digital identity systems centered on human needs.</p><p>With a perspective spanning engineering, computer science, and involvement in decentralized projects, Sheldrake understands the intricacies of designing digital ecosystems.</p><p>However, through his interdisciplinary lens, he sees profound gaps in how identity gets formulated in computational realms versus lived human experience.</p><p>In the same way that the internet has brought a series of helpful technological advancements, it’s also brought unintended consequences.</p><p>For Sheldrake, identity may be the premier challenge to align digital progress with human flourishing rather than harm.</p><p>By drawing out insights from his expertise in bridging social and computer sciences, this article explores the past, present, and most hopeful future pathways for digital identity.</p> Understanding and Describing Identity <p>Even defining digital identity proves slippery, as technologist Philip Sheldrake explains:</p><p></p><blockquote>“It’s so difficult to actually even describe the space we're about to talk about. It's astonishing how few words have real meaning in this space.”</blockquote><p></p><p>Identity intersects technology, business, government, philosophy, culture, and our personal lives. Thus, no singular perspective captures its complexity.</p><p>Sheldrake notes, “There are just a few throwaway phrases that just mislead people because they're so ubiquitous, they hardly mean anything anymore.”&nbsp;</p><p>Concepts like innovation, transformation, and disruption get used to the point of losing meaning. Making progress requires bridging disconnected outlooks. For example, social scientists and computer programmers use distinctive language and assumptions, often talking past each other. Successful digital systems blend these varied perspectives and provide enough interdisciplinary expertise to clarify complexity.</p><p>Sheldrake brings decades of experience working across domains, from helping launch open source browser Firefox to involvement with Ethereum and decentralized technology projects. He sees identity as the crux where technology and humanity meet — for better or worse:</p><p></p><blockquote>“I am obsessed with the potential for digital technologies to lend a hand in human flourishing. Except that, so far, the experiment of the digital has thrown up as many negative externalities… as positive. Little things, you know, like undermining democracy.”</blockquote><p></p><p>The alluring promise of technology remains unfulfilled until we construct frameworks elevating both computer science innovations and social scientific understandings of identity.</p> Technology Changes Identity Dynamics Over Time <p>While databases and algorithms remain constant, the societal outcomes and experiences with digital systems transform remarkably across months and years. Sheldrake explains how innovations go through a “series of phases” regarding consequences as usage patterns and cultural incorporation structurally mature.</p><p>In the early days of social media, few guard rails for behavior existed, enabling exploratory identity play. Yet, as digital engagement became mobile and pervasive, external constraints tightened. Structures accreted, along with probabilities of harm.</p><p>Sheldrake gives the example of shifting sentiment around decentralized technology projects like blockchain. Initial optimism about democratization gave way to backlash concerning crypto’s environmental impacts. This reveals less about the fundamentals of blockchain itself changing and more about the emergence of unintended externalities at scale.</p> Contrasting Views on Identity <p>There are fundamentally different perspectives on identity in computer science and social science. Sheldrake points out, “In computer science...nothing is addressable in internetworking until it has an entity and identifier.”&nbsp;</p><p>Rigid constructs like legal identities and cryptographic claims of personhood dominate programming approaches.</p><p>Meanwhile, in sociology and psychology, “identity is a sense-making capacity...a process, it’s a verb.” Human identity lives between people and contexts, ever-negotiated through information exchange. Instead of static entities, constantly co-created meaning flows.</p><p>Sheldrake argues the clash stems from differing historical customers driving innovation, noting “the first customers of IT were large corporations and governments...IT served the bureaucracy, it was the definition of bureaucracy.”</p><p>Thus, digitization elevated standardized legal identities for taxation and service provision — not the nuanced, fluid identities enlivening human relationships outside institutional walls. Much gets lost in translation.</p> The Path Forward Requires New Perspectives <p>Progress on digital identity relies on transcending entrenched disciplinary silos to enable genuine dialogue and collective innovation. While compromising on decentralized principles proves difficult, rigidly decentralized systems similarly risk harm without weighing human needs.</p><p>Sheldrake argues identity resides in “getting social science and computer science and the humanities, kind of riffing off each other's best strengths, rather than allowing computer science to riff off its worst weaknesses.” No single expertise holds the answers alone.</p><p>He continues: “One of my mentors mentioned to me, the beginning of the 90s, the 20th century was all about disciplinary excellence, the 21st century will all be about the interdisciplinary or even the transdisciplinary, trying to fill in the gaps between the disciplinary knowledge.”</p><p>To sufficiently fill those gaps, technologies like <a href="https://www.holochain.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holochain</a> aim to bring individual sovereignty and collective capacity. While there isn’t a perfect formula for identity, the next wave of innovators can learn from how it’s translated digitally.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/2023-forgerock-identity-breach-report">five consecutive years</a>, the leading cause of breaches has been compromised credentials — in other words, the use of stolen passwords. MFA renders the use of stolen credentials futile, as attackers are highly unlikely to have access to a user's other authentication factors, such as a mobile phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2019/08/20/one-simple-action-you-can-take-to-prevent-99-9-percent-of-account-attacks">Microsoft</a> has stated that using MFA may stop 99% of password-related attacks within an enterprise, so an increasing number of enterprises have begun to require MFA before granting account access. That's the good news.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bad news is that attackers are now evolving their tactics for bypassing MFA - and are finding some success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many organizations encourage using MFA for threat protection, but relying on users to approve authentication requests manually is now riskier than ever due to tactics such as MFA Bombing. </p>

<p>Considering a decentralized identity (DI) solution? Is this your wish list:<br></p>



<p>✔️ You want to deploy DI capabilities in the simplest way possible.<br></p>



<p>✔️ You want to focus on your core business while leaving others to do the detailed technical work of deploying your DI solution.<br></p>



<p>✔️ You want to deploy your DI solution faster and at a much lower total cost of ownership (TOC) than other deployment models offer.<br></p>



<p>To have those wishes granted, you need a cloud-based, SaaS deployment model—a complete and managed solution that includes the deployment, management, maintenance, and support of DI services. In short, you need the Anonyome Platform.</p>



<p>Read our <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/2023/12/delivering-decentralized-identity-service-offerings/">whitepaper</a> or continue here for the highlights.</p>



 More companies are turning to a SaaS solution for DI &nbsp; 



<p>For software providers and integrators, adding a DI infrastructure to their product lines presents many of the same choices they faced when integrating other system elements: for example, will we host our web servers in own own local data center using our own hardware? Or should we opt for the simplicity of leasing server space from a cloud hosting provider?</p>



<p>Both methods have benefits. Some companies enjoy the peace of mind that comes with controlling their own hardware and software stacks. Others—an increasing majority—find peace of mind comes from knowing that the hardware and software stacks are delivered and maintained through a contract model.</p>



<p>The contract model is often referred to as cloud hosting or the more formal Software as a Service (SaaS) model because the vendor provider deploys, manages, maintains, and provides support for the software.</p>



<p>Calculating the total cost of ownership (TOC) usually determines whether to use a SaaS or on-site deployment model. The key cost drivers for any software implementation are the costs of:<br></p>



 
 software application 



 hardware/hosting 



 staff required to deploy, manage, maintain, and support the application. 
 



<p><br>Any of those cost drivers that a company can successfully outsource become line items in a budget without the operational complexities imposed by on-site deployments.<br></p>



 The Anonyome Platform embraces the SaaS model 



<p>Many companies have calculated the inefficiency, complexity, and additional expenses of the traditional on-site software model and have opted for the simplicity of the SaaS model. In fact, the SaaS model has become the de facto standard for delivering software solutions and the Anonyome Platform was built to embrace this model.</p>



 <br>Here are 7 reasons why: 



<p></p>



 1. No upfront capital costs 







<p>With the SaaS model, the customer doesn’t have to bear the upfront capital costs of deploying a software solution or even contracting their own cloud provider. Instead, the SaaS vendor incurs these costs (e.g., hardware/hosting, software application, and IT staff hiring and training). This simplifies startup and operating costs for the customer, the customer only pays a monthly or annual subscription cost, and deployment is immediate.</p>



<p></p>



 2. Fast deployment 







<p>SaaS delivers an almost instant solution to the customer, which is far more attractive than waiting the many months typically required for deploying and testing in-house solutions. Anonyome provides a fully automated approach to deploying new environments for customers.</p>



<p></p>



 3. Vendor-provided maintenance and upgrades 







<p>In the on-site solution, a customer is on the hook for updating and applying security patches to the software and operating systems, and for performing compatibility tests with every change. On the other hand, in the SaaS model, the software vendor maintains and upgrades the software, which includes delivering new versions and security patching the hosted system to protect against security vulnerabilities.</p>



<p></p>



 4. No staffing requirements 







<p>Paying staff to research, design, integrate, test, finetune, and launch any system is a significant cost with in-house solutions—up to 75% of the overall costs, in fact. The SaaS model eliminates the staffing concerns for contracted services.</p>



<p>In new emerging areas such as DI, it may be extremely difficult to find new hires with the right skills. The Anonyome Labs’ team, on the other hand, is highly experienced and highly trained in DI technologies. Beyond the Anonyome Platform, we support the ongoing development of DI by:</p>



 
 helping to run three DI-focused blockchains 



 being an active contributor to the DI standards organizations 



 contributing source code back to the DI open source community. 
 



<p></p>



 5. No-fuss application scalability 







<p>With in-house solutions, the customer must think about infrastructure issues such as network bandwidth, database and server sizing before deciding whether to ramp up their solution. But customers using the SaaS model don’t have to think about the technical how of scalability, because it’s already done for them. This leaves them free to focus on their business strategy and when to scale for maximum revenue.</p>



<p></p>



 6. 24-hour software support 







<p>The service level agreement (SLA) is key to a SaaS solution because it outlines the reliable actions and response times a customer can expect should an issue arise. With Anonyome’s global workforce across multiple time zones, staff are always on hand to respond to priority issues, even after hours at the customer’s site.</p>



<p></p>



 7. High level security and privacy 







<p>Under the SaaS model, the software vendor hires and trains people to maintain top security and privacy capabilities on the customer’s behalf, which is a significant resource saving.<br></p>



<p>DI is exploding as the new identity management solution</p>



<p>As you’d know, DI is the technology and standards that allow a new form of digital identity that works everywhere, is more trustworthy, and respects privacy. DI puts the user in sole control of the personal information that forms their identity. It’s decentralized because there’s no central authority or single issuing agent.</p>



<p>According to June 2023&nbsp;<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/plotting-the-roadmap-for-digital-identity-us-organizations-are-set-to-embrace-decentralized-identity-301865810.html">figures, </a>more than&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/05/7-insights-into-progress-on-the-path-to-decentralized-identity-dr-paul-ashley/">62 per cent</a>&nbsp;of US companies plan to incorporate a&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/05/7-insights-into-progress-on-the-path-to-decentralized-identity-dr-paul-ashley/">DI </a>solution into their operations, with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/plotting-the-roadmap-for-digital-identity-us-organizations-are-set-to-embrace-decentralized-identity-301865810.html">74 per cent</a>&nbsp;likely to do so within a year.</p>



<p><br>Read: <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/simple-definitions-for-complex-terms-in-decentralized-identity%ef%bf%bc/">Simple Definitions for Complex Terms in DI</a> and <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/08/17-industries-with-viable-use-cases-for-decentralized-identity/">17 Industries with Viable Use Cases for DI</a><br></p>



<p>Centralized identity models are no longer sufficient to safeguard against exploitations from either rogue internal operators or external bad actors. DI has stepped into the breach, because:<br></p>



 
 DI is safer: Without central storage of credentials, DI presents much less risk of credential theft or other operational issues for the customer as custodians of sensitive data. 



 DI streamlines process:Organizations no longer have to repeatedly collect and distribute data, and sign-up and sign-in processes are faster because there’s no need to duplicate efforts and approvals. 



 DI gives individuals control over data:The customer controls their own data, which reduces risk, unifies user experience, and boosts their satisfaction. 



 DI reduces the compliance burden: The system eliminates manual error and inconsistent and redundant data distribution and validation. 
 



 The Anonyome Platform specializes in DI (and much more) 







<p>The Anonyome Platform does three things we know enterprise customers want:<br></p>



 
 Very quickly deploys DI capabilities in their application environment 



 Handles the deployment, management, maintenance and support of the DI solution 



 Allows the customer focus on high-level strategy instead of the technical intricacies. 
 



<p>Within the DI offering, the Anonyome Platform has five licensable products:</p>



 
 White label mobile DI wallet: A standalone mobile application for iOS and Android, a user can use the mobile DI wallet for DI interactions and storage: creating storing cryptographic keys; and creating connections for receiving, holding and presenting verifiable credentials. It interacts with verifiable credential issuers and verifiers, and supports both AnonCreds and W3C Credential formats. 
 



 
 Mobile native DI wallet SDK: For customers who want to add the DI wallet functionality to their own mobile application, this native mobile SDK provides the capability for storage; creating cryptographic keys; establishing connections; and receiving, holding and presenting verifiable credentials. 
 



 
 Verifiable credentials service/SDK/sample apps: This service establishes connections with DI wallets, issues verifiable credentials, and requests and verifies presentation proofs from DI wallets. It supports both AnonCreds and W3C Credential formats. 
 



 
 Relay service/SDK: This service introduces an always-on capability for a mobile DI wallet. Implemented as a cloud service, the relay service provides mediator capability for incoming/outgoing verifiable credential and other messages, so that sending and receiving is not limited to when the client implementations of the mobile DI wallet and SDK are online. 
 



 
 Governance framework:This framework empowers DI network participants to enforce rules while staying true to the tenants of DI. Organizations can define and enforce governance rules associated with their ecosystem, including which wallets, issuers, and verifiers are trusted and which credentials can be used and requested. 
 



<p>In addition to the current Anonyome Platform DI products, we are also developing:</p>



 
 Enterprise DI wallet: A combination mobile wallet application and cloud wallet, the enterprise DI wallet manages credentials associated with the enterprise. Differing from a personal DI wallet, the enterprise DI wallet is intended for one or more users to use simultaneously and to be inheritable by a future occupant of a particular job or position within an enterprise. 
 



<p>The Anonyome Platform is a SaaS-based, API-first developer platform of individualized services<br></p>



<p>Also known as the <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>, the Anonyome Platform offers a set of DI, privacy, and cybersecurity services and SDKs that developers can add as capabilities to their existing or new applications.</p>



<p>When a customer has licensed one or more of the Sudo Platform services, we create a new Sudo Platform deployment instance for that customer, which contains their specific licensed services. One of Sudo Platform’s unique features is it doesn’t use a shared deployment model (common for SaaS environments). Rather, Sudo Platform deploys environments individually for each customer. This means the customer can customize the environment for their needs, and that customer’s data and processing are completely separate from those of other customers.</p>



<p>Once we have deployed and configured an environment for a customer, we maintain and support it, which includes updating and patching it, and monitoring it 24/7.<br><br><a href="https://sudoplatform.com/2023/12/delivering-decentralized-identity-service-offerings/">Now, head to our whitepaper for specifics on how the Anonyome Platform operates</a></p>



<p>Ready to start building?</p>



<p>Remember, we built&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;so you don’t have to, and we make it easy for you to make it your own. It’s a modular, turnkey collection of services including:</p>



 
 DI 



 Safe and private browsing 



 Password management 



 Virtual private network 



 Compartmentalization 



 Virtual cards 



 Open and encrypted telephony and email communications. 
 



<p><br>You can use one, some, or the entire stack to augment your established offerings with adjacent capabilities that dramatically increase value for your customers.<br></p>



<p><a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a> includes everything you need to quickly bring new products to market or augment existing products with value-add privacy and identity protection capabilities. It includes:</p>



 
 Developer-focused documentation 



 APIs 



 SDK source code via GitHub 



 Sample applications for test-to-deploy of various capabilities 



 Brandable white-label apps for quick go-to-market deployments.

<p>Recent reports from the FBI have shed light on the escalating cyber espionage activities orchestrated by state-sponsored actors, particularly those emanating from China. Case in point — the emergence of the Volt Typhoon botnet, as highlighted in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/feb/01/china-hacking-threat-us-volt-typhoon-botnet-fbi-warning">The Guardian</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/fbi-china-espionage-hacking-db23dd96cfd825e4988852a34a99d4ea">AP News</a>, underscoring the critical need to safeguard sensitive information and ensure the integrity of digital identities, now more than ever.</p>
 Understanding the Threat Landscape 
<p>The FBI’s warnings regarding the Volt Typhoon botnet and China’s espionage activities serve as a stark reminder of the sophisticated tactics employed by cyber adversaries. Coincidently, my last <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/mitigating-midnight-blizzards-password-spraying-cyber-attack-insights-and-solutions-by-1kosmos/">blog</a> covered Midnight Blizzard – Russian nation state attackers on Microsoft. These threats pose significant challenges to national security and underscore the vulnerabilities inherent in identity verification and data protection. This also means the threat landscape is expanding.</p>
 Luckily, the Threat was Prevented 
<p>In this instance, the threat was thwarted before an incident occurred. In the case of the Midnight Blizzard attack on Microsoft, we were not so lucky. The warnings come as a shot across the collective bow for all organizations and serve as a reminder that this will not be the last time a foreign entity or any other hacker will target the vulnerable.</p>
<p>So, what are organizations to do to keep themselves out of the headlines? Not a huge surprise, but first we must all keep up with applying security patches and up-to-date versions of the OS and application layers. To restate the obvious, good system management hygiene is a must.</p>
<p>But the uncomfortable truth is that bad actors log in as frequently or even more often than using some sophisticated hack to gain access. Many organizations are minimizing dependence on passwords, but they are finding that the big challenge is addressing the many authentication use cases.</p>
<p>Windows Hello for Business conveniently supports passwordless access within the Microsoft platform, but try getting this to work with Mac OS, Linux or even your VPN. Domain controllers and virtual machines, for example, also continue to depend on passwords. To the delight of hackers, the resulting “passwordless strategy” resembles Swiss Cheese more so than it does a Swiss Army knife supporting the broad range of needs enterprise wide.</p>
<p>So, on the path to eliminating passwords it’s the diversity of information technology that needs to be managed, and for good reason. Most enterprise IT environments evolved over decades as did security standards. There should be little to no expectation that somehow magically all ways of authenticating into this morass would happen with some type of hand waving let alone a black box that effortlessly solves all unanticipated authentication use cases.</p>
<p>Identity, it turns out, isn’t sufficiently managed with a password, an SMS code or the knowledge of mother’s maiden name. This is not new … a long list of three letter acronyms including IGA, SSO, PAM, and IAM all recognize identity as a corporate asset that needs to be managed and governed. None, however, seem able to keep up with the unrelenting attacks using social engineering and pirated account credentials. You just need to read the headlines to know this.</p>
 Closing the Open Door 
<p>At 1Kosmos, we’ve always approached passwordless MFA as a feature, but we’ve viewed the root cause authentication issue as a business challenge revolving around identity. We solved that by performing identity verification and then generating as an artifact a non-phishable passwordless MFA credential with liveness detection.</p>
<p>But as our passwordless journey continued, something interesting happened. We found that placing identity outside of the application platforms and providing for various levels of identity assurance tuned to the risk of the digital interaction helped us rapidly evolve our identity and authentication platform to address the constant stream of use cases that surfaced in just about every customer deployment.</p>
<p>It turns out that not everybody wants an app, not everybody owns a mobile device, and some work environments outright prohibit the use of mobile handsets. By offering identity verification and authentication in a single privacy-by-design platform we’ve provided ourselves and our customers an elegant way to systematically accommodate the unexpected, and in a sense, hardest-to-solve authentication use cases.</p>
<p>This approach to identity modernization quickly augments core identity and access management to mitigate risk, reduce technical debt, and enhance access controls, effectively closing the open door that many hackers walk through unchallenged. By way of example, it’s why we’ve been able to rapidly release app-less authentication, browser-based identity verification journeys and most recently BlockID 1Key, a biometric security key.</p>
<p>At 1Kosmos, we believe that by integrating identity proofing, credential verification, and strong authentication, we equip organizations with the tools and insights needed to combat identity-based attacks effectively – and in ways not possible before.</p>
<p>Through a collaborative and identity-centric approach to security, we help organizations bolster their resilience and navigate through this digital storm unleashed by sophisticated attackers like those behind Volt Typhoon.</p>
 Prepare Now for What May Come 
<p>Given the advanced warnings from the FBI regarding the Volt Typhoon botnet and China’s espionage, we were lucky this time. But this sequence of events telegraphs the dangers that live among us and should serve as a battle cry for heightened security measures, starting with identity verification at first and every login … for customers, workers, and citizens.</p>
<p>Embracing innovative technologies that in turn enable rapid business innovation … it’s the path forward to reduce risk and deliver order-of-magnitude business improvement. It’s the logical path forward for organizations that thrive on the speed of innovation and want to de-risk their business plan by modernizing and simplifying identity and access management. It’s this bright future we at 1Kosmos envision for all organizations navigating digital transformation and the delivery of digital services.</p>

  <p>In November 2023 at <a href="https://ignite.microsoft.com/en-US/sessions/07952ef8-8603-4a94-8185-975ae95e53bb?source=sessions">Microsoft Ignite</a>, we announced Microsoft-managed policies and the auto-rollout of multifactor authentication (MFA)-related Conditional Access&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/11/06/automatic-conditional-access-policies-in-microsoft-entra-streamline-identity-protection/">policies</a> in customer tenants. Since then, we’ve rolled out report-only policies for over 500,000 tenants. These policies are part of our <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/11/02/announcing-microsoft-secure-future-initiative-to-advance-security-engineering/">Secure Future Initiative,</a>&nbsp;which includes key engineering advances to improve security for customers against cyberthreats that we anticipate will increase over time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This follow-up blog will dive deeper into these policies to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of what they entail and how they function.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  Multifactor authentication for admins accessing Microsoft admin portals 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Admin accounts with elevated privileges are more likely to be attacked, so enforcing MFA for these roles protects these privileged administrative functions. This policy covers 14 admin roles that we consider to be highly privileged, requiring administrators to perform multifactor authentication when signing into Microsoft admin portals. This policy targets Microsoft Entra ID P1 and P2 tenants, where security defaults aren't enabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Multifactor authentication for per-user multifactor authentication users 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Per-user MFA is when users are enabled individually and are required to perform multifactor authentication each time they sign in (with some exceptions, such as when they sign in from trusted IP addresses or when the remember MFA on trusted devices feature is turned on). For customers who are licensed for Entra ID P1, Conditional Access offers a better admin experience with many additional features, including <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-users-groups">user group</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-cloud-apps">application</a> targeting, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-conditions">more conditions</a> such as risk- and device-based, integration with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/authentication/concept-authentication-strengths">authentication strengths</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-session">session controls</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-report-only">report-only mode</a>. This can help you be more targeted in requiring MFA, lowering end user friction while maintaining security posture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This policy covers users with per-user MFA. These users are targeted by Conditional Access and are now required to perform multifactor authentication for all cloud apps. It aids organizations’ transition to Conditional Access seamlessly, ensuring no disruption to end user experiences while maintaining a high level of security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This policy targets licensed users with Entra ID P1 and P2, where the security defaults policy isn't enabled and there are less than 500 per-user MFA enabled enabled/enforced users. There will be no change to the end user experience due to this policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Multifactor authentication and reauthentication for risky sign-ins 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This policy will help your organization achieve the Optimal level for Risk Assessments in the NIST <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/zero_trust_maturity_model_v2_508.pdf">Zero Trust Maturity Model</a> because it provides a key layer of added security assurance that triggers only when we detect high-risk sign-ins. “High-risk sign-in” means there is a very high probability that a given authentication request isn't the authorized identity owner and could indicate brute force, password spray, or token replay attacks. By dynamically responding to sign-in risk, this policy disrupts active attacks in real-time while remaining invisible to most users, particularly those who don’t have high sign-in risk. When Identity Protection detects an attack, your users will be prompted to self-remediate with MFA and reauthenticate to Entra ID, which will reset the compromised session.</p>

<p>In an era where data security and privacy are paramount, the use of Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) in distributed ID and payment card printers is not just a recommendation but a necessity. These small hardware-based security modules serve as the sentinels guarding sensitive information in a digital age.</p>
<p>Security Significance of Trusted Platform Modules</p>
<p>At its core, a Trusted Platform Module is a dedicated microcontroller chip integrated into a device’s motherboard or system-on-a-chip. Its primary function is to secure and safeguard critical data, cryptographic keys, and system integrity. TPMs adhere to established industry standards and offer a range of cryptographic operations. They generate, store, and protect cryptographic keys and execute operations like digital signatures and card issuance. One of the most critical aspects of a TPM is its ability to provide <a href="https://access.redhat.com/articles/5254641">Secure Boot processes</a>, ensuring that the device’s firmware and operating system remain unaltered and authentic. This fundamental feature prevents attackers from compromising the system at its root, thereby establishing trust from the ground up.</p>
<p>Government institutions worldwide recognize the necessity of Trusted Platform Modules in safeguarding sensitive data and critical infrastructure. In the U.S., <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final">all devices connecting to government networks are mandated to incorporate TPMs</a> as part of their security standards. These modules play a crucial role in protecting classified information, securing communications, and mitigating potential breaches. Government systems equipped with TPMs are not only more secure but also enable remote attestation, meaning that their status can be verified and authenticated by trusted entities. This is essential for ensuring that the device’s software and firmware have not been tampered with, guaranteeing the utmost security.</p>
<p>Imperative for ID and Payment Card Printers</p>
<p>Without a TPM, devices such as ID and payment card printers become susceptible to rising security threats. Hackers, malicious software, and unauthorized users can exploit vulnerabilities in these systems, potentially leading to devastating consequences:</p>
 
 Data Breaches: Sensitive personal and financial information, including ID and payment card data, can be compromised, resulting in identity theft and financial fraud. 
 Counterfeit Cards: Fraudsters may take advantage of unsecured printers to produce counterfeit identification and payment cards, posing a severe risk to both individuals and institutions. 
 System Tampering: The absence of Secure Boot processes leaves systems open to firmware attacks, making them more susceptible to malware and unauthorized access. 
 
<p>The inclusion of Trusted Platform Modules in distributed ID and payment card printers is a necessity. Government institutions understand the imperative need for TPMs in safeguarding sensitive information, and the same principle applies to banks, universities, and enterprises. The absence of TPMs leaves these entities exposed to security vulnerabilities that could have severe consequences.</p>
<p>By integrating TPMs into their systems, organizations can fortify their defenses against data breaches, counterfeiting, and system tampering. These modules, with their technical prowess and cryptographic capabilities, offer a solid foundation for robust security in the digital age, ensuring the trustworthiness of the devices that shape our lives. Entrust is the only provider globally using Trusted Platform Modules across our latest line of issuance systems.

<p>In recent months, ransomware attacks have gained attention and become a top concern across multiple industries. The threat has affected many well-known brands, ranging from cable providers and aircraft manufacturers to mortgage servicers and title insurance companies. Ransomware is a type of malware used to infect computers and encrypt data. Once infected, the ransomware attempts to spread to connected systems. This can include computers accessible on the network, shared drives, and backups. The goal of the attack is to render data and applications unusable for the victim until a ransom is paid.</p>
<p>According to Corvus Insurance, ransomware leak site victims reached a <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/ransomware-victims-record-november/">record-high in November</a>: a 39% increase from the prior month and a 110% increase year-over-year. The report suggests the uptick was largely due to LockBit and the <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-4966">CVE 2023-4966 Citrix Bleed vulnerability</a>. The exploit allows threat actors to circumvent password requirements and multi-factor authentication (MFA) to hijack legitimate user sessions for harvesting credentials and accessing data. On November 21, 2023, the Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) also issued this <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-325a">advisory</a>.</p>
<p>For financial services organizations, ransomware attacks can be particularly damaging. In August 2023, real estate brokers and agents in the U.S. suffered from an <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/magazine/real-estate-news/commentary/mls-cyberattack-a-wake-up-call-for-all-leaders">attack</a> that took 23 multiple listing service (MLS) systems offline. MLS systems are private databases created, maintained, and funded by real estate professionals to help clients buy and sell properties. In November, one of the largest <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/mr-cooper-data-breach-impacts-14-7-million-individuals/">mortgage servicers</a> in the U.S. experienced an outage impacting millions and homeowners were unable to submit mortgage payments. Weeks later, two large title insurance providers in the U.S. and UK were attacked and closing transactions were delayed. In early January, one of the largest non-bank lenders was also <a href="https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/loandepot-ransomware-exposes-17M-people/705169/">attacked</a>.</p>
<p>What are the consequences of a ransomware attack? Depending on the industry, the answer will vary. To understand the scope of impact, consider these two sample customer transactions: An iced latte beverage versus a residential piece of real estate. While the first is likely the smallest purchase a customer may make in a single day, the other may be the largest single purchase they make in their lifetime. If the ice cubes used for making the latte represent data, a real estate financing transaction is an iceberg. The volume of personally identifiable information (PII) involved with buying and selling a home and making monthly loan payments make real estate, mortgage, and title firms highly sought-after targets for would-be attackers.</p>
<p>The Ice Cube</p>
<p>When a national coffee chain is subjected to a ransomware attack, customers are likely to face temporary inconveniences. Systems may go offline. Point-of-sale systems for credit cards may be unavailable until the recovery process is complete. Perhaps loyalty rewards information or some confidential data is exfiltrated. If it is determined that a material breach occurred, the compliance team will act in accordance with state and federal breach notification laws. The impacted organization will notify, within a required timeframe upon discovery of the incident, the attorney general for each state in which affected customers reside. Impacted customers will subsequently receive a notification. If PII is stolen or lost for certain customers, those individuals may be offered free credit monitoring for a designated period.</p>
<p>The Iceberg</p>
<p>For a mortgage lender or title agency experiencing a ransomware attack, the incident response process is similar. However, the downstream impact can have significantly greater consequences. For those in the process of buying or selling a home, closings may be delayed. Outages may prevent appraisers from uploading reports. Title companies may be unable to disburse funds from escrow. Seller proceeds, mortgage payoff amounts, real estate agent commissions, and other payments will be delayed until systems are fully restored. The homeowner may be unable to make their monthly loan payment online. A mortgage servicer may be unable to receive borrower payments.</p>
<p>For most borrowers in the U.S., the mortgage servicer also facilitates the property tax and insurance payments on behalf of the homeowner. For these escrowed loans, the impact of a ransomware incident could disrupt real estate tax payments to counties and payments toward homeowner insurance policy premiums. The extent to which stolen data is used for other purposes beyond extortion, such as identity theft or credit card fraud, may also remain largely undetermined for an extended period.</p>
<p>The real estate mortgage and financing ecosystem depends on moving large sums of money in a timely manner between multiple transaction participants. Whether delayed mortgage payments or delayed real estate agent commissions, the immediate impact of a ransomware incident on a financial services organization can be substantial. A sustained outage could affect loan amortization schedules, interest calculations, and principal balances. To facilitate funding new mortgages, lenders regularly sell loans to government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In turn, these GSEs offer mortgage-backed securities (MBS), which consist of a group of mortgages organized to pay interest like a mortgage bond. The mission for these entities is to help provide liquidity and stability to the U.S. housing market. Listed as one of 16 critical infrastructure <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors/financial-services-sector">sectors</a> by CISA, financial services firms play an integral role in ensuring economic stability.</p>
<p>From making their smallest purchase in a single day to the largest single purchase of their lifetime, a customer’s expectations regarding data protection will vary. Leaking a customer’s latte purchase history is not a desired outcome; however, the theft of data containing a borrower’s credit history, income, bank account number, and transcripts of past tax returns is exponentially less preferred. A substandard approach to securing transactions for this segment of the industry can create dangerously high levels of risk. The real estate financing industry plays a vital role in helping individuals achieve home ownership, and customer data protection efforts should be considered accordingly.</p>
<p>Best Practices for Preparation, Prevention, and Mitigation</p>
<p>CISA’s <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware/ransomware-guide">#StopRansomware Guide</a> provides ransomware and data extortion preparation, prevention, and mitigation best practices. Preparation best practices focus on backups, incident response plans, and implementing a Zero Trust architecture. For prevention and mitigation best practices, CISA groups by initial access vectors, such as phishing and compromised credentials. Highlights from CISA’s recommendations include:</p>
 
 Maintain Frequent Backups: Encrypt backups of critical data and store them on separate devices inaccessible from a network. 
 Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA): Organizations should consider implementing a Zero Trust architecture to prevent unauthorized access to data and services. 
 Update and Patch Systems: Ensure applications and operating systems have the latest patches and updates. Updates should be obtained directly from vendor sites rather than clicking on email links. Enable automatic software updates and do not use end-of-life software. 
 Email: If you are unsure whether an email is legitimate, CISA recommends verifying the email’s legitimacy by contacting the sender directly.

 How are connected the digital Identity and Digital Signature in Web 3.0? 



<p>Explores how digital and electronic signatures are fundamental in the age of digital identity, with a special focus on decentralized technologies, advanced cryptography and Self-Sovereign Identity within the Web 3.0 world.</p>



 Disclaimer: 



<p>In this article, we will use the terms “decentralized identity” and “SSI” (Self-Sovereign Identity) interchangeably. It should be noted that the views and opinions expressed are based on our experience in the field of digital identity, but should not be interpreted as legal definitions.<br>What is an electronic signature?</p>



<p>An electronic signature, in essence, is your consent in the digital world. It can be an image of your signature, a PIN code, or even a click of a button. It is vital in managing digital identities and preventing cyber-attacks.</p>



 Digital signature: a specialization of electronic signature 



<p>The digital signature, a specific subset of the electronic signature, relies on asymmetric cryptography technologies. This technology uniquely links each signature to the signer and the document, providing reliable verification of authenticity. A clear example is the Verifiable Credentials (VCs).</p>



 Digital signature and legal entities in different countries 



 Let’s see two examples on this subject: 



 
 In Argentina: Digital signatures are restricted to individuals, which presents unique challenges for digital identities. 



 In Mexico: Legal entities can use digital signatures, advancing in the management of digital identities. 
 



 Private key management and security 



<p>The security of a digital signature is based on proper management of private keys. The responsibility for protecting these keys varies by country and type of entity, being crucial for online security.</p>



<p>Following the previous example, in countries where the digital signature is personal, as in Argentina, the responsibility for protecting the private key falls on the individual, which is fundamental for the prevention of cyber-attacks. In Mexico, on the other hand, the entity is responsible for its protection.<br>Identity in the legal and commercial sphere</p>



<p>Identity, both for individuals and entities, is built through actions, reputation and other attributes accumulated over time. For legal entities, this includes their track record, credentials and legal compliance. This identity is crucial in business and legal interactions and operations, and is at the core of what defines Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) in the Web 3.0 era.</p>



 Digital signature in Web3 



<p>Web3, with its focus on decentralized identity, proposes a new paradigm in the management of digital signatures. This decentralized approach, exemplified by protocols such as QuarkID, significantly improves interoperability between different systems and entities, allowing greater flexibility and control by users over their digital identities.</p>



<p>In turn, these technologies enable selective disclosure, which allows users to share only the information that is essential for a specific transaction, protecting their privacy.</p>



<p>Simultaneously, the concept of non-repudiation ensures that users’ actions, backed by the immutability of the blockchain and advanced digital signatures, are indisputable, increasing the security and reliability of digital interactions.<br></p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Digital and electronic signatures are essential in the era of Web 3.0 and digital identity. Understanding these concepts is crucial for their effective implementation. To learn more about how Extrimian integrates digital identity and cybersecurity solutions, visit Extrimian.</p>

<p>Bluesky is building an open social network where anyone can contribute, while still providing an easy-to-use experience for users. For the past year, we used invite codes to help us manage growth while we built features like moderation tooling, custom feeds, and more. Now, we’re ready for anyone to join.</p>
 
    <a href="https://bsky.app/">Sign up for Bluesky</a>
 
<p>Join more than three million people discussing news, sharing art, and just posting.</p>
 What is Bluesky? 
<p>To mark the occasion, we teamed up with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davis.social">Davis Bickford</a>, an artist on the network, to share why we’re excited about Bluesky.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>To learn more about Bluesky and how to get started, read our <a>user FAQ here</a>.</p>
<p>And if deep dives are more your style, we worked with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/martin.kleppmann.com">Martin Kleppman</a>, author of Designing Data-Intensive Applications and technical advisor to Bluesky, to write <a href="https://bsky.social/about/bluesky-and-the-at-protocol-usable-decentralized-social-media-martin-kleppmann.pdf">a paper that goes into more detail</a> about the technical underpinnings of Bluesky.</p>
 Looking Forward 
<p>We’ve been working on more features that put you in control of your social media experience. Here’s what you can expect to see soon:</p>
 Stackable Moderation Services 
<p>Safety is core to social media. Bluesky moderates the app according to our community guidelines, and our vision for <a>composable moderation</a> allows users to stack more moderation services together, such as subscribable moderation lists.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, we’re excited to release the labeling services which will allow users to stack more options on top of their existing moderation preferences. This will allow other organizations and people to run their own moderation services that can account for industry-specific knowledge or specific cultural norms, among other preferences.</p>
<p>One potential use case for labeling is fact-checking. For example, a fact-checking organization can run a labeling service and mark posts as “partially false,” “misleading,” or other categories. Then, users who trust this organization can subscribe to their labels. As the user scrolls through posts in the app, any labels that the fact-checking organization publishes will be visible on the post itself. This helps in the effective distribution of the fact-check and keeps users better informed.</p>
<p>We’ll be sharing more in the coming weeks. In the meantime, if you’re interested in partnering with Bluesky and setting up a labeling service, contact us at <a href="mailto:partnerships@blueskyweb.xyz">partnerships@blueskyweb.xyz</a>.</p>
 An Open Social Network 
<p>When you log in to Bluesky, it might look and feel familiar — the user experience should be straightforward. But under the hood, we’ve designed the app in a way that puts control back in your hands. Here, your experience online isn’t controlled by a single company. Whether it's your timeline or content filters, on Bluesky, you can easily customize your social experience.</p>
<p>This month, we’ll be rolling out an experimental early version of “federation,” or the feature that makes the network so open and customizable. On Bluesky, you’ll have the freedom to choose (and the right to leave) instead of being held to the whims of private companies or black box algorithms. And wherever you go, your friends and relationships can go with you.</p>
<p>For developers: We’ve already federated the network among multiple servers internally, and later this month, you’ll be able to self-host a server that connects to the main production network. You’ll be part of the first batch of servers that federate with the network, so expect to experiment alongside us! We’ll share more information on how to join the production network with your own server soon. In the meantime, you can test out your server set up via our developer sandbox. <a href="https://www.docs.bsky.app/blog/federation-sandbox">Find instructions here</a>.</p>

 Watch the recording <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duaNhMAvFhA">here.</a>  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>The Indicio Identity Community Meetup kicked off its first discussion of 2024 with Michael Zuriek, Head of Innovation for Digital Travel at SITA, and Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio, diving into the ways verifiable credential technology will transform the experience of travel for everyone — passengers, airlines, airports, and governments.</p>
<p>First, some context. Indicio and SITA are partners who <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-sita-and-aruba-deliver-verifiable-credentials-for-digital-travel/">successfully developed and deployed a Digital Travel Credential (DTC)</a> following International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards.</p>
<p>Why is this a revolutionary technology for travel?</p>
<p>A paradigm shift is coming: Seamless travel</p>
<p>For years, countries have been storing traveler data in centralized databases and using complex agreements and policies to share that information to make travel possible. It’s why there are so many hoops travelers have to jump through when crossing borders.</p>
<p>Now, with a Digital Travel Credential (DTC) that follows ICAO’s global standard for storing identity data on personal mobile devices, there is no need for this complex, cumbersome system to facilitate border crossing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead, the DTC allows security to simply scan the traveler’s digital information, in a fraction of the time of using a manual, paper-based system. And it provides a way to pre-authorize travel and check in before the traveler leaves home.</p>
<p>We have been conditioned to wait; but automation can severely reduce the bottlenecks in airports.</p>
<p>Dahl described using a DTC to pass through Aruba’s immigration as “almost magical.”: The system was so efficient and seamless that the border guard had waved her through before she was even aware of what was happening. The DTC allowed her paperwork and identity to be verified ahead of time and a biometric scan at the airport checked that she was the correct individual tied to that travel information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every traveler to Aruba will soon be able to have the same experience as the island implements DTC-enabled technology.</p>
<p>By using a DTC for all the touchpoints at an airport where identity needs to be checked, passengers get a much quicker experience, while airports, airlines, and governments benefit from the verified data, simplified privacy compliance, and enhanced security that comes from decentralized identity.</p>
<p>Airports have already invested significantly into biometrics when Covid hit, we could see rapid adoption of the DTC as some of the hardware is already in place.</p>
<p>The EU, US, IATA, and other governments and industry organizations are all currently working on bringing biometrics and digital travel together. Because Indicio and SITA’s DTC works on any airport system, deployment of the DTC will be rapid. The DTC makes biometric technology work much more efficiently and effectively, while simplifying data privacy compliance. And, on a practical level, as airports are an industry of fragmented IT systems, ease of adoption and integration is a critical value proposition. As many airports have biometric investments, the DTC is an easy way to capitalize on these investments and improve processes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are just a few of takeaways from the conversation; if you have time, I highly recommend you watch the full recording which can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duaNhMAvFhA">here</a>. <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">Get in touch</a> with <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a> today to get the DTC for your business.</p>
<p>Join us for the next meeting of the Indicio Identity Community Meetup, where we’ll be speaking with Klaeri Schelhowe, Executive Director of Trust Alliance New Zealand and their Digital Farm Wallet Pilot Project a tool that enables farmers, farm enterprises, and industry organizations to manage critical farm data in an efficient and secure way.</p>

  The European Securities and Markets Authority has urged member states to decide whether to opt into MiCA’s grandfathering scheme or not by June 30th,&nbsp;2024.  The first part of South Korea’s planned two-part crypto regulation draft will come into force in July this&nbsp;year.  2024 is going to be a regulatory intense year for the crypto space in the US, with the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act setting the stage for stablecoin regulations in the&nbsp;country.  <p>Just weeks into 2024, the crypto world is already seeing major regulatory changes, with the most notable one being the US SEC’s approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs. That was just the tip of the iceberg, though, as a lot more is to come this year in areas like issuance, services, stablecoins, and oversight, with a strong focus on AML and KYC measures.</p><p>Emerging technologies such as DeFi, NFTs, and DAOs will also be under the regulatory lens, especially in Europe, Japan, and parts of Africa this year. So, what major crypto regulatory changes are we to expect from these areas in&nbsp;2024?</p> Europe <p>2024 will bring a wave of sweeping changes across the crypto landscape. The rollout of <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/mica-paving-the-way-from-liability-to-transparency">the Markets in Crypto Asset Regulation (MiCA)</a> in EU states is reshaping the scene, even influencing economic partners like Switzerland. As this unfolds, European regulators are joining forces, aiming to streamline how they categorize, monitor, and handle the tech side of crypto assets, creating a unified approach across the continent, with different types of crypto assets getting their own unique set of&nbsp;rules.</p> European Union <p>As a part of the Markets in Crypto Assets regulation rollout, the European Securities and Market Authority is <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/esmas-activities/digital-finance-and-innovation/markets-crypto-assets-regulation-mica">set to issue guidelines</a> on crypto asset categorization, market monitoring, and technological infrastructure standards. <a href="https://www.regulationtomorrow.com/eu/esma-encourages-smooth-transition-to-mica/">By June 30th, 2024</a>, EU states must decide on opting into the grandfathering scheme under MiCA, which permits crypto asset service providers to operate under national laws until MiCA authorization is obtained or&nbsp;denied.</p><p>This scenario could lead to varied regulatory approaches across Europe, which ESMA aims to harmonize. Furthermore, the Securities and Markets Stakeholder Group is <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-10/ESMA24-229244789-4595_SMSG_Advice_on_MiCA_package__1.pdf">advising ESMA</a> to ensure MiCA’s alignment with Decentralized Finance (DeFi) by the end of&nbsp;2024.</p> The United&nbsp;Kingdom <p><a href="https://decrypt.co/200289/uk-wont-be-copying-mica-crypto-parliamentary-group-chair">Instead of creating</a> a standalone regulatory framework like the EU’s MiCA, the UK plans to incorporate crypto activities into its existing financial services framework, necessitating crypto firms to comply with traditional banking regulations. The Financial Conduct Authority will offer guidance for crypto businesses <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/01/uk-crypto-firms-to-get-broad-laws-may-need-new-authorization/">requiring authorization</a> under this&nbsp;regime.</p><p>Different types of crypto assets, such as unique NFTs and already-regulated assets like security tokens, will also be distinctly regulated this year. Moreover, legislation to formalize this framework is anticipated in 2024, with transitional arrangements for businesses. As for stablecoins, the UK’s immediate regulatory emphasis is on fiat-backed ones used in payment systems, with legislation targeted for early 2024. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.taxjournal.com/articles/-it-would-be-premature-ineffective-for-the-uk-to-regulate-defi-activities-currently-says-treasury-#:~:text=the%20UK%20government%20does%20not,to%20regulate%20DeFi%20activities%20currently.">regulation of Decentralized Finance</a> remains under consideration.</p> Switzerland <p>Switzerland is implementing the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/tax/exchange-of-tax-information/crypto-asset-reporting-framework-and-amendments-to-the-common-reporting-standard.pdf">Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF)</a> this year, bringing digital assets under tax transparency regulations and necessitating due diligence on users by crypto service providers. Moreover, the Federal Department of Finance also plans to prepare a <a href="https://www.efd.admin.ch/efd/en/home/the-fdf/nsb-news_list.msg-id-98545.html">consultation draft for implementing these rules</a>, targeting completion by the end of June&nbsp;2024.</p> Asia Pacific&nbsp;(APAC) <p>Across the Asia Pacific region, governments and regulatory authorities are placing a heightened focus on strengthening the regulatory frameworks to ensure the security of digital assets and protect consumers. This includes the implementation of clear taxation policies for crypto assets, where profits from transactions are subject to taxation, and strict reporting requirements are imposed on crypto investors.</p><p>Governments are also emphasizing the importance of security and compliance, with regulations targeting anti-money laundering (AML), know-your-customer (KYC) procedures, and robust cybersecurity standards. Additionally, emerging technologies like DeFi, NFTs, and stablecoins are receiving regulatory attention, leading to the development of comprehensive policies and guidelines.</p> Japan <p>In 2024, Japan will continue its detailed approach to cryptocurrency regulation, focusing on consumer protection. This is in response to past breaches at Japanese exchanges, emphasizing the need for stringent security measures. We can also expect Japan to initiate <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/269200/japan-seeks-to-exempt-companies-from-tax-on-unrealized-crypto-gains-reports#:~:text=The%20Japanese%20government%20has%20approved,according%20to%20local%20media%20reports.">its much-anticipated tax policy reforms</a> to support the growth of crypto startups this&nbsp;year.</p> India <p>India is yet to finalize its approach to cryptocurrencies, with the anticipated cryptocurrency bill still pending since 2021. However, the Reserve Bank of India <a href="https://www.forbesindia.com/article/crypto-made-easy/rbi-ranks-crypto-near-the-bottom-of-systematic-risks-despite-harsh-criticism/77763/1">remains skeptical of cryptocurrencies</a> and instead favors CBDCs over other digital currencies, indicating no major regulatory changes in 2024. So, we are unlikely to see any major changes in terms of crypto regulations in India in&nbsp;2024.</p> South Korea <p>South Korea is working on a two-part crypto regulation framework for 2024. The first part, focusing on structuring the crypto market, will take effect in July 2024, whereas the second part, which is still under development, will establish rules for the issuance, listing, and delisting of cryptocurrencies. The country has also decided <a href="https://www.khan.co.kr/economy/finance/article/202401111541001">not to support crypto ETFs</a> and is considering <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/01/04/south-korea-regulator-seeks-ban-on-crypto-purchases-with-credit-cards/amp/">banning credit card purchases</a> of cryptocurrencies. Adding to this, <a href="https://crypto.news/south-korea-to-mandate-crypto-disclosure-for-5800-officials-in-2024/">both officials and companies</a> will need to start revealing their crypto holdings from next&nbsp;year.</p> Singapore <p>In 2024, the Monetary Authority of Singapore is set to focus on <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-23/singapore-plans-more-rules-to-curb-retail-crypto-speculation">reducing speculative trading</a> in cryptocurrencies, including the ban on cryptocurrency platforms offering incentives for trading. Moreover, starting in mid-2024, the use of Singapore credit cards to purchase digital payment tokens will <a href="https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/cryptocurrencies-digital-payment-token-credit-card-mas-2311461">no longer be&nbsp;allowed</a>.</p> Hong Kong <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Securities and Futures Commission <a href="https://apps.sfc.hk/edistributionWeb/gateway/EN/circular/doc?refNo=23EC67">are considering applications</a> for spot crypto ETFs and other virtual asset funds this year. It is expected to make significant progress in stablecoin regulation, too, with <a href="https://www.hkma.gov.hk/eng/news-and-media/insight/2023/12/20231227/">a consultation paper</a> already published seeking public feedback. The regulator also has plans to unveil <a href="https://www.hkma.gov.hk/eng/news-and-media/press-releases/2023/12/20231227-4/">a “sandbox” framework</a>, enabling market participants to engage directly with the regulatory environment in&nbsp;2024.</p> China <p>The People’s Bank of China recently <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/china-pboc-crypto-defi-stability-report">emphasized the need</a> for global crypto rules, maintaining its tough stance on cryptocurrencies. However, the country is pushing for <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/273492/china-forms-metaverse-working-group-with-huawei-tencent-ant-group-and-others#:~:text=China%20has%20formed%20a%20working,growth%20of%20the%20nascent%20industry.">standardization in the metaverse sector</a>, collaborating with tech giants and government representatives, and has <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/chinese-regulators-aim-to-disconnect-gaming-tokens-from-real-world-currency/#:~:text=Chinese%20authorities%20have%20proposed%20a,regulations%20for%20the%20gaming%20industry.">proposed a ban</a> on converting virtual gaming tokens to real-world assets this&nbsp;year.</p> Australia <p>Australia plans to advance its <a href="https://paymentexpert.com/2023/10/16/australia-new-crypto-regulations-2024/">crypto licensing framework in 2024</a>, introducing a regulatory framework covering licensing and custody rules for crypto asset providers. This legislation, once approved, will include a 12-month transitional period. The Treasury and Reserve Bank of Australia will also <a href="https://www.rba.gov.au/payments-and-infrastructure/central-bank-digital-currency/pdf/australian-cbdc-pilot-for-digital-finance-innovation-project-report.pdf">publish a joint report</a> on CBDC research this year, setting a roadmap for future&nbsp;work.</p> The Americas <p>Governments throughout the Americas are actively enhancing cryptocurrency regulations to address common concerns. They’re taking steps to combat issues like money laundering and fraud and safeguard investors.</p><p>A prominent focus is on regulating stablecoins, with measures to ensure that issuers maintain sufficient reserves and adhere to financial rules gaining traction.</p><p>Additionally, tax regulations concerning cryptocurrencies are being clarified, encompassing reporting requirements, capital gains taxes, and income tax obligations for crypto-related activities.</p> The United&nbsp;States <p>2024 in the US kicked off with the launch of <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-statement-spot-bitcoin-011023">the country’s first Spot Bitcoin ETF</a>. Yet, the SEC is maintaining its firm stance, not relenting in its rigorous crypto scrutiny. Laws for stablecoin issuers are also likely to emerge in 2024 following the House Financial Services Committee’s passage of <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4766/text">the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act</a>, which is currently awaiting consideration in the House of Representatives.</p><p>Another key focus for this year is <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN12223">the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act</a>, which could shift the crypto world from securities to commodities, with the CFTC taking the lead. Similarly, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4356/all-info">the bipartisan Responsible Financial Innovation Act</a> aims to classify most cryptos as commodities, shifting more responsibility to the CFTC and establishing stablecoin regulations.</p><p>Moreover, from January 2024, <a href="https://www.bdo.com/insights/tax/infrastructure-investment-and-jobs-act-contains-new-cryptocurrency-reporting-requirements">the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act</a> has been in effect, making it mandatory for entities to report crypto transactions over $10,000 to the IRS or face serious consequences. Lastly, the outcome of the US elections in November 2024 could significantly impact the crypto industry, as a crypto-friendly administration could bring much-needed clarity and legitimacy to the&nbsp;sector.</p> Canada <p>The Canadian Securities Administrator announced <a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/news/canadian-securities-regulators-seek-feedback-on-rules-for-public-investment-funds-holding-crypto-assets/">new regulations for public investment funds</a> in crypto assets in January this year, which is open for public feedback until April 17th, 2024. The new rule will permit only the non-redeemable and alternative investment funds to handle crypto transactions directly, requiring other mutual funds to invest through these entities. It also underlines that the crypto assets must also be fungible, insured, stored offline, and listed on a recognized Canadian exchange with an annual custodian review.</p> Brazil <p>In Brazil, policymakers are working to tighten crypto regulation and bring brokerages under stricter supervision in 2024. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazil-government-tax-income-financial-investments-obtained-abroad-2023-05-01/">newly enacted income tax regulations</a>, effective January 1st, 2024, impose up to 15% tax on individuals earning over $1,200 from foreign-based exchanges, aiming to generate $4 billion in tax revenue. Also, the Brazilian central bank’s digital currency, DREX, is in its testing phase until February 14th, 2024, with a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brazil-central-bank-names-digital-193619347.html">public launch</a> planned by year-end.</p> Colombia <p>Colombian lawmakers are drafting a <a href="https://bacsociety.com/en/new-bill-to-regulate-cryptocurrencies-in-colombia/">bill for comprehensive crypto regulation</a>, with collaboration between the crypto ecosystem and government bodies like the Central Bank and the Financial Superintendency. The bill, expected to be presented publicly this year, will undergo analysis by the Executive and then Congressional approval.</p> Argentina <p>This year, Argentinian President Javier Milei, a pro-Bitcoin advocate, aims to introduce crypto regulation aligned with the IMF’s anti-money laundering approach.</p><p>Milei’s draft bill, <a href="https://www.ambito.com/adjuntos/239/documentos/041/223/0041223294.pdf">the Law of Bases and Starting Points for the Freedom of Argentines</a> proposes favorable tax rates for declared domestic and foreign crypto holdings and legalizes their use. Tax rates start at 5% until March 2024, then increase to 10% through June, and 15% thereafter until September 2024.‍</p> Middle East &amp;&nbsp;Africa <p>In the Middle East and Africa, governments are attempting to strike a balance between nurturing the growth of digital finance and addressing regulatory challenges. This trend involves a focus on developing structured frameworks for cryptocurrencies, especially stablecoins, reflecting an awareness of their growing economic impact. However, there’s also an emphasis on enhancing anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism measures within the crypto&nbsp;sector.</p> The United Arab&nbsp;Emirates <p>​​This year, the UAE is on the brink of finalizing its stablecoin laws, with Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority leading the charge. VARA, the first of its kind in crypto supervision, <a href="https://www.pinsentmasons.com/out-law/news/dubais-move-oversee-stablecoins-bring-certainty-regulatory-grey-area">has revamped its virtual asset rulebook</a> to integrate regulations for fiat-referenced virtual assets (FRVAs), or stablecoins. These rules categorize cryptocurrencies, placing FRVAs in ‘category 1’. For stablecoin issuers, this means getting authorization and a license from VARA and adhering to its stringent regulations and the newly minted FRVA&nbsp;Rules.</p><p>The UAE’s Financial Services Regulatory Authority has also recently <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-uae">tweaked its AML and sanctions rules</a> in line with the FATF Travel Rule, specifically targeting provisions related to wire transfers in the digital asset&nbsp;realm.</p> Saudi Arabia <p>As of yet, Saudi Arabia does not have a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. The country has also banned banks from processing transactions related to crypto, while the Saudi Central Bank governor has <a href="https://saudigazette.com.sa/article/636735/SAUDI-ARABIA/SAMA-chief-warns-against-dangers-of-crypto-currencies">underscored the need</a> for adequate supervision, regulation, and coordination in virtual currency activities. Amidst this, SAMA has been experimenting through the launch of <a href="https://www.centralbank.ae/media/cbshgsmf/aber-report-2020-en.pdf">Project Aber</a>, a joint collaboration between SAMA and the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates (“CBUAE”), which explores CBDC for cross-border payments. Besides these developments that will continue this year, there’s not much happening on the regulatory front in&nbsp;Saudi.</p> South Africa <p>Last year, on October 22nd, South Africa began <a href="https://www.fsca.co.za/News%20Documents/FSCA%20Press%20Release_Declaration%20of%20Crypto%20Assets%20As%20A%20Financial%20Product_20%20October%202022.pdf">recognizing cryptocurrencies as a financial product</a> and made it <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/05/25/south-africas-crypto-firms-will-soon-need-to-apply-for-registration-or-face-a-heavy-fine/?_gl=1*1cr5fq9*_up*MQ..*_ga*NTE1NjY2NzkxLjE3MDU4MjY0MDI.*_ga_VM3STRYVN8*MTcwNTgyNjQwMS4xLjAuMTcwNTgyNjQwMS4wLjAuMA..">mandatory for all crypto exchanges</a> to secure operating licenses before the year ends. While the Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act currently governs them, crypto-related services will <a href="https://www.treasury.gov.za/public%20comments/2020%2010%2008%20CoFI%20Bill%20(version%20published%20for%20comment)%20(slightly%20updated).pdf">soon fall under the Conduct of Financial Institutions bill</a>, set to become law in the coming years. Additionally, with the Financial Action Task Force closely monitoring South Africa, 2024 will bring more robust anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing measures to the crypto sector, aiming to help the country exit the greylist by&nbsp;2025.</p> Nigeria <p>Nigeria, after lifting its <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigerian-central-bank-lifts-ban-crypto-trading-2023-12-23/">2021 crypto ban</a>, has set out <a href="https://www.cbn.gov.ng/Out/2024/FPRD/GUIDELINES%20ON%20OPERATIONS%20OF%20BANK%20ACCOUNTS%20FOR%20VIRTUAL%20Asset%20Providers.pdf">new rules for VASPs</a>, focusing on strong KYC and AML checks. However, Nigerian banks still can’t <a href="https://www.cbn.gov.ng/Out/2024/FPRD/GUIDELINES%20ON%20OPERATIONS%20OF%20BANK%20ACCOUNTS%20FOR%20VIRTUAL%20Asset%20Providers.pdf">trade or hold cryptocurrencies</a> themselves. At the same time, Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission is starting to handle license applications from crypto custodians and exchanges, showing a careful move towards more involvement in cryptocurrencies.</p> Kenya <p>After passing the <a href="https://kra.go.ke/images/publications/The-Finance-Act--2023.pdf">Finance Bill 2023</a> and signing it into law, Kenya is ready for a comprehensive digital asset regulatory framework covering tax integration and revenue guidelines. The local industry lobby group, the Blockchain Association of Kenya (BAK), is tasked with <a href="https://www.mariblock.com/kenyan-lawmakers-blockchain-association-draft-crypto-bill/">preparing the first draft</a> of a VASP bill referred to as the Crypto Bill by the National Assembly’s Departmental Committee on Finance and National Planning. With that, Kenya might become the first country where the industry’s representatives <a href="https://twitter.com/BlockchainKenya/status/1748641509069435244">develop</a> the regulatory framework for&nbsp;crypto.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>In 2024, we’re at a crossroads as far as global crypto regulations are concerned. Across the globe, from the European Union to the United States, governments are crafting new rules, influencing how the world perceives and uses cryptocurrencies in everyday&nbsp;life.</p><p>While each country’s approach varies, it’s crucial to ensure that the underlying intent remains consistent: safeguarding user experience and security. The decisions made this year will not only shape the immediate future of cryptocurrencies but will also lay the groundwork for their integration into the mainstream global financial ecosystem. So, this year will go down in history as a defining moment for the crypto industry, one that could determine its trajectory for the years to&nbsp;come.</p><p>______________________________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 22nd January to 4th&nbsp;February <p>Welcome to the latest edition of Veriscope Regulatory Recap! In today’s issue, we will cover the latest regulatory updates from all over the world from the last two weeks as we enter into the second month of&nbsp;2024.</p><p>As crypto adoption grows, regulatory developments, too, are getting ramped up with the US and Europe aiming for more clear guidelines. Meanwhile, in another part of the world, China remains unfriendly towards crypto while its special administrative region, Hong Kong, continues to provide regulatory guidelines in an attempt to become a crypto&nbsp;hub.</p><p>So, let’s take a deeper look into these regulatory advances being made around the globe and their impact on the crypto&nbsp;world.</p> The Global Landscape of Crypto Regulations <p>One of the major developments on the crypto regulatory front comes from the US, as American lawmakers are trying to delete the controversial accounting bulletin that imposes restrictions on companies for holding their customer’s crypto&nbsp;assets.</p><p>In Asia, Hong Kong is making major crypto regulatory moves, as it is planning to consult on the regulatory framework for over-the-counter crypto venues “very soon.” China, meanwhile, is amending its <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">anti-money laundering regulations</a> for the first time since 2007 to cover crypto-related transactions.</p><p>Similarly, in Europe, the European Securities and Markets Authorities, the securities regulatory authority of the 27-member union, is <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-01/ESMA75-453128700-52_MiCA_Consultation_Paper_-_Guidelines_on_the_qualification_of_crypto-assets_as_financial_instruments.pdf">seeking public feedback until April-end</a> to assess the criteria for classifying crypto as financial instruments.</p><p>With the proposed guidelines, the financial regulator aims to provide authorities and market participants with flexible conditions to determine whether a crypto asset can be categorized as a financial instrument, avoid having a one-size-fits-all approach, and ensure consistency across the&nbsp;region.</p> US Lawmakers Challenge the SEC on Crypto Custody&nbsp;Rule <p>Members of Congress, including Mike Flood (R-Neb.), Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), and Reps. Wiley Nickel (D-N.C.) has introduced resolutions to repeal the Securities and Exchange Commission’s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/oca/staff-accounting-bulletin-121">2022 staff accounting bulletin&nbsp;№121</a>.</p><p>The custody rule requires a company holding a client’s crypto assets to do so on its own balance sheet. This requires custodians holding crypto to maintain capital reserves to offset the risk, which could deter institutions and regulated banks from offering crypto custody&nbsp;options.</p><p>According to lawmakers behind the resolution, the legally binding directive was issued by the SEC without the required process of notice-and-comment, and hence, it must be repealed.</p> China to Introduce Revised Crypto AML&nbsp;Rules <p>Amid calls for more scrutiny, China is set to update its AML rules to cover cryptocurrency transactions. The revised rules are expected to go into effect in&nbsp;2025.</p><p>Late last month, Prime Minister Li Qiang conducted an executive meeting of the State Council to discuss the new draft of its AML regulations, including crypto provisions.</p><p>While the AML rule aims to curb illicit financial flows, it also acknowledges the ongoing engagement with cryptocurrencies despite official&nbsp;bans.</p><p>Speaking of crypto-focused AML regulations, China won’t be the first to implement the rule, as it has been adopted by other countries as well in the form of the FATF Travel Rule. For example, recently, the EU also <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/new-european-crypto-transfer-rules-in-2024">expanded its AML laws to cryptocurrencies</a>, requiring obliged entities to report on crypto transactions exceeding €1,000.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-shyft-perspective-global-crypto-regulatory-outlook-2024">The Shyft Perspective: Global Crypto Regulatory Outlook&nbsp;2024</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/ebas-amended-money-laundering-terrorist-financing-guidelines-explained">EBA’s Amended Money Laundering &amp; Terrorist Financing Guidelines Explained</a></p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>There’s been quite a buzz about Zero Trust in the last couple of years. Its genesis dates back to 2009, when the then Forrester Research analyst John Kindervag popularized the term when presenting the idea that an organization should not extend trust to anything inside or outside its perimeters. However, Zero Trust is still not a theme that resonates with all IT security experts. There are some who find it too fuzzy and non-deterministic, given that it is more akin to a philosophy or organizational strategy than a prescriptive certification that can be followed to the letter.</p>
<p>Zero Trust Principles – A Look Back in Time</p>
<p>We concluded that Zero Trust is firmly rooted in traditional well-established security design principles. We reached out to our Director of Product Security, Pali Surdhar, to get his view on Zero Trust. Pali forwarded a vintage document for our edification. The document “<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1011/R01/75-protection.pdf">The Protection of Information in Computer Systems</a>,” authored by Jerome H. Saltzer and Michael D. Schroeder, was published a mere 49 years ago in 1975. This was a time when computers were the preserve of universities, industry, and governments, and usually so big that they needed a large room to accommodate them. It was a time when Gates, Allen, Jobs, and Wozniak were just fledgling computer enthusiasts about to start their transformational journey in personal computing.</p>
<p>A quote from the abstract section of the paper gives a flavor of the content. “[this paper] examines in depth the principles of modern protection architectures and the relation between capability systems and access control list systems, and ends with a brief analysis of protected subsystems and protected objects.”</p>
<p>Security Principles Circa 1975</p>
<p>The paper then introduces three security categories:</p>
 
 Unauthorized information release 
 Unauthorized information modification 
 Unauthorized denial of use 
 
<p>These terms still resonate, although today we’d probably describe them as data breach, code hacking, and finally, Denial of Service, or perhaps a ransomware attack, where a bad actor has taken measures to lock out the authorized user.</p>
<p>The paper then provides examples of security techniques sometimes applied to computer systems. We thought it would be worthwhile translating into today’s cybersecurity terminology.</p>



Security Techniques&nbsp; – 1975
Today’s Security Terminology
Aligned with a Zero Trust Principle?




Labeling files with lists of authorized users
Access Control List – defines who has access to a system or application. Authorization and authentication could apply here too.
Yes


Verifying the identity of a prospective user by demanding a password
Password verification or even passwordless MFA
Yes


Shielding the computer to prevent interception and subsequent interpretation of electromagnetic radiation
Side channel attacks. Typically require an antenna or probe within close proximity of a device to eavesdrop by analyzing electromagnetic signals.
N/A


Enciphering information sent over telephone lines
Encryption, probably using TLS or similar. Refer to our last blog post <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/11/harvest-now-decrypt-later-fact-or-fiction/">Harvest Now, Decrypt Later – Fact or Fiction</a> for more information.
Yes


Locking the room containing the computer
Access control, defense in depth, secure room/vault, etc. These security measures are all still in use today.
Yes


Controlling who is allowed to make changes to the computer system (both its hardware and software)
Least privilege principle – only giving access to those who have the correct clearance and need access to the system
Yes


Using redundant circuits or programmed cross-checks that maintain security in the face of hardware or software failures
High availability would typically be used today with hardware devices having a backup device ready to continue service should a failure occur. Software can be designed with similar fault tolerance.
N/A


Certifying that the hardware and software are actually implemented as intended
In today’s IT environment this would involve a combination of internal quality assurance, security testing, and approval of hardware or software design. In addition, the code or hardware could be submitted to a third party for penetration testing and product certification against industry standards such as FIPS 140-2/3 or PCI DSS. Given today’s complex software and hardware systems, knowing the provenance of the components is essential. This is achieved through bills of materials, code signing, and security processors in hardware.
Yes



<p>So while the language used is reflective of the time it was written, we think you’ll agree that most of the ideas conveyed are security principles that equally apply in today’s modern distributed architectures.</p>
<p>NIST, CSA, and the CIA Triad</p>
<p>For those not inclined to read the 59-page NIST <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf">SP 800-207</a> document, here are the seven core tenets of Zero Trust.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Building on the NIST publication, the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) has recently published its <a href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/zero-trust-guiding-principles/">Zero Trust Guiding Principles</a>. For anyone who wants to get up the learning curve on Zero Trust without digging too much into the weeds, it is an excellent read. It is also reassuring that the CSA Zero Trust Working Group are of the same opinion as us:</p>
<p>“Zero Trust is a collection of long-standing principles applied in a way that aligns the security architecture with the way we work and live.“</p>
<p>The CSA document then provides a list of the security principles critical to the success of your Zero Trust effort:</p>
 
 Concept of least-privilege access controls (e.g., preventative) 
 Separation of duties (e.g., preventative) 
 Segmentation/micro-segmentation (e.g., preventative) 
 Logging and monitoring (e.g., detective) 
 Configuration drift remediation (e.g., corrective/reactive) 
 
<p>While the term Zero Trust was coined by Kindervag 34 years after the Saltzer &amp; Schroeder paper, we think you’ll agree that many of those principles align with the 1975 document.</p>
<p>And while things have certainly changed since 1975, when computers were monolithic and had limited networking capabilities (think remote users connecting in from terminals), the concerns about security were the same: protecting confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. Hopefully most of you will be familiar with the CIA triad, another cybersecurity fundamental.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Unchanging Need for Robust Security</p>
<p>Today, while the concerns remain the same, the complexity of compute environments has greatly increased. For example, in current environments, systems can be spread out across multiple clouds, software systems consist of many microservices, and data resides everywhere, just to name a few of the complexities. Additionally, today’s users not only consist of internal computer users sitting at their desks with directly connected terminals, but also potentially anyone, anywhere on the planet, accessing these complex systems via the internet.</p>
<p>The problem, and the strategy to mitigate the problem, have remained somewhat unchanged over the years. It is just the scale of the problem that has changed. Saltzer and Schroeder knew that the identity of a user needed to be established. They specified using a password for this. At the time with the limited access (no wide area network) this was sufficient. Today users (and adversaries) can access systems from anywhere. This makes establishing identity require something more than a strong password.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while Saltzer and Schroeder talked about locking their 1970s computer room (i.e., protecting the perimeter), they recognized that wasn’t in itself sufficient. In today’s world of distributed users and a multitude of devices wanting access, those physical walls have been replaced by a virtual perimeter, making it even harder to protect and further emphasizing the need for alternative approaches. Zero Trust therefore does not focus on perimeter defense, but instead advocates for strong identity (never trust, always verify) and micro-segmentation (to avoid lateral movement through the network). Sometimes what’s old is new, and that is because we have had a good thing all along.</p>

 Towards multivalent currencies, bioregional monetary stewardship and a distributed global reserve&nbsp;currency <p>In this third blog of a 4-part series we are sharing a speculative future scenario based around a network of distributed bioregional banks. The blog series is centred on the following enquiries and this reflection aims to address question&nbsp;three.</p>  What are the issues that make money (and our dominant monetary systems) so problematic? (Please see <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-dac459dc844e">Blog&nbsp;1</a>)  Can we use design principles to help us imagine desirable future scenarios? (Please see <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-38ed3849395f">Blog&nbsp;2</a>)  What could a desirable future scenario actually look&nbsp;like?  What can we start building and testing now to begin scaffolding a parallel system? (Please see <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-0360c0709087">Blog&nbsp;4</a>)   Part 3 (of 4): Imagining the distributed, bioregional banks of the&nbsp;future <p>In the previous two blogs we have been exploring monetary challenges and proposing some design principles that could underpin a response. In this post we are shifting to a more creative and imaginative space. The future is unlikely to unfold in a form that we can cognitively envision. If we accept that position then it might feel pointless to engage with imaginative scenarios or foresight exercises. On the other hand, it can be interesting to form a series of working hypotheses (or perhaps stories of change) that we can use as testing grounds for our current thinking. From there, we hope to move to a space of creative vulnerability where we dare to bring some of those thought experiments to life. It is highly likely that some of the ideas presented below won’t work. It is also likely that we will learn something important from each iteration, as we continually loop between what we can understand now and the edges of our potential.</p><p>This speculative proposition is centred on the idea of a series of distributed, bioregional banks. However, these next generation institutions will bear little resemblance to our current conception of a bank. In essence they will be stewardship interfaces that exist in service of the regenerative potential of their base region. When linked together via contextually respectful exchange rates they will realign our economic systems in service of planetary vitality. Ultimately the aspiration would be to create a new global reserve currency which itself is regenerative and decolonised by&nbsp;design.</p><p>What if a distributed bioregional bank actually&nbsp;existed?</p><p>It’s easy to find fault with our current banking system but what would we propose as an alternative? What would these distributed institutions actually do? Who would be involved and in what capacity? As a starting point to open this conversation up, we have been thinking about three stewardship functions that could be part of the remit of these next generation banks. We are framing these ideas as a story that is unfolding to try and illustrate how it might feel to interact with these future&nbsp;banks.</p>Image: Dark Matter&nbsp;Labs¹<blockquote>1. Multivalent currencies</blockquote><p>The future banks will be part of a vibrant ecosystem of decentralised multivalent currencies. The issuance and use of these diverse, infinite and resource-backed tokens will build a dynamic understanding of the integrity of the ecosystem as a whole. The key functions of the tokens will be fourfold:</p>  To demonstrate invisible or overlooked value&nbsp;flows;  To gather sensory inputs from different elements of the ecosystem;  To account for individual and collective contributions to the ecosystem’s health;  To form the basis for the overall RegenCoin for the bioregion.  <p>To illustrate how this might work we can use the example of a river printing its own solidarity tokens. People will receive river tokens in recognition of acts of care provided to the river. This might take the form of collecting rubbish from the river banks, introducing children to the joy of wild swimming or reducing the level of pesticides flowing into the water. Initially the system might be overseen by human guardians who vouch for such actions and communicate them to the Bank. As technologies are refined for this new way of living, a time will come where the river will be able to issue and destroy its own tokens via multi-sensory inputs.</p><p>The motivations for people to value the river tokens will be diverse. In the early days, it might be linked to respect and peer approval. Later, the tokens might become part of a blended measure of contribution that forms the overall currency for the&nbsp;region.</p><blockquote>2. Contextually respectful exchange</blockquote><p>The bank will provide a monetary stewardship function that will restrict the conversion of base assets into convertible tokens so that they align with the regenerative rhythms of the bioregion. For&nbsp;example:</p>  The Bank could regulate the sales of finite elements both within and outside of the bioregion.  The Bank could restrict the issuance of new debt to align with the underlying regenerative health of the region. Different types of debt could be issued that could only be used to buy or invest into specific classes of living agents (‘assets’ in today’s terminology). For example, on aggregate the bank would only issue debt for lumber processing activities that were forecast to be at a regenerative level for the region’s forests over the term of the&nbsp;loan.  The bank could designate taxes to be paid in a mix of specified tokens. This mix could be rebalanced periodically to incentivise the behaviours which are optimal for the fluid health of the ecosystem.  <blockquote>3. Probabilistic, participatory governance models</blockquote><p>The Bank’s governance systems will be based on Bayesian inference models. This is a form of dynamic statistical modelling that allows an initial set of assumptions to continually update depending on the information it receives. Critically, the output will be a blended result combining automatic sensory data inputs with the emotional values of the living community. For example, if a community upregulates the importance of river health then the overall value of the RegenCoin would fall if other activities were negatively impacting it.</p><p>These future bank activities can feel a bit flat and detached without a contextual grounding. One idea to bring them to life is to imagine how they could play out under different scenarios. We are suggesting two examples below and would be very curious to hear other ideas or interpretations:</p>  A house owner gifts their property back to nature: in this example a resident of the Bioregion decides that the area where their house has been built should be re-wilded in the interests of the bioregion’s health. When the resident nullifies their previous ownership rights, it will trigger a series of sensory credits to their RegenWallet. The regenerative generosity of the act will be upregulated by human and more-than-human voices. The result will be an amount of newly created RegenCoin being available to build a house in a more sensitive location.  A company tries to game the system to create rights over carbon credits: in this more negative example, we can imagine that a profit seeking company might want to manipulate the system for private gains. Their strategy might be to plant a dense area of trees to maximise their carbon credibility. However, as the sensory inputs are invisible, they would not know how their choice of tree species or location would be valued by the soil, pollinators or the trees themselves. In seeking to generate profits rather than regenerative potential they might in fact generate a negative&nbsp;return.  <p>Sitting in front of a computer in 2024, the scenario that we have outlined above might seem far fetched. If you take a deep breath, soften your gaze and meditate for a second on the extraordinary, complex beauty of life, perhaps it feels a little less fanciful. So much of the living world is beyond our cognitive understanding but entirely open to our sensory perception. To us this feels like both an invitation and a call to action. We already have the technological power of gods and we can choose to direct it in service of life. Grounding this aspiration in a practical context is the next important step in this journey. In our <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-0360c0709087">final blog</a> we will therefore begin exploring tangible elements of the scenario that we can start to build and test&nbsp;now.</p><p>We are incredibly heartened and grateful for all the messages that we have received so far in response to these blogs.

<p></p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>Hi, I am Rob MacDonald, vice president of product marketing here at 1Kosmos, and today I’m joined by Huzefa, co-founder and COO of 1Kosmos. How are you doing today Huzefa?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>I am doing great, Rob. It’s a Friday, so never better.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>It’s Friday, you’re in New Jersey, I heard it snowed a little bit this week, I hope you’re keeping warm.</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>When you talk about snow, you’re in Canada, so I cannot talk to you about snow. We got a little bit of a sprinkling, that’s it.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>Fair enough. All right, well listen, today, thanks for joining us, or joining me. We just made a recent announcement of a new integration partner, Amazon Cognito. So, before we talk about all the goodness of what we’re doing with Cognito, why don’t you tell me a little bit about what it is? What is Cognito?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>So, Cognito is a single sign-on platform, an IdP provider that Amazon Web Services provides, especially if you are building your applications on the AWS platform, this is the native integration that the AWS provides out of the box. So, Cognito is widely used across applications, individual applications that may be developed and have their own ecosystems within the AWS network.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>Cool. So, interesting. Where is AWS deployed within an organization? So, you said it’s an IdP, I think everybody that’s probably listening to these understands what an IdP is, but where do you typically find it? Because, when we think workforce in particular, there’s Okta and Microsoft and ForgeRock and Ping. Where’s Cognito, where do you find that?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>They primarily operate in the customer identity and access management or CIAM space today. So, they have not published essentially their numbers of their deployment, but it’s pretty vastly adopted. So, any kind of a public facing application which is hosted on AWS application, and if they would not have a custom integration to be done on Okta or Microsoft, Amazon says, here you go, you can use AWS Cognito.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>So, the primary use case for this would be a CIAM type of initiative, somebody’s put some application on AWS, and then this is the identity management portion of that application, is that what I understood?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>Makes sense. So, what motivated either 1Kosmos to partner with AWS or AWS to partner with 1Kosmos? How did that come to be?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>So, identity is our motivation. We’ve made some significant deployments in the CIAM space recently. 2023 has been a great year for us in that particular sense. And our customers were essentially looking for, hey, do you have these integrations with AWS Cognito that you provide out of box? Their footprint is pretty vast, which I got to know. And that has led to us building this integration with them and providing a more out of box solution with them as well.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>So, that’s amazing. Everybody knows AWS, everybody knows Amazon, and it’s cool to know that they’re doing this part of their business as well. So, we are now considered an AWS advanced technology partner. So, what specifically does that mean?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>So, our integration today with AWS is around us being a strong authentication for them. Meaning, if you need to do either multifactor authentication, if you want to do passwordless, if you want to have passkeys that you can deploy on your application that is supported by AWS Cognito, here you go. We are the partner of choice that you can go to. So, it’s pretty significant because most of the applications are now being mandated from a compliance standpoint that, hey, you need to have either Strong MFA or support passwordless passkeys in your application deployment stack, and that’s where our integration with AWS Cognito becomes extremely important. I just wanted to add that we want to continue this particular integration and develop further stories, more on the other sides of pieces that we have, identity proofing and better public mentions, but that is more in the future for us.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>So, based on what I’ve read on the Amazon Cognito site, they have more of these advanced technology partners. It looks like organizations that are aligned to that have gone through some sort of testing, is that correct? By Amazon?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>Yeah, integration as well as testing. So, while anything that we’ve done with AWS, it goes through significant scrutiny and review. So, even this particular integration that we put together, we had to document it. The entire GitHub of this particular technical integration is available. It is referenced in a blog that is published by the AWS community that goes out to anybody, the AWS customer. You can essentially go back and look at it. There are references to the GitHub link as well and what that integration is. But, anyway, all of this was not put together by us. We provided the integration story, but it was reviewed through multiple different channels and reviews. I cannot even recall how many by AWS and published by them.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>Well, that’s amazing. So, somebody looking at adding our technology into that stack can be pretty much rest assured that it’s been tested by Amazon to make sure that it works with their technology, and that the integration and implementation of us with Cognito would be seamless.</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>Absolutely. So, if you’re a developer, if you’re watching this, if you have AWS Cognito, feel free to look at the blog. Maybe we can reference it into the link as well when we post this. But, it’s pretty simple, straightforward. You would essentially put a custom auth plugin with 1Kosmos, and there you go. You’ll be able to provide strong MFA or passwordless authentication to your end customers.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>Awesome. We take user experience pretty seriously here at 1Kosmos. I guess, I’m sure you would agree with me on that. Everything we do revolves around that and basically privacy. But, it’s commonly known that users will go elsewhere if it’s too hard, if what they came to do wasn’t easy. How does 1Kosmos help Cognito users provide a better experience when they’re dealing with their end users?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>Absolutely. So, when the experience is, and I always want to highlight that there are two experiences. One is the strong MFA, because we believe in the story of you don’t have to completely take your organization from password to passwordless from day one to day two. You may have a transition period, so strong MFA becomes important. So, we have factored that experience in the entire channel where you can authenticate in Cognito, and then there’s a dialogue box that opens up, which essentially factors in what 1Kosmos provides to you, as any of the strong MFA options that you may have, push notifications, OTP, TOTP, et cetera. For our passwordless and passkeys, we provide an SDK, which again, from an end user standpoint, it seems seamless for them, where all they’re doing is entering their username, their backend API calls that we’re available, that contact 1Kosmos console or gateway that we have, and then we provide, we essentially see if this particular authentication is valid and give the signals back to AWS.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>Listen, I think it’s amazing. So, when we look at Amazon Cognito customers, we touched on it earlier, but how easy, or a developer, how easy is it for developers to deploy 1Kosmos into a Cognito instance?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>So, like I said, you can sign up for a 1Kosmos instance by going to a developer environment. If you have a Cognito instance, you can sign up for a free account for Cognito as well. That is available on the AWS site. There are instructions to develop a custom auth plugin. And on that particular blog we also highlight, and the GitHub repository, what are the steps that you need to essentially use to integrate AWS Cognito with 1Kosmos.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>So, then as a follow on to that question, that obviously sounds relatively easy. How would customers acquire an instance of BlockID? So, it’s like, I like it, I installed it at work, and the testing developer did all the great work. How do I then pay for the instance that I chose?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>We want to make the entire experience easy. So, if you’re a customer in the AWS ecosystem, we are listed on the AWS Marketplace. We have three distinct product lines that are available. So, you can choose any one of them. Most likely it will be around BlockID customer or verify. And you can sign up for the product through AWS Marketplace. You would get your instance, your license keys, et cetera, through that particular portal and you’ll be ready to go.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>That’s cool. Listen, Huzefa, I know that you’re super busy as always, and I wanted to thank you for taking the time today to sit down and tell us about this exciting announcement that we made this week. And I wish you the best, and I hope you come back and talk to me again on a vlog soon.</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>Look forward to it, Robert. Thank you.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>So, listen, if you want to find out more about this integration, you can check out our website. We’ve got a data sheet and a press release there that you can go take a read and learn more about this Cognito integration. And then, plus, as Huzefa mentioned earlier, there’s a Amazon Cognito blog that you can read as well. We’ll put the links to all of those down below. Thanks again everybody. We’ll see you again shortly.</p>

<p>In 2024, our product vision is to continue delivering solutions that empower not only issuers, but all ecosystem participants in the tokenization journey to&nbsp;cultivate liquidity and accumulate more users.&nbsp;In our view, to achieve the liquidity endgame, we have to build it up through a few phases: standardization, digitalization, collateralization, distribution, and then reach the liquid secondary market.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>Below, I’ll explain how we are turning our product vision into actionable steps to address your technical and operational pain points, smoothly transitioning to new phases, and adding value and services, all while improving liquidity for your investors.</p>
<p>Accelerating standardization phase:&nbsp;The industry now embraces the official token standard ERC-3643 for compliant tokenization. We’re working closely with the ERC3643 Association to swiftly advance standardization. Our focus includes developing key tools like the ERC-3643 DApp, streamlining the effortless deployment and management of ERC3643 tokens, and setting a new benchmark for simplicity in compliant tokenization.</p>
<p>Digitizing real-world assets and securities en masse:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Speeding up time to market:&nbsp;While our contributions to standardization are open-source, the value of Tokeny’s solutions extends beyond smart contract deployment (<a href="https://tokeny.com/what-should-you-expect-from-a-tokenization-platform-in-2024/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8RUs4gACQdk6BbN54jHVqFm74aEPuPDEGCyaq_EE5yfATnaaA2o47yqsavBstKBZv9NvI7">more details here</a>). We are committed to enhancing our APIs and white-label SaaS solutions. Tailored products for diverse segments, ranging from asset managers to Web3 RWA projects, are in development to catalyze the RWA wave and advance the asset digitization phase.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Delivering immediate benefits:&nbsp;Accelerating towards liquidity begins with addressing immediate pain points for institutions. Why tokenize now? It’s all about enhancing operational efficiency and streamlining processes with 3rd parties applications, to slash costs. By solving these points, we can set the stage for bringing enormous high-quality assets on-chain, laying the foundation for the critical mass needed for advanced services, and emphasizing transferability, reach, and liquidity.</p>
 
 Improved operational efficiency:&nbsp;Manual, human-based processes are not just time-consuming but also costly. And it is a common challenge across the entire private market. To tackle this, we’re developing features and smart contracts for various business cases, automating workflows from onboarding, and corporate actions, to secondary tradings. Automation increases operational capability, empowering institutions to reach a larger investor base. 
 Bridging 3rd party digital applications:&nbsp;Another notable challenge arises from the fragmented collaboration between various applications, each operated by different third parties. The multitude of digital applications involved in operations can create gaps when assets are brought on-chain. To address this, our products will continue to connect these disparate solutions, ensuring a cohesive operational workflow between tokenized assets and the involved providers. 
 
<p>3.&nbsp;The powerhouse for major corporations:&nbsp;Our strategy revolves around seamless integration into legacy systems and forming partnerships with tech providers, such as custody solutions, integrators, and financial platforms. Through strategic ecosystem integrations, we empower partners to seamlessly utilize our engine, allowing them to concentrate on their core business and sales while we manage all technical aspects.</p>
<p>Enabling DeFi by building a common data set for private markets:&nbsp;Initiated by accelerating permissioned DeFi, this month, we co-developed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.erc3643.org/news/erc-3643-association-members-developed-open-source-ui-components-to-bridge-defi-and-regulated-rwa?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8RUs4gACQdk6BbN54jHVqFm74aEPuPDEGCyaq_EE5yfATnaaA2o47yqsavBstKBZv9NvI7">an open-source UI component</a>&nbsp;with Dev.Pro. With this tool, DeFi is now equipped for regulated assets through ERC-3643, enabling any decentralized exchanges (DEX), automated market makers (AMMs), or lending protocol to provide compliant liquidity or collateralization for tokenized securities and RWA. Regulated entities can even launch their lending smart contracts. Our next move involves building a universal data set for tokenized securities through a product named AssetID, facilitating easy access to verifiable asset data for DeFi applications.</p>
<p>Building the distribution rails: DINO is an interoperable distribution network for digital securities that leverages the ERC-3643 standard. Our commitment to growth extends to integrating additional distribution channels into the DINO ecosystem. Compatibility with centralized exchanges (CEX) and AMMs is seamlessly established on our platform. As we eagerly await more DeFi protocols, the open-source UI component stands ready to welcome them. Think of us as a connector, ensuring a seamless convergence of all distribution rails on our platform.</p>
<p>Secondary market innovation:&nbsp;We will unveil an upgraded version of the Billboard, serving as a license-exempted P2P secondary market solution, enabling investors to seamlessly publish buy or sell intentions, just like placing an ad. Taking it a step further, we will introduce a fully decentralized version of the Billboard, entirely powered by smart contracts. This will allow counterparts to accept an offer directly on-chain, facilitating a peer-to-peer transaction. The offer can circulate across the entire distribution network, visible to all, but only eligible investors for the concerned tokens can accept it.</p>
<p>Exciting times lie ahead, and we look forward to embarking on this journey with you. Stay tuned for more developments throughout the year.</p>

 We can afford what we can actually do — 3 <p>Increasing financial constraints mean families, organisations and Governments are spending less money on the things they want and need, generating a doom spiral of decline. We need to find ways to <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/we-can-afford-what-we-can-actually-do-1-efdca9835617">expand what we can actually do</a> outside of the straitjacket of ‘we can only do what we can afford’. This third blog in a three part series, looks at how we at Mydex are working to expand what we as communities and as a society can actually&nbsp;do..</p><p>In <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/we-can-afford-what-we-can-actually-do-2-96213dd4d546">the second blog</a> in this series we looked at eight interconnected ways of expanding ‘what we can actually do’. They&nbsp;were:</p>  think capabilities (not just targets);  think genuine productivity (not just cuts and savings);  think mutual self help (to escape dependencies on external funders);  think clubs and communities (which provide agency, and not just markets and states, which take it&nbsp;away);  think institutional innovation (not just working within existing institutional constraints);  think genuine investment (and not just financial extraction);  think demonetisation (all the things we can do without money having to change hands);&nbsp;and  think Fair Process (because that’s the best way to do all the&nbsp;above).  <p>Here is how the work we (Mydex) are doing fits this&nbsp;agenda.</p> Think capabilities <p>Mydex’s data sharing platforms are a new form of infrastructure whose whole purpose is to expand what we can actually do with data. This includes expanding what we can do with the data itself (especially in terms of productivity) and, therefore, what we can actually do in terms of the services that this data makes possible. New data capabilities are all about expanding people and organisations’ ability to actually do&nbsp;stuff.</p> Think genuine productivity <p>In our work we enable safe, efficient data sharing and reuse so that the right people and organisations can access and use the right, reliable data at the right times. As our White Paper on the <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/Hidden_in_Plain_Sight_The_Surprising_Economics_of_Personal_Data/hidden-in-plain-sight-the-surprising-economics-of-personal-data-mydex-2022.pdf">Surprising Economics of Personal Data</a> shows, this cuts a huge amount of FERC (Friction, Effort, Risk and Cost) out of existing processes, enabling people and organisation to do a lot more with the same resources. Everything we do is about enhancing genuine productivity.</p> Think mutual self&nbsp;help <p>Right now, a lot of the work we are doing is in what we call health and care ‘clusters’. This is where many different people and organisations all come together to better address a particular group of peoples’ particular needs. These clusters are a form of mutual self help in practice: different people and organisations coming together to share data and coordinate activities in order to help each other to produce better outcomes.</p> Think clubs and communities <p>The clusters we are working within in health and care are a form of club where everybody contributes their bit and everyone gets their share of the benefits. In addition, we have built an entire platform called Inclued to enable the data sharing that helps people share data and coordinate activities in mutually supportive communities.</p> Think institutional innovation <p>Mydex is a Community Interest Company. Yes, we make and spend money like every other organisation, because we live in a world constrained by ‘we can only do what we can afford’. But we don’t do what we do to make money out of it. We make money in order to invest it in our purpose: to advance the community’s interest when it comes to personal data. Everything about our legal form is designed to ensure this happens. CICs are a continuation of the long tradition of institutional innovation we referred to in the second blog of this series&nbsp;[LINK].</p> Think genuine investment <p>Mydex exists because, thankfully, some genuine investors still exist (as opposed to multiple ‘investor’ saboteurs who are only interested in financial extraction). We wish there were more genuine investors and fewer saboteurs!</p> Think demonetisation <p>One of the things that perplex people about Mydex data platforms is that no money changes hands for data. We are not building a market for data. We enable non-monetised data sharing for mutual benefit. That doesn’t mean it isn’t economically valuable or doesn’t make economic sense. Quite the opposite. Non-monetised data sharing unleashes enormous personal, social and economic value because of the productivity gains it unleashes and the opportunities for innovation it creates. In demonetising data, we are helping to demonetise genuine wealth creation.</p> Think Fair&nbsp;Process <p>Everything about Mydex as infrastructure and as an institution is organised around one thing: giving individuals a real say over how their data is used. Because this data is used to provide most services, this extends to giving people a say in how the services they used are organised and delivered. At one level, personal data stores are a technical solution to a technical data problem. But they are a lot more than that. They are also <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/a-human-rights-based-approach-to-personal-data-566f4e4a8cb4">engines of human&nbsp;rights</a>.</p> Conclusion <p>Throughout their history humans have wrestled with the paradox of having to work within constraints they are confronted with and cannot avoid while also working out ways to lift these constraints.</p><p>Today, increasingly harsh constraints of ‘we can only do what we can afford’ are closing down options for families, organisations and Governments, tipping them into a spiral of decline. That can only mean one thing: the quest to lift those constraints — of finding ways to expand what we can actually do — it also growing in importance as every day goes by. It’s the responsibility of all of us — no matter what circumstances we find ourselves in and no matter what level of responsibility or authority —to look for ways break out of the straitjacket of ‘we can only do what we can afford’ and to find ways to expand ‘what we can actually&nbsp;do’.</p><p>This is our quest. We hope you will join us in pursuing&nbsp;it.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/increasing-financial-constraints-mean-families-organisations-and-governments-are-spending-less-e34ffc932dc4">Increasing financial constraints mean families, organisations and Governments are spending less…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Stakers can claim DF74 rewards. DF75 runs Feb 1 — Feb 8,&nbsp;2024  1. Overview <p>Ocean Data Farming (DF) is Ocean’s incentives program. In DF, you can earn OCEAN rewards by locking OCEAN, curating data, and making predictions (in Predictoor). <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">Here are DF&nbsp;docs</a>.</p><p>Data Farming Round 74 (DF74) has completed. 150K OCEAN + 20K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am Jan 25, 2024 and ended 12:01 am Feb 1. You can claim rewards at the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards"> DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF75 is live today, Feb 1. It concludes on Feb 8. 150K OCEAN and 20K ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF75   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF75 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

				  The Indicio Proven® Mobile SDK unlocks the power of verifiable identity and data by giving developers an easy way to build apps with digital wallets and add the features they need to deploy decentralized identity solutions.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>SEATTLE, January 31, 2024/ — Mobile app developers now have a simple and powerful way to add&nbsp; digital wallet functionality to their applications. The new <a href="https://indicio.tech/mobile-software-development-kit/">Indicio Proven® Mobile SDK</a> provides packages for Swift, Kotlin, and React Native that are all compiled from a single code base, making it easy to develop apps for both iOS and Android.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital wallets support receiving, holding, and sharing verifiable credentials, which enable people, organizations, and IoT devices to prove their identity and share verifiable data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Indicio Proven Mobile SDK solves a major blocker to deploying decentralized identity and verifiable identity, namely, the lack of a single source for all the code needed to build customized apps with interoperable digital wallets. Your developers can now bring decentralized identity to your applications without having to learn new programming languages or practices, or having to develop complicated, multi-app workflows.</p>
<p>At launch, the open-source protocols and standards the Indicio Proven Mobile SDK supports include DIDComm V1.0, DID:Peer:1 and DID:Peer:2 and AnonCreds. Future updates will add decentralized ecosystem governance (DEGov), JSON-LD and SD-JWT credential types, and OID4VC, providing interoperability with the European Union’s Digital Identity Wallet standards. Indicio is committed to enabling interoperability with all major cross border projects.</p>
<p>“Our SDK is the biggest advancement in digital identity wallet technology to date,” said Heather Dahl, CEO, Indicio. “We’ve eliminated the complexity of having to cobble together code written in different languages from multiple libraries and delivered a single source for integrated innovation with comprehensive functionality and interoperability — all based on well-tested code. Everything’s in one place for you to start building, save time, save money, and deliver the killer features your customers want in your products.”</p>
<p>Apps created using the Indicio Proven Mobile SDK also work with <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Indicio Proven®</a>, Indicio’s complete out-of-the-box product for issuing and verifying wallet data. Indicio Proven accelerates the speed and accuracy for making vital business decisions with its simple software that is easy to implement and can be added onto existing systems and infrastructure, removing inefficient, frustrating paper-based processes and creating better digital experiences for end users and customers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>METAR scores are made in every airport, every hour of the day. Can you predict the next few hours with the highest accuracy?</p><p>2024 marks the 3rd year of the Ocean Protocol Data Challenge Program initiative. ‘Aviation Weather Forecasting Using METAR Data’ is the second data challenge in 2024, and the second opportunity to score points in the <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/earn/data-challenges/">Championship Leaderboard</a> for this season. The challenge launches today Feb 1, 2024, with a deadline to participate ending Feb 20, 2024, 23:59:59 UTC. Access to the challenge description and submission guidelines can be found on the <a href="https://desights.ai/challenge/18">Desights</a> platform.</p><p>The dataset used for the ‘Aviation Weather Forecasting Using METAR Data’ challenge holds METAR scores that update every hour of every day. at KPIM Miami International Airport. We will only use 1 airport for this data challenge, though METAR is a standard score updated at each airport. The data we use for this challenge is Miami's historical METAR logs from 2014–2023. Recognizing the symmetrical data structure of METAR as a metric, models developed in this challenge will be able to be run in real-time for 1–12hr ahead of present-time predictions for METAR score. This is a unique opportunity for data people to dive into real-world data and uncover insights that could shape the future of aviation safety, understanding, airline efficiency, and pilots driving&nbsp;planes.</p> Challenge Overview <p>Objective: Building upon the insights gained from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), participants in this data science competition will venture into hands-on, real-world artificial intelligence (AI) &amp; machine learning (ML). Their primary objective is to develop advanced models that accurately predict future weather conditions at KMIA (Miami Airport). These AI/ML models become invaluable tools for aviation operations and safety by harnessing the extensive historical METAR&nbsp;data.</p><p>Data Set: Access to the dataset of historical METAR data points is available to download from the Ocean Market via the Mumbai Test Network (Polygon Testnet), and via Polygon Mainnet. You can download the dataset directly through <a href="https://bit.ly/3SONYvf">Desights</a>.</p><p>Machine Learning Model: Participants have free reign to attack their model selection based on their own preferences. Some ideas for Python native ML to include ARIMA/SARIMA using 'statsmodels', LSTM(Long Short-Term Memory) Networks using TensorFlow or Keras, Random Forest Regression using scikit-learn, or Gradient Boosting Machines using XGBoost. When implementing these models, you’ll typically start by preprocessing your time series data (e.g., normalization, choosing model weights, etc.), followed by feature engineering (like extracting time components and creating lag features). After that, you can train your model, tune its parameters, and validate its performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, or MAPE and pursue the most accurate METAR prediction.</p><p>It’s also a good practice to perform cross-validation to assess the robustness of your model. Given the complexity and variability of METAR data, it might also be beneficial to ensemble different models to improve predictions in prior portions of the data challenge.</p> METAR <p>METAR is a format for reporting weather information. A METAR weather report is predominantly used by aircraft pilots, airlines, observation stations, and <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/science-art-meteorology/">meteorologists</a> who use aggregated METAR information to assist in current general weather forecasting.</p><p>Raw METAR is the most common format in the world for the transmission of observational weather data.

<p>In an age defined by relentless technological evolution, our lives have seamlessly integrated into the complex web of the digital world. From social interactions to financial transactions, our activities are increasingly finding their home online. Yet, this digital transformation is not without its challenges, particularly concerning identity and privacy. As our lives migrate into this digital sphere, ensuring the security and authenticity of our identities becomes crucial. This is exactly where decentralized identity emerges as a game changer for the landscape of digital citizenship.</p><p>As <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/nine-bangladeshi-nationals-held-in-mumbai-for-illegal-stay/articleshow/105968173.cms">reported</a>, nine Bangladeshi nationals were recently apprehended in Mumbai, India for illegal stay and fraudulent activities, including the obtaining Aadhaar cards and PAN cards with fake documents and the illegal transfer of money to Bangladesh.</p><p>This incident underscores the critical need for a robust and secure identity management system. Breaches in such systems can lead to identity theft, financial loss, and various other problems.</p><p>Enter decentralized identity, a game changer for the landscape of digital citizenship.</p><p>Revolutionizing Identity Management: A Shield Against Fraud and Illegal Activities</p><p>Traditionally, digital identities have been stored and controlled by centralized structures. This centralized approach poses significant risks, where breaches can lead to identity theft, financial loss, and an array of other problems. Decentralized identity, on the other hand, operates on the bedrock of blockchain technology. It allows individuals to reclaim control over their digital identities, free from the clutches of a central authority.

<p>Between the pings, swipes, and endless scrolls of the modern world, genuine human connection often feels out of reach. For Joe Feminella, the problem of fostering meaningful interactions in the digital era led him to found the dating app First Round’s on Me.</p><p>Sparked by his own fatigue trying to find deep relationships in a system obsessed with scale over substance, Joe’s journey reveals three pivotal insights on coordinating impactful collaboration.</p><p>Joe's experience in developing a dating app offers a unique perspective on how innovative technology can be used to create more meaningful connections.</p> How the Design of Coordination Systems Affect Outcomes <p>While technology has the power to connect people globally, design choices dictate impacts on relationships. App founder Joe Feminella observes, “I think technology is just moving so quickly that we often don't know what to do with it.” Rapid digitization makes it hard to accommodate the reality of everyday life.</p><p>Consequently, Joe watched social platforms overwhelm users with information rather than facilitating meaningful connections. Engineered to maximize matches, the barrage of stimulus short-circuited genuine intimacy.</p><p>Joe suggests that “progress requires transcending entrenched, engineering-only perspectives.” Bridging system gaps in belonging allows innovation to elevate, not exploit, understanding.</p><p>This involves recalibrating metrics to empower care-centered coordination. As Joe concludes, “user-informed design interweaves logic with healthy social values.” By grasping technology’s influence, we gain a conviction for writing social code that finally facilitates the connections we want.&nbsp;</p> Using Feedback to Build a Better App <p>User frustration often signals when tools hamper rather than help healthy relating. For app founder Joe Feminella, the frustration he and his dates shared about the platforms they were meeting on revealed recurrent unmet needs.</p><p>Across demographics and identities, people voiced the desire for more intentional interactions cultivating genuine intimacy. They felt starved of courtship customs signaling care, not just matches indicating cursory interest. Stark contrasts emerged between the claims of these dating apps, which promised meaningful connections, and the actual experiences of emotional depletion they provided.</p><p>Application users expressed feeling reduced to a number, valued for quantification over quality of character. As the number of dating apps grew, environments that should encourage vulnerability lacked sufficient moderation protections. Leaving many to feel objectified by digitally amplified attention patterns.</p><p>Joe suggests exploitation causes anxiety, stating “onslaughts of stimulus overload sensitivities crafted over millennia.” By focusing computing on growth before grounded human needs, innovation routinely agitates users.</p><p>This taught Joe the need for cross-discipline solutions. He felt compelled to bridge the gaps hindering healthy bonds and to leverage technology for good. As he concludes, “Progress means transcending entrenched perspectives across disciplines.” Collectively authored improvements weave care back into digital social fabrics.</p> Bringing More Heart Into Tech to Bridge Understanding <p>Holochain's framework is made for peer-to-peer applications that are secure, reliable, and fast. Moreover, Holochain is made for social applications that bring people together, centering the user. This technology aligns perfectly with Joe's vision of building authentic connections.&nbsp;</p><p>His experience developing a dating app that emphasizes genuine human relationships is paralleled by Holochain's goal to connect user devices directly in secure networks, giving users the autonomy of locally installed software that still benefits from the power and redundancy of cloud software.&nbsp;</p><p>Joe's insight into user experience and cross-disciplinary thinking are essential. New, innovative technology still needs to be user-friendly and accessible to help enable human connection. Hope persists for redeeming technology to elevate healthy bonds, not degrade them. Joe suggests progress stems from “transcending entrenched perspectives” — blending wisdom across domains to braid ethical values back into digital spaces.</p> A More Connected Future <p>The tools either dividing or uniting us remain unwritten, awaiting our choice. While scripts concentrating on control and surveillance surround us, we retain the power to edit the tale toward care.</p><p>Now more than ever, we require rewriting the social code — infusing creativity with conscience, and computation with compassion. Though challenges persist in balancing scalability with situated nuance, a more beautiful technology beckons just beyond reach when we link hands across domains.</p>

<p>Less than a month into 2024 and password spraying is being named as the origin for our first eye-opening cyber-attack. In a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/01/25/midnight-blizzard-guidance-for-responders-on-nation-state-attack/">blog post</a>, Microsoft has identified Midnight Blizzard, the Russian state-sponsored actor also known as NOBELIUM for the attack on their corporate systems.</p>
<p>This is another in the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats. As organizations continue to grapple with the reality of sophisticated cyber-attacks, it becomes imperative to look for additional alternatives to bolster defenses if a breach is due to a wider security vulnerability.</p>
<p>Considering the recent guidance provided by Microsoft on the “Midnight Blizzard” nation-state attack, we at 1Kosmos delve into the nuances of this threat and offer insights into how organizations can navigate through the latest attack vector.</p>
 Understanding the Midnight Blizzard Cyber-Attack 
<p>What was the Midnight Blizzard cyber-attack? As covered by Microsoft Threat Intelligence, it represents a formidable challenge for organizations worldwide. Characterized by the group’s stealthy infiltration and persistent nature, this sophisticated attack exploited network vulnerabilities and breached Microsoft’s Outlook by using a test account to authorize a custom-built malicious application.</p>
<p>The group utilized a password spraying attack that successfully compromised a legacy, non-production test tenant account that did not have multifactor authentication (MFA) enabled. The account inadvertently gave hackers access to the inboxes of various executives, including those in cybersecurity and legal functions.</p>
<p>This allowed them to steal copies of their emails and attachments through a legacy OAuth application that had elevated access to the Microsoft corporate environment. The group had access for approximately six weeks before they were discovered.</p>
<p>The vulnerability was not limited to Microsoft’s own environment. As part of their forensic analysis, Microsoft determined that the same group of attackers used identical tactics to target the inboxes of an unspecified number of Microsoft’s customers.</p>
 The Attack 
<p></p>
 1Kosmos Perspective: Building Security Resilience 
<p>The nature of this attack illustrates a need to eliminate passwords, strengthen multi-factor authentication, prevent lateral movement, and simpifly the IT (Information Technology) stack.</p>
 How 1Kosmos can help: 
<p>Prevent Password Spraying Attacks: 1Kosmos can eliminate passwords wherever possible, and where not possible, enforce regular password reset intervals with a password reset workflow that proves the user’s identity to ensure the reset request’s validity.</p>
<p>Zero Trust Methodology: 1Kosmos authentication methods exceed Zero Trust guidelines and mitigate the risk posed by attackers, by verifying every user and device attempting to access resources. The result can limit the lateral movement of attackers within their networks, thwarting sophisticated infiltration attempts.</p>
<p>Phish-Proof MFA: 1Kosmos strong identity-based authentication protocols perform strong authentication and significantly improve the user experience. 1Kosmos LiveID is a phishing-proof MFA that proves identity at every access request.</p>
<p>Risk Based Authentication: One-size-fits-all authentication solutions prove ineffective, underscoring the imperative for risk-based authentication to become the standard rather than the exception. 1Kosmos can use contextual factors like device details and location to assess the risk level and apply the right level of authentication.</p>
<p>Audit and Reporting: 1Kosmos is built on a private and permissioned blockchain. This private, permissioned ledger retains a detailed, immutable audit trail of all events, enabling visibility to all logins, access attempts, information updates, and shared information related to the digital identity. These logs can be shared with SOC teams and other platforms to ensure quick digital forensic analysis.</p>
<p>Collaborative Defenses: Collaboration and integration are key to a successful security infrastructure. 1Kosmos has built out-of-the-box integrations with industry peers (including Microsoft) to enhance the resilience of organizations against sophisticated attacks. Relying on a duct tape infrastructure and the gaps they inject is exactly what these hackers are looking to exploit. A tightly coupled integration will reduce gaps and improve an overall security posture.</p>
<p>Industry Certifications: 1Kosmos has taken the step to ensure the safety and security of our platform. For instance, 1Kosmos is certified to many standards including FIDO2, NIST 800-63-3, UK DIATF and iBeta DEA EPCS. The combination of these standards prevents identity impersonation, account takeover and fraud while delivering frictionless user experiences that preserve user privacy.</p>
 1Kosmos Prevents Identity Based Attacks 
<p></p>
<p>As the threat landscape continues to evolve, we must remain focused and adaptive in our cybersecurity strategies. The Midnight Blizzard attack serves as a stark reminder of the persistent threat posed by nation-state adversaries. By embracing a proactive, collaborative, and identity-centric approach to security, organizations can bolster their resilience and effectively navigate through the digital storm unleashed by sophisticated attackers.</p>
<p>At 1Kosmos, we empower remote identity verification and passwordless multi-factor authentication, facilitating secure transactions with digital services for employees, customers, and residents alike. Through the integration of identity proofing, credential verification, and strong authentication, 1Kosmos effectively combats identity-based attacks, empowering organizations with the tools, insights, and expertise needed to combat threats such as this one and safeguard their digital assets.</p>

<p>On March 1st, 2021, the European Banking Authority <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-01/a3e89f4f-fbf3-4bd6-9e07-35f3243555b3/Final%20Amending%20%20Guidelines%20on%20MLTF%20Risk%20Factors.pdf">published final revised guidelines</a> on money laundering and terrorist financing risk factors, offering directions on how it intends to lead, coordinate, and monitor the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing.</p><p>Nearly three years later, on January 16th, 2024, the EBA published guidelines amending the earlier&nbsp;ones.</p><p>So, what do these amendments imply? How do they impact CASPs, the crypto asset service providers? What do the CASP/VASPs need to do to comply with these amendments? These are the aspects we will discuss in the segments&nbsp;below.</p> How Does EBA’s Final Guidelines Impact&nbsp;CASPs <p>The amendments outline what CASPs must do to handle potential money laundering and terrorist financing risks in their overall business and each transaction.</p> The Assumption That Drives EBA’s Guideline Amendments for CASPs/VASPs <p>The new guidelines recognize that Crypto Asset Service Providers operate differently from traditional banks. They point out that CASPs often deal with transfers to self-managed wallets and various decentralized platforms, which aren’t uniformly regulated worldwide. This might make them more vulnerable to money laundering and terrorist financing. The guidelines also note that certain features in crypto assets, which can keep transactions anonymous, could increase these&nbsp;risks.</p> What Could CASPs Do to Reduce&nbsp;Risk? <p>The EBA is advising Crypto Asset Service Providers to increase vigilance against the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing, especially due to the ease of anonymous international transfers.</p><p>Their advice includes practical steps like limiting product features to control where money can be sent. This means <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/new-european-crypto-transfer-rules-in-2024">allowing transfers</a> only to certain approved parties, such as crypto-asset accounts or bank accounts in the customer’s name, which are already following strict anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulations.</p><p>Additionally, the EBA suggests CASPs could use more controlled payment systems, like those used for small payments or transactions with the government. Another idea is to offer services specifically to certain groups, like a company’s employees, to better manage&nbsp;risk.</p><p>The EBA also notes that CASPs can lower their risk by ensuring customers meet regulatory standards and have a clean history of crypto transactions. Transactions that involve converting to or from official currency, especially through bank accounts in low-risk areas, are seen as safer. The same goes for low-value transactions for goods and services, as long as there’s no negative information about the involved crypto accounts.</p><p>CASPs are also encouraged to think about the risks linked to how and where they offer their services.</p><p>While these suggestions can help minimize risks, the EBA emphasizes the need for CASPs to actively implement measures that make their operations more&nbsp;secure.</p> The Measures that the EBA’s Amending Guidelines Recommend for&nbsp;CASPs <p>The EBA wants CASPs to have suitable and effective monitoring tools, including transaction monitoring tools and advanced analytics tools. The CASPs must also train relevant employees for them to have a wholesome understanding of crypto assets and ML/TF risks to which they may expose the provider.</p> The CASPs Must Ensure Enhanced Customer Due Diligence <p>According to the European Banking Authority’s published final revised guidelines,</p><p>CASPs must verify the identities of customers and beneficial owners using multiple trusted and independent sources. They also need to identify and verify majority shareholders who are not yet compliant.</p><p>EBA underlines that to understand customer relationships better, gathering more information about the customer and the business’s nature and purpose is essential, including tracing the origins of their funds and&nbsp;wealth.</p><p>CASPs are also advised to increase the frequency of monitoring crypto-asset transactions. And upon any triggering event, they need to rigorously review, update, and document relevant customer information. Conducting business relationship reviews more regularly is part of this protocol.</p><p>According to EBA, CASPs should use investigation tools more extensively for a deeper investigation into crypto assets. This includes examining all distributed ledger addresses a customer might use, particularly if they have several. They also need to monitor customer IP addresses more frequently.</p><p>Understanding a customer’s knowledge about crypto assets is another focus area of the amended guidelines. CASPs should take additional steps when withdrawal or redemption patterns do not align with the customer’s usual profile and determine whether the customer or a third party initiates these transactions.</p><p>Lastly, CASPs have the responsibility to verify that a customer truly controls and owns their self-hosted wallet address. To aid in this process, CASPs can now utilize <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/user-signing-now-available-on-shyft-veriscope">Veriscope’s User Signing feature</a>. It allows them to directly request cryptographic proof from users’ self-hosted wallets.</p> Analytics and Record-Keeping Requirements for&nbsp;CASPs <p>The EBA guidelines recommend the application of advanced analytics tools to transactions on a risk-sensitive basis. Their deployment must come as a supplementary addition to the standard monitoring tools. This is particularly important for transactions involving self-hosted wallets.</p><p>These advanced tools are designed to help CASPs trace a wallet’s transaction history and check for any possible connections to criminal activities or suspicious persons and entities.</p><p>Additionally, the guidelines highlight the need for CASPs to go beyond relying solely on distributed ledgers for record-keeping. They should have procedures to link each distributed ledger address with its corresponding private key, controlled by an individual or a legal&nbsp;entity.</p><p>Overall, these updated guidelines from the EBA are directing CASPs to adopt a more thorough approach to tackling money laundering and the use of crypto in terrorism financing.</p><p>This will likely mean that CASPs have to allocate more resources, including manpower and training, to comply with these guidelines and enhance their monitoring capabilities.</p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-shyft-perspective-global-crypto-regulatory-outlook-2024">Click here to read the latest global crypto regulatory outlook 2024&nbsp;report.</a></p> Key Takeaways   The European Banking Authority (EBA) published amended guidelines for Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) to address money laundering and terrorist financing risks.  The guidelines recognize that CASPs operate differently than traditional banks and may be more vulnerable to risks due to features like anonymity.  The EBA advises CASPs to take practical steps like limiting high-risk product features and transactions, verifying customer identities rigorously, and monitoring transactions more&nbsp;closely.  CASPs need enhanced customer due diligence including gathering more customer information, investigating crypto addresses, and understanding customer knowledge and behavior.  The guidelines recommend CASPs use advanced analytics tools to supplement standard monitoring and maintain comprehensive records linking crypto addresses to individuals/entities.  <p>______________________________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

 A Guide to Data Protection and Cybersecurity in the Blockchain Era <p>In today’s Web3 era, where online interactions are the norm — like chatting and shopping — the importance of digital identity and data protection cannot be overstated. Decentralized identity, as exemplified by initiatives like <a href="http://ont.id">ONT ID</a>, offers an innovative and effective solution. It allows us to manage our information ourselves, avoiding central storage. This decentralization means we can decide who sees our information and when. Leveraging blockchain technology, we ensure that our online identity is not only safe but also easy to&nbsp;manage.</p><p>The transition to decentralized identity goes beyond enhancing online safety; it’s about improving and simplifying a variety of digital interactions. Imagine being able to swiftly and securely verify your identity, be it at a bank, medical facility, or even during elections. This shift promises to revolutionize sectors like finance, healthcare, and governance, streamlining processes and safeguarding private information. However, the path to widespread adoption of these decentralized technologies involves overcoming significant challenges including interoperability, user education, and aligning with regulatory frameworks.</p> Key Points to Remember:   Enhanced Control and Cybersecurity: Decentralized identity systems significantly bolster the safety and ease of managing your personal information online.  Versatility in Application: These systems, rooted in blockchain technology, offer versatile applications, simplifying identity verification across various&nbsp;sectors.  Navigating Challenges for Widespread Use: Addressing challenges like scalability, user adoption, and regulatory compliance is crucial for the broader integration of decentralized identity.  A Paradigm Shift in Identity Management: Moving from centralized to distributed models, decentralized identity, powered by blockchain, enhances both security and trustworthiness.   Explaining the&nbsp;Idea: <p>Decentralized identity, or self-sovereign identity, is akin to having a unique key that proves who you are, under your exclusive control. It’s about creating and maintaining your own digital identifiers, a stark contrast to traditional identity systems. This approach significantly boosts privacy and cybersecurity, offering you the autonomy to make your own&nbsp;choices.</p> How Blockchain Helps: <p>Blockchain acts as a robust and secure digital ledger, underpinning decentralized identity. It’s like a consensus-driven digital notebook, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of your identity. This technology provides a transparent and tamper-proof record, fostering trust and reliability in digital interactions.</p> Advantages and&nbsp;Uses: <p>Decentralized identity systems offer enhanced privacy and security over traditional models. Their real-world use cases span various&nbsp;sectors:</p>  Healthcare: Patients control their health records, ensuring data&nbsp;privacy.  Finance: Secure and streamlined online banking experiences.  E-commerce and Insurance: Enhanced user trust through personal data ownership.  Travel: Secure sharing of identity documents, reducing data exposure&nbsp;risks.  Governance: Anonymous and safe interactions with government services.   Addressing Implementation Challenges: <p>For decentralized identity systems to function optimally, it’s essential to address scalability, encourage user adoption, and ensure regulatory compliance. These solutions enhance system performance, foster user trust, and meet legal standards.</p> Facilitating Growth and User Adoption: <p>To scale decentralized identities (DIDs), efficient network management is key. It’s about enhancing node efficiency, distributing workload, and employing off-chain solutions. Encouraging user adoption involves clear education, showcasing the benefits of security and privacy, and forming partnerships with trusted entities.</p> Navigating Regulatory Landscapes: <p>Decentralized identity solutions require careful consideration of regulatory landscapes. They must align with governmental governance frameworks for legitimacy. Achieving regulatory compliance involves monitoring evolving regulations, engaging with policymakers, and ensuring DIDs adaptability.</p> Ensuring Interoperability: <p>Developing standards for DIDs to work across platforms and jurisdictions is crucial for global efficacy. Establishing protocols for network nodes to interact with varying regulatory environments strengthens the viability of decentralized identity on a global&nbsp;scale.</p> Conclusion: <p>Decentralized identity systems represent a significant advancement in our digital world, offering a path to enhanced privacy and more secure online interactions. The adoption of these systems, integrated with blockchain technology, indicates a promising future, potentially transforming the landscape of online identity verification. The growth of this ecosystem hinges on widespread adoption and collaborative efforts among stakeholders, aiming to establish a norm where secure, private, and convenient identity management is the standard. While challenges in scalability, legal frameworks, and public understanding persist, the ongoing technological evolution and the growing emphasis on privacy suggest a bright future for decentralized identity&nbsp;systems.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/embracing-web3-with-decentralized-digital-identity-2e0200091cf3">Embracing Web3 with Decentralized Digital Identity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 ‘We can afford what we can actually do’ — 2 <p>Across the country people from all walks of life — from those running families to those running organisations and Governments — are <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/we-can-afford-what-we-can-actually-do-1-efdca9835617">having to ride two horses</a> at once: one that says we can only do what we can afford, financially speaking; and one that says we can afford what we can actually do. This second part of a three part series examines ways to expand what we can actually&nbsp;do.</p><p>In the dark days when the second world war was coming to an end people started discussing how to rebuild. As soon as they did so, they found themselves embroiled in a fundamental argument. Some said, there was little if anything we do, because we didn’t have the money to do it. Others, led by John Maynard Keynes said that was nonsense. As long as we had people who could work and resources they could work with, there were plenty of things we could do. “<a href="https://medium.com/mydex/we-can-afford-what-we-can-actually-do-1-efdca9835617">We can afford what we can actually do</a>”, he&nbsp;said.</p><p>How then can we expand what we can actually do, in our current situation? Here are some of the things we at Mydex Community Interest Company have been thinking about and trying to put this simple but important idea into practice.</p> Think capabilities <p>In recent decades, policy-makers and decision-makers have become obsessed with targets. They believed that if they defined the outcomes they wanted to achieve and focused resolutely and exclusively on achieving these outcomes, then all would be well. It all sounded very sensible and practical, but in fact it was quite the opposite. Why? Because what really matters is not whether one particular outcome is achieved, but whether we have the ability to continue achieving this outcome. What really matters is our capabilities because results follow from capabilities.</p><p>Yes, it is possible to strain every nerve and expend every ounce of energy achieving a particular target (and then collapsing in a heap afterwards). But doing this doesn’t build capabilities. It destroys them. And that’s what’s been happening with decades’ worth of outcomes-obsessed target setting, outsourcing and so on, with institutions like the NHS effectively being run into the&nbsp;ground.</p><p>Once we think of outcomes as the results of capabilities, then the main goal of every activity shouldn’t be just to deliver this or that particular outcome. It should be to do everything we can to build underlying capabilities alongside delivering the outcome in question.</p><p>Results are ephemeral. Once you’ve achieved them, they’re gone. But skills, knowledge, know-how and infrastructure are not ephemeral. They last. It’s capabilities that make results permanent — and that make it possible to improve on these results as time goes&nbsp;by.</p> Think genuine productivity <p>It’s all very well saying “we can afford what we can actually do” but what happens if what we can actually do is constrained — if our resources are&nbsp;limited?</p><p>This has been the human dilemma since the year dot. This is why expanding the scope, range and volume of the things we can actually do has also been the focus of human economic activity since the year&nbsp;dot.</p><p>At the heart of this lies productivity. Now, it’s sad but true: in recent times the word ‘productivity’ has got itself a bad name. It’s become associated with negative things like cutting corners or sweating the labour force — or, perhaps, with simply being boring and tedious. But in reality productivity is all we’ve got, because productivity is about making enough of the things we physically need practically available. Productivity is about building the ability to generate more, better outcomes using less resources — and what is more important than that? Without increased productivity it’s not possible to sustainably improve peoples’ material wellbeing.</p><p>Genuine productivity is liberating. When, for example, some clever sailors decided to start putting up sheets of fabric to capture the power of the wind rather than relying on rows of tired, sweating men desperately pulling on oars, they achieved a huge productivity revolution. Men who previously desperately hard days pulling oars could now devote their time and energy to doing other things. Boats could carry much bigger cargos (using the space previously occupied by oarsmen). And sailors could take these cargoes much further, because the wind never&nbsp;tires.</p><p>Sometimes productivity revolutions are generated by technical breakthroughs (LED lighting uses 85% less energy than previous forms of lighting). At other times, they are generated by changing the ways in which work is organised. Henry Ford’s moving assembly lines cut the time and labour needed to make a motor car by over 90%, making cars available to ordinary&nbsp;people.</p><p>Whether it’s from technical or organisational innovation, genuine productivity enables humans to achieve more using less resources: less time, less energy and effort, less materials. It is how real wealth has been created since the year&nbsp;dot.</p><p>But if Governments focus only on what they can afford — on the money overlay — while ignoring the underlying economic realities of what can actually be done, then the chances we have to improve produtivity will be be passed over.&nbsp;Ignored.</p><p>This has now been happening for decades, and it really is time that it&nbsp;changed.</p> Think mutual self&nbsp;help <p>In countless situations humans can achieve far more if they cooperate and work together instead of simply acting alone. It’s much easier for two people to push a broken down car than one. Even easier if it’s&nbsp;three.</p><p>Back in the day, before this country had a welfare state and before Governments and states grew so big and powerful, people had all sorts of needs that weren’t being met. Governments of the day would not, or could not, do anything to help them, so they had to learn how to help themselves.</p><p>That’s what the labour movement did, for example. It gathered people together to share resources and to use these resources to help each other help themselves. People did this in many different ways, building friendly societies, mutual building societies, burial societies, producer cooperatives, consumer cooperatives, trade unions, and so on — all of them acting not on the mantra of ‘we can only do what we can afford’ but focusing on the question ‘what we can actually&nbsp;do?’.</p><p>Decades ago, in the face of institutional inertia and failure, the people of this country created a flowering of institutional creativity, building completely new institutions from the ground up, designed to fit the circumstances they found themselves in. The welfare state — social security benefits, state pensions, the NHS and so on — were just further examples of a long and deep history of mutual institutional innovation.</p><p>With Governments once again saying there are things that they cannot or will not do, perhaps it is time to cherish and revisit that legacy. Perhaps, we as a society and citizenry need to stop looking up to the top with a begging bowl and start looking to each other again, to ask a different question: “OK. So what can we as communities (in, that is, countless different types of community) actually do with the resources we have&nbsp;got?”</p> Think ‘clubs’ and communities, not just ‘markets’ and&nbsp;‘states’ <p>In recent years, many people have pointed out that the classic left/right debates about ‘markets’ versus ‘states’ renders a huge part of our lives invisible — the fact that we live in communities. They may be local, physical communities or communities of interest or communities of practice. Either way, they’re important because they bring people together in ways where they share a common experience or interest.</p><p>In the context of expanding what we can actually do, communities are important because there are many ways to cooperate and share resources, things, information etc within a community that make things possible and enrich peoples’ lives without having to turn to either a market or a&nbsp;state.</p><p>But there is lots more where that came from. Back in the mid-sixties a young economist called James Buchanan wrote an article called ‘An Economic Theory of Clubs’. In it, he noticed that when we look at real world economic activities, very few of them fit the mould of either pure market (all just private individuals exchanging purely private property), or pure state (where everything is publicly owned and all decisions are made by the&nbsp;state).</p><p>In reality, he noted, most economic activities fit somewhere in the middle, in what he called clubs. This is where a number of people (but not everybody) contributes to creating a resource and enabling access to it and where, having contributed to this resource they share access to it according to rules that they have all agreed to. In a tennis club for example, every member contributes to maintaining the facilities, and every member gets to enjoy&nbsp;them.</p><p>To work well, clubs need boundaries. The tennis club can easily share a court between 100 or perhaps 1000 members. But if it becomes 100,000, then the court can’t serve them all. Likewise, five or six people helping to push that car is great. But if it is 50 or 60 it doesn’t work any more. So clubs happen when specific groups of people get together to do specific&nbsp;things.</p><p>Using Buchanan’s terms, firms a sort of club. So are supply chains and clusters where a number of organisations work together to achieve a common purpose — for example in health and care, dealing with one individual’s specific issue where lots of different inputs are required.</p><p>Once you think about it this way, it quickly becomes obvious that the vast majority of economic activity isn’t actually undertaken by either markets or states, but by ‘clubs’ where specific groups of people find ways of working together on particular things to improve on and expand what they can actually&nbsp;do.</p><p>This underlines the importance of human agency. Very often we find ourselves at the mercy of market forces, or dependent on the state. Markets and states are supposed to be complete opposites, but they have one thing in common. They both undermine and restrict human agency. (A key point about market forces is that they force us to behave in particular ways.) In contrast, clubs and communities emphasise and develop agency — our joint quest to lift the constraints we are faced&nbsp;with.</p><p>In short, there is a vast swathe of positive, productive economic activity that could be undertaken — that could expand what we can actually do — that needs neither remorseless market forces nor centralised bureaucracies to enable it to work. There is a vast untapped potential just waiting to be&nbsp;tapped.</p> Think institutional innovation <p>As Keynes pointed out, money isn’t a real economic resource. You can’t eat pound notes or build houses with them. To eat something we need food — a material thing, not a financial, symbolic thing. To have food we need to grow it. Growing food takes time, from planting to harvesting. Growing, processing and moving food requires energy and material resources like land, tractors and trucks. That is what the real economy is about: People, Time, Energy, Resources.</p><p>Money is just a poor symbol of these things. It’s supposed to represent real economic resources (though, increasingly it doesn’t), and it’s used as a mechanism to allocate and deploy these resources. But it is not the real thing. It is an institutional overlay, sitting on top of the real economy, creating a veil between us and the real thing (a veil which often obscures the real thing’s workings).</p><p>Institutions create the ‘rules of the road’ by which we humans get together and do things. We need these institutions. But sometimes they go wrong. Sometimes they are not well designed.</p><p>Money is one such institution. The institutional overlay of money and financial affordability works well when it deploys and allocates available human and material resources to meet human needs. But if and when it stops doing this job — if it creates a barrier between meeting human needs and the deployment of resources — then this institutional overlay is no longer fit for purpose. It has become a constraint that we need to&nbsp;lift.</p><p>The answer to not having enough money to spend on what we need is not to simply spend money as if there is no tomorrow. It’s not a choice between ‘fiscal responsibility’ and ‘fiscal irresponsibility’. It is to shift focus: to focus on expanding what we can actually do. To find new ways to connect real-world resources with real-world humans and their&nbsp;needs.</p><p>This isn’t just about technical innovation. It is about institutional innovation: building new institutions that create new rules of the road to enable people to get together. To make these connections in new ways to do new things. Just as the labour movement did a century&nbsp;ago.</p> Think genuine investment <p>In theory, the purpose of an investment is to build a capability that delivers better results. This is where the ‘returns’ on your investment come from. But over the past few decades, ‘investors’ have grown impatient with the time and effort that’s needed to build capabilities.</p><p>Instead, they have looked for ways to get better results wihtout having to worry about that pesky intervening bit of earning them via the extra wealth generated by the development of new capabilities. For example, if you can earn a bigger ‘return’ by shuffling the title deeds to an already-existing asset or gambling on its future price, why not? A return is a return. Who cares about how it’s actually&nbsp;created?</p><p>That’s why today, banks and the City of London hardly invest anything in real productive capacity. Virtually all of the money they ‘invest’ goes into the prices of existing assets such as houses, stocks and shares, or in gambling on the future prices of these in secondary ‘derivative markets’. For them, ‘investment’ is all about eating the cherries while doing nothing to plant the cherry trees or tending the cherry&nbsp;orchard.</p><p>The early 20th century economist Thorsen Veblen had a term for this. He called it sabotage. This was the process by which the people holding the money — the people deciding what is ‘affordable’ — go on strike if doesn’t guarantee them the quickest and highest possible return. Where they refuse to invest in things that may be immensely productive simply because it doesn’t line their pockets quickly&nbsp;enough.</p><p>In such a world it may be helpful to use the words ‘sabotage’ and ‘saboteur’ every time you come across the words ‘investment’ or ‘investor’. So, for example, if you see the term ‘social investor’, read ‘social saboteur’. With a few admirable exceptions it’s usually a good way of getting closer to the truth&nbsp;. But this is a truth that needs to change, with the return of real investors with a focus on expanding what we can actually&nbsp;do.</p> Think de-monetisation <p>For many decades now, most policy initiatives have focused on marketisation: where there is a human need it should have a price placed on it and for money to be exchanged. But if we enter a world where there is less money to spend, less money is exchanged, so fewer needs can be&nbsp;met.</p><p>It’s time to move in the opposite direction: to loosen this stranglehold by finding ways to de-monetise exchanges of value. If we focus on what we can actually do, rather than what we can ‘afford’ in narrow money terms, we find ourselves looking at real-world things like available time, energy (including human energy) and resources (both material and intangible e.g. knowledge, know-how, information and trust). To connect them, we might consider using local ‘alternative’ currencies or&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>Such de-monetisation also opens the door to other forms of non-market exchange. Not everything has to be sold for a price. Things can also be shared, given, borrowed and lent. Deepening and extending what we can actually do includes deepening and extending what we exchange, and&nbsp;how.</p> Think Fair&nbsp;Process <p>A Fair Process is, if you like, a process for making and implementing decisions that treat those involved and affected with respect: giving them a voice, being impartial when assessing what they have to say, making decisions in their interests (rather than listening to some more than others, and biassing decisions in favour of particular vested interests). It’s a <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/a-human-rights-based-approach-to-personal-data-566f4e4a8cb4">human rights approach</a> to whatever you are trying to&nbsp;do.</p><p>That may sound obvious. But very often it’s not what happens. For example, ‘leaving the market to decide’ is an unfair process almost by definition. This is because markets are organised around the spending of money and that means those with the most money have the most say, while those without any money end up being&nbsp;ignored.</p><p>Fair processes, on the other hand, tend to produce the best decisions (precisely because all voices have been heard rather than just a select few). They also earn buy-in from those involved (precisely because the process is seen to be fair). This is crucial if and when to actually get something done we have to create a ‘we’: we have to bring people together in a way that encourages them to work together.</p> Conclusion <p>We now live in a world where what we can do is increasingly restricted by the institutional constraints of “what we can only do what we can afford”. Day to day, all of us at every level — from families to those working in Governments — have to find a way of surviving within these constraints. But as they get tighter we also have to look for wriggle room. We have to open up spaces which enable us to expand what we can actually do. This blog has suggested some ways we can do this (‘we’ being important here, because very often it needs a joint&nbsp;effort).</p><p>As a Community Interest Company, we at Mydex know all about the constraints of only doing what we can afford. We never have enough cash to do all the things we want to do. On the other hand, our whole raison d’etre is to expand what we as a society and individuals can do with data. So our next blog looks at how Mydex fits what we’ve been talking about&nbsp;here.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/we-can-afford-what-we-can-actually-do-2-96213dd4d546">‘We can afford what we can actually do’ — 2</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				 <p>By Sam Curren</p>
<p>Moving to digital trust and verifiable credentials is the goal of many current organizations. Doing so carries substantial benefits, including fraud reduction, increased data sharing with reduced integration costs, and even privacy law compliance.</p>
<p>Large-scale efforts by governments and orgs like GLEIF to create organizational identity are often championed as the foundations for this new digital world, and many are under the impression that it is one that we must wait for.</p>
<p>In reality, the relationships you already have are the key to building a digital ecosystem. Ecosystems need to identify the parties involved in the issuance and verification of credentials — who to trust for what. By contrast, large global identity projects&nbsp; will actually provide very little value to established ecosystems where the parties have established relationships with each other. Moreover, as ecosystems turn digital, newly created digital identifiers from ecosystem participants can be passed directly between participants and the ecosystem governance authority using existing communication channels and relationships; there is no need for that to be orchestrated by another party.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples:</p>
<p>Employees within a company — companies already know their employees and have existing HR processes for interacting and coordinating with employees. Employees know which company they work for. Issuing those employees verifiable employment credentials requires no outside authority.</p>
<p>Trade associations — trade associations already know their member companies and have been working with them for a long time, in some cases, years or decades. Verifiable credentials for member companies, including certifications, proof of membership, and other benefit qualifications are all based on existing relationships.</p>
<p>Business partner networks — insurance companies are a great example of how to build on established trust. They know the providers in their network, and they know the insured individuals. They can provide both directories and introductions between newly connecting parties, all leveraging these existing relationships. Patient VCs can ease onboarding at a new medical provider, while providers can provide qualification credentials to patients. Data entry errors are minimized, efficiency is gained, etc.</p>
<p>None of these examples need anybody’s permission to start innovating with VCs and gaining immediate benefits.</p>
<p>So, what do these large government efforts and global identity programs provide? We’ve made it clear that existing relationships don’t need external parties. What these large identity systems do provide is a trusted foundation for new relationships. It simplifies the process of identifying new ecosystem partners and participants, which can be a major source of fraud. By streamlining the correct identification of individuals and organizations, ecosystems can grow rapidly and more efficiently.</p>
<p>So what’s the holdup on these large programs?&nbsp; It should be no surprise that policy creation, technology development, and often regulation take time to get right.</p>
<p>As these programs mature and deliver the right technologies, they will assist in the growth of already established identity and trust ecosystems. They’ll improve upon existing methods of vetting new partners and participants, and that’ll be great.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the technologies needed to enhance trust and create digital ecosystems from your existing relationships already exist. We at Indicio help our customers do just that, and we’d like to help you as well.</p>

  <p>I’m thrilled to announce the public preview of advanced certificate-based authentication (CBA) options in Conditional Access, which provides the ability to allow access to specific resources based on the certificate Issuer or Policy Object Identifiers (OIDs) properties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our customers, particularly those in highly regulated industries and government, have expressed the need for more flexibility in their CBA configurations. Using the same certificate for all Entra ID federated applications is not always sufficient. Some resources may require access with a certificate issued by specific issuers, while other resources require access based on a specific policy OIDs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, a company like Contoso may issue three different types of multifactor certificates via Smart Cards to employees, each distinguished by properties such as Policy OID or issuer. These certificates may correspond to different levels of security clearance, such as Confidential, Secret, or Top Secret. Contoso needs to ensure that only users with the appropriate multifactor certificate can access data of the corresponding classification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Authentication strength - advanced CBA options</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>With the authentication strength capability in Conditional Access, customers can now create a custom authentication strength policy, with advanced CBA options to allow access based on certificate issuer or policy OIDs. For external users whose multifactor authentication (MFA) is trusted from partners' Entra ID tenant, access can also be restricted based on these properties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This adds flexibility to CBA, in addition to the <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/advancing-cybersecurity-the-latest-enhancement-in-phishing/ba-p/2365681">recent updates we shared in December</a>.

<p>Munich, January 30, 2024 – IDnow, a leading identity verification platform provider in Europe, announces its cooperation with the <a href="https://netid.de/">European netID Foundation</a>. The goal: The introduction of an identity wallet for netID users in Germany as an alternative to the offerings of US platforms.</p>



<p>Developed by IDnow, the netID Wallet app will be available for users to download later this year and will allow them to reuse and share stored digital identities.</p>



<p>Self-determined and even simpler reuse of identities</p>



<p>netID is an open standard that enables users to access online services of netID partners (among others Süddeutsche Zeitung, Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland, ProSiebenSat.1 and United Internet with the WEB.DE and GMX brands) via the same login details, all in compliance with data protection regulations. The introduction of the identity wallet will make storing and retrieving identities even easier for around 40 million potential users.</p>



<p>Bundled in one digital location, users can access and verify proof of identity such as ID cards, driving licenses, social security data and much more on their smartphone at any time – making everyday processes more efficient. netID partners, in turn, can significantly simplify their processes for verifying customer data, for example for invoice purchases, and thus make them more cost-effective. </p>



<p>Wallet can be used by the partners of the netID ecosystem</p>



<p>The initial verification of the user’s identity to create the wallet is carried out using the proven IDnow solutions. Once the identity has been confirmed and the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">digital wallet</a> has been successfully created, the user decides with whom they want to share what data. Anyone who uses the wallet once to register with a mobile phone provider, for example, can use it again at any time with one of the partners in the netID ecosystem for verified identification.</p>



<p>The wallet is another step toward the future: the European Commission is about to publish a new version of the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas/">eIDAS regulation (electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services)</a>, which is expected to come into force in 2024. All EU citizens should have a digital identity by 2030. The launch of the netID Wallet supports this goal.</p>



<p>“netID has been simplifying digital life in Germany since it was founded. Transparency and data protection have always been at the heart of what we do. We see the netID Wallet as the logical next step in the further development of the netID offering. Thanks to the cooperation with IDnow, we can offer our users secure and user-friendly identity verification that will even be able to serve regulated use cases in compliance with eIDAS in the future,” explains Uli Hegge, CEO of the European netID Foundation.</p>



<p>“We are delighted to have gained a trustworthy partner for our identity wallet in Germany in the form of the European netID Foundation and to be an active part of the netID ecosystem in the future,” says Uwe Stelzig, Managing Director DACH at IDnow.  </p>



<p>“IDnow and netID pursue similar goals in terms of data security and user-friendliness, which we are now also pursuing together in identity verification. With the introduction of the wallet, users no longer have to identify themselves again and again, but can save their verified identities and simply reuse them the next time. In this way, netID partners can offer their users even faster and secure access to their services,” continues Stelzig.</p>

   by Martin Kuppinger  A while ago, I was asked how to deal with cybersecurity for Web3 and the metaverses. There is not a simple answer to this. I talked about this last year at KuppingerCole Analyst’s cyberevolution 2023, our cybersecurity conference. It’ll be a hot topic again at the upcoming EIC, KuppingerCole’s European Identity and Cloud Conference, from June the 4th to the 7th in Berlin.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>A while ago, I was asked how to deal with cybersecurity for Web3 and the metaverses. There is not a simple answer to this. I <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/securing-the-metaverse-cre23">talked about this last year</a> at KuppingerCole Analyst’s cyberevolution 2023, our cybersecurity conference. It’ll be a hot topic again at the upcoming EIC, KuppingerCole’s <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">European Identity and Cloud Conference</a>, from June the 4th to the 7th in Berlin.</p>
<p>Going back to the question: The easiest way to solve complex problems is by deconstructing them into smaller pieces, solving these, and putting everything together again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the graphic, foundational elements of Web3 converge with metaverses related technologies. It’s tough to try to solve security holistically, of course. But there is NFT Security as a smaller, yet complex&nbsp; challenge. There is DeFi (Decentralized Finance) Security — some of which we could deconstruct even further.</p>
<p>But, more importantly, there is a common universal element: Decentralized Identity. This is the glue. For solving security in a decentralized world, we need decentralized identity. Then we can solve the various challenges and construct a unified security approach.</p>
<p>Decentralized Identity, which is part of the broader theme of Digital IDs (aka Digital Identity) is one of the main themes of EIC 2024. Digital IDs are not just elements of Identity and Access Management (IAM). It is something much bigger. They relate to IAM, but in cross-organizational use (decentralized, reusable) and supply approaches that enable and leverage business models.</p>
<p>When we think about an avatar (or agent or whatever is the industry term de jour) in a metaverse, this is sort of a “digital double” to us. The term “digital twin,” unfortunately, is already used in another context (namely, manufacturing and simulation).</p>
<p>This digital double has an identity which relates to our digital identity. It acts on our behalf. This imposes challenges such as control, liability, and other concerns. Digital identity is the core of the solution, because we can define that identity, relate it to our identity and others, and keep control. Without this, we will fail in our journey towards new models, especially everything including autonomous or semi-autonomous (that is how I would name an avatar in a metaverse) systems.</p>
<p>While this field is still evolving, one thing is clear: A central foundational pillar of Web3 and the Metaverse (and every modern digital service and business) are Digital IDs, particularly decentralized identity. Also, don’t miss the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/leal/a-closer-look-at-eidas-20-and-the-eu-digital-identity-wallet">recent blog post of my colleague Alejandro Leal</a> on eIDAS and the EUDI wallet, another key topic at EIC 2024. There also is a lot of research on this topic available by KuppingerCole Analysts, such as the Advisory Note <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an80858/how-enterprises-will-learn-to-love-decentralized-ids-the-roles-of-distributed-and-sovereign-identiti">How Enterprises Will Learn to Love Decentralized IDs: The Roles of Distributed and Sovereign Identities in Our Private Metaverse</a> written by Mike Neuenschwander.</p>
<p>Look at our research, talk to the analysts of KuppingerCole, and don’t miss attending EIC 2024. See you in Berlin in June!</p>

<p></p><p>"Our current credit system says, 'Saddle yourself, so we can give you more to saddle.'" Eric Lapin, President of <a href="https://www.formfree.com/">FormFree</a>, stated during a recent <a href="https://youtu.be/TZkK8a64E7I?si=2qhaIF22uGbD7lbJ">TBD live stream</a>. His comment sheds light on a fundamental paradox of the U.S. credit system: it often requires you to accumulate debt as a prerequisite for obtaining loans, leading to more debt. This systemic issue is underscored by <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/sce/credit-access#/experiences-credit-demand1">recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York</a>, which reveals that 1 in 5 applicants for mortgages, car loans, or other types of loans were rejected — the highest rate in five years. This trend disproportionately impacts Black and Latino applicants. Guided by their slogan, 'Democratizing lending for all people without bias,' FormFree developed a platform built with Web5 and AI to address these issues.</p> Residual Income Knowledge Index (RIKI)<a title="Direct link to Residual Income Knowledge Index (RIKI)">​</a> <p>The Fair Isaac Corporation score, better known as a FICO score, is a three-digit score that helps lenders in the U.S. evaluate the likelihood of a borrower repaying a loan. A higher score indicates greater reliability. However, achieving a high FICO score — or any credit score — largely depends on accruing and gradually repaying debt. This may come as a disadvantage for various groups of people who may not have a credit score, including veterans, formerly incarcerated individuals, immigrants, young adults, and folks who prefer cash transactions.</p><p>To provide a more holistic view of a person's creditworthiness, FormFree developed a new system called <a href="https://www.formfree.com/news-and-insights/formfree-releases-residual-income-knowledge-index/">Residual Income Knowledge Index™ (RIKI™)</a>. Instead, RIKI analyzes monthly income and spending. Integrating this method into our existing credit system provides greater opportunities for home ownership, car purchases, and other essential loans.</p> "It's like Tinder for banks!"<a title="Direct link to &quot;It's like Tinder for banks!&quot;">​</a> <p>During the live stream, FormFree Software Engineer, Jon West, showcased their <a href="https://passport.formfree.com/">Passport</a> product. The demo highlighted Passport's ability to match borrowers with lenders. This feature inspired an audience member to comment, 'It's like Tinder for banks!'"</p><p>Here's how it works:</p>  Borrowers securely connect to their bank account.  FormFree analyzes the account records and creates an anonymized credit profile for the borrower.  Lenders review these anonymized profiles and decide which borrowers to extend offers to.  Borrowers can now review offers from lenders and choose their preferred option.  All necessary borrower data is shared with the lender once a match is made.  <p>Typically, borrowers endure aggressively pitched products from dozens of lending institutions. FormFree shifts control to users for more tailored loan consideration.</p> How FormFree Uses Web5<a title="Direct link to How FormFree Uses Web5">​</a> <p>FormFree uses the following Web5 technologies:</p>  <a>Decentralized Identifiers (DID)</a> - After sign up, the application associates a user's account with a DID.  <a>Verifiable Credentials (VC)</a> - A borrower's credit profile is secured as a Verifiable Credential enabling the borrower's information to stay anonymous and tamper-proof.

 Looking Back at 2023 
<p>2023 was a year of change for Public Trust Certificates – discussions on reduced validity periods, approval of new requirements, and significant progress in access to Verified Mark Certificates. Let’s review what happened in 2023 along with a few predictions for what’s to come in 2024.</p>
<p>TLS Certificates</p>
<p>The Google Chrome team was quite active in the TLS ecosystem. They began <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/root-ca-policy/moving-forward-together/">promoting</a> modernizing PKI infrastructures including reducing the TLS certificate validity period to 90-days. Entrust provided <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/04/googles-90-day-proposal-for-tls-certificates/">our response to the 90-day proposal</a>. The Chrome team also provided the market with information to help secure TLS PKIs through automation for a safer more reliable internet.” You can then hyperlink the word “information.</p>
<p>The CA/Browser Forum (CABF) published ballots which updated the TLS Baseline Requirements (BRs):</p>
 
 <a href="https://cabforum.org/2023/03/02/ballot-sc61v4-new-crl-entries-must-have-a-revocation-reason-code/">SC61</a> – New Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL) entries must have a <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/03/use-of-crl-reason-codes-updated/">revocation reason code</a> 
 <a href="https://cabforum.org/2023/03/17/ballot-sc62v2-certificate-profiles-update/">SC62</a> – Certificate profiles update for the requirements and restrictions of the TLS certificate profiles 
 SC63 – Makes OCSP optional, require CRLs, incentivizes automation, and <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/08/short-lived-certificates-finally-approved/">finally approves short-lived certificates, which do not require certificate status</a> using CRL or OCSP 
 
<p>The <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9345">IETF has published RFC 9345</a> to support delegated credentials for TLS and DTLS. The delegated credential mechanism allows a server operator to use the private key from their server to issue a delegated credential. The new credential will have a different private key and a validity period of no greater than seven days. Since the delegated credential is only valid for a short period of time, there is no status protocol required to be checked, that is, no CRL or OCSP response.</p>
<p>S/MIME Certificates</p>
<p><a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/11/s-mime-baseline-requirements-approved-by-the-ca-browser-forum/">The CABF approved the S/MIME Baseline Requirements</a> in November 2022, which provides an S/MIME standard for the public trust CAs. The S/MIME BRs have been effective since the September 1, 2023. ETSI also released standard <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/119400_119499/11941106/01.01.01_60/ts_11941106v010101p.pdf">ETSI TS 119 411-6</a> to comply with the EU regulation on electronic signatures in email messages and to support the S/MIME BRs. This allows EU CAs meeting the S/MIME BRs to be audited using the ETSI audit criteria. The S/MIME BRs were also required by the Apple and Mozilla policies.</p>
<p>DigiCert provided an <a href="https://github.com/digicert/smbr-cert-factory">S/MIME certificate factory</a> with samples of certificates which meet the S/MIME BRs. They followed up with the <a href="https://github.com/digicert/pkilint">pkilint tool</a>, which can be used for S/MIME certificate linting to find errors when a certificate does not meet the S/MIME BRs. Entrust fully supports <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/09/digital-certificate-linting/">digital certificate linting&nbsp;</a> and its <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/11/deploying-digital-certificate-linting/">deployment</a>.</p>
<p>Code Signing Certificates</p>
<p>The CABF began requiring <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/09/ca-browser-forum-updates-requirements-for-code-signing-certificate-private-keys/">code signing certificate keys to be generated and managed in a crypto device</a> effective as of June 1, 2023. The goal is to reduce key compromise by removing the option to generate key pairs in software. The CAs must also verify if the keys were generated in a crypto device which would include server HSMs, USB tokens and cloud HSMs.</p>
<p>Ballot CSC68 was issued to update the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/08/code-signing-revocation-requirements-updated/">code signing certificate revocation requirements</a>. The purpose was to tighten up the procedure when a key is comprised, or if a subscriber signs suspect code. If the CA finds out that either of these occurred, then the certificate must be revoked within 24 hours. At a later time the CA may backdate the revocation time before the key was compromised or the suspect code was signed. This will cause signatures after the revocation date to fail.</p>
<p>Verified Mark Certificates</p>
<p><a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/03/government-organizations-can-now-get-verified-mark-certificates-for-their-outgoing-emails/">Government organizations can now get Verified Mark Certificates (VMCs) for their outgoing emails</a>. This is equivalent to VMCs issued to companies which have registered marks. Google also strengthened VMCs by <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/05/gmail-now-offers-a-new-checkmark-for-emails-enabled-with-verified-mark-certificates-and-bimi/">adding a blue checkmark</a> which proactively indicates the sender of the email has verified that it owns the domain and the logo displayed in the avatar slot.</p>
<p><a href="https://bimigroup.org/resources/VMC_Requirements_latest.pdf">VMCR 1.5 was released</a> create Common Mark Certificates. This will allow a certificate applicant to submit either a modified registered mark or a prior use mark to be added to the certificate. The modified registered use mark will allow an applicant with a registered mark to make a change such as removing/moving words or removing a portion of the mark. This may allow the applicant to modify the mark to fit in place with different dimensions or perhaps provide a seasonal change to the mark. For prior use mark, the applicant must have historically displayed the mark for at least 12 months and the mark must be found in an archive webpage source. The Common Mark Certificate beta program has just started in December 2023. Note: we are not sure if both Google and Apple will fully support common marks and emails will not get the blue checkmark.</p>
<p>Mozilla sets Root CA Lifecycles</p>
<p>To support cryptographic agility which Mozilla states is the ability to replace cryptographic primitives, algorithms, and protocols efficiently at reasonable cost with limited impact on operations, Mozilla has <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Root_CA_Lifecycles">set a lifecycle schedule for trusted root certificates</a>. There is a migration plan for existing roots, but the ongoing schedule will be from the date of key generation, a TLS root will be removed after 15-years and an S/MIME root will be removed after 18-years. The lifetime will allow the CA time to get the root embedded and at least 10 years of use. The S/MIME roots have a longer lifecycle as S/MIME certificates are issued with a longer validity period.</p>
 To 2024 and Beyond&nbsp; 
<p>Here are some expected changes for 2024.</p>
<p>TLS Certificates</p>
<p>The CABF TLS validation subcommittee is working on <a href="https://github.com/ryancdickson/staging/blob/require-mpdv-v2/docs/BR.md#3229-multi-perspective-issuance-corroboration">multi-perspective issuance corroboration</a> to ensure when verifying a domain name that the determinations made by the primary network perspective is correct before a TLS certificate issuance. Multi-perspective determination will be applied to both domain names and Certification Authority Authorization (CAA)record compliance. We anticipate multi-perspective will migrate to a “must” requirement in 2025.</p>
<p>Code Signing Certificates</p>
<p>The CABF code signing working group is working on updates for Signing Services and high-risk certificate applications. Signing Service will help the certificate subscribers to be complaint and ensure their key pairs are generated in a cryptographic module, the private key is protected, and only the subscriber can activate the private key for signing. The high-risk certificate application has been changed as now all key pairs must be generated in hardware, which mitigates some of the risks that were addressed in the CSBRs.</p>
<p>Key attestation is a method for the CA to verify that the private key was generated in a cryptographic module. There is no standard for key attestation, so this is difficult to implement. Members of the IETF are working on addressing this issue by generation an RFC for <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-lamps-csr-attestation/">CSR attestation</a> and for <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ounsworth-rats-x509-evidence/">X.509 based attestation evidence</a>. CSR attestation can be implemented with existing crypto modules and the RFC may be available in 2024. X.509 based attestation will take longer to define and would need to be implemented in new cryptographic modules; as such, we do not expect to benefit from this effort for many years.</p>
<p>S/MIME Certificates</p>
<p>The IETF publish RFC 9485 which supports <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/11/caa-for-s-mime-email-certificates/">certification authority authorization (CAA) for S/MIME certificates</a>. This will support domain name owners to provide the CAA record “issuemail” for their authorized CAs. The CABF S/MIME working group is developing on an update for CAA as a recommendation in late 2024 and a “must” requirement in 2025.</p>

  <p>Tangle Labs are happy to share the release of Vira Wallet v0.3.0 one of the most advanced self-sovereign identity wallets on the market and just one step away from a full 1.0 release.</p><p>After rigorous testing over the past couple of months, and the impressive demonstration of interoperability with other projects, we have experienced significant positive feedback and ensured that the wallet has matured to a level where it is now being used for ticketing and open badge experiences in the real world. Learnings from such events and experiences have given the team valuable feedback that has Vira to develop into such an advanced application.</p><p>Vira is currently being used across a number of projects including the UNESCO Lifelong Learning project NGDIL, various real world event ticketing and open badge experiences, and has recently been declared a DIIP compliant wallet by the <a href="https://www.dutchblockchaincoalition.org/dbc-zone/diip-wallets">Dutch Blockchain Coalition</a>, alongside the UniMe wallet from Impierce Technologies. </p><p></p> Feature Updates <p>Whilst a lot has been done behind the scenes to streamline the app in the backend and to ensure its security, stability, and feature performance, the four big feature updates include:</p><p></p><p>Improved UX/UI</p><p>The Vira UI has developed into a seamlessly intuitive and easy-to-use user experience. The balance between user experience and security in the world of crypto and decentralised identity is a very difficult area, often sacrificing one for the other. Having worked alongside partners to build out seamless experiences, we have streamlined the Vira experience to be a smooth one, without sacrificing the importance of security and privacy for users. This important area of the development process can place Vira in the top ranks of user experiences in the identity wallet space.</p><p></p><p>Open Badge Support</p><p>Credentials can now be issued as standardised open badges, supporting the Open Badge Standard v3.0. Separating credentials by standardised types provides a versatile approach to how credentials are received, shared, and stored. The Open Badge standard, by Ed1Tech, is a world leading standard used all over the world. Having implemented the standard in its entirety in the latest release, Vira can now become an open badge compatible wallet that may be used by millions of badge holders in open badge ecosystems around the world.</p><p></p><p>Self-Signed Credentials</p><p>User signed credentials to allow self-declaration of information such as name and email. Having verified credentials issued by a third-party is one thing, but being able to verify that you have self-declared information personally, is another. By implementing self-signing within Vira wallet, this opens up a world of opportunity allowing users to assign self-signed data to profiles, such as name, telephone number, email address, and other data for profiling at the granular level whether its a business card, a user login, or another profile, Vira users can now declare the information they want to within their individual profiles.</p><p></p><p>Internationalisation and RTL Support</p><p>Fully integrated support for translation into any language allowing Vira to go global. Cross-border use is one of the huge value propositions of decentralised identity. With Vira now fully integrated with global internationalisation standards, it can support any language translation as we begin to be used in multiple countries around the world. So whether its an open-badge event in the Netherlands, a travel ticket in Germany, or a business document in UAE, Vira is poised to become a truly global app.</p><p></p><p>Login with DID</p><p>Login with DID support via open-source OpenID standards. Vira is 100% ready to allow its users to login with DID allowing any project to integrate login with DID into their apps and websites using the open-source libraries from Tangle Labs, giving users the opportunity to privately connect to services without the need for third-party identity providers such as Google, Facebook, or X, etc. </p> What’s next? <p>These updates alone have put us one step away from a final public v1.0 with a feature complete release scheduled for later in the year. With Vira already live in the real world supporting and showcasing decentralised identity in its many forms, the next release of v0.4.0 will add the final pieces of the puzzle to ensure the complete package is ready for adoption.</p><p>The next features to be updated and integrated into the 0.4.0 release for final testing include:</p>  <p>Full Multichain Support - to allow users to operate in different ecosystems by selecting which networks they wish to engage with.</p>  <p>Document Signing - allowing users to legally sign documents with digital signatures from within their Vira wallet</p>  <p>Translations - full translations to allow Vira to be used in various languages such as ES, NL, AR, DE, etc.</p>  <p>Verified Account Support - allowing users to verify their identity for reusable credentials</p>  <p></p><p></p>

Background 
<p>At Northern Block, our journey toward enhancing Canadian critical mineral supply chain transparency and traceability collaboration began with an <a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/learning/case-studies/energy-mines-digital-trust-pilot/">innovative pilot</a> in 2022, in partnership with the Government of British Columbia, Copper Mountain Mining Corporation, and PricewaterhouseCoopers. </p>
<p>During this initial pilot, we successfully demonstrated that greenhouse gas emissions reporting could be converted into digital credentials, making this sustainability data verifiable and highly available for various systems within the supply chain. This demonstration effectively showcased how, by utilizing common standards and protocols, sustainability data can be seamlessly transferred between different organizations’ systems while maintaining its integrity (note: we cover more of ‘how this works’ in the section below ‘Why do digital credentials help create supply chain transparency in the mining industry?’)</p>
<p>In early 2023, we expanded our efforts by adding support for two new digital credentials:</p>
 
 Mines Act Permit: Easily prove your permit status (for major mine operators in B.C.) 
 Towards Sustainable Mining (TSM): Submit TSM scores and share verified environmental, social, and governance (ESG) data securely 
 
 <p>Both credentials are rooted in authoritative governance frameworks, and utilise OCA bundles for proper credential branding</p> 
<p>To support mining operators in receiving their Mines Act Permit in the form of a digital credential, we continued our ongoing partnership with the Government of B.C..</p>
<p>To transform TSM reporting data into digital credentials, we formed a key partnership with the <a href="https://mining.ca/">Mining Association of Canada (MAC)</a>, whose 100+ members account for most of Canada’s production of critical minerals. Canada already produces more than 60 minerals and metals and is a leading global producer of many critical minerals, including nickel, copper, potash, aluminum, and uranium. MAC is also behind <a href="https://mining.ca/towards-sustainable-mining/">the TSM initiative</a>, a globally recognized ESG standard implemented not only in Canada, but in countries such as Australia, Brazil, Spain, Argentina, and Colombia. TSM, first established in 2004, allows mining companies to turn high-level environmental and social commitments into action on the ground. Additionally, TSM was the first mining standard in the world to require site-level reporting with external verification. We anticipated that facilitating the creation of digital credentials for mines, based on a recognized and important reporting standard, should generate significant demand and value in downstream supply chains.</p>
<p>We worked closely with MAC to develop a set of rules and standards for this new type of digital certificate to mobilize the data generated through the&nbsp; TSM standard. This digital certificate, or ‘credential,’ is designed for organisations involved in extracting important resources. Our goal was to make this TSM digital credential as accurate and trustworthy as possible, similar to what we had previously achieved with the greenhouse gas credential in 2022. We aimed to base the TSM credential on direct, original data (source data) and combine technical methods with strong surrounding governance. This approach ensured that TSM data transmitted through this credential could maintain its reliability and integrity, increasing its value. It can then be used effectively by other companies and organisations further along in the supply chain.</p>
<p>TSM’s comprehensive approach, utilizing various environmental, social and climate change indicators, has been a great mechanism for promoting responsible production practices. Our work in this domain reflects our commitment to making TSM data not only more accessible but also a trusted element in global supply chains, reinforcing responsible mining practices worldwide.</p>
<p>In late 2023, we achieved a significant milestone by enabling mines&nbsp;to self-issue their TSM reports for the years 2021, 2022, and 2023 in the form of digital credentials, which were then digitally presented to MAC using this innovative method. This accomplishment marked a huge milestone for our objective of creating trusted data inputs for supply chains. In this process, we also involved PricewaterhouseCoopers and Envirochem, two recognised TSM verification firms. The two verification firms created externally verified TSM reports as digital credentials for the two mines in question. Essentially, this means that when a mining company receives one of these digital reports from their verifier, it comes with the verifier’s digital signature. This signature proves that the report is genuine and hasn’t been altered. When the mining company shares this report with other supply chain participants, everyone can trust the data accuracy and provenance.</p>
<p>Here is an overview of the ecosystem which Northern Block is supporting with both the Mines Act Permit and TSM credentials:</p>
 <p>Note that in this image, the Government of British Columbia has developed its own digital credential system for government ministries, independent of Northern Block’s system. However, both systems are capable of communicating with each other due to their use of interoperable technology. It’s important to recognize that a digital trust ecosystem can involve many different actors, each potentially using services from various providers. A key advantage of this decentralized approach is the flexibility it offers participants, allowing them to choose their preferred platforms without being confined to a single, centralized system.</p> 
<p>This advancement was a substantial step in making the existing international TSM standard more accessible for supply chain participants. Our next focus is on broadening its use and creating a demand generation strategy. Given the increasing demand for high-integrity data in supply chains, we believe that our efforts have established crucial foundational groundwork.</p>
 Why do digital credentials help create supply chain transparency in the mining industry? 
<p>Digital credentials are based on internationally accepted technical and governance standards that are meant to facilitate digital trust. A digital trust architecture enables any two entities to share data between themselves in a trusted manner, independent of the system or application they’re using. This can be compared to email clients, where emails are reliably sent and received regardless of the different clients being used (e.g., like Microsoft Outlook and Google’s Gmail). This reliability is due to the use of common underlying protocols (a common language). Digital trust solutions leverage a common set of protocols, enabling them to exchange trusted data between themselves, with Security, Privacy, Authenticity and Confidentiality in mind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This allowed us to conduct trusted data exchanges between different systems. For example, we facilitated a live exchange&nbsp; between the Government of British Columbia and CMM, where CMM was able to use Northern Block’s ‘Orbit Enterprise Wallet’ to receive a digital credential representation of their Mines Permit. This was issued by the Government of British Columbia, from their credential issuance system, and CMM was able to receive the offer, and upon accepting it, stored the credential within their digital wallet, hosted by Northern Block. This demonstrates that by speaking a common set of standards and protocols, technical interoperability is attainable, avoiding enforcing any supply chain participants to use a specific solution, similar to how email works!</p>
<p>A key aspect of digital trust stems from digital signatures using cryptography. Whenever a piece of data (a digital credential) is sent from an authoritative party to another, that data is signed, becoming tamper-proof and backed by verifiable governance processes. For instance, when a supply chain participant consumes verifiable TSM data as a digital credential proof, they can be confident about the data’s provenance, knowing it came from a mine or the mine’s auditor, and that it followed the correct governance established by MAC. This creates a root of trust for ecosystems that wish to consume that data.</p>
<p>Once these digital credentials are available, they can be shared with any participant in an ecosystem at the discretion of the credential holder. For example, a mining company can easily share this data with investors, buyers, or ESG marketplaces with just a click of a button. They can also selectively share different credentials, controlling what data they share and with whom. Being able to mix and match various types of verifiable data can unlock new efficiencies and value creation opportunities. For example, CMM may share with an investor a proof that they’re a recognised mine in British Columbia, along with selective ESG data from their TSM credential. In this case, they were able to share data that came from two separate, but verifiable sources. The investor will know that all data proofs shared are authentic. This example starts to make us think about some of the efficiencies and new opportunities when being able to mix and match data from various sources.</p>
<p>By converting this data into digital credentials and storing them in wallets owned by the data owners, it becomes easier to share within supply chains, thereby making it more available. This is particularly important in the context of ESG reporting, where fraud is a concern. Digital trust is crucial because it allows for the creation of supply chain data inputs that are authentic and verifiable.</p>
<p>Ultimately, digital trust technologies will elevate the level of trust within critical mineral supply chains. Creating supply chain transparency is only as effective as the data that flows into it. Our goal is to ensure that the data entering supply chains is of high integrity and value, and our work to-date aligns well with the Canadian Critical Minerals Strategy.</p>
 Northern Block’s Mining Credentialing Solutions 
<p>Northern Block has been dedicated to developing enterprise digital credentialing technology suitable for a variety of applications. In early 2020, we launched the first commercial graded digital credential management platform in Canada, called NB Orbit Enterprise ; a no-code digital trust web-based platform that facilitates the storage, issuance and verification of digital credentials that are held and owned by organisations in digital wallets. The platform contains a collection of components based on identity management, distributed and edge computing, distributed ledger technologies and cryptography. Importantly, it is compatible with global digital trust standards and protocols.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some of the components available within Orbit Enterprise that we leveraged for this particular critical minerals digital trust project:</p>
 
 Organisational Wallet: a component that allows organisations to receive digital credential offers from their peers, such as governments and auditors, and securely store them in the organisational wallet (e.g., Mines Permit credential, TSM credential).&nbsp; 
 Secure Connection Manager: This tool helps organisations set up secure, two-way communication channels with each other. Once these channels are established, they can exchange information safely and privately, ensuring that all communications are genuine and confidential. 
 Digital Credential Creation and Sharing Module: This is a service that allows organisations to create and issue digital credentials, like digital IDs or certificates, either to themselves or to other organisations. It also includes features for requesting credentials, negotiating terms, and sending secure messages. This is particularly useful in business-to-business (B2B) situations, where two organisations need to collaborate on issuing these digital credentials. 
 Digital Credential Verification and Exchange Toolkit: This toolkit is used by organisations to either ask for proof of digital credentials from others or to provide proof of their own credentials. It supports collaboration and communication, similar to the credential issuance service, making it easier for organisations to verify each other’s credentials. 
 Credential Governance Toolkit: This toolkit is designed for creating and managing the rules and designs for digital credentials. It’s used by authoritative bodies to set standards and publish these credentials to trusted data registries. organisations can use this toolkit to follow these standards when issuing credentials. It also helps ensure that the branding and legitimacy of these credentials are consistent, especially in supply chains, so that everyone recognizes and trusts them. 
 
 Call to Action 
<p>If you are interested in contributing to the growth of this ecosystem, <a href="mailto:info@northernblock.io">we would love to hear from you</a>. Our initiative welcomes participation from a diverse range of stakeholders, including natural resource companies, data consumers in need of high-integrity sustainability data, government regulators, and technology solution providers. It will require the collective effort of many strong participants to elevate this ecosystem to the next level and generate a network effect. We are confident in the foundational elements already in place, especially our credentials rooted in authoritative trust. This foundation paves the way for an array of future use cases and broader applications.</p>

 ‘We can afford what we can actually do’ — 1 <p>Across the country people from all walks of life — from those running families to those running organisations and Governments — are wrestling with financial shortfalls that restrict what they can do. This three part series asks ‘Is there a positive way forward?’</p><p>Sometimes, in order to deal with a difficult problem, we have to embrace a paradox. Paradoxes happen when one thing — call it Proposition A — is clearly, incontrovertibly, undeniably true, but when something else opposite — call it Proposition B — is also clearly, incontrovertibly, undeniably true. In situations like this, to move forward, we have to find a way of holding both ideas in our minds at the same&nbsp;time.</p><p>Right now this paradox is hitting us all. Increasingly. With a vengeance. This is the paradox of ‘affordability’.</p><p>The first part of this paradox — the Proposition A bit — is the common understanding that “we can only do what we can afford”. If we’ve only got so much money to spend, there is only so much we can spend it on. Full stop. The simple reality of our situation. And, if because of circumstances beyond our control, we find ourselves with less money, then there are even less things that we can spend it on&nbsp;… less things that we can&nbsp;do.</p><p>This is not a happy situation. It’s a tough, harsh reality affecting millions of people today in every walk of life. It’s the day to day misery of millions of families wrestling with poverty. It’s looming centre stage across the nation’s local authorities, with 20% of them verging on bankruptcy. It’s causing a crisis in health and&nbsp;care.</p><p>It’s also dominating Government policies. ‘Only doing what we can afford’ — ‘austerity’ — has been the one theme that has dominated UK Government policies for decades now, particularly since the great financial crash of 2008. Over many years the Scottish Government has promised to do many things such as abolish child poverty. But in the last few months it has presided over a budget which will result in the exact opposite. It, too, is knuckling down to the harsh realities of ‘we can only do what we can&nbsp;afford’.</p><p>If the Labour Party gets elected at the forthcoming UK General Election things may not change all that much either. Labour leader Keir Starmer is making a big point that whatever promises he makes “in the end the fiscal rule comes first”. We can only do what we can&nbsp;afford.</p><p>Yet&nbsp;…</p> We’ve been here&nbsp;before! <p>As a society we’ve been here before, only worse. In the dark days of the Second World War for example, Britain had run out of money. It had spent every penny fighting the Nazis. Then, in the early days of 1942, there was a chink of light. Perhaps, after all, we might actually win the war! As this thought took hold, peoples’ attention began to turn to the question: what comes next? How to win the peace? How to&nbsp;rebuild?</p><p>This triggered an almighty spat between the forces of financial orthodoxy — the people whose worldview was dominated by the mantra ‘we can only do what we afford’ — and those whose focus was on underlying economic realities.</p><p>John Maynard Keynes believed that keeping to the mantra ‘we can only do what we can afford’ would be disastrous. “At one level — the formal level of bank balances — it’s true we can only do what we can afford,” he said. “But at another level — of underlying economic reality — it’s nonsense. In fact, the exact opposite is true. In reality, we can afford what we can actually do”. This was his Proposition B.</p><p>Keynes didn’t actually use the words in the above paragraph. But below are the words he used in a BBC broadcast on 2 April 1942, when he took the spat between the two worldviews public. Keynes called for an ambitious programme to “build homes, libraries, theatres, concert halls and dance halls” so that “every substantial city [has] the dignity of an ancient university or a European capital”.</p><p>But the financial establishment would have none of it. We don’t have the money, they argued. We can only do what we can&nbsp;afford.</p><p>This is how Keynes replied to the financiers (whom he addressed as ‘Sir John’) in his BBC&nbsp;talk.</p><blockquote>“The money?”, I said. “But surely, Sir John, you don’t build houses with money? Do you mean that there won’t be enough bricks and mortar and steel and&nbsp;cement?”</blockquote><blockquote>“Oh no,” he replied, “of course there will be plenty of all&nbsp;that”.</blockquote><blockquote>“Do you mean,” I went on, “that there won’t be enough labour? For what will the builders be doing if they are not building&nbsp;houses?”</blockquote><blockquote>“Oh no,” he replied, “of course there will be plenty of all&nbsp;that”.</blockquote><blockquote>“Well,” I said “if there are bricks and mortar and steel and concrete and labour and architects, why not assemble all this good material in&nbsp;houses?”</blockquote><p>Keynes finished his talk by saying “anything we can actually do we can afford”: wherever there are people with skills and energy capable of doing work, and wherever there are sources of energy and materials that could be deployed, then it’s possible to bring them together to meet human needs. When push comes to shove it is what we can actually do that defines ‘affordability’.</p> Riding two&nbsp;horses <p>The point about paradoxes is that to embrace the truths they both contain, we need to keep them both in mind at the same time. For many people running families, organisations, institutions and Governments today Proposition A — that we can only do what we can afford — dominates their days. Day in and day out, they struggle endlessly with the realities of financial constraints; of having to make hard, miserable choices that stop them doing things they really want to&nbsp;do.</p><p>They feel they don’t have a choice and in one sense they are right. The institutional reality of their situation is that the less money they have, they less they can do. If they start spending money they don’t have — beyond what they can ‘afford’ — they risk going bankrupt.</p><p>Yet only acting on Proposition A ignores the truth of Proposition B — that, as a society we can afford what we can actually do. And the more we focus only on Proposition A the more we actually reduce what we can actually do. And over time, that makes our situation worse, not better. Focusing only on Proposition A is a trap, placing us on a spiral of&nbsp;decline.</p><p>Somehow, then, we have to find a way of acting on Proposition B even as we wrestle with the constraints that Proposition A forces upon&nbsp;us.</p><p>What does this mean? It means that none of us has only one job. None of us can focus only on doing what we can ‘afford’ to do. Even as we wrestle with the constraints of Proposition A, somehow, somewhere, we need to find ways of also opening up and expanding what we can actually do. We all have two jobs to do. Two horses to ride, even if very often they pull us in different directions.</p><p>Our next blog looks at some of the ways we can do&nbsp;this.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/we-can-afford-what-we-can-actually-do-1-efdca9835617">‘We can afford what we can actually do’ — 1</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>As we reflect on Data Privacy Day 2024, the significance of safeguarding digital identities takes center stage in our increasingly interconnected world. The so-called conflict between “seamless user experience” and security (aka “friction”) is over — the only answer is that security has to be welcomed as part of the experience. Breaches affect our livelihoods, reputations, and families, so a little friction is not just a necessary evil, but an inherent part of the trust ecosystem.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, data breaches and privacy scandals have become alarmingly commonplace, raising concerns about the security of our personal information. From large-scale corporate breaches to individual cases of identity theft, the threats to our digital privacy persist and continue to evolve.</p>
<p>As technology continues to advance at a rapid pace, so too do the tools and techniques employed by malicious actors. From sophisticated hacking attempts to more subtle forms of data mining, our personal information is constantly under siege. Even the most highly trained security professionals may miss increasingly realistic AI-generated phishing scams, across text, voice, and video.</p>
<p>To counter this, CISOs across industries are grappling with the daunting task of securing these digital identities against an ever-evolving threat landscape. As we observe this year’s Data Privacy Week, the need for organizations to prioritize the protection of digital identities has never been more pronounced.</p>
<p>In the face of these challenges, CISOs must adopt a proactive and multi-faceted approach to fortify digital identity security.</p>
<p>Here are some key strategies that organizations can implement:</p>
 
 Zero Trust Architecture: Embracing a Zero Trust model involves assuming that no user or system is inherently trustworthy. By implementing strict access controls, continuous monitoring, and robust authentication mechanisms, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access. 
 Biometric Authentication: As passwords continue to be a weak link in the security chain, biometric authentication is gaining prominence. Fingerprint scans, facial recognition, and other biometric identifiers provide an additional layer of security, making it harder for malicious actors to compromise digital identities. 
 User Education and Awareness: Human error remains a leading cause of security breaches. CISOs should prioritize ongoing cybersecurity training programs to educate employees and users about the importance of protecting their digital identities. Recognizing phishing attempts and practicing good cyber hygiene can go a long way in preventing identity-related incidents. 
 Comprehensive Data Encryption: Implementing end-to-end encryption for sensitive data ensures that even if unauthorized access occurs, the intercepted information remains indecipherable. This is particularly crucial for protecting communication channels and data in transit. 
 Phishing-Resistant MFA: Bad actors are finding ways to bypass multi-factor authentication, but phishing-resistant MFA can help address these new attacks by incorporating multiple layers of protection requiring more authentication as well as proximity. 
 
<p>The imperative to protect digital identities has never been more crucial. CISOs play a pivotal role in shaping the cybersecurity landscape of their organizations, and their strategies must adapt to the evolving challenges posed by cyber threats. By embracing innovative technologies, fostering a culture of security awareness, and adhering to robust privacy practices, organizations can navigate the digital seas with confidence, safeguarding the identities of individuals in an interconnected world.</p>

<p>Reconfiguring Transition Landscapes</p><p>Entering 2024, it becomes increasingly important to shift the focus from immediate technological and demographic trends to the broader systemic tendencies that are likely to shape the future and options landscape. The seven drivers outlined below must be understood against a systemic backdrop of steadily declining foundational systems of civilisation — from decreasing available arable land along with structural decline in quality at a planetary scale, a quantum decline in energy returned for energy invested, to decreasing global well-being and a decline in life expectancy.</p><p>These fundamental shifts place us in a new paradigm where foundational resources are relatively diminishing in comparison to demand, while climate breakdown introduces increased volatility and shocks into the system. This volatility, coupled with a systemic decline, suggests we will face more shocks and an accelerating shortfall in nutrients, energy and well&nbsp;being.</p><p>As these factors converge, we don’t just mean fluctuating availability, but also significant price spikes. For instance, a 3–4% drop in food system availability, or 5% in aggregate, could lead to price increases of up to 400%. Such price volatility will lead to systemic inequality within and between nations, potentially triggering social tipping points. It is within this context and transition that we need to consider the following trends.</p><p>These structural tendencies, which demand both adaptation and mitigation, are key factors in determining how we evolve and adapt in the years (if not decades) ahead. Some of these tendencies will naturally allow for evolutionary progress, while others will require significant adaptation. Understanding these tendencies from a structural perspective is crucial because they form the undercurrents that will influence long-term trajectories. Recognizing and responding to these systemic tendencies and propensities will be essential in navigating the complex landscape of our future, and shaping our decisions, innovations, and strategies for the decades to&nbsp;come.</p><p>The essence of the “propensities” defined below lies in a profound transformation of our constraint space shifting our approach towards technology, society, and future planning. Furthermore, it is important to recognize that these propensities have historically always existed. What is now being manifested is that those propensities are not just a functional reality for the “ignorable many”, but becoming the dominant propensity at a planetary scale.This transformation is reshaping the very notions of progress, the integration of technology into daily existence, and the structuring of institutions.</p><p>These tendencies and propensities transcend the simple adoption of new technologies or the following of emerging trends. They represent a more profound, structural evolution in our collective thought processes and approaches. They signify a departure from linear, predictable models derived from extensions of ‘the adjacent possible’ socio-technical landscape based on present-day comprehensions.</p><p>In the following sections, 7 of these pivotal propensities are presented. Readers and participants are encouraged to critically engage with these ideas, offering their perspectives and insights. These shifts appear increasingly essential in framing and supporting the magnitude of the transition and more critically the innovation landscapes necessary to provide pathways for the transition.</p>  Multi-Perspectival Pathways for&nbsp;Tomorrow  <p>The transformation towards a multipolar world is one of the most structural shifts that the world is facing and it is driving profound changes in our pathway of transition. This multipolar world view increasingly extends beyond geopolitics, permeating into foundational shifts and divergences in transition pathways for societies.</p><p>The multiperspectival approach to climate transition underscores the growing portfolio of strategies being implemented globally — either passively or actively, each reflecting unique civilizational insights, lock-ins and interests. COP28 started to crystallize this emerging reality, with a breakdown in the hegemony of a singular transition pathway.</p><p>In this context, it is important to recognise that there appear to be at least three structural principal transition perspectives emerging:</p><p>Supply Side — Asset &amp; Investment Driven Transformation<br>Predominantly observed in the U.S., this strategy emphasizes the creation and enhancement of assets to revolutionize supply chains and technologies. It entails substantial investments in new technologies and infrastructure, nurturing innovation ecosystems, enacting supportive policies and regulations, fostering public-private collaborations, and integrating global supply chains. The goal is to transform supply and technology landscapes while promoting economic growth and competitiveness. It will necessitate new market design and financial innovations.</p><p>Integrated Transition Strategies:<br>This method aims to fundamentally alter supply-side technologies while simultaneously managing or reducing demand. Its’ complexity arises from the dual focus on high-cost supply-side innovation and transitioning demand, necessitating changes in consumer behavior and infrastructure adaptation. The central challenge is to harmonize advancing supply technologies with evolving demand trends, targeting resilience and sustainability. This strategy requires robust policy and regulatory frameworks for successful implementation but perhaps more critically the capacity for societies to make legitimate decisions at the speed and scale necessary.</p><p>Offset Systems<br>In regions like Saudi Arabia, where hydrocarbon energy base costs are low, investing in offset technologies becomes a strategic focus. This includes carbon capture and storage, efficiency enhancements, alternative hydrocarbon applications, and geo-engineering. This approach, contrasting with European or American strategies, leans towards maintaining the hydrocarbon economy while seeking to reduce or mitigate future environmental It’s’&nbsp;. This strategy necessitates novel methods for managing planetary risks and innovations. Moreover, the unproven technologies that it is reliant on will most certainly accelerate climate breakdown risks in the short&nbsp;term.</p><p>These divergent transition pathways will require adopting shared, dialogic and negotiation frameworks for handling different planetary risks and allocations and making provisions for them, not just within national contexts but also in relation to the planet as a whole (i.e. if we are to avoid a race to the bottom and collective self termination). holding and management of these risks on a global scale calls for an innovative form of systemic-level innovation from countries. It means rethinking and redesigning the way that risks are assessed (including historically accrued risks), addressed, and mitigated, integrating both national priorities and planetary responsibilities. Such an approach is crucial for navigating the complex, interlinked challenges that define the current era. It requires a shift towards more collaborative, integrated risk management strategies at the planetary level.</p><p>The multiperspectival nature of the climate transition calls for diverse innovation economies, national and metanational alliances, and a reimagined approach to negotiation and collaboration. Navigating this multipolar landscape requires recognizing varied transition pathways, managing geopolitical effects, balancing risks and trade-offs, and adapting to a substantial shift in global transitions. This multipolar, multi perspectival scenario necessitates sophisticated, economic diplomacy to forge a viable, and non-self terminating, equitable future</p><p>2. Planetary justice as a precursor for a planetary transition</p><p>The emergence and embedding of a multipolar world is also revealing long-standing injustices and accelerating future injustices, previously obscured by asymmetric and extractive power dynamics. The addressing of these injustices is not just an ethical imperative, but also a practical necessity for any large-scale planetary agreement on the necessary transitions ahead. The danger is not just that and equitable transitions might be otherwise being impeded by deeply rooted systemic injustices but any transition will be impeded itself progressing us to a path of mutually assured destruction. This stalemate response when confronting structural barriers has hitherto been the status quo. Tackling such injustices on a planetary scale demands substantial and concerted effort as they prevent a viable pathway towards the magnitude of change that will&nbsp;be.</p><p>3. High Interest High Inflation Macroeconomics</p><p>The macroeconomic landscape is also shifting alongside the unfurling implications of climate change intensifying in an increasingly multipolar world. We are witnessing increased market volatility and a more pressing scramble for transition materials — driven not just by market dynamics but also by existential necessities and increasing conflict.</p><p>This confluence of factors is likely to induce a sustained high-inflationary environment within the economic system and might drive a persistently high interest rate environment that will systemically restrain investment broadly especially in environments most vulnerable to planetary risks. It will throttle our capacity to mitigate the runaway risks associated with climate breakdown (i.e. with the exception of entities wielding substantial economic&nbsp;power).</p><p>Moreover, such macroeconomic factors are going to systemically accelerate the missing trillions problem, throttling the flow of capital into the real world economy. This is because as both the volatilities increase, future uncertainties increase, and the cost of capital will become increasingly prohibitive.</p><p>Moreover, this shift is poised to aggravate systemic inequalities, disproportionately affecting the poorest and most vulnerable and marginalized by rapidly increasing the cost of living. As systemic inequality widens, it will threaten to destabilize nation-states. This paradigm shift presents a formidable challenge, making global economies more susceptible to fragility. Addressing these emerging vulnerabilities will require systemic innovation at the monetary level that cannot be discounted and will increasingly become a systemic throttle if not addressed.</p><p>4. Operating in a Security&nbsp;World</p><p>The transition from a world predominantly driven by free trade principles to one increasingly centered around security agreements has been accelerating over the past six years (e.g. the UK/US Atlantic agreement or UK/Japan agreement). The shift towards security-based alliances is expected to continue, with an evolving and broadening definition of security. Recent trends have started to integrate critical technologies into security frameworks, and we can foresee this expansion to further encompass areas such as nutrition, critical minerals (already a traditional focus in security) and essential health commodities and&nbsp;needs.</p><p>The expansion of the security domain will also necessitate an even greater systems-based approach to security.</p><p>In a more systems-oriented worldview, the traditional concept of nation-state boundaries will undergo a fundamental change. Instead of being defined by geographical lines, states will be characterized by their critical metabolic flows that do not respect national boundaries. It is foreseen that these flows, encompassing energy, materials, and other vital resources, will increasingly become the definitional landscape of statehood. This perspective emphasizes the importance of resource dynamics and interdependencies in defining national identity and capabilities.</p><p>Furthermore, it is crucial to acknowledge that the increasing securitization of the world also paves the way for the weaponization of various elements. This might include areas such as food supplies, weather systems, geo-infrastructures, material goods, energy grids, and information systems. As security concerns broaden, so too does the scope of potential weaponization. This development raises fundamental questions about our response strategies. Relying solely on market transaction-based frameworks is increasingly insufficient for understanding the value and risks associated with such diverse sectors. A more comprehensive approach is needed to address the complexities that they&nbsp;present.</p><p>As we begin to recognize and operationalize security within these new frameworks of entanglement, we will see planetary-scale reconfigurations. This evolution signifies a deepening understanding of our interconnectedness and the need for comprehensive strategies in addressing security challenges.</p><p>The extension of the security framework to incorporate elements like energy, critical materials, food systems, and health infrastructures is poised to significantly reshape the planetary landscape. The move from a commodities-centric free trade world to one focused on security goods and security alliances will be pivotal in determining the pathways for future transitions. This growing emphasis on security is likely to transform international relations and economic agendas, marking a profound shift in the way that global interdependencies and cooperation are perceived and navigated. This evolution marks a new era in global geopolitics, where security considerations permeate multiple aspects of international engagement and decision-making.</p><p>5. The New Environmental Right</p><p>There is an emergence of what can be described as a surge in environmental nationalism (e.g. rise of AFD in Germany and its recent positions on environmental risks). This brand of nationalism is dedicated to the protection of environmental systems, advocating for methods such as population reduction (principally l by reducing migration) as means to conserve environmental resources. This is poised to be a defining feature of the new political right wing. Environmental nationalism is set to introduce a systemic form of austerity that transcends traditional public goods. Its primary focus will be on enacting austerity measures on essential environmental resources and might be used as a lever to propel a more nationalistic agenda.</p><p>Whilst such ideology is ostensibly aimed at preserving certain environmental aspects for particular socio-economic groups, it may also serve as a driving force for increasing systemic inequality. Its selective approach to conserving and allocating environmental resources is likely to generate imbalances, privileging certain groups while disadvantaging others and/or exacerbating existing disparities. A notable characteristic of such environmental nationalism will be its propensity to externalize environmental degradation. It prioritizes the maintenance and conservation of high environmental standards within its own borders, often by shifting environmental burdens to other regions or nations. This practice, akin to a form of passive economic warfare, is expected to intensify. Nations adopting this ideology may prioritize their internal environmental quality, frequently at the detriment of the broader global environment. This leads to aggravated issues like pollution and resource depletion elsewhere. Such externalization tactics, rapidly escalating under the banner of environmental nationalism, are likely to contribute to global environmental imbalances and tensions, complicating the quest for unified, worldwide environmental objectives.</p><p>6. Labour&nbsp;Crisis</p><p>Furthermore, a labor crisis is being evidenced in advanced economies that are grappling with diminishing labor supply, particularly noticeable in care and transition sectors. For example, numerous areas are readying for substantial urban and community retrofits, but face a shortfall in the workforce that is required to carry out such projects. Moreover, demographic shifts in these economies are outpacing the development of sufficient care infrastructure and labor resources.</p><p>To overcome such labor challenges, groundbreaking strategies are required. It entails a greater reliance on automation, significant investments in demand shifting infrastructures and human capital development and a structural reevaluation and reimagination of migration policies and international relations — such as multi-tier citizenships such as digital nomad and essential services visas or multi-tier participation rights and obligations. Such shifts are vital to reconfigure how we approach the new mass demands of work — from care provision to managing large-scale transition such as retrofits in a 21st-century context (especially considering the constraints on&nbsp;labor).</p><p>These labor issues and constraints are poised to drive profound change in the innovation landscape and transition strategies. The accessibility and distribution of labor and human resources will emerge as a key systemic limitation, with its impact varying significantly across the globe. This factor will be instrumental in determining the nature and efficacy of strategies for transition.</p><p>7. Information Flooding</p><p>The seventh foundational shift reshaping our organizational structures pertains to the nature of information economies. Human systems and institutional economies are inundated with an overwhelming flow of information, fundamentally altering our information processing methods. Instead of synthesizing and comprehensively understanding this influx, we are increasingly reliant on pattern-based computations. This approach involves identifying adjacent patterns to make sense of emerging data trends — a significant departure from traditional methods of knowledge processing.</p><p>However, knowledge institutions are designed to regulate the computation of knowledge rather than pattern recognition. Therefore they struggle to keep pace with the rapid influx of information, either in the computation of information or the pattern sharing. They are increasingly unable to adapt quickly enough to new demands or develop alternative frameworks for understanding. This gap in societal processing capability opens the door to the weaponization of pattern spaces, where myths and false narratives can proliferate, filling the voids left by conventional institutional computation. We are witnessing an era where the ‘hallucination of patterns’ becomes a systematic method to manage the deluge of information.</p><p>A critical challenge will be to construct a new institutional economy that is equipped to handle the scale of information overload. It necessitates a deep understanding of how societies process information and a structural reevaluation of current systems. Addressing this will be key to enhancing our collective capacity and capabilities for managing and facilitating the transition in an era of information abundance.</p><p>It is essential to effectively address societal capability to process vast quantities of information in order to construct robust decision-making structures that are fit for an era marked by heightened complexity and built on mass distribution of agency. The challenge will lie not only in developing information processing and decision-making systems for society, but also how to build such systems as a network capability of society as a whole, rather than for a representative few.</p><p>Moreover, the building of such systems is not just an operational necessity; it is a fundamental issue that sits at the heart of our societal evolution to transcend the transition challenge. These systems must be capable of managing the deluge of information and translating it into coherent, mass multi-agent decision-making processes that are both inclusive and effective in scope and&nbsp;context.</p><p>Navigating the Shift: A New Era of Planetarity **</p><p>The effort of this post is driven by the need to perceive, acknowledge and anticipate these structural changes with regard to our investments in innovation and transition frameworks and recognising that this is essential to prevent an escalating planetary landscape that becomes increasingly in crisis and at risk of geopolitical tension and conflict.</p><p>A dual purpose is served in understanding these contextual shifts. Firstly, the structural nature of the challenges that we face are acknowledged. More importantly, it involves devising of a new class of relevant innovative strategies and domains for the adaptation and mitigation of the impact of these shifts as society transitions.</p><p>Further, as we examine such transitions, we must recognize this moment presents a move from an era defined by industrial internationalism, with its colonisation and extractionism, to a new phase of multipolarity and systemic interconnectedness. This transition, from 19th century globalization to a nascent phase of planetarism, demands care if we are to preserve essential systemic capabilities that we have built as a planetary civilization (such as those exemplified by the microchip, antibiotics, satellites etc.), whilst we systemically and justly rewire our energy, materials, nutrient and cognition systems.</p><p>As we look towards the future, it is becoming increasingly evident that our pathways will not follow a single, universal transition. Instead, it will be characterized by a highly multipolar, multi-perspective, and hyperpluralistic approach. The critical question then becomes: how can we preserve this diversity of perspectives and multipolarity while fostering a new theory of diplomacy? This theory must be rooted in coordination, empathy, and respect amidst such diversity.</p><p>Central to this endeavor may be our ability to construct a new framework for diplomacy that can facilitate negotiation and understanding between various worldviews, playing a pivotal role in crafting a planetary future capable of embracing complex diversities (hard and soft power, new relational theories and a framework that acknowledges interconnected and, shared destinies on a global scale (both human, more than human and machine capability).</p><p>In addition, innovative institutions and the development of new institutional capacities will be required. The concept of diplomacy needs to be reimagined, including by the use of computational machinery and dynamic protocols that can make diplomacy not only more efficient but also legitimate by effectively integrating non-nation state actors and different regional blocs and perspectives, wider groups such as indigenous nations, and even diplomacy that takes into account future generations and more than human species. At last, the infrastructure exists to support the most providing the necessary infrastructure to support the most diverse of plurality. This will lay the groundwork for a new planetary future — and one that harmoniously integrates an array of perspectives and approaches.</p><p>Furthermore, it is also becoming increasingly apparent that as we shift away from our current material economy — a system that has generated abundance for some segments of society and scarcity for others — we are entering an era marked by greater scarcity. This transition could potentially lead us towards a novel concept of abundance. However, this journey is not without its challenges. As we begin to encounter the limitations inherent in our economies, particularly the rise of net-zero-sum scenarios, the risk of conflict and war further escalates.</p> The crucial question is: how do we navigate this transition? How do we move from a reality dominated by the dynamics of abundance through a valley of scarcity to a new paradigm of abundance? The new abundance could be conceptualized not just in material terms but also in terms of meaning. As we constrain our material economy and reshape the social signaling functions that it serves, we need to approach this transformation with careful consideration. There is a potential, perhaps in the next 40 years, to unlock a new era of energy abundance. This could revolutionize our material economy, creating both material and cognitive abundance in ways previously unimagined. <p>While this future pathway holds a promise, it is important to acknowledge that we are entering a world characterized by diminishing — particularly 19th century concepts of abundances. The implications of operating in such a world are profound and warrant significant attention and strategic planning.</p><p>Indy Johar with support from Dm colleagues — all errors and omissions are&nbsp;mine…</p> <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/7-structural-shifts-25c5e0801b9b">7 Structural Shifts:</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Cloud storage is amazing — and risky 







<p>The 2000s may be over, but cloud storage is still amazing. Services such as <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>, Apple’s <a href="https://www.icloud.com/">iCloud</a>, Google’s <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/">Drive</a>, and Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/online-cloud-storage">OneDrive</a> all help users share files with friends, recover when a hard drive crashes, and move files between their devices. Still, hearing about data breaches[<a href="https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/dropbox-files-left-unprotected-open-to-all">1</a>, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/nz74qb/hackers-stole-over-60-million-dropbox-accounts">2</a>, <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/dropbox-breach-130-github/">3</a>] leaves people wondering whether their data is safe in the cloud.</p>



 Security on today’s cloud lacks end-to-end encryption 







<p>Today’s cloud storage services use fairly similar client–server architectures that start with a locally installed application that monitors a specific file folder on a user’s computer. When the app detects changes in the folder, it relays them to the user’s account on the cloud. The cloud service handles copying them to a user’s other devices.</p>



<p>One of the problems with cloud storage is that files are not end–to–end encrypted (E2EE) – meaning that files encrypted before leaving a user’s device do not remain encrypted until they return. Rather, most providers use the transport encryption + encryption at rest paradigm. In this model, transport encryption encrypts files sent to the server (e.g., HTTPS), but decrypts them upon arrival. Next, the server applies encryption at rest so that only encrypted files are stored. While providers tout the strength of their encryption algorithms (e.g., AES 256), what they don’t highlight is that the server decrypts user files before re-encrypting them and that they hold the decryption keys!</p>



<p>While this model is efficient, it is vulnerable to attack or service provider bugs and unfortunately is the mainstay of cloud storage. This leaves users wondering: Are cloud providers accessing my data? and Can hackers steal my digital files? &nbsp;</p>



 We can make the cloud safer with Decentralized Identity 



<p>Answering those questions is difficult and varies over time. So, how do individual users protect their files in the cloud? One idea is to help users layer end–to–end encryption (E2EE) on top of any features the cloud storage services provide. This is fairly easy using the cryptographic features of decentralized identity (DI).</p>



<p>The DIDComm messaging specification was created to provide a platform-independent yet interoperable encrypted messaging capability that enables users of a wide range of DI platforms to exchange end-to-end encrypted messages.</p>



<p>This E2EE messaging capability can be used to secure files stored on virtually any cloud storage platform without divulging any plaintext file data content to the cloud service. Further, by storing secure files in an encrypted messaging format, those files can potentially be activated to later perform a myriad of secure file services for security and privacy conscious users.</p>

 Stakers can claim DF73 rewards. DF74 runs Jan 25 — Feb 1,&nbsp;2024  1. Overview <p>Ocean Data Farming (DF) is Ocean’s incentives program. In DF, you can earn OCEAN rewards by locking OCEAN, curating data, and making predictions (in Predictoor). <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">Here are DF&nbsp;docs</a>.</p><p>Data Farming Round 73 (DF73) has completed. 150K OCEAN + 20K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am Jan 18, 2024 and ended 12:01am Jan 25. You can claim rewards at the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards"> DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF74 is live today, Jan 25. It concludes on Feb 1. 150K OCEAN and 20k ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF74   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF74 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 20k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  You can read the details for how Predictoor DF Reward Amounts work&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa#58d9">here</a>.  Read how to optimize Predictoor rewards&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/rewards-mechanisms-of-ocean-predictoor-6f76c942baf7?source=collection_home---4------0-----------------------">here</a>.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

 Are you the top Data Scientist in the land? Demonstrate your case for 1st place in this year’s data challenge championship season.  Introduction <p>This blog introduces the kickoff of the 2024 Ocean Protocol Data Challenge Championship. The<a href="https://bit.ly/48ngARo"> first Data Challenge of the year</a> is live on Desights now and ends on Tuesday, Jan 30, 2024. ’24 is the 3rd year of Ocean Protocol-sponsored data science competitions. This year welcomes season 2 of the championship and leaderboard points. Additional details about the 2023 Season can be found <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/2023-data-challenge-championship-leaderboard-awards-f489cc45cf99">in this blog post</a>. Some minor details have been added/subtracted to this year’s championship, which are presented below:</p> What’s New This&nbsp;Season? <p>2023 welcomed over 200 unique data scientists competing in data challenges. To accommodate an increasing number of recurring participants, we have raised the prize pool for each data challenge from $5000 USD to $10,000 USD available every challenge. Due to this, the 200 OCEAN participation bonus for submitting reports &amp; proposals has concluded.</p><p>Starting with the current data challenge (<a href="https://bit.ly/48ngARo">Road to Safety: Traffic Accident Analysis</a>) the $10,000 prize pool will be distributed to the top 10 scored submissions per data challenge. Additionally, leaderboard points for the championship season will be rewarded for every challenge, scaled to the top 10 on a given data challenge. All participants outside of the top 10 will not receive points towards the championship season leaderboard. Furthermore, new data challenges will begin roughly on 2 Thursdays of each month, and each will be open to participate for 20 days. 2022 &amp; 2023 data challenges tested different time durations between 7–30 days. It has been determined that initiatives and hypothesis testing that require longer than 20 days will be tagged and executed as something other than a data challenge (data science competition).</p><p>Beyond the program structure, new features and functionalities of <a href="https://bit.ly/48ngARo">Desights.ai</a> continue to roll out regularly. Desights is the application that the Ocean Data Science team uses to conduct data challenges. The platform continues to mature as the web3 platform to crowdsource solutions to AI &amp; ML challenges, business intelligence, applied data science, and predictive analytics.</p> How It&nbsp;Works <p>There are 3 points to pay attention to while submitting:</p>  You will need a Desights Profile to submit to a data challenge. If you don’t have one, you can follow this simple tutorial to create one:<a href="https://docs.desights.ai/guides/creating-desights-profile"> https://docs.desights.ai/guides/creating-desights-profile</a>  Before submitting make sure you have the valid asset URL for your submission.

<p>When people talk about <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">onboarding and offboarding</a>, onboarding gets all the attention. We talk about how to make a <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/what-to-look-for-in-an-employee-onboarding-tool-for-small-businesses/">seamless onboarding experience and get your new employee to work fast</a>. How to provide them with the birthright apps they need to do their job. But we don’t talk about what happens when it’s time to part ways with an employee and what needs to be done then.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ensuring proper offboarding is a huge concern for small businesses. When you part ways with an employee, there’s a lot you can forget that can leave you vulnerable:&nbsp;</p>
 
 If the recovery email and phone number aren’t reset, the user might be able to regain access to their account. 
 If you forget to forward the user’s email, you might miss out on important communication from your customers.&nbsp; 
 If you don’t promptly deprovision the user’s accounts from third-party applications, you might be paying more in license costs than you need. 
 
<p>Luckily, it’s not all up to you to remember every step. Here’s how you can handle employee offboarding in YeshID.</p>
 Easier employee offboarding in YeshID 
<p>To offboard someone in YeshID, select that person from your Organization, and in the side car that opens, click ‘Offboard.’ From here, you can choose:&nbsp;</p>
 
 What action you wish to perform (suspending vs deleting) 
 Who, if anyone, to assign access to the employee’s Google Docs/Drive, Calendar, etc. data 
 Who, if anyone, should receive new email sent to the old address 
 When you would like the process initiated 
 
<p>As long as you are <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/3-reasons-to-ditch-the-access-management-spreadsheet-for-yeshid-access-grid/">managing application access</a> in YeshID, we will also create subtasks for applications which need to be deprovisioned. This is a big differentiator from how you can manage this process in the Google Workspace console. Offboarding directly in the console only turns off “sign in with Google” accounts for the user. But what about accounts that use a work email and password? YeshID helps you track all application access to make sure the user is offboarded from any company applications they had access to.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now let’s dive into each option.&nbsp;</p>
 Offboarding with the intention to suspend 
<p>This is a good option if you want to remove access for a user but don’t want to completely delete them. For example, maybe the user was privy to critical business data that you don’t want to risk losing, or maybe it’s a seasonal contractor that you plan to reinstate later in the year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s what happens when you suspend a user in YeshID:</p>
 
 The user’s data will be kept, but they won’t receive emails, calendar invitations, or files as long as they’re suspended (note: this does require you to maintain a Google Workspace license for the user).&nbsp; 
 Once you specify that the user is suspended, you will be prompted to create a task list to offboard the user from the applications they have access to.&nbsp; 
 Emails are sent to the application administrators, prompting them to remove access for the user at specified time. 
 You can “unsuspend” a user at any time, as long as they’re not deleted. 
 
<p></p>
 Offboarding with the intention to delete 
<p>This is a good option if you know that you want to remove the user entirely. When you delete a user, YeshID will:</p>
 
 Reset the Google Workspace password, which will revoke any application-specific passwords tied to the user’s account 
 Log the user out of every Google session across all of their devices by invalidating their session cookies 
 Delete the user’s account recovery email and phone numbers 
 Revoke all <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/navigating-the-oauth-maze-in-smb-identity-management/">OAuth grants associated with the user’s account</a> 
 Prompt you to create a task list to offboard the user from the applications they have access to 
 Send emails to application administrators, prompting them to remove access for the user at the specified time. 
 
<p>When you delete a user, YeshID will also create a list of tasks that an admin must manually complete. While the above steps will happen automatically, these steps require confirmation from the admin to continue:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Confirm that they have transferred all email from the account they wish to save, by using the Google Data Migration Service. 
 Initiate any data transfers that were configured in the YeshID offboarding dialog (Google Docs/Drive, Calendar, etc.). 
 Delete the account in Google Workspace. 
 Set the old email address as an alias on another account so you can continue receiving new email for the old account.&nbsp; 
 
<p></p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the last step here, creating an alias, can’t be done until you delete the user. Then you have to remember to come back to create the alias. It’s an easy step to forget — thankfully you have that task reminder in YeshID. 😉</p>
 Easier offboarding with technology 
<p>The task of offboarding a user contains many distinct steps, each of which can lead to issues if forgotten. Why take the risk? YeshID uses ready-made procedures that ensure you follow offboarding best practices and keep your environment safe and running smoothly. <a href="https://yeshid.com/">See how easy it can be</a>.</p>

<p>A context note from Mary Camacho: </p><p>As the executive director of an organization exploring new models of <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/revolutionizing-the-workspace/">human synergy and coordination</a>, I often think about how we can enable more inclusive collaboration globally.</p><p>So it was thrilling to have the chance to speak with Catherine Stihler, whose decades of experience in geopolitical relations has given her deep wisdom.</p><p>Our wide-ranging conversation covered many aspects of policy, technology, and governance. Fundamentally, it centered on a key question — how do we bridge the many divides that hinder human cooperation and collective problem-solving?&nbsp;</p><p>There were no simple answers, but identifying the barriers provided inspiration to keep striving for coherence across cultures. By exploring the intersections of technology, regulation, and how groups communicate, we identified commonalities underlying collective problem-solving. What follows is a summary of key noticings from the conversation.&nbsp;</p> Cultural Perspectives Complicate Collaboration <p>Successful <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/blending-physical-digital-collaboration/">collaboration</a> requires navigating varied mindsets and worldviews — a complex challenge. As Stihler noted, “How do you culturally navigate spaces and places?”</p><p>Her multinational career has shown that coherence demands understanding perspectives. Within the EU parliament alone, discussion happens in over 20 languages, demonstrating the diversity of communication styles. Even basic terms can mean different things across cultures.</p><p>Friction naturally occurs when bringing together people with different assumptions and motivations. As Stihler experienced, this tension is integral, if sometimes uncomfortable.</p><p>During negotiations, she focused on the ultimate policy aims that transcended cultural barriers. She focused on finding common purpose-centered compromises. Still, bridging divides can be challenging, given subjective identities and priorities. We must accept messiness in sharing space.</p><p>Keeping communication open despite discomfort aids progress. And the groups who govern play a key role in establishing incentives towards mutual understanding.</p> Inclusive Governance Requires Uncomfortable Coherence <p>Governance and policy processes necessitate navigating conflicting interests to reach collaborative decisions. As noted, this process contains inherent “tension” and “discomfort.” When representing constituencies with varying needs and values, perfect solutions fail.</p><p>Progress means reconciling disagreements.&nbsp;</p><p>Stihler recounted challenging EU regulations where health priorities competed with economic ones. Compromising entailed painful sacrifices on multiple sides. However, with shared underlying aims, adversaries transformed into collaborators united by a common purpose</p><p>While universal access to collaboration and information is ideal, Stihler noted that some limitations can spur healthy competition, stating:</p><blockquote>“Not all barriers are bad. Some can encourage innovations.”</blockquote><p>For example, within a single economic market, preventing total domination by one company allows space for newcomers and alternate models like co-ops. Rules ensure stability while still providing openings for diverse contributors.</p> Overcoming Persistent Digital Divides <p>Despite the connectivity promised by digital tools, barriers still limit access and divide users. As Stihler explained, restrictions like “geo-blocking” prevent sharing media across country borders, hindering collaboration. While the EU’s “Digital Single Market” intended seamlessness, gaps remain, frustrating users across member states and other countries.</p><p>For non-EU countries, these false boundaries are especially visible. From a UK or US perspective, the borders seem technical and arbitrary, given the ability to instantly share data globally. However, preventing access contradicts the spirit of open digital space. We must keep pioneering tools giving users agency and accessibility.</p><p>While some limitations aim to encourage market competition, others serve little purpose beyond denying availability. More and more people cross borders because families, friends, and now businesses are moving. And the digital tools they use also evolve alongside this change. This is a sweet spot for Holochain because the architecture requires the consent of the users and apps built with it — rather than centralized server hosting to connect groups together.</p> Bridging Divides Through Understanding <p>Technology alone cannot solve barriers to cooperation stemming from varied cultural perspectives and incentives. However, frameworks that help build bridges and foster mutual understanding can assist with reconciliation.&nbsp;</p><p>As the EU demonstrates, keeping communication open across cultural divides provides critical conduits for compromise, even if tension persists. Institutions play a vital role in sustaining conduits for exchange.</p><p>While universal inclusion remains an ideal, moderate limitations sustaining diversity also prove essential for progress by preventing stagnant monopolies and stimulating competition. With open, equitable rules of engagement, such friction engenders innovation rather than isolation.</p><p>As remote and hybrid work evolve, integrating the magic of embodied teamwork with virtual capabilities remains imperative to human progress. For it is amidst the messiness of the human experience that the future unfolds.</p><p>If you enjoyed this article, feel free to share it or drop a comment and share your thoughts. We want to hear from you!</p>

<p>Drivers of Personalization Trends</p>
<p>The increasing demand for cards, driven by factors such as rising debt, population growth, e-commerce, cashless transactions, and loyalty programs, has contributed to the industry’s growth. However, the overall growth rate of card volumes has tapered a bit in recent years as consumers selectively use both physical and digital credentials, leading to focused efforts around value-added services, cost-reduction strategies, and continuous improvement programs in card issuance.</p>
<p>Here are the drivers of these trends:</p>
 
 Value-added offerings – To stay competitive, personalization centers are offering a wider range of services and materials, addressing the changing market dynamics. This has resulted in complex manufacturing processes that require careful, continuous management across multiple site locations and machine types. 
 Cost reduction – Rising material and labor costs have prompted card personalization centers to focus on reducing operational expenses. They’re adopting lean and Six Sigma methodologies to enhance efficiency and reduce waste. Smart manufacturing includes processes and sometimes staff to monitor and execute cost improvement initiatives. 
 Complexities in card personalization – Personalization centers deal with various complexities, including card types, technology variations, equipment manufacturers, and numerous processes. These complexities pose challenges, but also drive the need for effective data-driven solutions. 
 Role of digital intelligence – Digital intelligence, powered by real-time analytics, plays a crucial role in identifying productivity trends, bottlenecks, quality issues, and line balancing in personalization centers. Traditional methods are inadequate for managing the intricacies of smart production environments.

<p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) has emerged as a pivotal tool in cybersecurity, a security key to bolstering the fortifications guarding sensitive information and systems. Essential to comprehending the broader discussion on MFA security is an understanding of the phenomenon termed “MFA Fatigue.” This concept encapsulates the exhaustion and inconvenience experienced by users due to repetitive and cumbersome multi-factor authentication and processes. Addressing this issue is instrumental in cultivating a cybersecurity environment that is both secure and user-friendly.</p>
 What is MFA Fatigue? 
<p>MFA Fatigue is a multifaceted challenge with various contributing factors. The core of this issue lies in the repetitive and often cumbersome login process and processes that users must navigate to authenticate their identities, compromised credentials, mobile device, username and password, and account. This can lead to exhaustion and frustration, diminishing the overall user experience and potentially leading to lax security practices.<br>
An in-depth examination of MFA Fatigue requires exploring its manifestations and impacts on user behavior. Recognizing the signs and symptoms is essential to preemptively addressing potential challenges and mitigating risks. It is crucial to analyze how MFA Fatigue influences user interactions with security protocols and its subsequent impact on user credentials and overall cybersecurity hygiene.</p>
 How does an MFA Fatigue Attack Start? 
<p>MFA Fatigue attacks begin by exploiting users’ weariness from engaging with multiple, repetitive authentication processes. Attackers anticipate that tired and frustrated users are more likely to make mistakes or bypass security protocols, making executing attacks like phishing or account and password hijacking easier.<br>
The attacker’s goal is to take advantage of these moments of vulnerability, where legitimate users might overlook suspicious activities or ignore security alerts because they desire a more straightforward authentication process.<br>
In these attacks, adversaries mimic legitimate authentication requests or login attempts, creating a sense of urgency, forcing the users to act quickly and without much thought. Users already fatigued by numerous authentication steps are more prone to fall for these tactics, giving attackers the access or information they seek, thus compromising the security defenses set by the MFA processes.</p>
 What is an example of a MFA fatigue attack? 
<p>One typical example of an MFA Fatigue attack is a phishing scheme where the attacker impersonates a trusted service with stolen credentials with which the user frequently interacts, such as an email provider or a corporate system.<br>
The user receives a message urging them to log in and attempt to confirm their identity by clicking a link. Since users often encounter multiple authentication requests, they might proceed without thoroughly evaluating the request’s legitimacy, potentially exposing sensitive information.<br>
Another example could be an attacker exploiting the users’ familiarity with authentication processes to make a login attempt to gain access or create a spoofed login page. Users, tired of repeatedly entering credentials and going through MFA procedures, may not meticulously check the URL or the page’s security, entering their information into a fraudulent site, which then captures their credentials and potentially bypasses MFA protections.</p>
 Is MFA fatigue social engineering? 
<p>MFA fatigue indirectly fosters a conducive environment for social engineering attacks. Social engineering involves manipulating individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security.<br>
MFA fatigue contributes to this by making users more susceptible to attacks due to their weariness and frustration from constant authentication requests. Most users might be less vigilant and more willing to comply with unusual requests, thinking it is just another part of the authentication process.<br>
However, it’s important to clarify that MFA request fatigue is not a social engineering attack. It is a state of user exhaustion and frustration due to repetitive MFA request processes, which attackers exploit using social engineering techniques, like phishing or pretexting, to deceive users into lowering their defenses and revealing sensitive information or access.</p>
 Evolving Landscape of Cybersecurity and MFA 
<p>Tracing the trajectory of MFA technologies provides valuable insights into their current state and future directions. Initially, MFA emerged as a groundbreaking approach to secure authentication, offering robust defenses against unauthorized access to login credentials, security keys, and authentication messages. However, as cyber threats have evolved, so have the demands on MFA technologies to provide enhanced security without compromising usability.<br>
The present landscape presents a crucible of challenges and opportunities. Technological advances and signs in a heightened threat environment necessitate continuous evolution and adaptation of MFA strategies. Organizations must be agile and responsive to maintain sensitive data integrity and security postures while mitigating MFA Fatigue.</p>
 Technological Innovations Targeting MFA Fatigue 
<p>Emerging technologies present promising avenues for alleviating MFA Fatigue. Innovations continually reshape the landscape, aiming to simplify authentication processes without compromising security. Evaluating the effectiveness of these technologies and their reception by users is integral to understanding their role in combating MFA Fatigue.<br>
Many technologies, such as biometrics and adaptive authentication, have been heralded as transformative in enhancing user experience. By staying abreast of these technological trends and their implications, organizations can make informed decisions that bolster their cybersecurity while easing user fatigue.</p>
 Legal and Compliance Considerations in MFA 
<p>In the labyrinth of multi-factor authentication (MFA), legal and compliance considerations are one example of pivotal guideposts. These elements delineate organizations’ boundaries and obligations to implement and manage MFA processes. The organization’s multi-factor authentication and legal landscape encompasses various facets, including data protection regulations, user rights, and industry-specific compliance mandates.<br>
Understanding and adhering to legal and compliance considerations are non-negotiable facets of responsible MFA deployment. Organizations must stay abreast of legislative developments, regulatory requirements, and industry best practices. This adherence is instrumental in safeguarding organizational integrity, user trust, and the overall robustness of cybersecurity defenses.</p>
 User Experience (UX) Design Principles for MFA 
<p>Incorporating User Experience (UX) design principles into MFA strategies heralds a reimagined approach focused on the user’s identity-centricity. This involves designing MFA processes prioritizing ease of use, intuitive interaction, and overall user satisfaction. Effective UX design in MFA seeks to reduce complexities and frictions contributing to user fatigue and dissatisfaction.<br>
By leveraging UX design principles, MFA processes can be transformed into seamless user journeys that harmonize security and usability. Such a design ethos fosters a positive user interaction with security protocols, encouraging compliance and enhancing the security keys overall effectiveness in authentication processes.</p>
 Organizational Strategies for Implementing MFA 
<p>Deployment strategies within organizations play a critical role in the reception and effectiveness of MFA processes. Thoughtful implementation involves careful planning, stakeholder engagement, and continuous improvement mechanisms. Crafting strategies that consider organizational dynamics, technical infrastructures, and user needs are paramount.<br>
Adoption and usability are key considerations in the strategic deployment of an MFA system. Organizations must foster environments supporting user education and adaptation, providing necessary resources, training, and support. Such comprehensive strategies pave the way for the successful integration of MFA as a robust and user-friendly component of organizational cybersecurity.</p>
 Continuous Improvement: Analytics and Feedback 
<p>Embracing a philosophy of continuous improvement propels MFA strategies toward evolving excellence. Utilizing analytics offers a lens into user interactions, behaviors, and challenges within the MFA processes. With user feedback, analytics forge a pathway to insightful enhancements and refinements.<br>
Feedback loops, encompassing user insights and analytical data, become the bedrock for informed decision-making. They facilitate the identification of areas for improvement, user challenges, and opportunities for optimization. By nurturing a culture of continuous improvement, organizations can maintain MFA processes that are both contemporary and user-centric.</p>

<p>Over the years, the ways in which we get from A to B have changed based on how the mobility industry has developed as well as major world events impacting travel choices and decisions. However, finding the fastest and easiest way to get to our final destinations still remains the major priority. But not only do we want fast and easy travel but also convenience paired with cost savings, and we want to be able to know all our options.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/safety-shared-mobility-driver-license-verification/">Shared mobility</a> such as car sharing and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/francois-hoehlinger-the-future-of-micromobility/">micromobility</a> will continue to see growth <a href="https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/carsharing-market">over the next 10 years</a> due to increasing environmental regulations, there are plenty of choices for consumers, but how can they find the best based on their immediate needs?</p>



<p>Enter Mobility as a Service (MaaS)—a one-stop traveling shop, which takes every type of transportation into account and provides its users the best optimized route to their destination. A concept focusing on a “bundled service model,” consumers are in a sense buying into mobility, instead of investing in transport equipment such as personal vehicles.</p>



<p>With the global Mobility as a Service market projected to <a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/mobility-as-a-service-maas-market-102066">grow from $236.42 billion in 2022 to $774.93 billion by 2029</a>, companies need to bear in mind where MaaS is headed and how they can become part of this growing movement.</p>



 What is Mobility as a Service (MaaS)? 



<p>Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is an emerging trend that is transforming the way we use and access transportation. The overarching idea of MaaS is that it is an integration of various forms of transport and transport-related services into a single, comprehensive and on-demand mobility service. Basically, everything at the touch of a button. This in effect allows users to access all types of transportation (walking, car sharing, public transportation, micromobility, etc.) in one application with a single payment channel. Say goodbye to the multiple ticket purchasing stress.</p>



<p>Instead, services are <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mobility-travel-reflections-2023/">becoming consolidated</a> by having one application for all their travel needs.</p>



 Why is MaaS important? 



<p>The importance of MaaS lies in the concept itself. By reducing the inconveniences associated with accessing individual transportation services, MaaS provides a one travel service from planning to booking to paying, creating a more fluid and integrated experience of transportation. This results in less congestion, fewer emissions and lower operating costs all while providing a more accessible and inclusive journey for those individuals with limited mobility. Plus, MaaS allows for the integration of smart city data to create efficient and cost-effective traffic management systems. In the long run, MaaS holds great promise for improving accessibility, affordability, sustainability and efficiency in our transportation networks.</p>



<p>Additionally, every person has their own unique needs based on their job, interests, financial profile, physical capabilities, behaviors, relationships, personal preferences and more. Putting these all together creates a specific identity that can be tailored to when it comes to transportation and exactly what MaaS will provide since alternative transport options will be available in a one-stop shop.</p>



<p>In short, MaaS could be the final puzzle piece needed to make urban life smoother, faster and cheaper for everyone.&nbsp;</p>



 What are Mobility as a Service examples? 



<p>Mobility as a Service can sometimes be confusing when wondering which apps and operators fall under which category. Some MaaS providers, such as ride hailing apps (Uber) and peer-to-peer rental services (GoGet &amp; FlexiCar) are currently good examples of MaaS that focus on one or two areas. However, with the <a href="https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/mobility-as-a-service-market">expected CAGR around 7.43% over the next five years</a> and Asia-Pacific the fastest growing market, major players in the MaaS industry include Enterprise, Hertz and Moovit.</p>



<p>However, the future of MaaS looks toward apps that can provide all services in one place such as Whim based in Helsinki, but also available in the UK, Belgium, Austria, Japan, etc. Whim combines over 2,500+ taxis, car rentals and public transport options, helping users plan and book better journeys through smartphone technology. This can also be seen from the business side as well. UK-based company Mobilleo is a Mobility as a Service app specifically for businesses. Whether a self-employed business or a fleet manager, Mobilleo combines thousands of travel providers into one app to help businesses find, book and pay for their journey in one solution.</p>



 



 

 



 Digital identity: the building block of MaaS. 



<p>But what does this mean exactly for users and operators? Well, for one it means the importance of data. In order to provide what consumers are looking for data must be shared. However, security concerns arise from both the consumer and operator when it comes to data collection and could keep MaaS from growing. Consumers fear the attractiveness this service would be for fraudsters, while also doubting the legitimacy of ID verification platforms. On the other hand, operators worry about the challenge of proper driver’s license verification and preventing minors/fraudsters from using their services.</p>



<p>In a way, the root of the problem is the lack of security on both ends and the possibility of the mishandling of data, which would put the fate of MaaS in jeopardy. A strong <a href="https://www.itf-oecd.org/sites/default/files/docs/mix-maas-mobility-service-final.pdf">framework for data sharing</a> and identity verification therefore needs to be put in place in order for MaaS ro be successful. But there’s really no need to worry because there is a solution.</p>



 The missing link: security through identification. 



<p>The key to this new service is what connects the various modes of transportation and their service operators in order to support MaaS and provide a smooth multi-leg and multi-modal journey for customers. But what exactly is the key? Simple. Digital identity verification.</p>



<p>With all transportation options listed in one area, having digital identity verification is crucial so providers know who is using their services. Plus, providers want to offer the best service to their customers (in hopes that you will use them again) and can do that by way of having the digital identities of its users. But consumers also benefit by seeing what the mobility providers can offer them. Basically, it’s a two-way street where both parties can be satisfied.</p>



<p>But why exactly is digital identification necessary? Not only does it provide consumers and companies the benefits of this two-way street, but it offers trust, which is the foundation of any relationship.</p>



<p>Because MaaS is a platform displaying various modes of transport, there are some services that will need to know if a customer possesses a valid driver’s license or is the appropriate age to use their application. Additionally, any leasing contracts for car-sharing also can require a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/qualified-electronic-signature-qes/">qualified electronic signature</a> or proof of bank account. But no matter what they may require, a one-time, fast, seamless and automated identity verification is all that is needed.</p>



<p>Plus, as more and more services become digitalized, companies will offer the opportunity for users to store their digital identities in a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">digital wallet</a> so verification can become even more simplified and efficient while traveling. Since MaaS is housed all in one application, all needed documents, tickets, etc. will be in one place while on-the-go. Travel will be like it never has before. &nbsp;</p>



 







 Convenience is the goal. 



<p>Though still a new concept, MaaS will become more popular in the future due to its main function. It provides convenience for all its users. Mobility doesn’t need to be a hassle or stressful and people don’t want it to be. Instead, it should be easy and smooth. MaaS provides exactly that with the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/change-social-and-shared-mobility/">assistance from digital identity verification</a>.</p>



<p>Not only is MaaS convenient, but so is proving your identity. IDnow offers automated solutions which require only a quick photo snap of your ID or driver’s license. Even a qualified electronic signature can be added when necessary. With a process that only requires a few minutes, users can do so from on-the-go, wherever they may be. IDnow is the solution for knowing customers’ true identities so they can carry on with their journey.<br><br>Read on: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fueling-demand-convenient-mobility/">Fueling the demand of convenient mobility</a></p>



 A partnership leading us into tomorrow. 



<p>In today’s growing mobility sector, having a digital identity is essential for both consumers and businesses. Both want to authenticate the other and feel secure in their relationship. Thus, these digital identities are at the core of MaaS since it is a one-stop shop. It truly is a digital identity solution partnership that will lead us into the world of tomorrow’s transportation.</p>

 In 2023, new entrants to the financial system reached a monumental milestone, for all the wrong reasons. 



 



<p>Last year, for the first time ever, crypto firms and fintechs received more fines than traditional financial services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f2a8c1e4-30f2-49c7-939b-73e0d1a22033">data analysed by the Financial Times</a>, crypto and digital payment companies paid an eye-watering $5.8 billion in fines due to a multitude of reasons, including non-compliance in anti-money laundering checks and failing to uphold sanctions and other financial crime issues.</p>



 Findings and failings. 



<p>In total, crypto firms recorded 11 separate fines in 2023 compared to an annual average of just two over the last five years. Meanwhile, payments firms recorded 27 fines, which was a huge increase on their annual average of five per year from 2018 to 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most fines levied against payments groups were to fintech groups that were less than 20 years old.</p>



<blockquote><p>This is a surprising shift in the global payments space, and just goes to show that such punishments can be levied out to even the most digital-savvy sectors.</p>Rayissa Armata, Director, Global Regulatory &amp; Government Affairs at&nbsp;IDnow</blockquote>



<p>“Gone are the days where bad behavior will be tolerated by newcomers to the financial industry. With major players like <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-first-hit-1-bln-assets-2024-01-19/">Blackrock recently launching its bitcoin ETF</a>, which boasts huge compliance operations as well as general risk aversion, the industry is likely, and will need to, grow up quickly in 2024 and beyond,” added Rayissa.</p>



<p>The main contributor to the astronomical amount of 5.8 billion in fines was the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/21/binance-settlement-crypto-exchange">$4.3 billion penalty</a> levied against crypto exchange Binance, which was set “purposefully high.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reasons for the mammoth fine were attributed to violations of:&nbsp;</p>



  The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)<br>  Failure to register as a money transmitting business<br>  Violations to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).&nbsp;  



<p>“Binance became the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange in part because of the crimes it committed – now it is paying one of the largest corporate penalties in US history. The message here should be clear: using new technology to break the law does not make you a disruptor, it makes you a criminal,” said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen was even clearer in her <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/binance-and-ceo-plead-guilty-federal-charges-4b-resolution">damnation of the crypto platform</a>, stating how Binance’s “wilful” failures to adhere to AML and sanctions compliance allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, this was not the only wake-up call that should have set off alarm bells in the crypto community in 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The much-publicized decision to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/24d153b0-0c28-4946-acbe-2e93329bca52">convict the founder of FTX of money laundering</a> and fraud sent further shockwaves through the industry. Despite such turbulence, there were also significant steps taken to stabilize crypto in 2023, such as the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">Market in Crypto Assets regulatory framework (MiCA)</a>, the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/transfer-of-funds-crypto/">Transfer of Funds regulation (TFR)</a>, and the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-crypto-regulatory-regime/">UK’s proposed regulatory regime</a>, which neared ever closer to completion. As the regulations are finally likely to be enforced in 2024, this could not happen at a more crucial time.</p>



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/identity-first-future-trends-2024/">Discover which trends are likely to affect the crypto (and gambling and financial services) industry in 2024.</a>  



<blockquote><p>2024 may very well prove to be a watershed year for the crypto industry. It’s likely that the upcoming crypto regulations will have a positive impact and act as a stabilizing force, while the fines should serve as a deterrent and remind crypto firms that AML laws and regulations apply to them too.</p>Rayissa Armata, Director, Global Regulatory &amp; Government Affairs at&nbsp;IDnow&nbsp;</blockquote>



<p>“However, there’s also a very real chance that firms, especially new entrants to the crypto and fintech market that are in a rush to establish themselves and onboard as many customers as possible, may bypass certain steps in customer controls. This is not advisable. KYC processes, and rigorous identity checks are in place for a reason – to protect the business and the customer.”</p>



 Light at the end of the tunnel? 



<p>Besides the aforementioned regulatory frameworks due to be enforced later this year, 2024 has already started with some reassuring developments regarding crypto regulation. Chief among these was guidance issued by the European Banking Authority (EBA), which extended its <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-issues-guidance-crypto-asset-service-providers">guidelines on money laundering and terrorist financing</a> to crypto asset service providers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The European Council and European Parliament also recently announced that it had reached a provisional agreement on the decision to create the brand-new <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2023/12/13/anti-money-laundering-council-and-parliament-agree-to-create-new-authority/">Anti-Money Laundering Authority (AMLA)</a> – a European authority with the expressed purpose of countering money laundering and financing of terrorism. Technical negotiations are expected to be ongoing for months, with a tentative aim of formally adopting final agreement by 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Proposals put forward include:&nbsp;</p>



  Requirements for financial institutions to conduct <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/enhanced-due-diligence/">enhanced due diligence</a> on wealthy individuals, or on transactions involving high amounts.<br>  Enhanced due diligence for cross-border crypto transactions.&nbsp;  



<p>While obliged entities, including financial institutions, banks, real estate agencies, asset management services, casinos, and merchants traditionally enforce AML requirements like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC</a>, the new rules now cover most of the crypto ecosystem. All crypto-asset service providers will now be required to conduct due diligence on customers, including verifying personal KYC data, with such data required to accompany transfers under the Travel Rule when transactions exceed €1000 or more.</p>



 Stronger together. 



<p>In February, 2024, we joined a consortium of five partners, including the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iota.org/">IOTA Foundation</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://walt.id/">walt.id</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://spyce5.com/">SPYCE.5</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://bloomwallet.io/">Bloom Labs</a>, with the aim of making Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) and self-hosted wallets compliant with the European Anti-Money-Laundering Regulation and the Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR).&nbsp;[Read more about TFR in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/transfer-of-funds-crypto/">blog, ‘EU extends TFR to crypto, requiring KYC for all crypto transactions.’</a>]</p>



<p>A major challenge for CASPs will be to adhere to the new rules lies in GDPR compliance, as personal identifiable information (PII) should not be stored on blockchains or Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT). However, to comply with the new regulations, CASPs need to know with whom they are doing business and continuously verify this information.</p>



<p>To address this challenge, the consortium has proposed a system where a trusted party tokenizes an identification process, allowing CASPs to have confidence in this process, without revealing any PII.</p>



<p>Discover more about the consortium by reading the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/consortium-crypto-assets-compliant-eu-regulations/">press release </a>and watching the explainer video below.</p>



 



 

 



 Putting the KYC into crypto and fintech. 



<p>While <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC processes</a> are an integral part in ensuring crypto exchanges can protect themselves and their customers from fraud and money laundering, they are also an important requirement to comply with AML, MiCA and other crypto-related regulation. Having these controls in place will protect investors from financial losses and add stability to a notoriously volatile market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The bottom line is that KYC and Know Your Business is at the nexus of this world and people are catching up to this reality – you have to know who is out there – as people go on or off chain or in and out of the traditional banking world,” warned Rayissa.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow’s highly configurable <a href="https://www.idnow.io/platform/">identity verification solutions</a> work across multiple regulations, industries and use cases, including <a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">crypto</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/fintech/">fintech</a>. Whether automated or expert-assisted, our online identity verification methods have been optimized to meet the strictest security standards and regulatory requirements without compromising on customer conversion or consumer experience.</p>

			 Year of Tokeny: 2023’s Milestones &amp; 2024’s Tokenization Predictions 
 
<p>I hope you kicked off the new year with great energy and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>At Tokeny, our people are what make us outstanding. As a remote-first team, we prioritize coming together each year for retreats to forge physical connections, align our visions, and simply share great moments.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>Last week, our journey led us to the picturesque Puigcerdà in Spain. Amidst breathtaking mountain hikes, indulgent spa experiences, and delightful culinary adventures, we also found time for some highly efficient meetings. It was truly amazing, and we had the pleasure of meeting one of our first members, Nida, who finally joined us in person after six years of dedicated work at Tokeny from Turkey.</p>
<p>As we reflect on the achievements of 2023, we are thrilled to share the highlights that have propelled us to the forefront of tokenization.</p>

<p>🔷 ERC-3643 Standardization Contribution:</p>
 
 Association Launch: We successfully launched the ERC3643 Association with 45 prominent actively participating members, including top-tier financial institutions, global law firms, and blockchain leaders like SS&amp;C, Invesco, CMS, Apex Group, and Polygon. 
 EIP Recognition: Achieving final status in the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP), the ERC-3643 was officially recognized as the de facto token standard for compliant tokenization. 
 
<p>Predictions for 2024</p>
<p>The upcoming year promises to be full of tokenization breakthroughs. Our predictions are:</p>
 
 5 out of the top 10 asset managers will tokenize assets:&nbsp;Tokenized products will be introduced by half of the top 10 asset managers. 
 Standardization with ERC-3643:&nbsp;The entire industry will start to build valuable use cases and form a dynamic ecosystem with a validated token standard ERC-3643 instead of reinventing the wheel. 
 Regulated entities will start tokenizing cash: A few large financial institutions will issue stablecoins, e-money or deposit tokens. 
 US regulation will open up:&nbsp;The US market is set to open up, compelling others to hasten their initiatives. 
 Institutions go public blockchain:&nbsp;It opens the door for interoperability with DeFi, driving demands from investors by adding utility to their assets and innovation. 
 
<p>As we kick-off 2024, we are prepared for the challenges and opportunities in the tokenization landscape. Your support has been pivotal, and together, we are set for an even more dynamic year ahead.</p>
<p>Thank you for being a crucial part of Tokeny’s journey!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/quicktake/artificial-intelligence">Artificial intelligence</a> (AI) has many upsides, but a significant downside is its role in creating <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-20/deepfakes-what-are-fake-ai-video-dangers-and-how-to-spot-them">deep fakes</a> and other identity theft fraud mechanisms. The technology is increasingly accessible and affordable, manipulatable media is freely available across the internet, and detecting real from fake is growing more difficult by the day.</p>



<p>A ‘deep fake’ is a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-20/deepfakes-what-are-fake-ai-video-dangers-and-how-to-spot-them">video</a>, image, or audio of a real or fictitious person’s likeness or <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/03/22/1165448073/voice-clones-ai-scams-ftc">voice</a> that was substantially modified or generated using <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-machine-learning-everything-you-need-to-know/">machine learning</a> and <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-generative-ai-and-why-is-it-so-popular-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/">generative AI</a>. The result is convincing content that looks and sounds like it comes from a specific person. In the case of the popular <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/grandparent-scams-get-more-sophisticated">grandparent scam</a>, that ‘specific person’ is the victim’s grandchild whose voice and image have been manipulated to convey a fearful message, while in the growing number of corporate or <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/regulating-ai-deepfakes-and-synthetic-media-political-arena">political deep fakes</a>, the subject could be a CEO, political opponent or even a president.</p>



<p>Deep fakes are used to defraud money and spread disinformation. They threaten privacy, reputation, finances, and peace, potentially on a global scale.</p>



<p>The US government is moving to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-20/deepfakes-what-are-fake-ai-video-dangers-and-how-to-spot-them">regulate</a> deep fakes, and some commercial operations have introduced <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-20/deepfakes-what-are-fake-ai-video-dangers-and-how-to-spot-them">deep fake detection technology</a>, so there are solutions on the horizon. But a solution we see enormous potential in is <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/11/what-is-web-3-0-and-what-does-it-mean-for-privacy/">Web3</a> and <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/08/17-industries-with-viable-use-cases-for-decentralized-identity/">decentralized identity technology</a>, grounded in <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/01/how-do-blockchains-provide-the-trust-foundation-for-decentralized-identity-based-apps/">blockchain</a>.</p>



<p>In a nutshell:</p>



 
 Web3 and DI technologies would deliver some secure content “locks” that could be quickly checked and verified as irrefutable proof of authenticity. 



 Blockchain would make it incredibly difficult for malicious actors to manipulate or tamper with digital content since every change would be permanently recorded and verifiable. 
 



<p></p>



<p>There are a few ways to leverage this technology:</p>



 
 A person would possess an official <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/simple-definitions-for-complex-terms-in-decentralized-identity%ef%bf%bc/">decentralized identifier</a> (DID) (which includes a public key) on a public blockchain. Any piece of content that person creates would be cryptographically hashed and signed with a digital signature created by the private key associated with their public key, proving its authenticity, or 



 A person would hold verified credentials for their digital persona in a digital wallet, which again would prove the authenticity of their created content. In the digital wallet, they would also store other verified real-world credentials for their digital persona, such as driver license, passport, proof of residency and so on, or 



 A person could store in their digital wallet <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq">non-fungible tokens</a> (NFT ) backed by blockchains to prove ownership of digital assets including video and voice recordings.&nbsp; If a recording is protected by an NFT owned by a reliable person or organization then the recording can be trusted and is not subject to fraud. 
 



<p>With all these solutions, anyone watching a video or listening to or reading a piece of content could be assured of the content’s author and that the content has not been modified. This provides protection against deep fakes, including those created using AI.</p>

<p></p>



<p>This <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/decentralized-signature-countering-deepfakes-julien-maldonato/">great article</a> from Deloitte summarizes the 6 ways Web3 and DI would act as a safeguard against deep fakes and other generative AI scam mechanisms:</p>







<p>1. Provenance tracking: Cryptography and distributed ledger technology makes it almost impossible to conceal manipulated origins of content.</p>







<p>2. Self-sovereign identity: DI gives the user complete control over their identity, including their content, shutting out the potential criminal element.</p>







<p>3. Tamper-proof meta data: Embedding cryptographically verified metadata such as timestamps, location, and device information, readily distinguishes authentic content from manipulated versions.</p>







<p>4. Authenticity certificates: Digital certificates attached to validated original media act as irrefutable proof of authenticity.</p>







<p>5. Algorithmic detection: Blockchain-based platforms can use deepfake detection software that algorithmically flags suspected fakes and deters bad actors.</p>







<p>6. Incentives alignment: Leveraging tokenized incentives and reputation staking, common in <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/11/what-is-web-3-0-and-what-does-it-mean-for-privacy/">Web3</a> models, may discourage the production and dissemination of manipulated content.</p>



<p>But wait, there’s more …</p>



<p>Interestingly, on the flip side of AI is its potential to combat the scams it actually helped create by shoring up Web3 and DI systems. AI can help secure identities and monitor social networks for suspicious activity or profiles, weeding out forgeries and inauthentic content.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/06/28/how-ai-and-web3-id-tech-can-defeat-deepfake-frauds/?sh=158ec8394814">Forbes</a> writer describes this “quid pro quo” arrangement between Web3/DI and AI this way: “Blockchain-verified profiles can offer a type of ‘proof of humanity,’ a place to store digital assets and identifiers, and a single point of access into the Web3 ecosystem—all while keeping the user’s privacy under their control. Meanwhile, AI can work to monitor and secure these profiles, keeping people from becoming the next victims of AI-wielding criminals.”</p>



<p>We can act right now</p>



<p>This is an interesting and rapidly evolving topic. For now, the key takeaway is that AI-driven fraud will likely remain a threat for some time, but leveraging Web3 and DI technology grounded in blockchain and even pairing it with AI technology presents a viable solution that’s available right now. <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Explore the solutions we offer in Sudo Platform</a>.</p>

				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>Decentralized identity governance covers both the traditional remit of governance —&nbsp;who is in control and therefore accountable — with the technical policies, rules, and procedures that apply to any given use of decentralized identity.</p>
<p>This hybridity can be a source of confusion. Those from the business world may think in terms of corporate governance and those from the engineering world may think in terms of technical stacks. In merging the two, the goals of clarity and simplicity — hallmarks of good governance — run into the complexity of technology, which in the case of decentralized identity, is compounded by its recent emergence, protean capabilities, and unfamiliar concepts and terms.</p>
<p>Our goal here is to simplify and help you understand the basics so that you can start implementing the technology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Getting started 
<p>Let’s assume that you’ve already decided that you want to use decentralized identity and verifiable credential technology to share and verify data without the need for direct integrations or third parties.</p>
<p>To implement your solution, you need to ask yourself/team/partners the following question: Do you want to—</p>
<p>create an ecosystem of your own (by ecosystem we mean a complete system for issuing, holding, and verifying credentials/data/identity for a specific use case)</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>only issue credentials on an existing ecosystem</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>only verify credentials on an existing ecosystem?</p>
<p>Answering “yes” to the first means you are the governance authority (or you and a partnering organization or government will co-create the governance if the solution has multiple stakeholders).</p>
<p>A “yes” to the second or third means you need to evaluate the governance of the ecosystem you’re joining to see if it meets your needs.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you are creating an ecosystem and the use case comes with a regulatory requirement to run your own verifiable data registry/distributed ledger network, you’ll need to create network governance.</p>
<p>The image below illustrates the decision process.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>One thing to note is that most solutions do not require creating and running your own verifiable data registry/distributed ledger network. There are global networks to choose from, including the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-networks/">Indicio Network</a>, which is purposefully designed for enterprise grade solutions. The point is not having to create a distributed ledger network radically simplifies the amount of governance you have to create and manage, something that’s not always apparent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 One solution, three governance elements, 
<p>For the next step, we’re going to borrow a visual aid from St. Patrick, a shamrock. Right now, any implementation of decentralized identity is going to have the following governance elements.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>Ecosystem governance applies to the Issuers, holders, and verifiers of verifiable credentials. A governance authority establishes rules for participation and interaction. If you’re creating an ecosystem, as we’ve noted, you are the governance authority for all these participants.</p>
<p>Machine-readable governance is a way to encode ecosystem governance rules — that is, who is a trusted issuer, what attributes must be presented — in a file that agent software (the software used by issuers, holders, and verifiers) can access and cache. It enables human governance rules to be automated. And because the rules are cached, credential verification is possible in offline situations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Network governance comprises the governance for a distributed ledger network, which includes the legal agreements for credential issuers to write to the ledger. As noted, you’re unlikely to need to create this, but you will have to evaluate other networks based on their governance and, if issuing credentials, you’re likely going to have to sign agreements to write to a network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What are the key governance issues in each of these elements?  
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>To implement governance, you are going to have to make a series of policy and technical decisions on each of the bullet points in Ecosystem Governance, and evaluate competing networks on the bullet points in Network Governance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some of the important decisions you are going to have to make when creating governance for an ecosystem&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identity assurance —&nbsp;are you issuing credentials to people, organizations, or things? How much information in the credential will identify the person compared to describing&nbsp; the credential? For the personal identity attributes, do you need an identity assurance process?</p>
<p>Credential issuers — Will there be multiple credential issuers in your ecosystem? If so, how are they to be onboarded?</p>
<p>Credential types — what credential type should you use for people, organizations? Do you need selective disclosure? What are the policies and procedures for credential expiry, revocation? Are there any restrictions on who can verify credentials?</p>
<p>DID methods — What DID methods for which participants? Should you use a DID method with communication endpoints? How much durability do you need in your ecosystem?</p>
<p>Protocols — Do you need secure protocols for notification and confirmation? What device capabilities will your participants have?</p>
<p>Cryptographic keys — How will you manage key rotation?</p>
<p>Wallets — What are your options and requirements? Do you have a recognizable brand?</p>
<p>Networks — Will you use a network? Which one will you choose and how will it benefit your solution? (Learn more about the networks Indicio offers and <a href="https://indicio.tech/a-deep-dive-into-the-indicio-networks/">how to choose the best one to fit your needs.</a>)</p>
<p>This is not an exhaustive list of things to consider or the place to dive in and provide analysis and recommendations. But looking at these issues and making decisions is not an Everest-summiting task. In all likelihood, you will make them in consultation with one or more partners who will likely have specific requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The net result will be a set of approved credential issuers (a trust list) and a set of rules for interaction between all participants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We strongly recommend encoding these rules in machine-readable files that can be downloaded by each participant in the ecosystem/use case. Why? It’s simple, it’s flexible, it makes governance portable —&nbsp;and it has provided the best solution for our customers (we’ve created a <a href="https://indicio.tech/governance-editor/">governance editor</a> to help automate the process).&nbsp; </p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>Those are the basics. You should have a broad idea of what you need to address in order to implement or evaluate governance for your solution. It’s the starting point for understanding the decisions you need to make, and we’ll cover those decisions in future blog posts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is one thought to end with, it is to choose options that provide the most flexibility for future development. Technology is not static and with something as powerful as verifiable data, the only thing you can be sure of (besides the data) is that people will innovate in ways that cannot be anticipated. We always recommend building solutions that are capable of managing multiple credential formats, easy key rotation, and (quite essentially) provide communication endpoints so that you won’t find yourself at a sudden competitive disadvantage.</p>

<p>One of the biggest security weak points for organizations involves their <a href="https://www.hypr.com/security-encyclopedia/authentication">authentication</a> processes. According to <a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/blogs/gcat_threathorizons_full_jul2023.pdf">Google Cloud’s 2023 Threat Horizons Report</a>, 86% of breaches involve stolen credentials. Our own research found that <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/report-state-of-passwordless">60% of organizations reported authentication-related breaches</a> in the past year. Context-based authentication offers an important tool in the battle against credential stuffing, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-prevent-man-in-the-middle-attacks">man-in-the-middle attacks</a>, MFA prompt bombing, and other attacks on authentication systems.</p>  
<p>Also referred to as <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-adaptive-authentication">adaptive authentication</a> or <a href="https://www.hypr.com/security-encyclopedia/risk-based-authentication">risk-based authentication</a>, context-based authentication layers on dynamic security controls that use contextual signals and other indicators of risk to make access decisions. When used in conjunction with secure passwordless authentication, it helps better protect your resources while providing better employee and customer login experiences.&nbsp;</p> 
 What Is Context-Based Authentication?  
<p>Context-based authentication goes beyond traditional methods by controlling access and user authentication flows based on dynamic risk calculations. It analyzes information such as user behavior, device signals, and risk signals from other security tools to dictate access policies. This is a departure from traditional authentication, which relies solely on presenting the correct credentials. Based on this risk information it may, for example, prompt users for an additional authentication factor, require them to re-affirm their identity through a proofing process, or block access altogether. Incorporating context and eliminating insecure passwords from the authentication process significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, thereby lowering the chances of a potential data breach.</p> 
<p>In its simplest terms, context-based authentication involves two parts:</p> 
  
  Establishing a baseline: In order to determine what behavior and scenarios are suspicious, the systems must first establish a baseline for each user that defines what is normal.  
  Responding to anomalies: Once a baseline is set, the context-based authentication system evaluates each login attempt against this norm. It actively scans for potential anomalies, such as login attempts originating from unusual geographic locations or suspicious VPNs, during periods of user inactivity, if the device is rooted or jailbroken, and other factors that indicate a higher risk. It also takes into account the type of access requested — for example a high-risk transaction. If elevated risk levels are detected, the system triggers additional authentication factors or verification steps.  
  
 Key Components of Context-Based Authentication  
<p>Any context-based authentication system contains these basic components, although they will vary in both how they are constructed and how they get used. The best context-based authentication processes assess multiple layers and signals in order to effectively optimize for both security and user experience.&nbsp;</p> 
 Risk Engine  
<p>The heart of context-based authentication is the risk engine. The risk engine continuously collects and analyzes data to determine the risk level associated with each user access request. Modern authentication risk engines use machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence to detect malicious behaviors and threats in real time. The broader and more varied the information sources and risk signals, the more accurate and effective the risk engine.</p> 
 Context Sources  
<p>As mentioned, the effectiveness of the risk engine fully depends on its data sources. Sources include things such as device health posture, mobile, web and browser contextual signals, real-time events, user behavior and access patterns. Ideally, your sources also include risk data from EDR systems and other cybersecurity tools deployed in your organization.</p> 
 Action Orchestration  
<p>Real-time risk information holds little value if it cannot also be actioned upon in real time. Context-based authentication systems use the risk insight to enforce access policies. This can range from simply denying access, to requiring additional authentication steps, to requiring the person to prove that they are the person they claim to be using identity verification technologies.</p> 
<p></p> 
 Benefits of Context-Based Authentication  
<p>Context-based authentication provides multiple advantages for organizations.:</p> 
  
  Prevents attacks: Context-based authentication operates as a continuous gatekeeper, actively scanning for anomalies and high-risk activities. This proactive approach prevents unauthorized access attempts and significantly reduces the risk of successful attacks, protecting sensitive data and fortifying the organization's security posture against evolving threats.  
  Improves User Experience (UX): By leveraging contextual cues to streamline access, it ensures that legitimate users can navigate seamlessly through the authentication process. This not only enhances overall user satisfaction but also minimizes friction, making security measures more user-friendly without compromising on protection.  
  Ensures Regulatory Compliance: Context-based authentication allows organizations to continuously assess identity threats and mitigate risks as required by NIST, ISO, HIPAA, GDPR and other regulations. It also can ensure only authorized users access sensitive information in accordance with requirements underPCI, FISMA, FRCP and HITECH.  
  Enables Zero Trust Architecture: <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/risk-based-authentication-essential-to-zero-trust">Context-based authentication aligns with Zero Trust</a> “never trust, always verify” principles. It assumes that no user or system is inherently trustworthy, requiring continuous and ongoing verification. When used in conjunction with phishing-resistant AAL3-compliant authentication methods, it provides a strong foundation for building a Zero Trust architecture.  
  
 Implement Context-Based Authentication With HYPR Adapt  
<p>Context-based authentication employs risk-based analysis to determine and adjust authentication security controls in real time. The level of security it delivers depends on multiple factors including the sophistication of the risk engine, the breadth and depth of contextual information it uses, and the range of security controls it can affect.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-adapt">HYPR Adapt</a> leverages a cutting-edge identity risk engine for real-time threat assessment, dynamically adapting security policies to deliver a personalized yet secure authentication experience. HYPR Adapt operates in tandem with HYPR's industry-leading, FIDO-based passwordless MFA solution, delivering a powerful <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/the-power-of-risk-based-authentication-with-hypr-adapt">risk-based authentication</a> solution that tailors workflows to each user's context, effectively mitigating risks.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Improved configurability for organizations that uses PIV / CAC 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the last year since we announced the General Availability of Certificate-based Authentication (CBA), we’ve seen an increase of over 850% in Entra ID CBA usage for US Government customers. CBA helps our customers in their Zero Trust journey, migrating from on-premises IdPs such as AD FS, while continuing to provide familiar end user experience using PIV / CAC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We continue our investments in cloud-based CBA with recently added capabilities that allow you to tailor authentication policies by certificate and resource type, as well as user group. You can now select certificate strength for different users, use CBA with other methods for multifactor or step-up authentication, and set high affinity (strong) binding for either the entire tenant or by user group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>January 21-27, 2024 is Data Privacy Week. As one of the world’s leading identity solution providers, Ping Identity knows exactly what’s at stake with data privacy. In an era dominated by digital interactions, online connectivity, and ecommerce, Data Privacy Week is the perfect time to reflect on such an important topic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2023, Ping Identity conducted an important consumer survey titled <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/content-library/misc/3743-2023-consumer-survey-brand-loyalty-digital-economy.html">Brand Loyalty In the Age of the Digital Economy</a>. One of the most startling findings from this survey is that only 10% of respondents trust the organizations that manage their data. While Ping is proud to offer solutions to data privacy problems with innovations like decentralized identity, we also want to spread the message about ethical data practices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With digital transformation now touching every corner of the world, the responsibility to safeguard user data is paramount. As such, Ping Identity is thrilled to observe Data Privacy Week in 2024 with the global IT community.</p>

 Towards multivalent currencies, bioregional monetary stewardship and a distributed global reserve&nbsp;currency <p>In this second blog of a 4-part series we are sharing some design principles that could underpin a desirable future scenario. The blog series is centred on the following enquiries and this reflection aims to address question&nbsp;two.</p>  What are the issues that make money (and our dominant monetary systems) so problematic? (<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-dac459dc844e">Blog&nbsp;1</a>)  Can we use design principles to help us imagine desirable future scenarios?  What could a desirable future scenario actually look like? (<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-951ca09dd76d">Blog&nbsp;3</a>)  What can we start building and testing now to begin scaffolding a parallel system? (<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-0360c0709087">Blog&nbsp;4</a>)   Part 2 (of 4): Can we use design principles to help us imagine desirable future scenarios? <p>In the <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-dac459dc844e">first blog</a> of this series we explored a number of factors that make our current monetary system incompatible with a regenerative and equitable future. Highlighting such issues feels important but it should not be the end goal. If something is threatening our shared fates, then it is our collective responsibility to try and create an alternative. Our aim is to learn from sharing these initial thoughts by inviting comments and critiques. Ultimately we hope to convene a community who have diverse skills and experiences beyond our own; a distributed team united in designing and building the alternative monetary system that we so desperately require. A first step towards that is to think carefully about what a desirable monetary system might in fact&nbsp;contain.</p><p>We are approaching this challenge in two&nbsp;parts:</p>  Firstly, by sharing ten design principles that we think should underpin a regenerative monetary&nbsp;system.  Secondly, we are in the process of developing aspirational future scenarios that respectfully explore the above principles.   Design principles <blockquote>Copper reserves cannot be equated with a forest. Carbon sequestration is not interchangeable with soil microbes. A whale’s life is not proportional to a barrel of&nbsp;oil.</blockquote>Credit: Dr Martin&nbsp;Lorenz<p>The following principles underpin a vision that opens up the future rather than closing it down. Whilst it is critical to understand the constraints (such as energy and carbon), we also need to seed a desire for non-competitive, infinite economies. Value flows such as solidarity, information and care can be managed in a different way to finite economies, providing a liberating release valve to our current scarcity&nbsp;mindset.</p>  Maintain interregional stability via organised exchange: our global supply chains are complex and entangled. Currently, the major reserve currency is backed by military force rather than by the collective values of the global population. As the polycrisis² intensifies we must ensure that we have the systems in place to trade fluidly and to provide a strong incentive to maintain peaceful relations.  Uplift economically poor but regeneratively rich regions: in much of the world our conception of profit and wealth is perverse, but it can be reconceived in service of regenerative potential. Regions and communities that are regeneratively abundant should automatically derive transactional rights that can be used to uplift critical infrastructures.  Elevate decentralised, value-backed currency issuance: Bitcoin is an example of alternative currency with a link to the physical world. This is achieved by the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp">proof of work function</a> that rewards miners who solve a mathematical problem with newly issued bitcoin (or with transactional fees). This principle builds on the requirement for a tangible link with the biosphere to break the cycle of growth linked extraction which we explored in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-dac459dc844e">Blog 1</a>. However, it seeks to achieve it by stewarding and increasing regenerative potential rather than by solving inane calculations.  Steward respectful interchangeability: we must clearly understand that finite elements of our world are not commensurate. Copper reserves cannot be equated with a forest. Carbon sequestration is not interchangeable with soil microbes. A whale’s life is not proportional to a barrel of oil. We must create closed loop cycles of stewardship that ensure respectful fungibility.  Quantify rather than price: markets provide a powerful distributed allocation mechanism for private assets, but are dangerously inadequate in relation to common elements such, soil health and air quality. Our attempts to price ‘nature’ and ‘natural assets’ have to date only yielded further extraction. We thus need to think about using measurements to account for the base reality of our systems rather than their priced abstractions.  Build visceral accountability: our transactional worldview allows people to separate their lived experience from their monetary choices. To maintain healthy relationships with each other and with our ecosystems, we must reconnect our animate senses to our decision making processes. Unless we can sense and feel how our actions play out, we are unlikely to tap into the wisdom required to steward a densely populated planet.  Commit to computational collaboration: the increasing ability to digitalise living systems can be directed to help us understand diverse perspectives, including those of the other-than-human world. What would it mean to create technologies of care? Could we use computation power to build interfaces that clearly visualise and recognise the complexity of entangled value&nbsp;flows?  Drive dynamic, iterative decision making: we must avoid the conceited falsity of being in control of living systems. Instead, the data that we collect can be used to create a dynamic understanding of complex interactions. For example, how are the different elements reacting with each other? How does the picture evolve as more data comes in? What does this mean in terms of acting as a respectful ecosystem collaborator?  Strengthen participatory value governance: building on principles 7 and 8, we must design governance systems capable of understanding the collective values of nested communities. This form of open society will transcend narrow voting behaviours in service of our collective thriving.  Interweave spiritual and political logic: we must aspire to preserve the aesthetic, intrinsic sacredness of life whilst recognising the political reality of our time. Holding both perspectives, whilst the transitional reverberations rip through the fabric of society, will be a critical aspect of this&nbsp;work.   Outlining a desirable scenario <p>Imagine a situation where currencies and capital are fundamentally linked to the objective, intersubjective and intrinsic value of interconnected relationships. Where the accounting and forecasting systems allow for multivalent factors and unforeseen possibilities. Where multi-sensor inputs are connected to a continuous participatory governance structure and trans-contextual decision making is the norm. This might sound complex and opaque, but in reality the technology either already exists or is close to reaching this level of functionality. The constraints are primarily those of path dependency² and power defending inertia.</p><p>We fully acknowledge that we cannot simply transcend the structural reality of our existing socio-economic systems. The aim is therefore to present the seeds of a cohesive alternative, because whilst we cannot possibly imagine the exact form of a future monetary system, we can think about the building blocks that it might contain. In our <a href="https://darkmatter-labs.medium.com/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-951ca09dd76d">next blog</a> we will share an outline for a possible scenario that we hope to use as a conceptual baseline for an initial prototype. If the above principles have sparked any ideas regarding what a desirable scenario might contain, or if you are already working in this field, we would really value your thoughts.</p><p>This blog was written by Emily Harris (<a href="mailto:emily@darkmatterlabs.org">emily@darkmatterlabs.org</a>) under Dark Matter’s Next Economics LAB. We aspire to start working on some tangible proofs of possibility for bioregional currencies in&nbsp;2024.</p><p>References:</p>  We are using the term polycrisis to describe how multiple crises are interrelated and coalesce to create compounded effects.  Path dependency refers to processes where past events or decisions constrain later events or decisions.   <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-38ed3849395f">Towards multivalent currencies, bioregional monetary stewardship and a distributed global reserve…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 How inclusive are your services? We explore how video verification can help give your company a competitive edge. 



 



<p>Inclusiveness escaped mere buzzword status and took some significant steps into the mainstream in 2023. This year, it’s sure to become an even more important competitive differentiator.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Being able to offer a truly inclusive workplace; one that is respectful of a team’s differences, whether that be gender, race, sexuality, or disability is a non-negotiable for the modern workforce.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed, a more diverse and inclusive corporate culture has been shown to create multiple benefits, including:</p>



  Bigger talent pools<br>  More ‘heard’ and satisfied staff<br>  Better reputation among peers<br>  <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/why-diversity-matters">Optimal business performance</a><br>  Improved understanding of customers  



<p>But, what about a company’s actual customers? Besides the carefully crafted core values, and specific selection of stock photographs on a company’s website, how accessible are their products? How easy do organizations make it for customers to register, to use, and to integrate their services into their daily lives?</p>



 Accessibility for all. 



<p>With over <a href="https://helpfulprofessor.com/types-of-genders-list/">80 different cultural descriptions of gender</a>, amid growing sentiment that people should be able to self-identify, the challenge to offer fully inclusive identity verification has become increasingly complicated. Nobody should be denied access to online products; whether that’s opening bank accounts, renting scooters, or any other service that requires users to verify their identity.</p>



<p>There are many factors that can lead to inequality and a lack of inclusiveness in identity verification. For example, deeply entrenched racial bias has been discovered in many AI-based identity verification systems. Facial recognition software, in particular, has a long history of failing to <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/19/18412674/ai-bias-facial-recognition-black-gay-transgender">recognize certain ethnicities.</a> Other incidents of racial bias include black applicants receiving a disproportionate percentage of rejections via an AI-based applicant screening process. In 2022, the UK data watchdog, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) began a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jul/14/uk-data-watchdog-investigates-whether-ai-systems-show-racial-bias">three-year study</a> into ‘AI-driven discrimination’ by analyzing the effects of using algorithms to sift through job applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The use of AI has also revealed a worrying trend to discriminate against women by, for example, continuing to use gendered terms like policeman or fireman in text creation. In AI-prompt video generation, traditionally female roles, like carers, are <a href="https://www.computing.co.uk/sponsored/4148316/gender-biased-ai-sending-us">still depicted by females</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There has also been evidence of <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/11/4-ways-to-address-gender-bias-in-ai">higher gender identification error rates among female subjects</a> by AI-enabled computer vision systems.</p>



 Fighting bias, one face at a time. 



<p>In a bid to break down the barriers of bias, IDnow is collaborating with 12 European partners, including academic institutions, associations and private companies, as part of the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ai-bias-facial-verification/">MAMMOth project.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Funded by the European Research Executive Agency, the goal of the project is to study existing biases and offer a toolkit for AI engineers, developers and data scientists so that they may better identify and mitigate biases in datasets and algorithm outputs.</p>



 Great UX for all users. 



<p>Additional factors such as age, disability, and neurodiversity are other areas that pose usability and inclusivity challenges, as is low proficiency in technology, or poor internet infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is also the issue of those who do not have identity documents. Populations without paper or photo ID face an uphill struggle to verify themselves digitally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A lack of identification has always been a barrier to economic and social inclusion, and in the digital age, without access to digital IDs and digital verification solutions, this is still the case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Approximately <a href="https://www.womeninidentity.org/articles/women-in-identity-launch-code-of-conduct-project-challenging-digital-identity-teams-to-create-more-inclusive-solutions">one in four people</a> in the UK do not have traditional identity verification, yet smartphone ownership is on a steady march to capacity.</p>

 The Hitchhiker’s Guide to KERI. Part 1: Why should you adopt&nbsp;KERI? <blockquote>TLDR: The KERI protocol does not have a distributed consensus mechanism and is not subject to the blockchain trilemma. KERI is designed to be scalable, secure, and decentralized — all three at the highest&nbsp;level.</blockquote><p>This blog is the first part of a three-part series, the Hitchhiker’s Guide to&nbsp;KERI:</p>  Part 1: Why should you adopt&nbsp;KERI?  Part 2: What exactly is KERI? (Coming&nbsp;soon)  Part 3: How do you use KERI? (Coming&nbsp;soon)  Deep Thought, The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy (2005&nbsp;film).<p>In Douglas Adams’ science fiction series “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy,” a supercomputer named Deep Thought took over 7.5 million years to calculate the “Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything” and humorously gave out the number&nbsp;“42”.</p><p>Without Deep Thought (or even ChatGPT) and million years of computation, we may answer a slightly different question:</p><blockquote>What is currently the best technology for Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), Decentralized Identifier (DID), and Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure (DPKI)?</blockquote><p>This guide argues that the answer to this not-so-ultimate question is Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI).</p> KERI Why/What/How <p>Since its invention in 2019, KERI has been one of the most misunderstood technologies and concepts in the SSI space, given its technical complexity and seemingly steep learning curve. As an attempt to demystify KERI, here, this three-part series will answer three simple Why, What, and How questions, as&nbsp;follows:</p>Adapted from “The Golden Circle” in “Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action” by Simon Sinek&nbsp;(2009).<p>Part 1 starts with the Why question. The following sections outline the evolution of digital identity systems from a centralized to a decentralized model. We will delve into the reason why blockchain is not a necessary component for building a decentralized identity system and put forth an argument as to why a KERI-based model is a better alternative and is potentially a candidate for the next generation of digital identity&nbsp;systems.</p>The evolution of digital identity. Centralized Digital&nbsp;Identity <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_identity">Digital identity</a> is defined as the information utilized by computers to represent external entities, including a person, organization, application, or device. Hence, digital identity has been around since the early days of the Internet when a computer system needed to know with whom or things it interacted.</p><p>Dated back to the 1960s and 1970s, the earliest form of digital identity was the use of usernames and passwords that allow multiple users to access shared computer resources and online services. These systems independently and centrally manage their interactions, resulting in a model known as Centralized Digital Identity. Nowadays, centralized digital identity has evolved into Federated Digital Identity in the 2000s where digital identities used by multiple computer systems are federated to a single trusted centralized entity, called an Identity Provider (IdP). Despite their prevalence, there are two major concerns with the centralized identity&nbsp;model:</p>  Single Point of Failure: A centralized identity system relies on a single centralized entity. If the central entity is compromised, all associated systems and services also become vulnerable.  Privacy Concern: IdPs with large user bases, like Google and Facebook, can collect a vast amount of user data, tracking all aspects of the users’ digital lives. These IdP platforms may monetize these data as well as abuse it, e.g., influencing the geopolitical opinions of the&nbsp;public.   Blockchain-based Decentralized Digital&nbsp;Identity <p>Decentralized Digital Identity—also known as Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)—promises to give “control” back to the users from the centralized platforms—enhancing trust while preserving individual privacy. Seminal works that lay the foundation include The <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf">Laws of Identity</a> (2005) by Kim Cameron and <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/">The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity</a> (2016) by Christopher Allen.</p><blockquote>Note: The terms “Decentralized Digital Identity” and “SSI” are often used interchangeably. However, SSI is more commonly used to describe the principles and community while Decentralized Digital Identity is more commonly used to describe the technology based on the principles of this movement.</blockquote><p>By 2015, the rise of blockchain technology started to capture the attention of the digital identity community, and several sessions on “blockchain identity” were hosted during the Spring 2015 <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> (IIW). A seminal paper on “Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure (DPKI)” by C. Allen, et al. was also published in the same&nbsp;year.</p><blockquote>“The goal of DPKI is to ensure that, unlike PKIX, no single third party can compromise the integrity and security of the system as a whole. Trust is decentralized through the use of technologies that make it possible for geographically and politically disparate entities to reach consensus on the state of a shared database.” — <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot1-sf/blob/master/final-documents/dpki.pdf">Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure</a>, C. Allen, et al., Rebooting the Web of Trust I&nbsp;(2015).</blockquote><blockquote>Note: PKIX stands for Public Key Infrastructure that is based on X.509 certificates.</blockquote><blockquote>Note: Here, we specifically refer to the term “blockchain” as a “distributed-consensus ledger with a global ordering of records”. This is because the term “blockchain” is sometimes used to refer to a hash-chained verifiable data structure.</blockquote><p>The development of blockchain-based digital identity kickstarted the SSI revolution and resulted in multiple communities of practitioners including the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> in 2017 and the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP Foundation</a> in 2020 as well as multiple standards including <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a>.</p><p>Over the years, the popularity of blockchain has made the term “decentralization” synonymous with the term “blockchain” to the public. Unfortunately, this gave a false impression to many people that any decentralized system requires the use of blockchain technology. For example, the Internet Protocol (IP)—which was invented in the 1970s and predates the invention of blockchain—is also decentralized since there is no single entity controlling the global Internet&nbsp;network.</p><p>Blockchain indeed possesses multiple properties that make it suitable for decentralized digital identity systems, including security, availability, programmability, transparency, etc. However, blockchain is not a silver bullet without any drawbacks and is simply one implementation of decentralized systems among many. For example, one of the most common drawbacks of blockchain is its scalability due to the unsolvable problem known as the blockchain trilemma.</p><p>While you can certainly build a decentralized identity system using blockchain, it turns out you don’t have to. The following sections give a detailed reason for why this is the&nbsp;case.</p> Double Spending&nbsp;Proof <p>In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto published the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin whitepaper</a>. At its core, Bitcoin solves the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending">double-spending problem</a> in a decentralized manner using a distributed consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Work (PoW). Later iterations of blockchain technology proposed other consensus mechanisms such as Poof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Authority (PoA).</p><blockquote>Note: The double-spending problem is a problem in a cryptocurrency system where the same single digital token can be spent more than&nbsp;once.</blockquote><p>In essence, blockchains address the double-spending problem by establishing a network of validators, which are distributed geographically and are not controlled by a single entity. These validators collectively maintain a shared ledger with a total ordering of transactional records. Updates to this shared ledger occur through a consensus mechanism agreed upon by the validators.</p><blockquote>Note: In distributed systems, a “total order” refers to a consistent and agreed-upon sequence or ranking of all events or transactions in a system. In a total order, every pair of events can be compared, and it is clear which one occurred before the&nbsp;other.</blockquote><p>While double-spending is a fundamental problem in a cryptocurrency system, it does not generally apply to an identity system. In a cryptocurrency system, if Alice transfers the same amount of money to Bob twice, Alice is twice as poor, and Bob is twice as rich. On the other hand, if Alice performs identical authorization operations on Bob repeatedly, their internal states may be affected by only the first operation and remain unaffected by all subsequent operations.</p>The necessity of double-spending proof for a cryptocurrency system vs. an identity&nbsp;system.<blockquote>Note: This is the property called idempotence. It is defined as follows: “An operation is idempotent if it can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application.”</blockquote><p>Cryptocurrency operations are not idempotent and require double-spending proof property. On the other hand, most operations in identity systems are idempotent. This can be summarized below:</p><blockquote>“An identity system does not need to provide double-spending proof of an account balance. It merely needs to provide consistency.”</blockquote> Bypassing the blockchain trilemma <p>The blockchain trilemma is a well-known fundamental problem in blockchain technology, which is widely believed to be unsolvable. It highlights an inherent trade-off among decentralization, security, and scalability in blockchain systems. Implementations of blockchain—including blockchain-based identity systems—cannot simultaneously achieve high levels of all three components. Any attempt to improve one aspect always comes at the expense of the&nbsp;others.</p><p>A good example is Bitcoin itself, which is extremely secure and decentralized while having poor scalability. Another good example is the Terra blockchain which was designed to be highly scalable at the cost of security, leading to its collapse in&nbsp;2022.</p><p>The root cause of the blockchain trilemma is the fact that a blockchain network fundamentally consists of validators that must come to a consensus to make an update to a shared totally ordered ledger. Such a consensus mechanism is an essential component in a cryptocurrency system where double-spending proof is a critical property.</p><p>As outlined in the previous section, as a double-spending proof is not a necessary property for an identity system, a consensus mechanism is thus not a required component. Hence, the blockchain trilemma can be entirely bypassed—not solved—for a decentralized identity system by giving up the double-spending-proof property.</p><p>As it turns out, a means for building such a decentralized identity system already exists, and it is known as&nbsp;KERI.</p> KERI-based Decentralized Digital&nbsp;Identity <p>In a nutshell, <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI)</a> is a decentralized protocol for the management of persistent self-certifying identifiers.</p><blockquote>While blockchain was initially invented for the construction of a cryptocurrency system, the KERI protocol was specifically designed for building a decentralized digital identity&nbsp;system.</blockquote><p>While, we will discuss in detail what KERI exactly is in the next part of this series, here are a few reasons why you should adopt&nbsp;KERI.</p> KERI is a more scalable alternative to blockchain <p>One of the most common problems with blockchain-based identity systems is their scalability. For example, Hyperledger Indy—one of the most popular blockchain protocols for decentralized identity—<a href="https://github.com/lissi-id/acapy-load-test-results/blob/main/AcaPy_0-7-4/Endurance_Test/04-0_7_3_indy-200rpm/report-test-results-0-END.pdf">takes around 4 hours to issue 18,000 credentials</a>, as discussed in detail by Kaliya Young in her blog “<a href="https://identitywoman.net/being-real-about-hyperledger-indy-aries-anoncreds/">Being “Real” about Hyperledger Indy &amp; Aries / Anoncreds</a>”.</p><p>In short, blockchain is slow, and one can only make it faster by reducing security and/or decentralization due to the blockchain trilemma. This is not at all the case for&nbsp;KERI:</p><blockquote>The KERI protocol does not have a distributed consensus mechanism and is not subject to the blockchain trilemma. KERI is designed to be scalable, secure, and decentralized — all three at the highest&nbsp;level.</blockquote><p>Since security and decentralization are often not a concern for most implementations of blockchain-based identity systems, the most important reason for adopting KERI is as&nbsp;follows:</p><blockquote>KERI is a more scalable alternative to blockchain for building decentralized identity&nbsp;systems.</blockquote> Other reasons to adopt&nbsp;KERI   KERI may leverage blockchain for discovery and verification. KERI’s ledger, called a key event log (KEL), may be embedded in an arbitrary blockchain network. As a result, KERI may leverage all the advantages of using blockchain — including availability, transparency, and programmability.  KERI is portable across blockchains. KERI does not ultimately rely on blockchain. Once a KERI-based identity system utilizes a blockchain network, it may switch to another blockchain network. This solves the ledger lock-in problem where a decentralized identifier is locked to a specific blockchain network.  KERI is recoverable from a quantum attack. If a quantum suddenly becomes available and is used to attack a KERI-based identity system, the KERI protocol has the means to recover control from the attacker via a mechanism called pre-rotation.  KERI supports the right to be forgotten. Transactions in blockchain are recorded in a shared totally ordered ledger, which makes it impossible to delete a transaction that contains personally identifiable information (PII). This is not a problem for KERI since KERI’s ledgers—i.e., KELs— are not&nbsp;shared.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-keri-part-1-51371f655bba">The Hitchhiker’s Guide to KERI.

Trust registries can quickly become a powerful tool for the discovery of services, including digital credential exchange services.</p>
<p>There’s a common misconception that trust registries are only necessary once digital credentials become widely adopted. However, I think the reality is quite the opposite. Trust registries are not just supporting systems; they are enablers of digital credential adoption.</p>
<p>What is a Trust Registry? In simple terms: Some list of authoritative identifiers that are governed. In the context of digital credentials, when a person presents a credential from their digital identity wallet to a verifier, the verifier might question the legitimacy of the issuing entity behind the credential presented. This is where a trust registry becomes invaluable. It can provide verifiers with the information needed to confirm whether the issuer is authorized by a governing body, under a governance framework.</p>
<p>The Dual Role of Trust Registries. Trust registries serve a dual purpose. Yes, they can be used by entities, such as verifiers, seeking inputs to help them make trust decisions. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly to where we’re at in the adoption cycle of digital credentials: trust registries act as discovery mechanisms. For example, if I’m looking for an authorized auditor for a specific function, a verified auditors list in a trust registry can provide essential information to initiate contact and potentially help me form business connections.</p>
<p>In the digital trust context, this could lead to forming direct connections or requesting credentials to further business processes. Therefore, trust registries are not only useful for making trust decisions during credential exchanges but also serve as powerful tools for decision-making prior to any credential exchange, acting as a strong discovery mechanism.</p>
<p>Investing in trust registries is crucial for the broader adoption of digital credentials – that’s why we’re spending a lot of time at Northern Block building foundational infrastructure for trust registries. They provide the necessary infrastructure for trust decisions and discovery, facilitating smoother and more reliable digital interactions in various business contexts.</p>

 Navigating The Real Politics of the Blockchain <p>In my last piece on this subject I explored how young people are searching for community and identity online, either through aesthetics like Cottagecore, or through economics, with things like DAOs and how, as a result, they had been captured by a brutal and isolating form of “pay-to-play tribalism”. Instead of finding the true utopian community that provides “food, fire and friends beside water” their interactions have been atomized and monetized by the neoliberal hegemony. I have thoughts on how to fix&nbsp;that….</p><p>So, how do we fix that? It’s not easy, and there are lots of inherent problems to navigate.</p><p>Let’s start with thinking about the discourse between the people running DAOs and the people running old-school incorporated cooperatives in the conventional nation state&nbsp;system.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_co-operative_movement">Cooperatives</a> have worked for centuries, at enormous and truly revolutionary scale. There was a time when so much of the British economy was going to coops that the State started to suppress them to try and maintain the existing feudal-capitalist power structure. How did coops work? Basically the administrative systems of feudal capitalism, owned by the&nbsp;people.</p><blockquote>Cooperatives have worked for centuries</blockquote><p>Now this is, I think, an important distinction. The coops were not new administrative structures. Paper records, bookkeepers, shopkeepers, money, trade — it was all the same processes — but:</p><p>1) without extractive profit&nbsp;making</p><p>2) accountable to service users, not a faceless&nbsp;Lord</p><p>So we have the same structure as the capitalism of the era in terms of the business processes but different owners. This is informative. The innovation is in power but not necessarily in process. Same processes serving different masters.</p><blockquote>We have the same structure as the capitalism but different owners</blockquote><p>This is in sharp contrast to Free Software. Free Software is why we have Linux, Wikipedia, and Open Source. It started as a revolutionary movement which stated that software users had human rights. It expressed those human rights in the form of a binding legal licence applied to software distributors</p><p>Free Software was started by the most likely deeply autistic, and slightly frightening, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman">Richard Stallman</a>. I find that he’s become scary weird as he’s aged. Stallman wrote a staggering amount of software, consulted with lawyers, and gave it away under a licence agreement which enforced human rights. Stallman’s use of software licensing to enforce human rights is a stunning creative leap. It’s the kind of constitutional brilliance on which great nations are founded. He was shivved in the back by the capitalists, who took the economics of free software and stripped rights. You know this movement as the Open Source movement. Open Source took the collective, collaborative economics of Free Software — economics intended to deliver a commons in which human rights were respected — and took out the human&nbsp;rights.</p><blockquote>We live in the shell of a dead revolution</blockquote><p>It’s worth going back and reading about the <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?FreeSoftwareVsOpenSource">Free Software vs. Open Source split</a> — the personality types will be familiar to anybody from the blockchain space. The <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/mastercoin-a-second-generation-protocol-on-the-bitcoin-blockchain-1383603310">Bitcoin / Ethereum split</a> — where Bitcoin refuses to evolve smart contracts — is kinda similar. This stuff is prehistory, but the corporate capture of Free Software, stripping out the human rights stuff, and creation of Open Source as a shallow imitation of a revolution ought to be of interest to all blockchain people.</p><p>Sounds like Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC),&nbsp;yes?</p><p>This stuff is the real political history of the high tech age. Richard Stallman is our Jefferson, our Gandhi. He’s the one who did the key foundational thinking about human rights in the age of technology. A lot of you have never heard of him and this is not by accident, OK?</p><blockquote>You have never heard of Richard Stallman, and this is not by&nbsp;accident</blockquote><p>So what I want to point out here is the dynamics where revolutionary cultural innovations are stripped of the elements which empower ordinary people, and then co-opted by capitalism or feudalism or whatever form power takes at the moment. Blockchain people do have this fear too. <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/be-realistic-demand-the-incorruptible-fa15d6401b0e">Elsewhere</a>, I’ve talked about the dire need to reform the blockchain and bring in ways to purge it of rampant scamming. If we don’t, that’s what will happen; everything we value about it will be stripped out and the husk co-opted by the established hegemony for uses it was never meant for and of which its originators do not&nbsp;approve.</p><p>So let’s go back to young folks and DAOs. The dream is simple: economic and cultural empowerment through new mechanisms for effective collective action. Community that really works for people. Everybody puts their money into a bucket. They vote on how the money is used. Revolutionary stuff gets done. Money flows&nbsp;back.</p><p>What DAOs have found in practice are all the same human-nature problems which plague cooperatives:</p><p>1) members are&nbsp;passive</p><p>2) managers wind up doing all the work, and getting all the power as a&nbsp;result</p><p>3) wasting other people’s money is easier than watching it&nbsp;closely</p><p>Manageable? Maybe. DAOs with seriously activist membership are theoretically possible but it’s like looking for political parties where the entire membership are actively engaged in policy debates. Rather than what we get in practice: people just show up to vote and otherwise live their life. And so we wind up with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem">Principal-Agent Problem</a>&nbsp;(PAP)</p><p>The people working on your behalf to manage your DAOs or coops or banks turn out to be working on their behalf not yours. They know the business better than you too, so they’re super hard to watch. Something very complicated and subtle happens here. We inject an ultra low transaction cost environment with the potential for very, very cheap audits and tight control of administrators via smart contracts into a known-difficult area of human&nbsp;affairs</p><blockquote>The managers turn out to be working on their behalf not&nbsp;yours</blockquote><p>What changes? Solution? Well, certainly not so far. The various governance and management problems of DAOs are pretty well known. The archetype is that even the well-governed and well-managed DAOs are&nbsp;either:</p><p>1) run by three people in a pub running the multisig, or</p><p>2) clueless popularity contests for&nbsp;$</p><p>This has clear parallels with all sorts of similar problems too: DAOs and holders, voters and representatives, shareholders and management, supporters and team owners, fans and record companies, and so on. Experts with power do what they can get away with; or “the people” are in charge, but clueless.</p><p>Can this problem be fixed with technology?</p><p>Efficient, transparent administration watched over by an activist population that takes the time to understand the issues and expresses their political power consistently and coherently?</p><p>Never going to happen. Not a&nbsp;thing.</p><p>So now&nbsp;what?</p><p>Let me just double down on this for a moment. The Principal-Agent problem is an unsolved repeating pattern in human society from the beginning of time. DAOs simply restate that problem in a new way with new tools, but nothing about those tools presents a solution to the PAP. The blockchain presents a pretty decent solution for the CAP Theorem (a fundamental problem in distributed systems engineering) but it does not obviously present a solution to the PAP. I think we need to face this head on: we can get to the PAP in record time, but THEN&nbsp;WHAT?</p><blockquote>DAOs simply restate that problem in a new&nbsp;way</blockquote><p>Let me link to an old thread about <a href="https://x.com/leashless/status/1492888622227505153?s=61&amp;t=JS-omg-hSIjQHBCkIFYmEA">“Meditations on Moloch”</a> which looks at Moloch as the dark god of zero sum games, in particular iterated zero sum games, and why Moloch is a worse problem now than in previous ages. The perspective is that fundamentally Moloch is a thing humans have always managed to defeat by changing&nbsp;culture.</p><p>David Graber and David Wengrow looked at the archaeological and anthropological evidence for social evolution and culture change in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dawn_of_Everything">The Dawn of Everything</a> and showed we lived in large, complex, but decentralised communities for millennia and that the current centralised, capitalist, nation state is not inevitable; all kinds of other structures have worked just as well, if not better, for humans. They also found that repeatedly humans have turned their back on ways of managing communities that no longer work, reinventing structures and systems so that they suit people better, usually without violent upheaval and revolution. This is the kind of thing we need to do again, and the blockchain gives us one way of doing&nbsp;it.</p><blockquote>Repeatedly humans have turned their back on ways of managing communities that no longer&nbsp;work</blockquote><p>We need to look at DAOs and the rest of it in the <a href="https://x.com/leashless/status/1492896859903475717?s=61&amp;t=JS-omg-hSIjQHBCkIFYmEA%20now%20what?">context of a response</a> to a Moloch-type lock-in where the global economy is stacked by the Boomers against the young, and stacked by everybody against future generations because of climate&nbsp;change.</p><p>A simple NFT drop with no further involvement from the team gets rid of the Principal-Agent Problem by not having Agents. Each person owns their NFTs. They’re in it together, alone. Community etc. are “soft” not administrative. But if those NFTs are being used as a way of fundraising for something like a video game or a cartoon show something changes. The NFTs represent property which is made more valuable depending on the success/failure of the Agents — the owners of the brand who are continuing to work. This probably has some interesting implications for securities law down the line but I’m going to leave that can of worms to the lawyers. It’s a hard problem no-doubt. Ditto ERC20 type tokens or shitcoins: here there’s almost always a principal-agent factor, a team&nbsp;working.</p><p>DAOs have split functions.</p><p>1) They’re social anchors: people buy into the group and so will stick around. <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/can-the-blockchain-save-the-young-from-themselves-0639b24b335c">People can invest in getting to know each-other.</a></p><p>2) They’re profit-making enterprises with Principal-Agent problems.</p><p>This is where they fail as social organisations, they are enabling that “pay to play tribalism” that gives the illusion of community, but in fact opens participants to rapacious exploitation. So what does it take to provide buy-in tribalism without having the Principal-Agent Problem turn into members being exploited by their administrators?</p><p>The answer would be to remove the agents from communities. Issue 200 seats or whatever. No more will be issued. No further work. You literally wind up with collectible badges: 200 seats here, 500 seats there. The seats become more valuable or useful, they change hands. But “useful” can’t refer to central services offered by administrators acting as agents for the holders. It can’t be a fundraising thing.</p><blockquote>The answer would be to remove the agents from communities</blockquote><p>Ironically I think something very clever could be done by selling seats in some kind of scheme where the proceeds of the sale are split *equally* among all the people that bought in. The folks who buy in early do better financially. Those who buy in later do worse. But 0 agents. And that approach leaves no kitty to be managed: scarcity is demonstrated on the buy-in, but after that the token’s paid for and you get your cut of the proceeds. I don’t know if that would work in practice, but it’s a way of issuing scarce badges for money without creating&nbsp;PAP.</p><p>And if the DAOs and NFTs are about creating small communities in an endless anonymous sea of the internet, maybe that function should be strictly separated from the economics of Ponzi schemes and starting investment funds together. Because binding these together is a problem. You can easily see how it happened: economic necessity, Ponziconomies, and social isolation resulting in a fusion of team-and-tribe into a Strong Bond which then just causes a ton of common PAP problems: fraud, incompetence and laziness from agents &amp; apathy from membership.</p><blockquote>Can we take the “cult” out of subculture?</blockquote><p>Because if you think it’s bad with DAOs and NFT projects, wait until you see the social fallout from failed <a href="https://protocol.com/policy/srinivasan-network-state">Network State </a>projects. It’s all the same social dynamics, but now with real estate and law in the&nbsp;mix.</p><p>I don’t mean to be a Luddite here, or anti Weird Futurist Culture, but I think we have a predictable set of problems here and “let 1000 flowers bloom” does not help when they are weeds growing on toxic brownfield soil.</p><p>The combination of social solidarity and commerce is unsafe, which takes us back to the Cooperative movement and the Labour unions. With an educated and engaged population these institutions thrived. But as people became depoliticised and disengaged, unions turned into corrupt corporations and the coops diminished into&nbsp;shops.</p><blockquote>The combination of social solidarity and commerce is&nbsp;unsafe</blockquote><p>To go forward, we need to decisively separate the commercial from the social. We need to have clear rules, we need law so that when agreements are made, their basis is clear, and so that when someone buys or sells something it is clear what is being bought and sold to and by whom. The combination of the blockchain and what we are doing at Mattereum makes this possible.</p><blockquote>We need to decisively separate the commercial from the&nbsp;social</blockquote><p>The outcome is a situation where the community building can go on independently of money games because people are no longer relying on charming and exploiting other community members to extract money from them. It puts a stop to the zero sum game, where for every winner there has to be a loser, and makes the whole space deeply unappealing for scammers. Communities are built on trust, and clear rules and fair processes build that trust. DAOs have the potential to be the basis for the kind of community people yearn for, but the governance needs to be sorted out, to separate the grift from the community and lay down the bedrock of trust on which to&nbsp;build.</p><p>Mattereum’s purpose is to build the structures that make eradicating grift and building community possible, and we’ll keep doing it. We need a better world and if we have the power to help make that happen, we need to use&nbsp;it.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/how-the-blockchain-can-save-the-young-from-themselves-edac3e7062bc">HOW THE BLOCKCHAIN CAN SAVE THE YOUNG (from themselves)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The age old method of keeping track of who has access to different applications is typically a spreadsheet. People on the left, and apps on the top. A new person comes or goes, and you update the spreadsheet. Easy enough, right?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Except that your head of engineering gave Jira access to someone and forgot to tell you.</p>
<p>And then there was that time that you were on vacation and didn’t get to personally handle offboarding, so who knows what did or didn’t get deprovisioned. Oh, and of course, there’s that one contractor who just needs access to a few things — wait, are they still doing work for you?</p>
<p>Suddenly what you’re calling access management doesn’t feel reliable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2024, it’s time to ditch the spreadsheet in favor of technology that makes your life simpler. Today, we’re excited to introduce Access Grid for YeshID, the only identity and access management platform purpose-built for companies running in Google Workspace.</p>
<p>Access Grid might look like what you’re used to, but it’s much more powerful and easier to maintain. By reducing the orchestration of access management, we make it easier to be efficient and compliant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are three reasons to ditch your spreadsheet this year.</p>
 
  A spreadsheet is static. 
 
<p>Your spreadsheet is just that — a spreadsheet. It’s simply a list you have to maintain. Your spreadsheet doesn’t automatically send an email or remind someone of a provisioning task.&nbsp; Updating a field in Access Grid, on the other hand, kicks off a workflow, allowing you to track access as it’s being granted or revoked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you check a box to indicate that a user should have access to an app, a task is automatically created and assigned to the administrator of the app. Access Grid shows a grayed box, indicating that it’s still to be provisioned. Once the administrator confirms that they’ve granted access, Access Grid is automatically updated.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 
  A spreadsheet is manual. 
 
<p>Unlike with your spreadsheet, Access Grid has the ability to automatically identify <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/yeshid-integrations-an-easier-way-to-manage-app-access-for-smbs/">users for commonly used applications</a> that YeshID is integrated with. That means you don’t have to manually input who has access to your organization’s instances of Slack, Notion, and Hubspot. Depending on the size of your organization, this can save tons of time.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 
  A spreadsheet is “all you.” 
 
<p>Access Grid’s centralized workflow makes your spreadsheet a living access table — and that means it’s not solely on you to ensure it’s always current. Once you kick off that workflow, you can set, forget, and let Access Grid handle the rest. By automating requests to your internal application owners, you can take yourself out of being the middleman.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 Ditch your access management spreadsheet 
<p>The spreadsheet method had its day, but you can see how it might prevent SMBs from leveling up and even unintentionally add operational, technical, and security debt to take care of later. What’s more, access management isn’t just about ensuring internal accuracy. It presents a <a href="https://www.aicpa-cima.com/topic/audit-assurance/audit-and-assurance-greater-than-soc-2">security and compliance risk</a> as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re ready to ditch the spreadsheet for a more <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/what-to-look-for-in-an-employee-onboarding-tool-for-small-businesses/">streamlined way to onboard/offboard</a> and a more secure way to manage app access, look no further. YeshID is <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/a-new-era-of-secure-it-identity-management-yeshid-soc-ii-and-you/">SOC II compliant</a>, in the <a href="https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/yeshid_onboard/456377342688">Google Workspace Marketplace</a>, and has a big ol’ DELETE button if you decide it’s not for you. <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">Learn more</a>!&nbsp;</p>

To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF73 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 20k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  You can read the details for how Predictoor DF Reward Amounts work&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa#58d9">here</a>.

<p>Identity forms the foundation of the modern workplace. Nearly every task depends on the ability to securely access systems using valid digital credentials linked to verified employees. Identity and access management (IAM) must constantly balance between security on one hand, and convenience and productivity on the other.</p>  
<p>The increasing interconnectedness and decentralization of systems, together with the surge in digital identities, are placing tremendous strain on these IAM processes, and attackers have been quick to take advantage. The past year saw regular reports of identity-related breaches, with increasingly severe consequences. Take the <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/lessons-from-the-mgm-attack">2023 hack of MGM Resorts</a> — their systems were down for ten days after hackers impersonated an employee and tricked service desk personnel into granting them access.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In order to better understand what we can expect in 2024, the research team at Vanson Bourne surveyed IAM security leaders across the United States about the current <a href="https://www.hypr.com/solutions/workforce-identity-assurance">workforce identity security</a> practices and pain points in their organization.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
 Identity Security Trends: Key Findings  
 Identity Challenges Abound  
<p>Our research shows that all organizations still struggle when it comes to securing their workers’ identities. The top pain point, cited by 40%, is employee <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/best-practices-for-identity-proofing-in-the-workplace">identity proofing</a>/verification. Many organizations use a series of manual processes that are disconnected from their primary identity systems. Authentication comes in at a close second challenge, with 37% admitting that their authentication processes are vulnerable to phishing and credential attacks. Other top challenges include implementing continuous risk assessment and reducing authentication application sprawl, both named by 35% of organizations.&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
 Organizations Contend With Frequent Identity Risks  
<p>The findings show that employees engage in risky activities on a regular basis. Around seven in ten organizations (71%) report detecting risky user behavior or unexpected changes in the risk environment multiple times each week; nearly a quarter experience daily risks.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Moreover, In all likelihood, these risk figures skew much higher. Organizations admit their visibility into identity risks remains incomplete. On average, they monitor fewer than half (49%) of their employees’ identities on a daily basis for risk or indications of compromise. This potentially leaves a large swath taking risky actions that go undetected.</p> 
<p></p> 
 Employee Identity Fraud: Organizations Find It Difficult To Verify Employees in Real Time  
<p>More than ⅔ of organizations spend over two hours performing <a href="https://www.hypr.com/security-encyclopedia/identity-verification">identity verification</a> checks when an employee needs to replace a device, when a risk is flagged by security systems or when employees change roles. In some cases the average time spent is much higher. For example it takes an average of 8.52 hours to verify identity when an employee changes roles.</p> 
<p></p> 
 Identity Fraud Is Rampant and Costly  
<p>The widespread reliance on insecure identity security solutions is leaving the door wide open to security threats, with undeniable consequences. Identity fraud is so prolific among organizations that over three quarters (77%) report falling victim multiple times within the last 12 months.</p> 
<p>Organizations are feeling the impact in their balance sheets. On average, identity fraud cost organizations an average of $4.33 million in the last 12 months.</p>

</h3>

   Account takeover fraud (ATO) is a form of identity theft where fraudsters overtake an online account and pose as real users. Typical means for ATO include compromised credentials, session-hijacking, social engineering, and device takeover.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; 
 For example, ecommerce sites are common targets for ATO fraudsters for a variety of reasons, including the fact that quite a lot of sensitive a

<p>Account takeover fraud (ATO) is a form of identity theft where fraudsters overtake an online account and pose as real users. Typical means for ATO include compromised credentials, session-hijacking, social engineering, and device takeover.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, ecommerce sites are common targets for ATO fraudsters for a variety of reasons, including the fact that quite a lot of sensitive and financial data are stored there, and yet individual users may be less vigilant with their security than in some other verticals. Once bad actors gain access to an ecommerce account, they can make purchases with the card on file, but they can also view sensitive personal data such as credit card numbers, home addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. Not only does this example show how an ecommerce platform can be damaged by ATO, but it also highlights how ATO is used for identity theft. Similarly, a bad actor may seek access to an online banking portal in order to transfer funds or to harvest enough PII to use elsewhere – for example, at another financial institution to apply for a loan under a stolen identity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ATO is a problem in most industries that do business online. The following industries are especially common targets for ATO:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <p>Financial services</p>
 
 <p>Online retail &amp; ecommerce</p>
 
 <p>Healthcare</p>
 
 <p>Social media</p>
 
 <p>Video streaming &amp; entertainment</p>
 
 <p>Online gaming</p>
 
 Utilities 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Common ATO Red Flags 
 &nbsp; 
 
 <p>Odd Login Behavior: Logins from new devices, new locations, new times, or anything outside of previous common behavior is considered a red flag.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <p>Large Number of Failed Login Attempts: When multiple login attempts occur in a short period of time, this may indicate a brute force attack, which involves repetitive attempts to “guess” a password based on minimal pieces of PII.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <p>Login Spikes: Bots are commonly used to flood the system, similar to a brute force attack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <p>Account Detail Changes: If there are changes to an account’s preferred email, phone number, or security/account recovery details, especially all at once, this can indicate an ATO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Suspicious Activity: High volumes of chargebacks or purchases from new locations should be considered suspicious.

				  2024 will be a huge year for verifiable data. As the industry continues to develop, our team wanted to call some interesting trends to your attention and put together some predictions for what we think will happen this year.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Ken Ebert</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</p>
<p>AI technology exploded in 2023, with <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai-in-2023-generative-ais-breakout-year">60% of organizations</a> reportedly using generative AI in some capacity. Two major categories of AI use cases are when an AI does things on a human’s behalf—such as an <a href="https://indicio.tech/a-trusted-copilot-using-decentralized-identity-to-manage-an-ai-virtual-assistant/">AI assistant</a>—and when a human uses a generative AI to create things—such as <a href="https://chat.openai.com/auth/login">ChatGPT</a>, which can create written documents or images. Our team believes that as AI grows in popularity, particularly in business deployments, the need for identity integrations for both of these categories will grow with it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to acting as an assistant and doing things on a user’s behalf, AI will need to be able to prove that it is authorized by a human to act on their behalf. It’s very usefulness as an assistant&nbsp; is tied to whether you can trust it with your secure information. For example, an AI that you can ask to play music for you is useful — but an AI you can trust with your credit card and ask to buy groceries, pay a bill, or even book a vacation? That is what people will pay for. To achieve this level of trust in a robot will require more security than passwords have proven they can provide; it will need mutual authentication and verifiable identity from both the user and the AI.</p>
<p>Generative AI has already caused quite a stir, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2023/12/30/ai-generated-art-was-a-mistake-and-heres-why/?sh=cc26b683fef3">particularly from artists</a> whose work these platforms have been trained on. While the internet has always been somewhat murky on the origins of work, the ability to give a&nbsp; computer a series of prompts and some guidelines and have it generate a visually-believable image or a plausibly correct article creates a whole new level of skepticism. This problem can also be solved by using verifiable credentials at the point of creation to record a digital “signature” that will allow anyone to check with certainty where a piece originates from and if it has been altered since that creation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Multi-Credential Systems</p>
<p>Recently, organizations have realized that there is no one “golden” credential type that fits every use case. In fact, our team has seen several platforms moving to support combinations of JSON-LD, SD-JWT, and AnonCred credentials as projects using multiple credential types gain traction. As ecosystems grow and begin to overlap, we will continue to see multiple credential types being used due to their unique benefits, not just due to competing ideas and organizations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials Will Be Folded into Existing Systems</p>
<p>Businesses have begun and will continue focusing on combining verifiable credentials with their existing systems, rather than approaching decentralized identity as an independent technology. Verifiable credentials almost always need to be paired with existing workflows to unlock the value of verified data — once you are certain of the data, then you need to do something with it. In addition, once you have established a trusted digital relationship using the inbuilt secure, bi-directional communication features, a series of other powerful use cases become possible. Some examples include mutually authenticated chat (confirm it’s a real Nigerian prince before you engage with him), faster, more secure interactions with organizations such as your bank, and a better way for employers to manage access for employees.</p>
<p>One real world application that Indicio has been working on in partnership with SITA and the Government of Aruba is verifiable credentials for travel. Using verifiable credentials as the underlying means of data transfer and authentication, travelers can store all the information they need to get through the airport quickly and efficiently, including their passports, VISAs, and boarding passes. Any of these credentials can be stored and verified with a single scan, resulting in a much faster experience at various touch points in a travel journey. And because these credentials draw on the information embedded in an official document, they eliminate the errors that inevitably occur when people are asked to fill in paper forms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While credentials are an integral part of the equation, many travelers will never think twice about them, and may not even realize they are using decentralized technology.&nbsp; We see this simplicity and speed driving adoption in many other industries, as they realize the time and cost savings to be gained.</p>
<p>Better Awareness of Full Ecosystems</p>
<p>Our team predicts that, as we move through 2024, more people will realize the idea of credential ecosystems as ways to unlock all the benefits&nbsp; of decentralized identity. Being able to verify the integrity of a credential is a huge step forward, but equally important is being able to verify the issuer. For example, if you have a digital driver’s license and you use it as proof of identity to take out a loan, the bank would need to trust that your driver’s license hasn’t been tampered with AND know which authority issued it. From there the bank can make the human decision of whether or not we trust that source. As we continue to build this technology, more people will realize that without a mechanism to decide if you can trust the issuer, a credential alone is insufficient</p>
<p>Organizations Will Learn That They Can Go to Production with What They Have Now</p>
<p>Many organizations have been hesitant to openly adopt this technology or go to market for a&nbsp; variety of reasons, including a feeling that the technology isn’t ready or complete and concerns about needing permission to proceed or authorization from central gatekeepers, such as governments or standards bodies. But this technology is ready right now, and is already in use today. It doesn’t require a huge lift and shift, can be rolled out at whatever scale comfortable with to start, and most importantly, it provides a better way for organizations to manage their tremendously valuable data and implement the governance of their ecosystems. In 2024 our team sees many realizing that they can move forward without the need to wait for others to solve root trust issues or grant them permission to manage their own ecosystem.</p>
<p>Overall 2024 will certainly be one to watch for decentralized identity!</p>

 What is FIDO Passwordless Authentication? 
<p>Fast Identity Online (FIDO) is an advanced security protocol that seeks to eliminate the need for passwords, moving towards a more secure and user-friendly authentication process. FIDO passwordless authentication is a modern approach to two-factor authentication that deviates from traditional methods that typically rely on usernames and passwords. Instead, it leverages cryptographic techniques and private keys to ensure that users are who they say they are.</p>
<p>This approach fundamentally differs from traditional authentication systems. Unlike conventional password-based methods of authentication, where users must remember and input passwords, FIDO facilitates authentication by verifying the user’s device or biometrics.<br>
This ensures direct communication between the user’s mobile device, computer browser, and the server, minimizing the risk of phishing attacks and data security breaches.</p>
 
The Importance of Secure Authentication 
<p>Password-dependent authentication has long been a vulnerability relying solely on passwords for securing accounts, and sensitive data has led to a surge in cybersecurity incidents, including data breaches, identity theft, and unauthorized access, stolen credentials used to user’s identities elsewhere.<br>
By focusing on only secure authentication methods, the FIDO passwordless and universal authentication framework also emphasizes reducing password-associated risks.<br>
It addresses the vulnerabilities of username and password-dependent authentication methods alone, making it challenging for attackers to compromise the user’s computer accounts, thus fortifying online security.</p>
 
Overview of How FIDO Works 
<p>FIDO (Fast Identity Online) offers a revolutionary take on user authentication through the security keys and its nuanced, cryptographic approach, differing substantially from traditional password-based systems. Here’s a more in-depth technical breakdown of how FIDO operates:</p>
 
 Asymmetric Cryptography: FIDO relies on a pair of cryptographic keys — a public key registered with the online service and a private key securely stored on the user’s device. This pair is used to authenticate users securely. 
 Local Device Authentication: Before the cryptographic process begins, the user must unlock the local device through a secure action such as entering a PIN, using a fingerprint sensor, or leveraging facial recognition technologies. 
 Authentication Request and Response: When authentication is needed, the service challenges the user’s device. The device then responds using the private key to sign the challenge, which the service verifies using the public key. 
 User Verification and Key Pair Generation: During registration with an online service, the user’s device creates a new key pair on behalf of the user, keeping the private key securely on the device while registering the public key with the service. 
 Limited Reliance on Centralized Servers: The private keys never leave the user’s device, limiting centralized servers’ necessity and minimizing the attack surface. 
 
 What is the FIDO Alliance? 
<p>The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a> is a robust consortium of leading international companies and organizations dedicated to establishing and promoting authentication standards that reduce the world’s over-reliance on passwords.<br>
Through a collaborative approach, the FIDO Alliance aims to create secure, user-friendly, and universally applicable authentication methods that seamlessly integrate across various online platforms and systems.<br>
Members of the FIDO Alliance contribute to the development, standardization, and widespread adoption of passwordless authentication practices. These contributors range from tech giants and financial institutions to government entities and other industry players, collectively driving innovation and fortifying global online security landscapes.<br>
The FIDO Alliance’s pioneering work nurtures a resilient digital ecosystem where businesses and users can interact confidently, benefiting from enhanced security and a simplified user experience.</p>
 
Advantages of Implementing FIDO Passwordless Authentication 
 
Enhancing User Experience 
<p>FIDO’s passwordless authentication significantly improves the user experience. Users find the authentication and registration process more convenient and less cumbersome without remembering and managing multiple passwords. This reduction in friction enhances user satisfaction and fosters a more streamlined and efficient user account and journey.<br>
Implementing FIDO’s username and passwordless approach simplifies the user’s interaction with digital platforms, security devices, and services, encouraging more frequent and confident use of online services. It marks a considerable step forward in creating an even online service environment where security and usability coalesce.</p>
 
Boosting Security Levels 
<p>One of the fundamental advantages of FIDO passwordless authentication lies in its enhanced security levels. Using cryptographic principles such as public key cryptography and private and public key two pairs, FIDO passwordless sign ensures that user credentials remain secure, minimizing the potential attack vectors typically associated with traditional password-based security usage.<br>
FIDO reduces the vulnerability of authentication processes by more user attempts and eliminating the dependence on passwords for user attempts. It mitigates common attack strategies like password cracking and phishing, contributing to a fortified security framework that confidently safeguards the user’s account data and privacy.</p>
 
Reducing Costs and Resources 
<p>The implementation of FIDO passwordless authentication can result in substantial savings for businesses. Reducing the reliance on passwords decreases the number of password reset requests and the associated administrative support, thus saving time and resources.<br>
Moreover, enhanced security mechanisms considerably reduce the risks and potential costs associated with data security breaches and cybersecurity incidents.<br>
In doing so, FIDO passwordless authentication presents itself as a cost-efficient alternative to password theft that optimizes user identity security and resource allocation.</p>
 
Implementing FIDO Passwordless Authentication in Businesses 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Steps to Adopt FIDO Authentication 
<p>Adopting FIDO Authentication in your organization entails a series of well-planned and executed actions. Here are specific steps</p>
 
 Gap Analysis: Conduct a thorough review of your existing authentication infrastructure to identify weaknesses, redundancies, and areas for enhancement.<br>
Map out the user authentication journey to understand the user experience and identify potential friction points. 
 Strategic Planning: Develop a comprehensive strategy outlining the implementation process. Consider timelines, key milestones, and necessary resources. Align the FIDO authentication implementation strategy with broader organizational cybersecurity objectives. 
 Selecting Appropriate FIDO Solutions: Choose a FIDO-certified solution like BlockID that aligns with your organization’s needs. Consider factors such as usability, scalability, and compatibility. Engage with vendors and solution providers for product demos and technical consultations to make informed decisions. 
 System Integration: Collaborate with IT teams to integrate the selected FIDO solutions within the existing technology infrastructure. Conduct rigorous testing to ensure the new authentication mechanisms’ compatibility, reliability, and performance. 
 Staff Training and Awareness Programs: Organize training sessions to educate employees about the new FIDO authentication processes, especially those in IT and security roles. Develop user guides, FAQs, and other resources to assist users and ensure a smooth transition. 
 Pilot Implementation: Begin with a pilot phase, implementing the FIDO solutions in a controlled environment to gather feedback and identify potential issues. Use insights from the pilot phase to make necessary adjustments before a full-scale rollout. 
 Full-Scale Rollout: Roll out the FIDO authentication solutions organization-wide, ensuring that all systems are updated, and all users are onboarded. Continuously monitor the implementation for user feedback, system performance, and any signs of security vulnerabilities. 
 
<p>By following these steps, security professionals can ensure a successful, secure, and user-friendly implementation of FIDO authentication security key, within their organizations.</p>

The difficulty of access paralyses the research arena and informed public discourse on distribution of wealth and social responsibility (incl. involvement of journalists, academics, city administrations, etc.) further jeopardizing spatial justice. Ultimately, this hinders facilitation of adequate policy, law enforcement and action against exploitative practices such as property flipping, foreign investments, tax avoidance, money laundering and future responses to climate&nbsp;impacts.</p> Introduction <p>Across Czechia, housing prices rose by more than 130% between 2015–2021 (<a href="https://vdb.czso.cz/vdbvo2/faces/en/index.jsf?page=vystup-objekt&amp;pvo=CEN15A1&amp;z=T&amp;f=TABULKA&amp;skupId=86&amp;katalog=31782&amp;pvo=CEN15A1&amp;str=v136&amp;c=v136~8__RP2021">Czech Statistical Office</a>) and continue to do so.

The application makes it possible to obtain selected data on plots, buildings, units (apartments or non-residential premises) and building rights, registered in the real estate cadastre, as well as information on the status of proceedings for the purposes of registering ownership and other rights of authorised entities to real estate in Czechia, or for the purpose of confirming geometric plans.</p><blockquote>Ownership data can be viewed for free plot by plot (CAPTCHA)</blockquote><p><a href="https://nahlizenidokn.cuzk.cz/Napoveda/index.htm?id=idh_FAQ">Viewing the real estate cadastre</a> (CN) does not require any registration and is free. The application is intended exclusively for data viewing (plot by plot), as any acquisition or extraction of data by automated means is not&nbsp;allowed.</p><blockquote>Core institutions have limited&nbsp;access</blockquote><p>Our investigation revealed that the <a href="https://iprpraha.cz/o-nas">Institute of Planning and Development of the Capital City Prague</a> (IPR Praha) — Prague’s main policy-making unit for urban architecture, planning, development, design, and administration — as well as the City of Prague itself only has partial access to the cadastral registry of land ownership.</p><p>This is because the cadastre aims to disseminate data for smaller areas, a common demand. Public entities have the privilege of accessing cadastral data pertaining to their administrative area at no cost, but its use is limited to public administration purposes and cannot be redistributed to third parties&nbsp;(IPR).</p><blockquote>All about&nbsp;money?</blockquote><p>We were informed by the cadastre office that the range and condition for CN data provision are ruled by the <a href="https://www.cuzk.cz/Predpisy/Pravni-predpisy-v-oboru-zememerictvi-a-katastru.aspx">Decree Nr 358/2013 Coll</a>. Large quantities of data can be acquired, with pricing per plot ranging between 50 Kč to 100 Kč (2–4 euro depending on level of information provided). For a dataset covering the entire city of Prague, we were quoted a figure of 931 928 Kč (ca. 38.200 EUR), a figure prohibitive for this project, but also for many researchers, journalists, and the general&nbsp;public.</p><blockquote>Prevention against automated data harvesting methods is in&nbsp;place</blockquote><p>As the <a href="https://www.cuzk.cz/">State Administration of Surveying and Cadastre</a> prohibits any form of automated data scraping we chose not to engage with this method. We, however, performed a test to what extent such an option would be technically possible. Our test revealed that data is hard to access this way, but that it is possible to check plot ownership one by one through <a href="https://nahlizenidokn.cuzk.cz/VyberParcelu/Parcela/InformaceO">this website</a>.&nbsp;Example:</p>  Katastrální území Název/kód katastrálního území: 73012, and&nbsp;then  Parcelní číslo:&nbsp;2415/1  <p>After solving CAPTCHA which aims to prevent scraping, a list of owners should appear — in the example above we chose a site of Bubny Development.</p><p>We attempted to utilize the cadaster office’s API, developing a script with the Puppeteer JavaScript library. This script was designed to navigate the necessary webpage, complete the form, and interact with buttons. However, our progress was impeded once more due to the CAPTCHA. Even when attempting to use a headless browser to circumvent this challenge, the website failed to load without JavaScript enabled. In essence, it appears that intentional measures have been implemented to make accessing the data difficult.</p><p>With current machine learning methods, it is possible to overcome captcha, however, this method would enter clearly (dark) grey zone legal&nbsp;grounds.</p> Prague’s largest landowners <p>Revealing Prague’s largest landowners is not an easy task. We leveraged a mix of GIS analysis, a manual check of the data register, literature review and interviews. As obtaining a whole data set for Prague is beyond the budget of the project, we were only able to scratch the surface and point to major actors in the city who are widely known to local researchers and journalists.

The contribution organization Pražská developerská společnost, which is supposed to register vacant city plots and plan their development, has a certain overview. According to its representative Martin Červinka, unlike many cities in the west, Prague has relatively enough land for the next few&nbsp;decades.</blockquote><blockquote>The Prague development company currently has land with the potential for the construction of six to eight thousand apartments. According to Červinka, however, it can be estimated that the city may still have land for approximately another ten to twelve thousand apartments.</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://denikreferendum.cz/clanek/35777-priciny-krize-bydleni-zacinaji-uz-u-vlastnictvi-pozemku">— Denik Referendum</a>, (Gaby Khazal — <a href="https://urbanjournalism.org/">Urban Journalism Network</a>)</blockquote>Fig 2.

However, the lack of supply and increased demand only tell part of the&nbsp;story.</p><p>As cheap mortgages were available for years, housing became a popular investment product resulting, for example, in ca 220,000 investment flats in Prague, mostly in the historical centre. Furthermore, some of the following factors helped push homes out of reach for&nbsp;many:</p>  years of <a href="https://denikreferendum.cz/clanek/26609-restituce-privatizace-deregulace-a-politika-bydleni-je-v-troskach">housing policy which has deregulated the market</a>, leading to an increase in privatisation and commodification, coupled with recent attempts for its&nbsp;renewal  little incentive to <a href="https://denikreferendum.cz/clanek/32627-mesta-v-pronajmu-delat-bytovou-politiku-znamena-zacit-sbirat-data">create accessible, coherent datasets</a> that might reveal uncomfortable truths e.g. about the concentration of&nbsp;wealth  slow bureaucracy (e.g. <a href="https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/362481530288062060-0080022018/render/EUSNDBCZLaunchFactsheetEnglish.pdf">slow construction permitting</a>) resulting in stretched planning across political cycles,  low property taxation that does not reflect the value of land (flat tax per district, i.e. in the same district tax on the most fashionable street can be the same as on the peripheral areas), as well as lack of preventative measures such as e.g. <a href="https://balkaninsight.com/2023/08/03/pragues-housing-crisis-surfs-brownfield-wave/">dynamic property taxation</a> for owners that leave investment apartments empty or developers that leave land banks&nbsp;fallow,  little land-value capture (LVC) utilisation (<a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/408eaca3-en/index.html?itemId=/content/component/408eaca3-en">OECD</a> classifies the developer obligations, land readjustment and strategic land management instruments of the LVC as “used rarely” in Czechia), with only the recent introduction of limited <a href="https://www.praha.eu/file/3254972/metodika_kontribuce_investoru.pdf">developer contributions</a> in forms of cash, schools, parks or other public amenities (see: Bubny-Zatory or Zizkov Freight Station brownfield developments).  years of <a href="https://denikreferendum.cz/clanek/35777-priciny-krize-bydleni-zacinaji-uz-u-vlastnictvi-pozemku">continuous sale of municipal land</a> (albeit we can also a see positive signs of declaring a halt to those practices)  <p>These policies have reinforced the emerging global narrative which depicts city authorities as powerless in the face of developers, but this myth can be debunked through recognition of a new set of capabilities within administrations.</p><blockquote>Municipalities can recognize the power of ownership data and its usage as tools for regaining agency in city development.</blockquote><p>As European real estate prices keep rising under the prevailing economic, taxation and housing policy regimes, many urban problems call for reforms around land ownership, its leverage power, and data transparency at the EU, national and city&nbsp;levels.</p> Pledge for data transparency <p>Lack of easily accessible ownership datasets of land ownership, human-business networks and real estate transactions creates a condition where speculation can happen behind the scenes, away from the civic eyes and sense-making capabilities. In an attempt to protect individuals, GDPR data protection rules end up hiding exploitative behaviours, for example by making it impossible to reveal linkages to tax havens, uneven accumulation of wealth through the ownership multiple apartments or land sites, shell companies, and more. As a consequence, the right to land, and housing are further undermined.</p><p>Unfortunately, the European Court of Justice recently declared that the public access of registers containing information about beneficial owners of businesses breaches the right to privacy. Consequently, not just Luxembourg but also the Netherlands has restricted access to the registry of real owners following the verdict. This further sets a precedent for other member states despite having been highlighted by <a href="https://denikreferendum.cz/clanek/34655-rozhovor-ztizeni-pristupu-doevropskych-registru-vlastniku-jevelky-krok-zpet">Denik Referendum</a>, journalists and experts as a significant regression in endeavours to enhance transparency and uncover unjust financial transactions.</p><p>In the Prague context, wide transparency and ease of access for all to land, real estate ownership, transaction and business register data would&nbsp;entail:</p>  ease of access for download of whole-city datasets for city administration, politicians, journalists, researchers, and eventually the general&nbsp;public.  ability to search through the register by owner’s&nbsp;name  ability to link and visualise individuals and their connections to companies and owned land (historical and&nbsp;present)  ability to show transactions.  <p>Current land registry systems are predominantly centralized with data maintained by the govenrmnet or a central authority making the system vulnerable to corruption, hacking, fraud, registration gaps. An update through a transformation of land registry to a blockchain database could alter the data governance framework and render beneficial effects. While <a href="https://journals.muni.cz/mujlt/article/view/11622">benefits and dangers</a> should be taken into consideration this idea has already numerous examples in practice (initiatives undertaken by governments in Republic of Georgia, Sweden, Ukraine, as well as Ghana, Brazil, Honduras, India and&nbsp;Japan).</p><p>All of this could play a key role in improving housing affordability by unlocking:</p>  measures to capture real estate value uplifts due to e.g. public investments, through spatial taxation (see: <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/Smart-Commons-A-new-model-for-investing-in-the-commons">Smart&nbsp;Commons</a>)  progressive taxation on the among of land&nbsp;owned,  taxation of empty housing stock or multi-apartment ownership (hindering speculative behaviours)  real estate developer contributions (large and small) in exchange for usage or plugging in to the municipal assets such as heavier usage of roads, electricity grid, parking space, pressures on the water systems and infrastructure, urban green&nbsp;etc.  greater possibility of building affordable housing thanks to better overview of municipal assets and their relation to other city landowners  expansion of multiplicity of actors able to research, analyse and engage with the data (e.g. urban heat islands and climate adaptation of streets — researchers could develop models which include mostly affected citizens, owners, and tenants to inform and organize collectively towards climate adaptation, as well as whole-city retrofit, and&nbsp;more)   Necessary alliances <p>In this context, the current continuation of the aforementioned <a href="https://cities4rent.journalismarena.media/">Cities for Rent</a> initiative — the <a href="https://urbanjournalism.org/">Urban Journalism Network</a> and its project Ground Control aims to gather investigative journalists from around Europe to address land ownership issues.

Most of these improvements come to Predictoor’s backend: the pdr-backend repo.</p><p>We’ve evolved it a lot lately! Where it mandates the first big release since launch (yet still pre-v1). That’s what this blog post describes.</p><p>The rest of this post is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the prior release (pdr-backend v0.1), and section 3 its challenges. Section 4 describes the new release (pdr-backend v0.2), focusing on its key features of CLI and YAML file, which help usability in running bots. Section 5 describes how v0.2 addresses the challenges of v0.1. Section 6 concludes.</p> 2. About pdr-backend v0.1&nbsp;Flows <p>We released <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend">pdr-backend</a> when we launched Predictoor in September 2023, and have been continually improving it since then: fixing bugs, reducing onboarding friction, and adding more capabilities (eg simulation flow).</p><p>The first official release was <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/releases/tag/v0.1.0">v0.1.0</a> on November 20, 2023; with subsequent v0.1.x releases. It is licensed under <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/LICENSE">Apache V2</a>, a highly permissive open-source license.</p><p>In the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/e93c4becafcf1bf3f81e8f7e4689754c9231ae85/READMEs/predictoor.md">last v0.1 predictoor bot README</a>, the flow had you do simulation, then run a bot on testnet, then run a bot on mainnet. Let’s elaborate.</p><p>Simulation. You’d start simulation with a call like: python pdr_backend/simulation/runtrade.py. It grabs historical data, builds models, predicts, does simulated trades, then repeats, all on historical data. It logs and plots progress in real time. It would run according to default settings: what price feeds to use for AI model inputs, how much training data, etc. Those settings were hardcoded in the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/e93c4becafcf1bf3f81e8f7e4689754c9231ae85/pdr_backend/simulation/runtrade.py">runtrade.py</a> script. To change settings, you’d have to change the script itself, or support&nbsp;code.</p>A snippet of parameters from v0.1 <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/e93c4becafcf1bf3f81e8f7e4689754c9231ae85/pdr_backend/simulation/runtrade.py">runtrade.py</a> script<p>Run a bot on testnet. First, you’d specify envvars via the terminal: your private key, envvars for network (e.g. RPC_URL), and envvars to specify feeds (PAIR_FILTER,TIMEFRAME_FILTER, SOURCE_FILTER). Then you’d run the bot with a call like:python pdr_backend/predictoor/main.py 3. It would run according to default settings. The 3meant predictoor approach #3: dynamic model building. To change predictoor settings, you’d have to change&nbsp;code.</p>Setting envvars in&nbsp;v0.1<p>Run a bot on mainnet. This was like testnet, except specifying different envvars for network and perhaps private&nbsp;key.</p><p>Any further configurations, such as what CEX data sources to use in modeling, would be hardcoded in the script. To use different values, you’d have to modify those in your local copy of the&nbsp;code.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/e93c4becafcf1bf3f81e8f7e4689754c9231ae85/READMEs/trader.md">last v0.1 trader bot README</a> had a similar flow to the v0.1 predictoor bot&nbsp;README.</p> 3. Challenges in pdr-backend v0.1&nbsp;Flows <p>We were — and are — proud of the v0.1 predictoor bot &amp; trader bot flows. We’d streamlined them fairly well: one could get going quickly, and accomplish what they needed to. To go further and modify parameters, one would have to jump into Python code. At first glance this might have thought this a problem; however target users (and actual users) are data scientists or developers, who have no trouble modifying code.</p><p>Yet there were a few issues. First, it was annoying to manually change code to change parameters.</p>  We could have written higher-level code that looped, and modified the parameters code at each loop iteration; however code that changes code is error-prone and can be dangerous.  Trader bots and predictoor bots had the same issue, and worse: the py code for parameter changes was scattered in a few places. Even if the scattering was fixed, the core issue would&nbsp;remain.  <p>Second, envvars didn’t have enough fidelity, and adding more would have led to an unusably high number of&nbsp;envvars.</p>  Recall that we used envvars to specify feeds (PAIR_FILTER, etc). This wasn’t enough detail for all our needs. For example, in running a predictoor bot, one couldn’t use envvars to specify the model output feed (what feed to predict) and model input price feeds, let alone non-price feeds for model&nbsp;inputs.  And, putting it into envvars would be sloppy and error-prone; if we weren’t careful, we’d have a crazy number of&nbsp;envvars.  <p>Third, a messy CLI was organically emerging.</p>  Recall, one would run a predictoor bot with a custom call directly to the script, such as:python pdr_backend/predictoor/main.py 3, where 3meant approach 3. Similar for simulation or trader&nbsp;flows.  Support for CLI-level parameters was pretty basic, only lightly tested, and was implemented on a per-script basis. Then, from our own runs of predictoor bots we were starting to do basic analytics, and a new&nbsp;./scripts/directory emerged, with each script having its own custom CLI call. Things were getting messier&nbsp;yet.  <p>Finally, we wanted to extend pdr-backend functionality, and doing it in v0.1 code would explode complexity.</p>  We have big plans for our “make $” experiments, and for these, we saw the need to extend functionality by a&nbsp;lot.  We wanted to build out a proper analytics app. We wanted to professionalize and operationalize the data pipeline, for use by simulation, the bots, and the analytics app.  We wanted to extend simulation, into a flow that supported experiments on realtime data and with the possibility of live trading. Doing this would have means even more parameters and flows; if we kept the v0.1 parameter-setting and messy CLI then complexity would become unwieldy. We needed a cleaner base before we could&nbsp;proceed.   4. Introducing pdr-backend v0.2 <p>We’re pleased to announce the release of <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/releases/tag/v0.2.0">pdr-backend v0.2</a>. It solves the issues above 🎉 via a good CLI, and a YAML file to set parameters. It’s live now in the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend">pdr-backend repo</a>.</p><p>The rest of this section describes the heavily-updated CLI, the YAML file, and changes to the pdr-backend architecture for a good data pipeline and analytics.</p> 4.1 Updated&nbsp;CLI <p>You get started with Predictoor like&nbsp;before:</p> git clone https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend<br>cd pdr-backend<br>python -m venv venv # create &amp; activate virtual env't<br>source venv/bin/activate<br>pip install -r requirements.txt # install modules<br>export PATH=$PATH:. # add pwd to path <p>Then, you can type pdr to see the interface at the command-line:</p> $ pdr<br>Predictoor tool<br><br>Usage: pdr xpmt|predictoor|trader|..<br><br>Main tools:<br>  pdr xpmt PPSS_FILE<br>  pdr predictoor APPROACH PPSS_FILE NETWORK<br>  pdr trader APPROACH PPSS_FILE NETWORK<br>  pdr lake PPSS_FILE NETWORK<br>  pdr claim_OCEAN PPSS_FILE<br>  pdr claim_ROSE PPSS_FILE<br><br>Utilities:<br>  pdr help<br>  pdr &lt;cmd&gt; -h<br>  pdr get_predictoors_info ST END PQDIR PPSS_FILE NETWORK --PDRS<br>  pdr get_predictions_info ST END PQDIR PPSS_FILE NETWORK --FEEDS<br>  pdr get_traction_info ST END PQDIR PPSS_FILE NETWORK --FEEDS<br>  pdr check_network PPSS_FILE NETWORK --LOOKBACK_HOURS<br><br>Transactions are signed with envvar 'PRIVATE_KEY`.<br><br>Tools for core team:<br>  pdr trueval PPSS_FILE NETWORK<br>  pdr dfbuyer PPSS_FILE NETWORK<br>  pdr publisher PPSS_FILE NETWORK<br>  pdr topup PPSS_FILE NETWORK<br>  pytest, black, mypy, pylint, .. <p>There are commands to run experiments / simulation (pdr xpmt), predictoor bot (pdr predictoor), trader bot (pdr trader), and for people running predictoor bots to claim rewards (pdr claim_OCEAN, pdr claim_ROSE).</p><p>There’s a new command to fill the data lake (pdr lake), and several new analytics-related commands (pdr get_predictoors_info&nbsp;,&nbsp;…, pdr check_network ). Remaining commands are typically for use by the core&nbsp;team.</p><p>To get help for a given command, just type the command without any argument&nbsp;values.</p> 4.2 New: YAML&nbsp;file <p>The default file is <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/ppss.yaml">ppss.yaml</a>. Most CLI commands take PPSS_FILE (YAML file) as an input argument. Therefore users can make their own copy from the default ppss.yaml, and modify at&nbsp;will.</p><p>The YAML file holds most parameters; the CLI specifies which YAML file and network, and sometimes commonly-updated parameters.</p>  To minimize confusion, there are no envvars. All parameters are in the YAML file or the CLI. One exception: PRIVATE_KEY envvar is retained because putting it in a file would have reduced security.  <p>The YAML file has a sub-section for each bot: a predictoor_ss section, a trader_ss section, etc. The web3_pp section holds info for all networks.</p><p>Below is an an example of the predictoor_ss section in the YAML file. Note how it specifies a feed to predict (predict_feed), as well as input feeds for AI modeling (aimodel_ss.input_feeds).</p> predictoor_ss:<br>  predict_feed: binance BTC/USDT c 1h<br>  bot_only:<br>    s_until_epoch_end: 60 # in s. Start predicting if there's &gt; this time left<br>    stake_amount: 1 # stake this amount with each prediction. In OCEAN<br>  aimodel_ss:<br>    input_feeds:<br>      - binance BTC/USDT c 1h<br>#      - binance BTC/USDT ETH/USDT BNB/USDT XRP/USDT ADA/USDT DOGE/USDT SOL/USDT LTC/USDT TRX/USDT DOT/USDT ohlcv 1h<br>#      - kraken BTC/USDT 1h<br>    max_n_train: 5000 # no. epochs to train model on<br>    autoregressive_n : 10 # no. epochs that model looks back, to predict next<br>    approach: LIN <p>Most CLI commands take NETWORK as an input argument. The YAML file holds RPC_URL and other network parameters for each network. Combining this, the NETWORK CLI argument selects from them. Therefore to wants to use a different network (e.g. testnet → mainnet), then one only needs to change the network name in the CLI. Compare this to v0.1 where several envvars needed changing. A bonus: the new setup allows convenient storage of many different network configurations (in the YAML&nbsp;file).</p><p>When the whole YAML file is read, it creates a <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/pdr_backend/ppss/ppss.py">PPSS</a> object. That object has attributes corresponding to each bot: a predictoor_ss object (of class <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/pdr_backend/ppss/predictoor_ss.py">PredictoorSS</a>), a trader_ss object (of class <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/pdr_backend/ppss/trader_ss.py">TraderSS</a>), etc. It also holds network info in its web3_pp object (of class&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/pdr_backend/ppss/web3_pp.py">Web3PP</a>).</p> 4.3 New: Good data&nbsp;pipeline <p>We refined pdr-backend architecture to have a proper data pipeline, in new directory /lake/. It’s centered around a data lake with tiers from raw → refined. We’ve moved from storing raw price data as csv files, to <a href="https://www.databricks.com/glossary/what-is-parquet#:~:text=What%20is%20Parquet%3F,handle%20complex%20data%20in%20bulk.">parquet</a> files, because parquet supports querying without needing to have a special database layer on top (!), among other benefits.</p><p>In conjunction, we’ve moved from <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> dataframes to <a href="https://pola.rs/">Polars</a> dataframes, because Polars scales better and plays well with parquet. (We are already seeing intensive data management and expect our data needs to grow by several orders of magnitude.)</p> 4.4 New: Space to grow analytics <p>We’ve also updated pdr-backend analytics support, in the new directory /analytics/&nbsp;. First, what used to be ad-hoc scripts for analytics tools now has proper CLI support:pdr get_predictoors_info&nbsp;,&nbsp;…, pdr check_network. These analytics tools now use data from the lake, and continue to be evolved. Furthermore, we are building towards a more powerful analytics app that uses python-style plotting in the browser, via streamlit.</p> 5. How pdr-backend v0.2 Fixes v0.1&nbsp;Issues <p>Here’s how v0.2 fixes each of the four issues raised&nbsp;above.</p>  Issue: Annoying to manually change code to change parameters  v0.2 fix: use YAML file &amp; CLI for all parameters. The YAML file holds most parameters; the CLI specifies which YAML file and network, and sometimes commonly-updated parameters. The YAML file holds parameters that were previously envvars, or somewhere in code. <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/ppss.yaml">Here’s</a> the default YAML&nbsp;file.  Issue: envvars didn’t have enough&nbsp;fidelity  v0.2 fix: use YAML file &amp; CLI for all parameters. In the YAML file, each bot gets its own subsection, including which feeds to work with. The YAML has far more fidelity because it also includes variables that were previously in&nbsp;code.  Issue: a messy CLI was organically emerging  v0.2 fix: now we have a clean CLI. Previous calls to scripts for simulation, predictoor bot, trader bot, and various analytics are all now folded into the CLI. The CLI is implemented in new directory /cli/; its core modules <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/pdr_backend/cli/cli_arguments.py">cli_arguments.py</a> and <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/pdr_backend/cli/cli_module.py">cli_module.py</a> use argparse, the best-practices CLI library for Python. The CLI has <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/tree/main/pdr_backend/cli/test">unit tests and system&nbsp;tests</a>.  Issue: we wanted to extend pdr-backend functionality, and doing it in v0.1 code would explode complexity.  v0.2 fix: YAML &amp; clean CLI give a less-complex, more flexible foundation to build from. And we’re now nicely along in our progress: as we were building v0.2, we have also refined its architecture to have a proper data pipeline (in /lake/), the beginnings of a more powerful analytics app (in /analytics/), and are about to upgrade the simulation engine for more flexible and powerful experiments.   6. Conclusion <p>With Ocean Predictoor, you can run AI-powered prediction bots or trading bots on crypto price feeds to earn $. With pdr-backend v0.2, the interface to use predictoor bots &amp; trader bots just got a lot simpler, via a CLI and using a YAML file for parameters. It also refactors backend code such to that we can do more powerful experiments around making&nbsp;$.</p><p>Get started at the pdr-backend’s <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend">README</a>.</p> Notes <p>[1] Two 1.86M values is a coincidence.

  <p>There’s a plethora of data connectors for Microsoft Sentinel, from Microsoft and Azure services to third party sources and custom logs. This data is only as good as the analytical value it brings. During investigations – both proactive and reactive – visualizing data in different formats offers value into finding anomalies, patterns, and insights difficult to spot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When working with data which includes geographic related information such as Microsoft Entra sign-in logs, visualizing the data through a proper medium is essential to making the most use of the data. This is where using interactive maps for Sentinel and Log Analytics workspace comes into play. As of the writing of this blog article, it’s not possible to use the interactive map directly within the Logs section of Sentinel or Log Analytics workspace. Instead, the Azure Data Explorer web app or <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/tools/kusto-explorer">Kusto Explorer desktop app</a> must be used. This article will use Azure Data Explorer for all examples. The setup required for this is simple and only takes a few minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Setup and configuration 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first step is to go to the <a href="https://dataexplorer.azure.com/">Azure Data Explorer</a> web app and click on Add in the top left of the screen, and then select Connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1 Adding connection to Azure Data Explorer (ADX)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point, a window will appear asking for a connection. To connect to a Sentinel instance (it’s actually the Log Analytics workspace), the following information is required:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Subscription ID 
 Resource group name – this is the resource group where the Log Analytics workspace is in 
 Log Analytics workspace name 
 
<p>All of these can be found simply by clicking on Settings in the Sentinel menu and then clicking Workspace settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 2 Workspace settings of the Sentinel instance</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After clicking on Workspace settings, the information required will be available on the screen as shown below. This is also true if you’re connecting to a Log Analytics workspace without Sentinel. By going to the Log Analytics workspace’s page, the page below will open.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 3 Workspace settings of the Sentinel instance</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The connection URI needs to be in the following format:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://ade.loganalytics.io/subscriptions/&lt;subscription-id&gt;/resourcegroups/&lt;resource-group-name&gt;/providers/microsoft.operationalinsights/workspaces/&lt;workspace-name&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the connection URI has been updated with the required values, it can be added to the section in Azure Data Explorer, and once a display name has been entered click Add. Ensure that the Log Analytics workspace configured in the connection URI is in the tenant shown at the bottom of the window. If the Log Analytics workspace is in a tenant other than the one signed in as in Azure Data Explorer, the tenant can be switched on this screen as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 4 Adding the connection URI to Azure Data Explorer (ADX)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the connection has been set up, it should be viewable under Connections in the left menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 5 A table from the newly configured connection</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To query the tables, select the workspace and enter the query as you would normally do in the Sentinel Logs screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 6 Running a query in ADX</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Using the interactive map 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To use the interactive map, the data must contain longitude and latitude data. Mapping based on country, state, or city names will not work. The format of the longitude and latitude should be in decimal degrees. This means that 41.40338 and 2.17403 will work but 41°24'12.2"N and 2°10'26.5"E will not work. Most tables in Sentinel will have geographical data in the correct format already.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The render operator must be used followed by “scatterchart with (kind=map)” to generate the interactive map. There is documentation about parameters which affect <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/geospatial-visualizations">geospatial data visualizations</a>. One rule is the first two columns of the query output must be the longitude and latitude values, in that order. While the specific columns for longitude and latitude can be selected manually after running the query, it adds an extra step that’s easily skipped by ensuring the proper order of columns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The query below will take count of Entra sign ins from each location and then visualize it on an interactive map.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(7d)
| where isnotempty(LocationDetails.geoCoordinates)
| extend Latitude = toreal(LocationDetails.geoCoordinates["latitude"])
| extend Longitude = toreal(LocationDetails.geoCoordinates["longitude"])
| summarize Count = count() by Longitude, Latitude
| project Longitude, Latitude, Count
| render scatterchart with (kind=map)
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 7 Interactive map result of query</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the map is interactive, you can zoom in and move around freely. Clicking on the objects will show the values based on the query output. In the query example above, the number of sign ins from that location were being calculated and therefore this is shown when clicked on the object.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 8 Interactive map result of query</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After running the query in the Azure Data Explorer page, a menu will appear to the right of the results. This section will allow you to change settings of the visualization of the query results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 9 Settings options on the right which allows you to configure which outputs will affect size on interactive map</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s possible to set the circle sizes proportional to the number of sign ins (or any other numerical value that may exist in the query output). To do this, the Size section needs to be turned on by toggling the Hide toggle and then the column which will determine the size can be selected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The effect of configuring the Size section can be seen below. Note how the circle sizes are now different.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 10 Ability to select which output determines the size of the items on the map</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 11 Interactive map result of query with point sizes based on output values</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Visualizing geographical data can give insights that may be difficult to find when using other visualization methods. Once a connection has been setup from Azure Data Explorer Sentinel logs such as Entra ID, sign-in logs can be queried and visualized on an interactive map, making investigations much more effective.</p>

  <p>One of the best practices for securing your organization's data is to follow the principle of least privilege, which means granting users the minimum level of permissions they need to perform their tasks. Microsoft Entra ID helps you apply this principle by offering a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference">wide range of built-in roles</a> as well as allowing you to create custom roles and assign them to users or groups based on their responsibilities and access needs. You can also use Entra ID to review and revoke any role assignments that are no longer needed or appropriate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It can be easy to lose track of role assignments if admin activities are not carefully audited and monitored. Routine checks of role assignments and generating alerts on new role assignments are one way to track and manage privileged role assignment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chances are that when a user with privileged roles is approached, they’ll say they need the role. This may be true; however, many times users will unknowingly say they need those permissions to carry out certain tasks when they could be assigned a role with lower permissions. For example, a user will be able to reset user passwords as a Global Administrator, but that does not mean they can’t do that with another role with far less permissions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Defining privileged permissions 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/privileged-roles-permissions?tabs=admin-center#terminology">Privileged permissions in Entra ID</a> can be defined as “permissions that can be used to delegate management of directory resources to other users, modify credentials, authentication or authorization policies, or access restricted data.” Entra ID roles each have a list of permissions defined to them. When an identity is granted the role, the identity also inherits the permissions defined in the role.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s important to check the permissions of these roles. The permissions defined in all built-in roles can be found <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference">here</a>. For example, there are a few permissions that are different for the Privileged Authentication Administrator role than the Authentication Administrator role, giving the former more permissions in Entra ID. The differences between the authentication roles can be viewed <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/privileged-roles-permissions?tabs=admin-center#compare-authentication-roles">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another example of having differences between similar roles is for the end user administration roles. The differences and nuances between these roles are outlined in detail <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/privileged-roles-permissions?tabs=admin-center#who-can-reset-passwords">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Auditing activity 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To decide if a user really needs a role, it’s crucial to monitor their activities and find the role with the least privilege that allows them to carry out their work. You’ll need Entra ID audit logs for this. Entra ID audit logs can either be sent to a Log Analytics Workspace or connected to a Sentinel instance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two methods that can be used to get the events of carried out by admin accounts. The first will make use of the IdentityInfo table, which is only available in Sentinel after enabling User and Entity Behavior Analytics (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/enable-entity-behavior-analytics">UEBA</a>). If you aren’t using UEBA in Sentinel or if you’re querying a Log Analytics Workspace, then you'll need to use the second method in the next heading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Using Microsoft Sentinel 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To ingest Entra ID audit logs into Microsoft Sentinel, the Microsoft Entra ID data connector must be enabled, and the Audit Logs must be ticked as seen below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1 Entra ID data connector in Sentinel with Audit logs enabled&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The IdentityInfo table stores user information gathered by UEBA. Therefore, it also includes the Entra ID roles a user has been assigned. This makes it very simple to get a list of accounts that have been assigned privileged roles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The query below will give a unique list of activities an account has taken, as well as which roles the account has been assigned:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
AuditLogs 
| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(90d) 
| extend ActorName = iif( 
                         isnotempty(tostring(InitiatedBy["user"])),  
                         tostring(InitiatedBy["user"]["userPrincipalName"]), 
                         tostring(InitiatedBy["app"]["displayName"]) 
                     ) 
| extend ActorID = iif( 
                       isnotempty(tostring(InitiatedBy["user"])),  
                       tostring(InitiatedBy["user"]["id"]), 
                       tostring(InitiatedBy["app"]["id"]) 
                   ) 
| where isnotempty(ActorName) 
| join kind=inner (IdentityInfo 
    | where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(7d) 
    | where strlen(tostring(AssignedRoles)) &gt; 2 
    | summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by AccountUPN 
    | project AccountObjectId, AssignedRoles) 
    on $left.ActorID == $right.AccountObjectId 
| summarize Operations = make_set(OperationName) by ActorName, ActorID, Identity, tostring(AssignedRoles) 
| extend OperationsCount = array_length(Operations) 
| project ActorName, AssignedRoles, Operations, OperationsCount, ActorID, Identity 
| sort by OperationsCount desc 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will give results for all accounts that carried out tasks in Entra ID and may generate too many operations that were not privileged. To filter for specific Entra ID roles, the following query can be run where the roles are defined in a list. Three roles have been added as examples, but this list can and should be expanded to include more roles:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
let PrivilegedRoles = dynamic(["Global Administrator", 
                               "Security Administrator", 
                               "Compliance Administrator" 
                              ]);

                         tostring(InitiatedBy["user"]["userPrincipalName"]), 
                         tostring(InitiatedBy["app"]["displayName"]) 
                     )

<p>Once the query is run, the results will give insights into the activities performed in your Entra ID tenant and what roles those accounts have. In the example below, the top two results don’t pose any problems. However, the third row contains a user that has the Global Administrator role and has created a service principal. The permissions needed to create a service principal can be found in roles less privileged than the Global Administrator role. Therefore, this user can be given a less privileged role. To find out which role can be granted, check <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/delegate-by-task">this list</a>, which contains the least privileged role required to carry out specific tasks in Entra ID.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because there is no table that contains the roles an identity has been granted, you’ll need to add the list of users to the query and filter them. There are multiple ways to get a list of users who have been assigned a specific Entra ID role. A quick way to do this is to go to Entra ID and then select Roles and administrators. From there, select the role and export the identities that have been assigned to it. It’s important to have the User Principal Names (UPNs) of the privileged users. You’ll need to add these UPNs, along with the roles the user has, to the query. Some examples have been given in the query itself. If the user has more than one role, then all roles must be added to the query.</p>

                                tostring(InitiatedBy["user"]["userPrincipalName"]), 
                                tostring(InitiatedBy["app"]["displayName"]) 
                            ) 
        | extend ActorID = iif( 
                            isnotempty(tostring(InitiatedBy["user"])),  
                            tostring(InitiatedBy["user"]["id"]), 
                            tostring(InitiatedBy["app"]["id"]) 
                        ) 
        | where isnotempty(ActorName) ) on $left.UserPrincipalName == $right.ActorName 
| summarize Operations = make_set(OperationName) by ActorName, ActorID, tostring(Roles) 
| extend OperationsCount = array_length(Operations) 
| project ActorName, Operations, OperationsCount, Roles, ActorID 
| sort by OperationsCount desc 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you run the query, the results will give insights into the activities performed in your Entra ID tenant by the users you have filtered for. In the example below, the top two results can cause problems. Both have the Global Administrator role, but their operations don’t necessitate to have that role. The permissions needed for these operations can be found in roles less privileged than the Global Administrator role. Therefore, these users can be given a less privileged role. To find out which role can be granted, check <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/delegate-by-task">this list</a>, which contains the least privileged role required to carry out specific tasks in Entra ID.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 4 Actions taken by users in Entra ID</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this user still requires the Global Administrator role then the Security Administrator role will become redundant as the Global Administrator contains more permissions than the Security Administrator role.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keeping accounts with privileges that are not required is keeping your attack surface greater than it needs to be. By ingesting Entra ID Audit logs, you can query and identify users who have unnecessary and over-privileged roles. You can then find a suitable alternative role for them.&nbsp;</p>

			 What is a digital signature and how does it work? 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>In the form of a coded message, a digital signature securely links a signer to a document in a recorded transaction. Digital signatures employ a standardized and widely accepted format known as Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to ensure the utmost levels of security and universal acceptance. PKI entails the use of a digital certificate for identity verification.</p>						 
				 
				 
				 
			 How do digital signature works? 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>Digital signatures, similar to handwritten signatures, are unique to each signer. Providers of digital signature solutions, such as InfoCert, adhere to a specific protocol known as Public Key Infrastructure, or PKI. PKI mandates that the provider utilizes a mathematical algorithm to generate two long numbers, referred to as keys. One key is public, and the other is private.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When a signer electronically signs a document, the signature is formed using the signer’s private key, which is securely held by the signer. The mathematical algorithm functions as a cipher, creating data that matches the signed document, known as a hash, and encrypting that data. The resulting encrypted data constitutes the digital signature. Additionally, the signature is timestamped with the time of document signing. If the document undergoes changes after signing, the digital signature becomes invalid.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, John signs an agreement to sell a timeshare using her private key. The buyer receives the document along with a copy of John’s public key. If the public key cannot decrypt the signature (via the cipher used to generate the keys), it indicates that the signature either does not belong to John or has been altered since it was signed. In such cases, the signature is deemed invalid.</p><p>To uphold the integrity of the signature, PKI mandates that the keys be created, managed, and stored securely. This often involves the services of a reputable Certificate Authority (CA). Digital signature providers, like InfoCert, comply with PKI requirements to ensure secure digital signing.</p>						 
				 
				 
				 
			 What’s the difference between an electronic signature and a digital signature? 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>A digital signature is a form of electronic signature that demands a higher level of identity verification through digital certificates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The broader category of electronic signatures (e-signatures) encompasses various types of electronic signatures. This category includes digital signatures, which represent a specific technological implementation of electronic signatures. Both digital signatures and other e-signature solutions enable the signing of documents and authentication of the signer. However, distinctions exist in terms of purpose, technical implementation, geographical usage, and the legal and cultural acceptance of digital signatures compared to other types of e-signatures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, the utilization of digital signature technology for e-signatures varies significantly between countries following open, technology-neutral e-signature laws, such as the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, and those adopting tiered eSignature models favoring locally defined standards based on digital signature technology. This includes many countries in the European Union, South America, and Asia. In the European Union, governed by the eIDAS regulation, two levels of digital signatures exist: Advanced Electronic Signature (AES) and Qualified Electronic Signature (QES).</p><p>Furthermore, certain industries also endorse specific standards rooted in digital signature technology</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p> Navigating the Digital Identity Landscape 
<p>While eIDAS 2.0 centers on fostering interoperability and setting standards for digital identity, the EUDI Wallet serves as a tangible tool for users, thereby contributing to the development of a comprehensive digital identity ecosystem.</p>
<p>The Electronic IDentification and trust Services Regulation, more commonly known as eIDAS, aims to create a unified digital identity framework, promoting interoperability and trust in cross-border interactions. eIDAS 2.0 represents a paradigm shift, addressing key challenges that hindered the initial eIDAS regulation's widespread adoption. Its revision was triggered by low implementation of eIDAS by European Union (EU) member states. The revised eIDAS 2.0 plans to provide private individuals a trusted and secure means of sharing verified identity and data attributes with not just public but also private services.</p>
<p>Key to the eIDAS regulation is the digital wallet, with each member state responsible for providing a digital identity wallet to every citizen who wants one. With the ambitious goal of <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EPRS_BRI(2022)699491">80% of EU residents using a digital identity by 2030</a>, the idea is to provide all citizens and residents across the EU with highly secure and privacy preserving digital wallets that can be used to manage various digital credentials. As a result, a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_5651">final agreement</a> on eID was reached by the European Parliament and the Council on November 8, 2023.</p>
 Things to consider 
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/kuppingercole-analysts-predict-verified-identitys-market-/">KuppingerCole market sizing research</a> indicates that the financial, government, and health care sectors already see the highest use of a verified digital identity to remotely onboard and enroll users. While these may be the most frequent users of verified digital identity, other industries are rapidly showing interest. This expected growth is in line with the overall growth of this segment, marked by increasing maturity of technologies, increasing adoption across a wider range of industries, and an increased use of eIDs and digital wallets. However, the true potential lies not in restricting these technologies to specific use cases but in embracing their capacity to simplify a multitude of interactions.</p>
<p>Far from being a mere tool, the EUDI Wallet could serve as a means for the adoption of digital services by providing a unified approach to identity management. From e-commerce to government processes and beyond, the EUDI Wallet and eIDAS 2.0 have the potential to integrate decentralized identity principles into existing applications and build new digital services that benefit from them. Nevertheless, ensuring security and interoperability will be challenging - especially at the massive scale of users and use cases the EU is targeting.</p>
<p>In addition, the digital identity issuance and applicability must not just be for one organization or use case – if a user has access to a verified, digital identity, they must be able to use it for many different purposes, with many different service providers in disparate industries, and even with public institutions. Therefore, solutions must be flexible and extensible: flexible to provide adjustable levels of assurance to each use case or flow, and extensible to address the increasingly complex interoperability needs and security considerations.</p>
 Reaping the benefits 
<p>The wallet's full potential extends far beyond specific use cases, encompassing its applicability in e-commerce, organizational and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/leveraging-decentralized-identity-enterprise-eic2023">enterprise settings</a>, government interactions, and more. Key components to consider when selecting the right technology mix for a digital identity solution will include high functionality with exceptional user experience. The crucial factor here is the widespread acceptance of the EUDI Wallet, which hinges on its user-friendliness, security, and global functionality. Achieving acceptance becomes feasible when the system is easier to use and seamlessly works on a global scale.</p>
<p>Done right, the economy stands to gain significantly from the simplification brought about by the EUDI Wallet. One of the primary benefits is a reduction in drop-off rates, as the streamlined and user-friendly nature of the wallet ensures a smoother process, preventing potential users from abandoning digital interactions midway. Additionally, the simplification enabled by the wallet helps reduce overall process costs. Eliminating unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles and reducing in the time required for various transactions further bolster the economic benefits.</p>
<p>In essence, the key to unlocking the full potential of the EUDI Wallet lies not only in its technical capabilities, but equally in the investments made to educate users, promote transparency, and cultivate a user base that recognizes the transformative impact of digital wallets on both the personal and economic landscape. Emphasizing the versatility of the EUDI Wallet in various economic facets is critical for user adoption, which ultimately leads to a more efficient and connected economy. User education will therefore be an important part of success, as will an iterative approach.</p>

<p>Safety is core to social media. Transparency is essential to building trust in moderation efforts, and the data we are providing here is a first step towards full transparency reports. We hope these early disclosures provide some visibility into our behind the scenes operations, and we intend to deliver more granular data and reporting in the future. Given the transparent nature of the network, independent researchers also already have direct access to relatively rich data on labeling and moderation interventions.</p>
 High-Level Overview 
<p>Over the past year, the Bluesky app has grown from a handful of friends and developers to over 3 million registered accounts. We have hired and trained a full-time team of moderators, launched and iterated on several community and individual moderation features, developed and refined policies both public and internal, designed and redesigned product features to reduce abuse, and built several infrastructure components from scratch to support our Trust and Safety work.</p>
<p>We’ve made a lot of progress, and we know we still have a long way to go to deliver on the vision we set out — including <a>composable moderation</a>, mute words, temporary account deactivation, and collaborative programs to combat misinformation (such as Community Notes). We will have more to share in coming weeks! But first here is an overview of 2023.</p>
 Reporting By The Numbers 
<p>One of the most obvious and visible forms of moderation on Bluesky is the report-and-review feedback loop. Any user can report content such as posts, accounts, or lists through the app. We then review reported content and behavior against both the <a>Community Guidelines</a> and <a>Terms of Service</a>, and take action when appropriate.</p>
<p>Our team of proactive and very-much-appreciated full-time moderators have provided around-the-clock coverage since spring. We’re doing things differently than a lot of social media sites, and hired our moderators directly, rather than relying on a third-party vendor. While we might use automated tools to handle reports in the future, right now every single report filed has been reviewed by humans, with no automated resolution. In 2023 we reviewed 358,165 individual reports.</p>

The report categories in this graph&nbsp; are based on the `com.atproto.moderation.defs#reasonType` schema. Currently, these categories do not clearly align with the in-app copy for reports. The categories shown in-app will be updated and harmonized soon. <a>Download the raw data as a TSV file here</a>.
<p>A relatively small fraction of accounts was responsible for creating the majority of reports, and separately a small fraction of accounts received the majority of reports. In total 76,699 individual accounts (5.6% of our active users) created one or more reports, and 45,861 individual accounts (3.4% of our active users) received one or more reports (either on the overall account, or on a piece of content created by the account).</p>
<p>When we take action on a report, our interventions have ranged from sending warning emails, to labeling, to takedowns of content or entire accounts. Takedowns can be either temporary suspensions or take effect permanently. While we used all of our interventions over the course of 2023, this post only includes a breakdown of takedowns: 4,667 accounts taken down, and an additional 1,817 individual pieces of content taken down.</p>
<p>In addition to reports from the community, we have a number of automated tools to proactively detect suspicious or harmful conduct without a user first reporting it to the moderation team, such as slurs in handles and spam accounts. Some of these tools take direct action on visual content by applying labels like "gore" to violent imagery, while others simply file automated reports for human review. Users can appeal labels applied to their account through the same in-app reporting flow, which the moderation team will then take another look at. The numbers above do not include the large volume of reports created by our own automated systems.</p>
<p>Child sexual abuse and exploitation, including the distribution of child sexual abuse material (CSAM), is obviously unacceptable anywhere on the Internet, including Bluesky. We built AT Protocol and Bluesky to ensure we can rapidly identify and remove this content anywhere it appears on our network, even when federation becomes available in the future. To help proactively detect, take down, review, and report CSAM to the applicable authorities (including NCMEC in the United States), we partnered with an established non-profit vendor who provides both hash matching APIs and specialist web apps for review and reporting. While any instance of this behavior is dangerous and warrants prompt action, to date we have thankfully not yet encountered a significant volume of such content in the network. However, our systems proactively identified four instances of potential CSAM, of which two were statistical false-positives, and two were confirmed to meet reporting requirements and were reported to NCMEC.</p>
<p>For this report, we are not yet including counts of legal requests and the fraction of requests serviced, nor are all of our moderation actions (such as labels) fully represented in the numbers we’ve shared here. We look forward to providing more granular data and reporting in the future. Given the transparent nature of the network, independent researchers also already have direct access to relatively rich data on labeling and moderation interventions.</p>
 Interaction Controls 
<p>No amount of reactive moderation will help if the base design of a product rewards abuse or inflames inter-community conflict. In 2023, we added a number of app and protocol features that give individuals and groups more control over their interactions in the network, with the aim of building safety options into the design of Bluesky itself.</p>
<p>Moderation lists can be used for muting and blocking. Individuals can maintain curated lists of accounts for an entire community, reducing duplicated efforts. Lists themselves are always public, and the behaviors of lists match the privacy of individual-level actions: blocking a list is public, while muting a list is private. Like all technical safety features, lists have both advantages and disadvantages as a moderation primitive. They can be a vector for harassment and abuse (and thus themselves require moderation), become difficult to maintain at larger scale, and have no built-in affordances for collaborative control or accountability. On the other hand, they are relatively familiar and easy to understand, have a low barrier to adoption, and integrate easily with everyday use of the app.</p>
<p>Self-labeling of individual posts lets authors ensure appropriate content warnings are in place for viewers. This feature is currently limited to posts with visual images and adult content, but there is a clear path to expanding the scope to more labels.</p>

  
  
    The self-labeling feature.

<p>Reply controls give authors choice over who can interact in their threads, including the ability to close all replies to a post.</p>

  
  
  
      The reply controls feature.

<p>There are several more basic interaction controls in development or on the horizon. The ability to hide individual posts and to appeal labeling decisions on your own posts are both available now as beta-quality features. We are also tracking requests for the ability to mute keywords, and for users to be able to temporarily deactivate their own account. We’ll share more about these planned features in the coming months.</p>
 Supporting Tools and Infrastructure 
<p>Trust and safety efforts rely on tooling — and a lot of our work has been building the supporting tooling and infrastructure for this work from scratch. We’ve made a lot of progress in 2023 behind the scenes to support our moderation teams and policies.</p>
<p>Our moderation review tools have gone through major refactors and workflow improvements over the year, based on feedback from our moderators and policy experts. What started as a minimal admin interface can now handle tiered review queues, templated email workflows, moderation event timelines, and more. From a technical perspective, the APIs driving this system, both reporting and review, are defined the same way as other atproto endpoints, which supports interoperability with other alternative clients and workflow systems. We named the front-end interface of the moderation review system Ozone, and we plan to open-source it soon. We’re also in the process of pulling out the moderation back-end as a standalone service that other organizations can self-host.</p>

Screenshot of the Ozone web interface, from a development environment.
<p>Lastly, we have developed a rule-based automod framework to augment our moderation team when battling spam, and to proactively flag unacceptable content before it gets seen and reported by human users. This has helped identify some patterns of engagement farming and spam, and we will continue to develop and refine abuse detectors as we move towards open federation and growing the network.</p>

 Proactive Cyber Security needs TDIR 
 
<p>Organizations and society in general have become more and more dependent on IT delivered services.&nbsp; This has increased the potential impact of risks from cyber-attacks.&nbsp; Cybersecurity needs to meet this challenge by moving beyond the traditional approach of protection, detection, and response.</p>
 Limit Attacker Free Time 
 
<p>The old model of a risk arising from a largely static threat exploiting a known vulnerability to cause damage is no longer adequate for today’s cyber environment.&nbsp; The cyber “<a href="http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/corporate/documents/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf">Kill Chain</a>” explains how threat actors are active within the cyber infrastructure well before a vulnerability is exploited.&nbsp; Therefore, it is not sufficient simply to remove known vulnerabilities - it is essential to detect cyber threat activity prior to the attack to actively prevent this from succeeding.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1: TDIR to Limit Attacker Free Time</p>
<p>The level of risk from cyber-attacks such as ransomware is now so high that it is a question of when not if a cyber-attack on your organization’s business critical cyber infrastructure will succeed.&nbsp; However, while most organizations have invested heavily in cyber prevention, surveys reveal that they are less well prepared to recover from a cyber-attack.</p>
<p>Authorities around the world have recognized these challenges and are imposing stricter requirements on organizations that their populations rely on for a wide range of essential services, which includes a wide and growing number of private companies that should be preparing now to meet their new obligations.</p>
<p>Notably the EU issued the&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/1148/oj">Network and Information Systems (NIS) Directive in 2016</a>&nbsp;and the US saw the introduction of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">Executive Order 14028</a>&nbsp;on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity in 2021. But European authorities are now seeking to go even further with an update to the NIS Directive, known as NIS2, which is expected to go into force by the second half of 2024.</p>
<p>Unlike its predecessor, NIS2 has a much wider scope, going beyond the traditional critical national infrastructure providers to include a range of organizations that are essential for the normal functioning of society, which include both EU and non-EU organizations that will have to ensure their compliance in future.</p>
 Threat Detection and Incident Response 
<p>All these factors taken together have led to a growing market in Threat detection and Incident Response tools and services.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/wp80959/getting-ahead-of-the-cybercriminals-understanding-the-external-threat-landscape">Threat intelligence</a> – the threat actors reuse and repurpose the techniques, tools, and processes (TTPs) that they use. This makes it vital that where these are identified, this information can be securely shared amongst potential victim organizations. This information Information about threats, TTPs, and devices that adversaries employ; the systems and information that they target; and any other threat-related information that provides greater situational awareness.</p>
<p>Organizations should join the cyber threat intelligence networks relevant to their industry and location. They should also make sure that their cyber-security teams or service providers receive and share cyber threat intelligence from trusted suppliers.</p>
<p>Threat Detection – there is <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an80845/architecting-your-soc-to-defend-against-today-s-attack-vectors">a wide range of tools</a> that are intended to help to detect abnormal activity within and around the organizational systems. These include Security Event Information Monitoring (SIEM), Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR), Endpoint Protection Detection &amp; Response (EPDR), Network Detection and Response (NDR), and Extended Detection and Response (XDR).&nbsp; In general, these tools ingest the vast amount of data logged by the various sensors around the IT infrastructure and provide capabilities to filter and analyze this data to detect anomalies.&nbsp; The challenges are the sheer volume of data and avoiding false positive overload.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations should implement or outsource these activities in a way that is integrated with relevant threat intelligence.&nbsp; Look for the application of Machine Learning (ML) / Artificial Intelligence (AI) based approaches to improve the detection of actual threats. Look for integration with attack path analysis and to help to prioritize the actions needed on threats detected.</p>
<p>Attack Surface Management – business applications and the cyber infrastructure upon which they depend will contain vulnerabilities or weaknesses that could be exploited by cyber adversaries.&nbsp; Many of these will already be known and documented as Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) for which there are patches or workarounds to remove them. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc81218/attack-surface-management">Attack Surface Management tools</a> help organizations to find these vulnerabilities and together with attack path analysis tools to prioritize and close them.</p>
<p>Organizations should implement a continuous vulnerability detection and assessment process to remove known vulnerabilities. They should subscribe to and act on feeds providing newly discovered vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Data Resilience – <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/data-resilience-is-key">data is the most important asset of the modern organization</a>, and it needs to be protected against ransomware as well as loss. Cyber adversaries use various techniques to infiltrate an organization’s IT systems and make changes that prevent the organization from accessing their data and using their IT services. Cloud services create challenges and cloud infrastructure is data defined.&nbsp; Organizations can misunderstand the shared responsibility model and believe data protection is the sole responsibility of the cloud provider.&nbsp; In addition, Big Data and massive data lakes held in cloud services create additional data resilience challenges.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80804/cloud-backup-for-ransomware-protection">Backup and Disaster Recovery tools</a> provide important controls that are needed to recover data and restore services following cyber-attacks. Organizations need to implement and regularly these tools as part of their Business Continuity processes.</p>
<p>Incident Response - <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lb80209/responding-to-cyber-incidents">Organizations need a plan for managing incidents</a> and this must be prepared and tested in advance of an incident occurring. When a major incident is suspected there must be a clear process for invoking a major incident response. The key elements of this are having an incident response team who know what their roles are and that can be assembled when needed. A command structure with a clear chain of command and definition of responsibilities. A communications plan to manage communications with all those involved when and incident occurs. Recovery and restoration – the process for removing the vulnerabilities, restoring the affected systems and data, and then safely resuming their normal operation. Notification – the process for meeting your organization’s statutory obligations for notifying regulators and customers about the incident.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/hacked-72-hours-of-a-ciso-nightmare-cre23">Organizations should retest this plan at regular intervals</a>.</p>
 Dynamic Cyber Security 
<p>Cybersecurity spending will never be able to grow as fast as attacks increase. Just trying to defend is not sufficient – organizations must get ahead of the cybercriminals and move beyond current approaches to cybersecurity by understanding the external threat landscape. Cybersecurity needs to keep up with this rapid pace of change by taking their focus beyond the traditional approach of protection, detection, and response, to become proactive.</p>

<p>In writing the <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/01/03/verifiable-credentials-and-mdocs-a-tale-of-two-protocols/">recent blog post</a> on W3C Verifiable Credentials and ISO mdocs, I found a rat’s nest of options and choices that made understanding the landscape ridiculously challenging. When talking about verifiable credentials, you’re actually talking about a collection of format and protocol specifications that sometimes overlap. In order to understand the space, I needed to sort out several points:</p>



 
 What is a digital credential? 



 What is the difference between a format and a protocol? 



 What are the formats and protocols that are most relevant when talking about verifiable credentials? 



 How does someone decide what technology to pursue, and where do they find out more? 
 



<p>Because of the competing use cases, siloed focus, and general market politics, some of the concepts below are more of a continuum than clear distinctions from one area to the next. And that is part of why the space is so confusing. As there is no single<a href="https://dictionary.reverso.net/english-cobuild/arbiter+of+good+taste"> arbiter of good taste</a> when it comes to how the Internet functions, all this confusion only gets sorted out through years of discussion, debate, testing, adoption, and evolution.</p>



 Digital Credentials 



<blockquote>
<p>A digital credential conveys data that is an authentic representation of information held in a registry at the time of issuance.</p>
Andrew Hughes and Dr. Torsten Lodderstedt</blockquote>



<p>To understand everything else in the world of verifiable credentials, first, you need to know what a digital credential is. Andrew Hughes and Dr. Torsten Lodderstedt described it in their <a href="https://pages.scmagazine.com/rs/188-UNZ-660/images/Identiverse%202023%20-%20Verifiable%20Digital%20Credentials%20Comparison%20and%20Analysis%20of%20Emerging%20Issuance%20Protocol%20Standards%20-%206.01.pdf">Identiverse 2023 presentation</a>: “A digital credential conveys data that is an authentic representation of information held in a registry at the time of issuance.” So many important words there! My translation is that a digital credential is a collection of information about a person or thing (in more generic terms, a subject) that has been packaged based on what was in a particular repository at a single point in time. How trustworthy the data is, how secure it is against tampering, all that is actually out of scope for what it is. A digital credential is the keystone to building an ecosystem; it isn’t all that interesting until we figure out how to use it.</p>



 Credential Issuance Formats and Protocols 



<blockquote>
<p>A format is a the structure of the data.</p>



<p>A protocol is how you move that data around.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you have a digital credential in a format, but you haven’t issued it to the entity that needs it, what good is it? This is where issuance formats and protocols start making verifiable credentials usable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking to the W3C’s specifications, issuance and presentation formats are all contained within the W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model, described in more detail later in this post.</p>



<p><a href="https://openid.github.io/OpenID4VCI/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-wg-draft.html">OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance</a> (OpenID4VCI, which is barely shorter than the name of the specification), is an issuance protocol. This issuance format can be used with just about any issuance format. ISO’s mdoc, W3C’s Verifiable Credentials, it’s open to most everything. The purpose of the protocol is to make sure that the credentials are transported in a standardized way. OpenID4VCI is still in draft, so it is something of a moving target for anyone not deeply embedded in the space already.</p>



<p>But OpenID4VCI isn’t the only issuance protocol under development. The&nbsp; ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 17 committee is working on <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/86783.html">23220-3</a> – Cards and security devices for personal identification – Building blocks for identity management via mobile devices – Part 3: Protocols and services for issuing phase. My expectation is that this work will align more closely with the mdoc/mDL work and its more restricted underlying assumptions, but I am not closely tied to the ISO efforts.</p>



<p>If you want to truly dig into the rabbit hole of comparing credential formats, the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X93ptJcmfX1NZEo5E7ElnqJ-knDS4Dj6JOYSJ_2PsUw/edit#gid=1084392809">Credential Format Matrix</a> is the place to start.</p>



 Credential Presentation Formats and Protocols 



<p>Now we have the concept of a digital credential, it’s been issued, and we want to use it. That means putting it in a machine-readable format to present to something else and defining the protocols to use to get it there. There are a variety of requirements and constraints that influence what that format needs to be for any given use case.&nbsp;</p>



 W3C Verifiable Credential Data Model 



<p>The W3C wants to create credential issuance and presentation formats for the web. The use cases this model supports are intended to allow for All The Things. From uber-secure data like government-issued credentials to meh-secure data like movie tickets, the W3C Verifiable Credential specification “provides a standard way to express <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#dfn-credential">credentials</a> on the Web in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy respecting, and machine-verifiable.” They came out with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">official version</a> of their data model in 2022. However, specifications of this level of complexity rarely survive contact with reality. And so, people within the W3C are working on a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/">new version</a> that will include breaking changes from the first version.</p>



<p>My “ahHA” moment when researching this came from a conversation with <a href="https://self-issued.info/">Mike Jones</a> when I asked if the W3C Verifiable Credential Data Model was a credential presentation format or credential issuance format. He said, “The issuance format is called a Verifiable Credential.&nbsp; The presentation format is called a Verifiable Presentation.”</p>



<p>The format for a W3C Verifiable Presentation credential consists of three major parts: the metadata about the credential (e.g., who issued it, when it was issued, etc.), the claims that make up the credential (the details of the entity being described), and one or more proofs (see ‘digital signatures’ below).</p>



 Selective Disclosure JSON Web Token-based Verifiable Credentials (SD-JWT VC) 



<p>According to the IETF Internet-Draft abstract, the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc/">SD-JWT VC draft specification</a> “describes data formats as well as validation and processing rules to express Verifiable Credentials with JSON payloads based on the Selective Disclosure for JWTs (SD-JWT) format.”</p>



<p>A few things make SD-JWT VC’s format different from the W3C’s Verifiable Credential format. First and foremost is its <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc-01.html#section-1.2-6">explicit mention</a> that it does not use the W3C’s data format in v1, v1.1, or the draft v2. While both are general-purpose credential formats, the W3C requires the use of JSON-LD (described below in the section on data serialization). The SD-JWT VCs, on the other hand, focus on regular JSON payloads and the SD-JWT format. Some people find the restriction of JSON-LD too much to bear, which makes the SD-JWT VC format a more appropriate option for them.</p>



 ISO mdoc 



<p>As <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@aniltj/111692855215449887">Anil John</a> noted in a Mastodon thread, “The starting point for the W3C VC work and the ISO mDL work were radically different; the mDL work was directly focused on in-person use cases while the W3C work was focused on remote/online use cases. Both are trying to address the other at present, but the starting point has influenced the design choices that are inherent in both standards.” mdoc uses the Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL), a language that can be used either the CBOR or JSON data serialization formats. mdoc is standardized in ISO/IEC’s 18013-5, a specification on the in-person presentation of mobile driving licenses (mDL). There is a very readable description of mdocs and mDLs in ENISA’s <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/digital-identity-standards/@@download/fullReport">Digital Identity Standards</a> write-up from July 2023.</p>



<p>While this format can be used for other digital credentials, its standardization in the mDL specification results in people (like me) conflating mdoc and mDL regularly. It’s hard to pinpoint <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/download/attachments/17167105/20211005_ISO_IEC_18013_5_INTRO_W3C_CCG.pdf?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1633559852634&amp;api=v2">when standardization started</a> for mdoc; probably the best one to point to is 2014, when ISO/IEC kicked off the task force, resulting in ISO publishing 18013-5 in 2021. There is still plenty of work to do, particularly around how you’d take this credential presentation format and use it in a remote (rather than in-person) setting. That’s being covered in ISO/IEC 18013-7, still a work in progress.</p>



 Data Serialization Formats 



<p>You have a digital credential. You understand the choices you must make to decide what format it needs to be in. Now, you need the best way to transmit it to the thing that will consume it. That’s where data serialization formats come in. In the digital credential space, there are a handful that most people talk about.</p>



<p>If we’re talking more about tiny devices and digital credentials about things, then using something that focuses on keeping the format really, really efficient is critical. That’s something that the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8152/">Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)</a> exists for. If that level of efficiency isn’t necessary and more features are required, then <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7165/">JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)</a> is probably better. Whether you find <a href="https://json.nlohmann.me/features/binary_formats/cbor/">one better than the other</a>, from an outside but still geeky perspective, is like arguing between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war">emacs and vi</a>. If you’d like something more structured and optimized for an environment where the data pieces are related to each other (for example, all parts of a single schema), then <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/">JSON for Linked Data (JSON-LD)</a> is a great choice. Complicated, or so I’m told, but great.</p>



<p>But wait, there’s more! Continuing with the JSON theme, work is underway within the IETF that focuses on the selective disclosure (rather than all-or-nothing disclosure) of data in a JSON structure. That’s the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/">Selective Disclosure for JSON Web Tokens </a>(SD-JWT) draft. If you’re more interested in work being developed within the European Union, the European Commission’s European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) project’s <a href="https://code.europa.eu/ebsi/ecosystem/-/blob/3f2d4283e5756c2cb0fe51119e00e496755dd0d9/drafts/sd-jws.md">EBSI Improvement Proposal (EBIP) on selective disclosure</a> might be a fit, even though it refers back to SD-JWT.</p>



<p>As individuals focus on their core use cases and the best formats to support them, they will drift apart in terms of the functionality supported and the terminology used. That, in turn, creates complications for people and organizations that need to support more than one use case that brings in more than one credential presentation format. Every additional format involves support overhead to maintain it. Wouldn’t it be better if we just … picked one?</p>



 Digital Signatures + Credentials 



<p>Now, let’s consider the security of all this. Looking at the fundamentals of security, confidentiality, integrity, and availability, what is the best way to secure the presentation and transmission of a digital credential? That’s where digital signatures come in. TechTarget has an excellent article explaining digital signatures. The tl;dr of it is that digital signatures are a way to cryptographically secure one or more pieces of data such that someone (or something) can look at it later and say, “Yep, that was signed and sent by who I expected and hasn’t been changed since it was sent.”</p>



<p>That’s important information, but now there are choices to make. What exactly should be signed when it comes to digital credentials? Do you include the signature in what you’re presenting so it’s a core part of the credential, or do you put a wrapper around it like an envelope? Or both? The answer to that is, as with so many things, it depends. Do you expect all the devices to be able to handle this kind of cryptography on the fly, possibly without access to the Internet? Are the devices powerful enough to handle all the math?</p>



<p>Taking this down a slightly different dependency path, depending on what data serialization format you’re using, you’ll have another set of specifications to learn about that tells you how to sign, encrypt, and decrypt the different possible formats.</p>



<p>The IETF created the JSON-based building blocks of JSON Web Token (JWT), JSON Web Signature (JWS), JSON Web Encryption (JWE), JSON Web Key (JWK), and JSON Web Algorithms (JWA). <a href="https://www.loginradius.com/blog/engineering/guest-post/what-are-jwt-jws-jwe-jwk-jwa/">LoginRadius</a> has a great article describing each of these and, at a high level, how they fit together.</p>



<p>Similarly, the IETF is working on similar building blocks based on CBOR, including the CBOR Web Token (CWT) rather than JSON. For those organizations more committed to a CBOR-based model, the COSE working group is where to learn more.</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>So much of this work is either still in draft or very early deployment. That means it is all subject to change. The descriptions of the technologies above may be lacking in several ways. My hope is that this post will help you understand where the debates are happening and the work is still in progress. If you think any of these efforts are going in the wrong direction, please engage in the conversation rather than creating Yet Another specification effort. The fragmentation in the space is not helping move this work forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is probably the least SEO-friendly post I’ve written in ages! Thanks for getting through it, and I hope it was as helpful to you as it is to me in understanding how all these parts are supposed to fit together. I encourage those more deeply involved in specification writing than I am to offer their feedback, either agreement or correction, in the post comments! It will help me learn and possibly help others as well.</p>



 But Wait, There’s More! 



<p><a href="https://mas.to/@aniltj@infosec.exchange/111760759756293917">Feedback from Anil John</a>:</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>It’s the start of another year and as I’m preparing for our annual sales kick off event it’s a great time to reflect on 2023 and look forward to where we are going in 2024.</p>
<p>Globally, I think it’s safe to say that 2023 was not the year that was hoped for, knock on effects from the war in Ukraine have seen inflation and interest rates rise. Beyond that we’ve seen large reductions in force across the IT sector as organisations correct their hypergrowth bets. Given all that as the backdrop we’ve had a great year in 2023, our growth continues on the same trajectory currently sitting at &gt;6x in 5 years, that certainly helps to keep our shareholders happy. &nbsp;Our profits continue to rise allowing us to power more growth in 2024.</p>
 The Organisation Identity Landscape 
<p>We’ve seen some disruption in the organisation identity landscape this year with the exit of GMEI as an accredited Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) Issuer. This has settled down reasonably quickly and we’ve been quick to assist our customers in the consolidation of their LEI portfolios, simplifying their management and providing a more cost effective solution.</p>
<p>We have also maintained our position as number 1 in LEI Issuance and in December ‘23 we issued 28% of all new LEIs. This is a great testament to the team we have and the ‘platform’ they have created, which allows us to give best value to our LEI partners and customers.</p>
 Combining Organisation Identity &amp; Individual Identity 
<p>While we continue our mission to champion organisation identity as described by our shared vision for the future of digital identity:</p>
<blockquote><p>Combining highly assured organisation identity with strongly authenticated individual identity to show who you are, who you represent and the rights you have when representing them.</p></blockquote>
<p>As I explored in my last blog, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/general/the-value-of-identity-context/" title="The Value of Identity Context">The Value of Identity Context</a>, identity is contextual and it is critical to understand that context in a dynamic, fine-grained manner to ensure security, privacy accountability. It was great to see Gartner starting to embrace organisation identity as a discrete identity class at the 2023 IAM summit in London. We will continue discussing this important topic at the upcoming Gartner 2024 IAM summit, where we will be joined on stage by the Global LEI Foundation (GLEIF).</p>
<p>Our development team launched many new features into the IAM platform, both the on-premise and cloud deployments, throughout 2023. As a result we have seen a number of great successes and the growth of our existing customers. It’s a privilege to be working with them as they transition from national to international players in their respective areas. The continuing benefit and the globalisation assistance that is afforded by digital identity is clear to see.</p>
 The growing importance of Verifiable Credentials 
<p>2023 has seen an increasing awareness of the need to verify identity statements and correspondingly the increasing maturity of verifiable credentials is providing a framework to that end. We’ve seen this in our involvement in both EU Digital Identity (EUDI) and GLEIF verifiable LEI projects. vLEI especially, although early stage, is showing great potential with some significant interest from large regulators. We are seeing wider recognition of the underlying technology layer, a maturing of that layer and an increasing eco-system of supporting tooling and technology. I’d like to think we have played our part in this as we progress towards becoming a Qualified vLEI Issuer in 2024. The requirement on legal entities of having and being able to present a verifiable organisation identity will be a growing requirement by business and regulators.</p>
 Looking forward 
<p>Like everyone else, we are hopeful that the macro-economic situation will improve during 2024, we’ll know that when we see the interest rates start to drop, fingers crossed for H2-24. In the meantime, we will charge on regardless, growing our LEI footprint, becoming a qualified vLEI Issuer delivering the next evolution required to progress towards a universal implementation of our vision for the future of digital identity.</p>
<p>As we all look to increase security, reduce fraud, and simplify business interactions, having the correct rights for the context you are in, driven by the organisation you are representing will become a fundamental requirement.</p>

  The FATF Travel Rule has been active in the US since&nbsp;2013.  The minimum threshold at which the Crypto Travel Rule comes into force in the US is&nbsp;$3000.  To comply with the FATF Travel Rule, US VASPs must verify and share customer identities, ensuring compliance with AML and CFT standards.  <p>About <a href="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/crypto-adoption-index-statistics/">33.7 million Americans</a> own cryptocurrencies in the US, whereas the crypto ownership rate in the country is 13%. Another <a href="https://www.security.org/digital-security/cryptocurrency-annual-consumer-report/">study</a> reveals that 40% of American adults now own crypto, up from 30% in&nbsp;2023.</p><p>Even more interesting is the fact that about 63% of current crypto owners want to obtain more crypto, with 21% of non-owners saying the first Bitcoin ETF, which was finally approved in the US on Jan 10, 2024, makes them more likely to invest in cryptocurrency.</p><p>In light of the growing crypto adoption in the country, it is imperative to understand the regulatory aspect, especially the Crypto Travel Rule US. So, let’s get&nbsp;started!</p> Background of the Crypto Regulations &amp; the FATF Travel Rule in the&nbsp;US <p>In the US, there is no formal regulation surrounding crypto as of yet, but they are the focus of both the state and federal governments.</p><p>The Treasury Department treats Bitcoin as a currency while the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) generally treats crypto assets as securities, and the CFTC refers to Bitcoin as a commodity. For federal income tax purposes, crypto is classified as property.</p><p>When it comes to crypto exchanges, they must adhere to the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and have to register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), and comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and terrorist financing (CFT) policies.</p><p>Then, there is the <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule">Crypto Travel Rule</a>, which was introduced in June 2019 by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global financial watchdog. The FATF brought cryptocurrencies under the scope of Recommendations 10 to 21 and, most importantly, Recommendation 16 — the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>It’s not as if the Travel Rule itself was conceptualized in 2019, as it has been in existence for many decades as part of the US Bank Secrecy Act to strengthen financial rules and establish communications between traditional financial institutions and law enforcement across borders. In 2012, the FATF included it as one of its Recommendations, and soon, the rest of the world also adopted the FinCEN Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p> Key Features of the Travel Rule in the&nbsp;US <p>Initially, the FinCEN Travel Rule only applied to banks and required financial institutions to share information about their customers and report any suspicious activities. Then, in June 2019, it was also applied to the crypto industry to prevent illicit activities and ensure compliance with AML policies.</p><p>While the FATF doesn’t clearly explain just how virtual asset service providers (VASPs) should comply with the Travel Rule, the agency does provide general requirements.</p><p>Under the Crypto Travel Rule US, VASPs, including crypto exchanges, OTC traders, hosted wallets, crypto custodial solutions, banks, and other financial bodies, are required to share the identities of their users who are involved in virtual asset transfers exceeding a certain threshold. VASPs must obtain and verify customer identification as well as share it with one&nbsp;another.</p><p>A VASP is defined as a legal person who transfers, exchanges, or stores virtual assets or participates in or provides financial services related to virtual&nbsp;assets.</p><p>The user information that a VASP has to share while processing crypto transactions depends on the transaction value. The Fincen Travel Rule requirements for a value below the $3,000 threshold include:</p>  The name of the sender, i.e., originator, and the recipient, i.e., beneficiary  Both the sender and recipient’s virtual asset wallet address or a unique transaction reference number  <p>If the value of virtual asset transfer exceeds $3,000, VASPs must&nbsp;collect:</p>  Originator’s name, date and place of birth, wallet address, physical address, national identity number, or customer identification number  Beneficiary’s name and wallet&nbsp;address  <p>VASPs must also carry out a counterparty VASP check to confirm that they are dealing with a registered/licensed VASP and that they have sufficient AML/CFT supervision. Moreover, VASPs also have to constantly monitor transactions in order to report any suspicious activity as part of a risk-based approach to AML and&nbsp;CTF.</p><p>VASPs must be licensed and registered in their jurisdiction. Additionally, they are required to screen customer wallets and to share any blacklists with other VASPs and relevant&nbsp;parties.</p> Impact on Cryptocurrency Exchanges and&nbsp;Wallets <p>Through the Crypto Travel Rule, VASPs prevent malicious individuals and entities from using cryptocurrencies for their elaborate money laundering and terrorist financing plans.</p><p>This is achieved by requiring cryptocurrency businesses to collect and share customer information without exposing it to cybersecurity attackers while navigating its varied implementation from country to country. VASPs must also perform due diligence on beneficiary VASPs, maintain records, and report to relevant authorities.</p><p>However, the major challenge with the Crypto Travel Rule is that FATF only provides recommendations, which means it’s up to the member countries to decide whether to implement the rules and how, resulting in varying regulations.</p><p>For example, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/comprehensive-guide-to-crypto-regulations-and-fatf-travel-rule-in-singapore">the United States</a> and Canada have been among the relatively early adopters of the Crypto Travel Rule, while <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-united-kingdom">the United Kingdom</a> only recently put the rule into&nbsp;effect.</p><p>Not only has the enforcement of the Crypto Travel Rule been at varying rates in different jurisdictions, but it is also interpreted differently and requires different information. Also, the threshold for affected transactions is different, with the FATF recommending $1,000, lower than $3,000 in the&nbsp;US.</p> Country <p>Implementation Year — Transaction Threshold</p> United States <p>2013 — $3,000</p> United Kingdom <p>2023 — No minimum threshold. More information is required for transactions over&nbsp;£1,000.</p> Singapore <p>2020 — No minimum threshold. More information is required for transactions over SGD&nbsp;1,500.</p> Japan <p>2023 — ¥100,000</p><p>To address these challenges, it’s crucial for VASPs to adopt a flexible and comprehensive approach, such as a fully automated Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Travel Rule solution like <a href="https://www.shyft.network/veriscope">Veriscope</a>. This solution can adapt to the diverse regulatory requirements of different jurisdictions while ensuring compliance. Veriscope can provide a unified platform that simplifies the process of collecting, verifying, and sharing customer information securely across&nbsp;borders.</p><p>By implementing such technology, VASPs can effectively navigate the complex landscape of international regulations like the FATF Travel Rule, maintain high standards of customer privacy and data security, and ensure compliance with the varying thresholds and requirements set by different countries.</p> Global Context and Comparisons <p>As crypto adoption continues to grow globally, countries around the world have been ramping up their efforts to regulate the&nbsp;sector.</p><p>In 2023, over 40 countries engaged in myriad initiatives to develop crypto-focused regulations and legislation — targeting licensing and listing guidance, stablecoin regulation, Travel Rule compliance, and crypto framework development.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/new-ventures/cryptocurrency-assets/pwc-global-crypto-regulation-report-2023.pdf">a PwC report</a>, the vast majority of jurisdictions are discussing the FATF’s Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>Besides the Travel Rule, regulators are taking a range of approaches to regulate crypto with varying degrees of strictness. Some common approaches adopted include licensing and registration requirements, AML/CTF regulations, consumer protection measures, and determining the appropriate tax treatment.</p><p>In 2023, the US enforced most penalties and took strong legal action against major crypto players, including Binance and Coinbase. This is despite the fact that the country still lacks a comprehensive regulatory framework and has taken the ‘regulation by enforcement’ approach. However, a lot of legislative progress is being made on crypto laws, though there remains a lack of guidance from US regulators.</p><p>This has resulted in a fragmented regulatory landscape in the US, where the SEC regards crypto as securities while the CFTC regulates crypto derivatives, and FinCEN sets the <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">AML</a> and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/what-is-kyc-in-crypto-and-why-do-crypto-exchanges-require-it">KYC</a> requirements for crypto businesses.</p><p>The European Union is all set to apply its unified regulatory framework, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/mica-paving-the-way-from-liability-to-transparency">Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA)</a>, to ensure financial stability, market integrity, and investor protection. The law came into force in June 2023 and is expected to apply by 2024-end. Meanwhile, the UK plans to bring a range of crypto activities within existing laws governing financial services&nbsp;firms.</p><p>While China has taken a restrictive stance towards crypto, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/japan-to-enforce-crypto-travel-rule-from-june-1st">Japan</a> recognizes them as legal assets, and India is considering a comprehensive crypto regulation framework.</p><p>Meanwhile, the likes of Singapore, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-uae">the UAE</a>, and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-hong-kong">Hong Kong</a> are developing robust regulatory frameworks, demonstrating a global shift towards the regulation of digital assets. This trend is exemplified by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission, which has launched a registration regime for digital asset businesses. Similarly, in the Middle East, Dubai has taken a proactive step by launching VARA, or the Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority, to offer specific zones and guidelines for crypto&nbsp;trading.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>The regulatory crypto landscape is constantly evolving, with governments around the world trying to strike a balance between taking advantage of the nascent technology &amp; encouraging innovation and protecting consumers &amp; financial stability. Here, the Crypto Travel Rule aims to play a crucial role in preventing crypto’s usage in money laundering and terrorist financing. However, complying with the Travel Rule requires guidance, a comprehensive solution like Veriscope, and collaboration with other entities and global regulators.</p><p>As the rapidly growing crypto ecosystem continues to mature, we will be seeing regulatory developments and more clarity that will shape the future of this industry.</p> Frequently Asked Questions  Q1: What is the minimum transaction threshold for the application of the Crypto Travel Rule in the&nbsp;US? <p>In the United States, the Crypto Travel Rule comes into effect for virtual asset transfers exceeding $3,000.</p> Q2: How must US VASPs comply with the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule? <p>The US-based VASPs must comply with the FATF Travel Rule by verifying and sharing customer identities to meet anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-financing of terrorism (CFT) standards.</p> Q3: Does the Crypto Travel Rule apply to all types of cryptocurrencies and transactions in the&nbsp;US? <p>The Crypto Travel Rule applies to all cryptocurrencies and is triggered for transactions over the specified threshold of $3,000, regardless of the type of cryptocurrency involved.</p> Q4: What are the implications of the FATF Travel Rule for individual cryptocurrency users in the&nbsp;US? <p>While the Travel Rule directly impacts VASPs, individual users may experience stricter identity verification processes and data sharing when transacting amounts over $3,000 through regulated platforms.</p><p>___________________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

 The market for <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/">mobility</a>, and micromobility in particular, saw big changes in 2023. François Hoehlinger, former CEO of Troopy and co-founder of TOLV, talks to us about the obstacles facing the micromobility sector, and explains how to enter an industry facing many challenges. 



 What new mobility trends did you see emerge in 2023? 



<p>In 2023, we saw some strong counter-trends in mobility, starting with the micromobility market, which suffered from the market downturn and the drying-up of financing.</p>



<p>Inflation has clashed with micromobility’s recent business model, but there are still some positives: last-mile delivery and cargo bikes. Trends are turning toward green mobility, and battery repair services have also made their mark on the market.</p>



<p>On the software side, companies are increasingly innovating to optimize existing and future mobility business models. In particular, we have seen fund-raising for solutions to optimize journey times and carbon reporting.</p>



<p>We can also mention the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/age-verification-electric-scooters/">regulations governing electric scooters</a>, which have <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/micromobility-and-the-future-of-transportation/">become stricter in Paris and have led to the extinction of many players</a>. Cities that have kept fleets of electric scooters have tended to reduce the size of these fleets to optimize their use, and other cities like Paris have cut off these types of services altogether, which is not necessarily the solution to adopt. If we want to make it work for everyone, we sometimes need to give ourselves the means to do so, notably by putting in place the right infrastructure and educating users. Unfortunately, we’re not there yet.</p>



<p>It took public transport 40 to 50 years to carve out a solid place for itself in the mobility landscape. Emerging services in the micromobility market, based on ultra-fast models, will also take some time to find their rightful place.</p>



 What can we expect in 2024? Where is mobility headed? 



<p>For some years now, mobility has not been at the forefront of investors’ minds, as it’s a complicated model to finance, and not always profitable. We’re also seeing a contraction in the market, with fewer startups being financed than in the pre-COVID era. 2024 will be the year of consolidation, as demonstrated by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/10/micromobility-startups-tier-and-dott-plan-to-merge-to-find-a-path-to-profitability/">TIER’s partnership with Dott in early January</a>.</p>



<p>On the investor side, more flexibility is needed. Mobility business models take time. Look at Uber, which took a long time to stabilize and is now a key player in the market. It’s essential to give mobility players more time to make their way toward the “network effect” and profitability.</p>



<blockquote><p>Today, governments need to agree on a common policy to enable regions and cities to roll out mobility solutions for their citizens, and mobility players to continue to exist. And this is undoubtedly what will take shape in 2024.</p>François Hoehlinger, co-founder of TOLV</blockquote>



<p>Would you like to know more about the future of mobility? Discover the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mobility-travel-reflections-2023/">perspectives that will guide mobility in 2024</a>.</p>



 Is there a particular micromobility service (e.g. electric bikes) that is most popular with users? 



<p>The e-scooter is a relatively attractive means of travel for users. Even if, from an ecological point of view, you’ll never do better than walking or cycling, in some big cities it’s simply not possible, or it would take too much time. The scooter is a good way to get around quickly, without too much effort, and at an affordable price.</p>



<p>As for the motorized scooter, it’s the best modal alternative to the car: not only can you cover long distances, but in cities like Paris, it’s much easier to get around than a car, especially during rush hour.</p>



<p>In Paris, the panorama of different means of transportation is vast, and to know what works best with users, we’ll have to wait for a little more insight, in order to better understand modes of transport and the actual modal shift away from individual car use.</p>



 Is collaboration between cities and micromobility operators growing as Mobility as a Service (MaaS) and multimodal travel becomes more popular? What impact is this having on the industry? 



<p>Micromobility players have built their businesses around their ability to get along with municipalities. Some cities, such as Munich and Stockholm, are pioneers in micromobility, while others find it more difficult to establish efficient collaboration with public authorities.</p>



<p>To overcome these inequalities between cities, we should now be able to offer them a catalog of solutions tailored to their <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fueling-demand-convenient-mobility/">specific mobility needs</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mobility-as-service-digital-identity-partnership/">Mobility as a Service (MaaS)</a>, which enables users to plan, book and pay for an intermodal journey on a single digital platform, will bridge these inequalities or, conversely, sometimes complicate them by adding an additional technical layer to existing systems.</p>



<p>MaaS is a formidable tool, provided it is properly implemented in existing IT systems, but it is costly and complex to set up.</p>



 In France, regulations have become stricter, particularly for the rental of electric scooters. Do you think this will help improve safety on the roads? Or, on the contrary, will it slow the sector’s growth by discouraging users and players? 



<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/09/01/1197329094/paris-rental-electric-scooter-ban-has-taken-effect">The situation in Paris has not been favorable to electric scooter services</a>. We could have tried setting up test zones to make their use safer and encourage people to work with one another. We are now aware that this sets a precedent that will necessarily be negative for European cities.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/safety-shared-mobility-driver-license-verification/">safety issue</a> raised by the use of scooters is an important point; but what is the modal shift to buses or cars following the withdrawal of electric scooters? The aim of micromobility is to help open up cities; removing one of these new means of travel undoubtedly has an impact on citizens’ mobility.</p>



<blockquote><p>If these micromobility systems exist and are to continue to exist, it is imperative that they be integrated into a single, comprehensive approach.</p>François Hoehlinger, co-founder of TOLV</blockquote>



<p>A number of measures can be taken to provide a better framework for micromobility services.</p>



<p>With Troopy, scooter rental was only available to people over 21 years of age, who had to have a driver’s license and to pass certain additional tests, particularly relating to the vehicle’s motorization. Users who speeded repeatedly were excluded from the service.</p>



<p>Strict rules of use and prevention messages are essential. Let’s not forget that everyone is concerned by the use of the road and urban space, and so everyone needs to be educated, not just users of micromobility services.</p>



 In your opinion, is France a pioneer in micromobility compared to other countries? 



<p>France is a pioneer in the transport sector. Above all, we’re pioneers in terms of transport authorities such as Transdev and RATP.</p>



<p>The emergence of micromobility services was first seen in Northern European countries such as Norway, Sweden and Germany.</p>



<p>Take Stockholm, for example: the city’s bicycle lanes are protected and pedestrianized, and their bike-sharing system is one of the oldest in Europe. They also offer a Voi electric scooter service, a major player in the world of micromobility. Public space is very well shared, and this is what makes the difference between Stockholm and the way we operate in France today, where the approach is much more individualistic.</p>



<p>France has yet to find its own operating model for micromobility. This will require collaboration between transport authorities and mobility players. We need to make the most of our know-how, which has proved its worth to date, in the service of tomorrow’s mobility.</p>



 What are the major challenges facing micromobility players today? Particularly in terms of inclusivity and equality. 



<p>Today, mobility players are fighting to make inclusivity one of the spearheads of mobility in general. The various mobility services were created precisely to open up the countryside and the outskirts of cities.</p>



<p>The aim of micromobility is to enable citizens to move around freely, between metro lines for example, at a relatively accessible cost.</p>



<p>To convince the most reluctant on the topic, micromobility players will be relying on various aspects such as the safety of the vehicles made available, their availability at any time of the day or night and the speed of these means of transport.</p>



 What kind of solutions are micromobility players looking for to ease the use of their services? 



<p>A <a href="https://www.idnow.io/identity-verification/">KYC solution</a> like the one proposed by IDnow is extremely important in my opinion: it saves time and increases efficiency on the service side. Millions of micromobility journeys are recorded every year, which corresponds to thousands of accounts created that need to be verified to ensure the security of the services.</p>



<blockquote><p>Eventually, the creation of unique identifiers to access different mobility services in the same city, as with MaaS, will be the order of the day.</p>François Hoehlinger, co-founder of TOLV</blockquote>



 According to you and your market expertise, what makes the difference between a good KYC tool and a bad one? 



<p>Having compared several KYC solutions myself, the differentiating factors are time savings and the ability to deliver a high-performance tool. A good KYC tool should prevent fraud attempts and automate the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/">identity verification process</a> when an account is created on a platform.</p>



 How can someone enter into the mobility market? 



<p>As a company director, you can negotiate with the municipalities and work with the regulators present on the market to make your way, but it doesn’t work every time.</p>



<p>To offer a better structure to all European players, I have created, with the help of five expert co-founders, a free European network called “Intermobility” bringing together over 800 decision-makers in mobility, transport, logistics and energy.</p>



<p>But we’re not stopping there: in February 2024, we’re launching a French “think tank” specialized in these sectors. This think tank will bring together all the decision-makers in the ecosystem, from politicians to financiers, with the aim of restoring the image of the world of transport and making France an economic engine for mobility.</p>



<p>The aim is to bring together the different points of view and visions of mobility players. In the future, this will enable us to make appropriate proposals to move the mobility market toward greater social inclusion, as well as greater ecological and profitable, sustainable business models.</p>

				  It’s only a matter of time before generative AI renders current methods of identity verification for financial transactions useless.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>As the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/increasing_threats_of_deepfake_identities_0.pdf">paper</a>, “Increasing Threat of DeepFake Identities,” published by United States Homeland Security put it:</p>
<p>[People have a] “natural inclination to believe what they see, and as a result deepfakes and synthetic media do not need to be particularly advanced or believable in order to be effective in spreading mis/disinformation.”</p>
<p>This paper was written two years before the long, 2023 reveal of exponential advances in commercially available generative AI technologies. The ability to deepfake reality is now spectacularly believable and the tools to do so are all easily available.</p>
<p>While the problem space for deepfakes in 2021 was the threat of political malfeasance and misrepresentation—how you could make a politician, expert or celebrity say something prejudicial or wrong—now, that space has metastasized to incorporate the daily business of “knowing your customer” —&nbsp;aka KYC.</p>
<p>KYC is critical to trust in digital banking and finance. Selfies and liveness checks using facial biometrics are used to onboard customers remotely for accounts, approvals, and transactions without the customer having to show up in person to be verified.</p>
<p>But, as TechCrunch’s Kyle Wiggers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/08/gen-ai-could-make-kyc-effectively-useless/?guccounter=2">recently noted</a>, an attacker using generative AI “could download a selfie of a person, edit it with generative AI tools and use the manipulated ID image to pass a KYC test.”</p>
<p>While Wiggers points out that it hasn’t happened yet (but to the best of his knowledge—right?), the article details emerging capacities that threaten to disrupt an entire layer of advanced identity and data verification tools based on images, facial biometrics, voice, and video.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://medium.com/@harishhacker3010/bypassing-kyc-using-deepfake-e11f0722c722">a recent post</a> on Medium, security researcher and masters student Harish SG claims to&nbsp; bypassed “multiple liveness detection and deepfake detection APIs used in several applications.”</p>
<p>At best, innovation in AI will create an arms race, with the advantage seesawing between fraud and fraud detection.</p>
<p>If images, liveness, and voice checks can all be faked with easily available tools and the right digital skill set, the impact on business, government, and social trust is potentially vast. Consider how reliant the IRS is on ID.me performing liveness checks on U.S. taxpayers. How long will it be before we see a generative AI, KYC-related scandal that will make global headlines? Given the innovation we’ve seen in 2023, it is reasonable to think in terms of months rather than years.</p>
<p>Decentralized identity, verifiable credentials, and KYC</p>
<p>The capacity to deepfake a liveness check completely disrupts any verification process dependent on a liveness check. One of the weakest targets is remote KYC, which will&nbsp; send customer account creation back to the pre-internet era.</p>
<p>But there is a simple fix: portable, reusable KYC — a simple, unfakeable way to prove you are who you say you are over and over again. Relying on math rather than imagery, this KYC&nbsp; can be easily shared with, and verified by, any organization that needs to know that you are who you say you are. In short, a KYC credential.¹</p>
<p>A trusted, local organization such as a bank would undertake an in-person liveness check (or a full KYC) and then issue a verifiable credential to that person attesting to having verified their identity. This credential is unique to the person and can be thought of as a container for&nbsp; holding any kind of data, including biometric data. The person can’t add to or change the data in the container without breaking the container. The container is linked to the organization that created it, and this link cannot be altered due to the use of cryptographic keys. Anyone with the right software is able to verify the origin and integrity of the container.</p>
<p>When the person needs to do KYC remotely, the organization contacted can verify that the container came from the issuing organization before interacting, and they can verify the information hasn’t been altered.</p>
<p>Of course, a local bank or financial institution can also do a full KYC on their customers and issue “full” KYC credentials with all the relevant data needed for interaction with other businesses or organizations. In addition to mitigating fraud, this also saves institutions and organizations from having to do complex KYC over and over again.</p>
<p>In both cases, device binding and biometric checks bind the credential to the person’s mobile device and wallet software, preventing misuse by others, and the verifiable credential could then be used, anywhere, and in conjunction with further liveness checks to facilitate remote KYC.</p>
<p>The result is seamless identity verification and immediately actionable data. A customer can simply and quickly prove that they are who they are and wherever they are. And they get privacy-preserving features and the capacity to provide the continuous verification needed by zero trust approaches to security².</p>
<p>The inevitable threat of generative AI can only be met by adding verifiable credentials. But the good news is that verifiable credential technology is easy and quick to add to existing systems. Indicio provides a complete, award-winning solution — Indicio Proven® — including a <a href="https://indicio.tech/know-your-customer/">KYC credential</a>.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials will also be essential to releasing the full value from using AI agents to simplify and manage interactions and transactions involving analysis of personal data and integrated payments. For more on this, see our position paper, <a href="https://indicio.tech/library/ai-position-paper/">A Trusted Copilot</a>, on using decentralized identity to manage an AI virtual assistant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 1) Verifiable credentials are a form of decentralized identity. They enable you to verify the source of any data (using decentralized identifiers) and whether it has been tampered with (digital signatures) without having to check in with the source of the data or check in with a third-party identity provider. 
 2) For a more expansive explanation, see our <a href="https://indicio.tech/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/A-beginners-guide-to-decentralized-identity-July-25-2023.pdf">Beginner’s Guide to Decentralized Identity</a>.

Generated by Microsoft Bing<p>The Tenth of January saw a landmark for the crypto industry, with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving 11 US-listed exchange-traded funds (ETF) that track Bitcoin. While the SEC appears to have been rather grudging about this, primly pointing out that they remained skeptical about cryptocurrencies, it nonetheless represents a major step forward for crypto and is a sign of a maturing ecosystem, which Mattereum can only&nbsp;welcome.</p><p>So, why is this so important? Well, for a start, it is the first time in ages that the SEC has done anything remotely positive towards crypto, but more than that, it represents a further step into the financial mainstream for cryptocurrency. <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a> is based on the belief that there is more to the blockchain than an opportunity for grift, hype, bubbles and get-rich-quick scams; that the underlying infrastructure is sound and has huge potential for being the basis for international trade in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>The ETF ruling is important because what an ETF does is allow people to invest in assets or groups of assets without having to directly purchase the assets themselves. For Bitcoin, what this means is that instead of needing to have your own digital wallet, or an account on a crypto trading platform you can invest in an ETF based on Bitcoin, run by an investment fund. This immediately widens the market to people who like the potential returns of Bitcoin investment, but who have been put off so far by either the technical requirements of buying Bitcoin themselves, or the appalling reputation for instability and outright fraud that crypto exchanges have earned. ETFs mean that people can now invest in crypto through established fund managers like Fidelity and BlackRock, plus funds can easily trade ETFs on stock exchanges, which has not been possible for crypto&nbsp;before.</p><p>While this is great, investment analysts are voicing concern about crypto ETFs. They believe these could put too much risk and volatility into Americans’ retirement accounts, given that the price of bitcoin is prone to wild fluctuations, often without warning and for reasons that are not immediately clear. Yiannis Giokas, senior director of Moody’s Analytics has been quoted as saying “The notorious price volatility of bitcoin&nbsp;… could expose mainstream investors to a less familiar spectrum of investment risks”. This is a weakness of pure crypto as an investment vehicle, but fortunately there are other options on the&nbsp;horizon.</p><p>It has been clear for some time that the mature use case for the blockchain is for trading real world assets (RWA), not for running a limited currency. Bitcoin chose <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/be-realistic-demand-the-incorruptible-fa15d6401b0e">not to evolve</a> into a system that could run smart contracts, so Ethereum (ETH) was developed to meet that need. On ETH and similar chains it is possible to tokenize and fractionize RWAs and trade them on chain. While Bitcoin ETF are definitely a step forward, they are a relatively small one in the grander scheme of things, it is on chain RWA that have the greatest potential for the future. Starting with high value assets like gold and real estate, tokenization increases liquidity and hugely simplifies what are currently complex and lengthy transactions, which will open the market in such things to far more people than the relatively niche Bitcoin ETF will. RWA have the potential to hugely smooth and accelerate international trade, which will have a far greater impact in the long term. Ultimately, I would suggest, it is investment in RWA and in tokens issued by key RWA players that will have the biggest effect over time. It is good to see Bitcoin ETF bringing crypto into the mainstream, but it will be the RWA that follow that enable the blockchain to revolutionise business going&nbsp;forward.</p><p>Mattereum has worked hard and invested millions in developing unique and innovative lawtech solutions to make that possible. The <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/at-the-turning-point-how-crypto-interacts-with-real-world-assets-b4bf3c4b217c">Perez Cycle</a> maps the development of new technologies, and shows that they go through a period of rapid growth driven by hype and often disreputable actors that creates a bubble, and when this bursts, the technology goes through a period of being seen as radioactively disreputable before any underlying functionality is adopted by mature users and put to work for successful, unflashy, purposes that finally generate real value. We have seen the blockchain go through hype, boom and bust and the ETF approval is one of the first major signs that we are now moving into the next phase, where we see it being taken up by more sober users and taking its place in the financial mainstream. Mattereum sees itself as one of those&nbsp;users.</p><p>To this end, <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a>’s innovations are specifically designed to reinforce the value of RWAs by providing the missing link in the system — a means to legally tie the on-chain token representing the RWA to the physical asset itself, so that ownership can be defended in court in 172 jurisdictions worldwide. With this, almost any asset, physical or virtual, can be traded on chain, with both parties secure in the knowledge that ownership is clear and uncontestable. This is the revolution that is coming, and Bitcoin’s new-found respectability is paving the&nbsp;way.</p><p>The Bitcoin ETH ruling is great — but it is just a taste of what is to come with&nbsp;RWA.</p><p>The Bitcoin ETF takes crypto assets and dresses them in the clothes of tradfi financial assets: shares in a fund, where the fund owns a bunch of bitcoin. The fund shares then trade on an exchange: it’s literally an Exchange Traded&nbsp;Fund.</p><p>But in the reverse direction, Mattereum will take real world assets like gold bars and apartments — tradfi assets if you will — and dresses them in the clothes of defi financial assets: NFTs and ERC20 fractional ownership tokens.</p><p>This two way traffic between the tradfi and defi world can only benefit both worlds. Defi needs the sheer volume of the real world assets. Tradfi desperately needs transparency, openness, efficiency, and above all innovation, to better finance the world’s need for goods and services.</p><p>As defi and tradfi learn how to work together we can build a new system with the best features of&nbsp;both.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-bitcoin-etf-ruling-opens-the-doors-for-the-mainstream-blockchain-667a3d5bd403">THE BITCOIN ETF RULING OPENS THE DOORS FOR THE MAINSTREAM BLOCKCHAIN</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Ah, January! The month of fresh starts, new resolutions, and doubling down on our best behaviors. This is the perfect time for Google Workspace Super Admins to do a check to ensure they’re following <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/tips-for-building-effective-iam-processes-at-your-startup/">best practices when it comes to identity and access management</a>.</p>
<p>Unsure where to start? Here are three things you can do today.</p>
 1. Audit all apps and limit scopes where needed 
<p>OAuth is a widely used protocol for granting access to resources. OAuth also represents one of the largest surface areas for data to be unknowingly leaked is through <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/navigating-the-oauth-maze-in-smb-identity-management/">an unmanaged application through OAuth in Google Workspace</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a user grants an application access to their Google Workspace data through OAuth, they may not be fully aware of the scope of access they are giving to the application, and the application may have access to more data than the user intended. This issue becomes particularly critical when applications with extensive permissions retain this access for prolonged periods.</p>
<p>To mitigate risks like unauthorized access, data exposure, and account takeover, it’s essential for leaders to proactively manage and monitor these OAuth grants. Regular reviews and audits of the grant validity periods are key practices in ensuring these permissions are necessary and relevant, and in maintaining the overall security and integrity of your organization’s data.</p>
<p>One way to do this is by <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/7281227?hl=en#zippy=%2Cgmail-high-risk-oauth-scopes%2Cdrive-high-risk-oauth-scopes">using your Google Workspace console</a> and navigating the following path: Security &gt; Access and Data &gt; API Controls &gt; Manage third party app access &gt; View list. There, you can view apps with access, revoke access if needed, and just get a general view of what’s going on in your app environment. Check out the video below, where I walk you through it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On the other hand, you can also easily track this information with YeshID. Our intuitive dashboards present <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/new-from-yeshid-data-visualization-for-google-workspace-access/">a comprehensive overview of app licenses, showcasing the interconnected web of permissions across different applications</a>. This helps leaders easily identify which apps or services have broad access to sensitive data and understand the potential risks associated with each OAuth grant.</p>
 2. Review your authentication settings 
<p>Reviewing your authentication settings to ensure they align with internal policies is paramount. We recommend you use one of these two approaches:</p>
 The traditional 2FA and strong password approach 
<p>First, enforce strong passwords that contain a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, and are at least 12 characters long. Using a unique password for each account is important because if a hacker gains access to one password, they will not be able to use it to access your other accounts. You can do this through Google Workspace Admin console <a href="https://admin.google.com/ac/security/passwordmanagement?journey=62">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, turn on two-factor authentication (2FA) to add an extra layer of security to your online accounts by requiring a second form of verification in addition to your password (usually a code sent to your phone, a biometric scan, or a physical token). 2FA makes it much harder for someone to gain unauthorized access to your accounts: Even if they have your password, they also need to have access to your second form of authentication in order to log in. You can do this through Google Workspace Admin console <a href="https://admin.google.com/ac/security/2sv?journey=32">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
 The more modern passwordless approach 
<p>A more secure (and easier to use) choice is to adopt the passwordless setting. It has several benefits:</p>
 
 You stop using the vulnerable password 
 You handle the two-factor requirement with a simpler user experience 
 
<p>Turn on <a href="https://admin.google.com/ac/managedsettings/352555445522/passwordless">Google’s passwordless beta</a> or try <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">YeshID’s simple passwordless approach</a>.</p>
 3. Streamline your onboarding/offboarding process&nbsp; 
<p>If you’re still onboarding new users manually in Google Workspace the old way, it might be time to think about updating your process. Fortunately, that doesn’t have to mean putting weeks into procuring a tool or hiring an employee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By augmenting Workspace’s hard-to-navigate console with a user-friendly dashboard and enhanced controls, YeshID <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/stepping-lightly-a-guide-to-avoiding-onboarding-and-offboarding-missteps/">makes streamlining onboarding and offboarding a breeze</a>. Scheduled workflows, flexible controls, and customizable templates help automate onboarding/offboarding and provisioning tasks, ensuring the right users have the right access at the right time.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Schedule onboarding: YeshID allows you to schedule onboarding tasks. An email is automatically sent to the user on their start date, and their account is provisioned immediately to kickstart the application license process. 
 Create templates for departments: Create templates for different departments to automate the assignment of groups and orgs, reducing manual work. 
 Manage application provisioning: Manage the application provisioning process through YeshID’s task management system. Assign administrators for each application, and they’ll receive notifications for when to provision access. 
 Compliance management: YeshID serves as a central source of truth for access management, making it easy to demonstrate compliance when needed. 
 
 It’s your year!

 The Real Politics of the Blockchain <p>One of the arguments for why Octopuses have not managed to make the jump to high technology in the past few million years is that, despite being spookily intelligent, their young are free floating little sea creatures rather than being raised by parents. No way to build culture. EVERY GENERATION STARTS FROM&nbsp;ZERO.</p><blockquote>Humans can’t start from zero — we need to learn from previous generations.</blockquote><p>Today’s younger generations are as adrift on the internet, on the infinite seas of the information environment, as baby octopuses are in the vast depths of the open ocean. The only things which are stable reference points are archaic (religion) or capitalised (product-based identities). Equally&nbsp;abyssal.</p><p>But Humans can’t start from zero — we need to learn from previous generations. Some say cave paintings were used to teach younger people how to hunt! We have been at this a&nbsp;while.</p><a href="https://smarthistory.org/bhimbetka-cave-paintings-2/">https://smarthistory.org/bhimbetka-cave-paintings-2/</a><p>So I’m thinking again about how to handle the political disenfranchisement of young people through the blockchain, building on something <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-blockchain-sleep-of-reason-b28f3bd3f83b">I wrote a while back</a>. The hopes and dreams of a better world where people have individual agency and great collective power are deep-rooted in blockchain culture. Can we deliver that&nbsp;dream?</p><p>I believe we can but it needs some careful cultural thinking about how young people got so screwed over by the economy and socially atomized, and what might be needed to fix it. It’s all about “frontier” and getting away from incumbents to places where it’s genuinely possible to create something.</p><p>Also humans live a really, really long time which means you can have me — a Gen X “90s kid” — tell you what I think about the situation. In contrast Octopuses only live about five years so their elders are pre-school. But in the 1990s we had almost exactly the same obsessions that the current generation has and my hope is that we can help you find a way&nbsp;fowards.</p><p>Does any of this look familiar? Hell we’re even fighting the same companies.</p><p><a href="https://www.trippingly.net/burning-man-musings/burning-man-1996">Burning Man 1996: Helco - Trippingly</a></p><p>Can we deliver the&nbsp;dream?</p><p>I was part of an internet community in the early 1990s. People all over the world. Our symbol? A simple “@“ because nobody else had a cultural identity as an email&nbsp;user.</p><p>Just think about that for a second. You’re driving around in some suburb looking for your friend’s house, that you only know from the internet, and you pass a mailbox with an “@“ symbol printed on a piece of paper and taped to the outside of the mailbox. “Internet People Here”. It’s like seeing the Bitcoin logo on a shop, or the Ethereum logo on a conference.</p><p>You know that in this place you’re part of The&nbsp;Network.</p><p>Go back to the age of rail and there were <a href="https://popularmechanics.com/technology/a25174860/hobo-code/">Hobo Code symbols</a>. The “@“ symbol was our technomad code. “Internet People&nbsp;Here”.</p><p>That’s 30 years ago. It’s as distant from 2023 as the 1960s were for us in the 1990s. It’s an entire world&nbsp;away.</p><p>Fashion used to play the same role. Subcultural branding and tagging and identity all woven together. You’ve seen these guys? London in the 1980s had one of the most extreme fashion subcultures ever seen. That version of punk was expensive in money and opportunity costs. Social&nbsp;proof!</p><p>The people that paid that cost were in it together against the world — out-in&nbsp;group.</p><p>Of course, with those people it&nbsp;was:</p><p>Today, by and large, young people are not responding like this; it is notable that in the 21st century the thriving ferment of street subcultures has largely died out except as nostalgia trends (although, even then, no one has brought back<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/jul/30/big-quiffs-zombies-and-dead-crows-the-wild-world-of-psychobilly"> psychobilly</a> — no one should bring back psychobilly).</p><p>So now everybody’s on the internet. Young people who skipped college are sitting around at home trading crypto in their teens, and then moving to Singapore for tax reasons in their 20s (or whatever).

Now you look like Those Other People. Outside of college campuses etc. the Cottagecore Community doesn’t really meet in reality. This is all online. It’s much the same economic cost as buying into a mid-price NFT project. It’s almost like we’re all trying to anchor in the enormous full emptiness of the internet.</p><p>You can see the same thing in the photography “community” — all the Fuji buyers making “film like” into a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKk3MlP9ypk">thing</a>, while the Nikon buyers are showing off their P1000 shots of birds feeding their babies 4.5km away with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/sM7882GmuRg">superzoom</a> goodness. It’s markets being used as community mediums. Buy this product to find your&nbsp;people.</p><p>Other people anchor through economics. I think that the heavy slant of the blockchain space towards libertarianism, autism, Asperger’s, Nerd Culture, and the general social blunting that comes with working with machines (I could hardly talk when I was a computer graphics engineer) is partly responsible for this. Crypto-socio-economics — binding people together with economically shared incentives through things like NFTs or DAOs is a nerd response to living in an atomized society. — with people for whom aesthetics don’t appeal, economics may do the job of bringing people together.</p><blockquote>Other people anchor through economics</blockquote><p>So I think what’s happening in the NFT space, and to a limited degree in stuff like L2 chains or crappy little L1s, is a similar kind of social anchoring. “You’ve got $20,000 of Dogecoin? Well we’re 100% on the same team. Go Doge!” Because otherwise people just drift away online. There’s no cost to leaving the community so people do, often silently.</p><p>The only way we know how to answer the question of “who are you?” Is socially.</p><p>Family names. “John of Sudbury”. “Joe Baker”. Given names. I travelled all over America in the 1990s on “@“. The story of “who am I?” was tightly coupled to the social technology of the day: email lists. I don’t think nearly enough work has been done on the “economic sociology” of crypto projects, particularly DAOs and NFT communities. Now that I’m seeing this head-on, it all makes so much more sense. A single framework with aesthetic and “<a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/core-words-cottagecore/">-core</a>” cultures, NFTs and DAOs together. This also neatly explains the early adopter communities on Twitter, Instagram and, earlier than that, Flickr (really the first social network for people that made images rather than writing as a way of expressing their identity) — influencers as social leaders: reference point organisers. In ancient times this was one of the functions of soap operas: people who worked in the same office but lived in different communities could gossip about people they both “knew” outside of the workplace, those being the cast of Friends etc — Yes, I know this sounds incredibly dumb. But 30 years ago (!) there were academic publications as people discovered this phenomena!</p><a href="https://www.dhi.ac.uk/san/waysofbeing/data/communication-zangana-baym-1993.pdf">https://www.dhi.ac.uk/san/waysofbeing/data/communication-zangana-baym-1993.pdf</a> Who’s writing the equivalent paper today about&nbsp;NFTs?<p>I don’t think nearly enough work has been done on the “economic sociology” of crypto&nbsp;projects</p><p>So the idea that what we have is <a href="https://www.ica.coop/en/history-co-operative-movement#:~:text=In%201844%20the%20Rochdale%20Pioneers,surplus%20to%20benefit%20the%20community.">economic responses to social atomization</a> is not a new one but I’m seeing it in a new way because I’ve got it from two sides right now: “aesthetic” culture from YouTube etc. and NFT/DAO from&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>This is almost gendered, women and men.&nbsp;Almost.</p><p>As we have transformed our physical and social environment further and further from the environment that we evolved in, it becomes harder and harder for us to find the true happiness which is harmony between our own nature and nature itself. We love dogs and BBQs beside water. No form of happiness is more universal than a few families and friends gathering to grill food on a beach or by a lake. That’s where we evolved. That’s our native environment at its&nbsp;best.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@leashless/friends-dogs-and-faint-wood-smoke-e596fe387427">Food, fire and friends beside&nbsp;water.</a></p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@leashless/friends-dogs-and-faint-wood-smoke-e596fe387427">Friends, dogs, and faint wood smoke</a></p><p>Ape Utopia.</p><p>That’s what people are seeking in these internet cultures, but are they finding&nbsp;it?</p><p>Once, in the ’90s, when the internet was young, we did this with mailing lists and newsgroups, we had little social communities where like-minded people found each other and generated whole new friendship groups that didn’t rely on geography or finding the right pub. There’s even an archived list of all the “<a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/ezines/kr5hou2zh4qtebqk.onion/UXU/UXU-148.TXT">cyberpunk</a>” email lists from the 1990s. Isn’t that amazing? It was all DIY and profoundly uncommercial. but this was basically commodified and destroyed by social media that first co-opted it, then corrupted it by filtering the messages and monetising the interactions, so the groups no longer felt like&nbsp;“home”.</p><blockquote>This was commodified and destroyed by social&nbsp;media</blockquote><p>You can see why an entire generation of innovators latched on to crypto because it seemed like it could, in theory, reinvent that uncommercial sense of online community by owning the commercial aspects collectively, and then offer social solidarity at the “tribal” and potentially even the “municipal” level through larger projects like Ethereum.</p><p>Ethereum Nation.</p><p>But it’s all stretched. We can’t actually live inside of the metaverse. The people who own the same NFTs as you do might be too far away and too alien to babysit your kids. The core biological reality of our lives is only very slightly improved by online community. Life still happens in the real world and this is what’s producing the crazy addictive (often life damaging) effects: it doesn’t matter how much you drink wine if what you need is coffee. The strongest online communities are still only reflections and shadows of “food, fire and friends beside water.” Social media does not give people what they actually need. That’s why we keep scrolling.</p><blockquote>We can’t actually live inside of the metaverse</blockquote><p>People are growing up untethered: fashion doesn’t indicate identity when you can drop $200 at Shein and walk out with an entirely new wardrobe. There’s no social cost to weird hair. There’s no geographic binding after high school really. The idea that what we have is a set of broad pathologies based on the conditions of internet atomization resulting in community inclusion being mediated by products, in other words you have to buy your friends, is fucking brutal. I’ve heard it before, but only understood it for myself now; it is a desperate position for a social monkey to find itself&nbsp;in.</p><blockquote>Community inclusion being mediated by products is fucking&nbsp;brutal</blockquote><p>This is not the utopia you are seeking — it’s “pay to play tribalism”. This is unfortunate. You can see the perfect opportunity for people being exploited: you want to join a tribe and get to know people. You want to make money. The two impulses are joined in the DAO structure: a community you buy into. It’s a little bit like having a cult with elected leadership, or a multi-level marketing scheme which is owned by the members. The social dynamics are very similar to both cults and MLMs. The social dynamics fuse capitalism and society in a new and probably kinda dangerous way.</p><blockquote>It’s “pay to play tribalism”</blockquote><p>Clearly there’s a social binding force — but with that come problems. The combination of social solidarity and commerce is unsafe. We cannot make an atomized population powerful with either shallow social organisation or technology. To save the world — and here I’m thinking climate change — we need the most profound de-atomization imaginable (or maybe geoengineering).</p><p>We’re in a&nbsp;maze.</p><p>We’re building technologies without the end goal in sight. What people want at a shallow advertising-driven level and what people need at a “my life is whole and makes sense to me” level are way different. Instagram does not substitute for a better relationship with your sister. And this is the fundamental challenge of the “real world assets” phase of Ethereum. OK, now we can handle real estate on the blockchain in tokenized form. We really can:<a href="http://mattereum.com/land"> http://mattereum.com/land</a> is a real deal and there’s <a href="https://swarm.com/swarm-partners-with-mattereum-to-securitise-real-world-assets-on-chain/">way more</a>&nbsp;coming.</p><blockquote>Instagram does not substitute for a better relationship with your&nbsp;sister</blockquote><p>But can we solve the social problems too? We’re already seeing the broad outlines of this attempt: Network States are “crypto communities do real estate” with kinda strange Silicon Valley logic&nbsp;applied.</p><p>Once you tease out the projects that are the Silicon Valley equivalent of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_citizen_movement">Sovereign Citizen</a> play (i.e. opting out of existing nation state structures to avoid tax and law, while still physically living in the state) what they are is electronic communities organised around money rather than community: the people grew up atomized: never felt community. We get regular pings from people with ambitions of doing community land projects and building physical settlements with crypto finance as an integral part of the start up plan, often with community governance done using DAOs or other crypto voting&nbsp;methods.</p><p>People are reaching.</p><p>This is really the&nbsp;key.</p><p>If we’re going to ship large-scale community-oriented real estate development projects that actually deliver “food, fire and friends beside water” at scale we’re going to need to figure out the sociological issues which have made modern community so hard. Winding up a Network State that failed is going to be much harder than winding up a company or shuttering a community.</p><p>People think they want tokenized real estate. They need community. They won’t be happy with tokenized real estate unless it delivers community.</p><p>That is part of why there is so much interest in DAOs and Network States. People want to be reconnected to each other. That’s the fundamental human drive at the heart of all of this. Yes, professional real estate clients want faster transactions and so on. Yes, Mattereum can deliver that. But their clients want community. The enormous cultural push towards de-atomizing society and returning to interconnected forms is unstoppable: it is human nature returning to being human after centuries of industrial oppression.</p><p>Post-industrial society is like post-war society: an attempt to return to&nbsp;peace.</p><blockquote>Professional real estate clients want faster transactions but their clients want community</blockquote><p>As we move down the pathway towards tokenized community real estate projects, whether they be Network States or start-up villages or just plain old electronic communes, we’re going to wind up having to try and bring wisdom about community, not just the <a href="http://mattereum.com">Mattereum</a> legals.</p><p>It’s not like I haven’t lived in communities and studied them in detail for more than 30&nbsp;years.</p><p>I do have grounded opinions about how to do this, and I think if we invested in researchers and worked closely with clients we could actually deliver functional community templates. And that is, after all, probably the highest good that <a href="http://mattereum.com">Mattereum</a> can deliver to retail customers: better arrangements for buying their houses and managing shared assets with their neighbours.</p><blockquote>The highest good that Mattereum can deliver: better arrangements for buying houses and managing shared&nbsp;assets</blockquote><p>Professional finance needs precision and efficiency. But homeowners need warm relations. Bad governance and bad finance produce stone cold grinding poverty: Homeowners Associations and sharecropping. If we actually go into this tokenized real estate thing with a clear sense of the end goals in mind it might be a lot easier than we think: nobody’s tried with lawyers. “Good fences make good neighbours”, and a contract is nothing but a fence of written words. The legal structures are all there: there’s no reason for Homeowners Associations to be terrible.</p><p>There’s no reason shared ownership has to be predatory. Societies do not have to be the way they are; we can change&nbsp;them.</p><p>So — what does this all mean? Well, my parents’ generation were part of the post-war economic boom. The economy was buoyant and everyone, whatever their income was, floated up on the tide. Until, basically, the 1980s; Thatcher, Reagan and neo-liberal economics, which, as a matter of policy, was “every person for themselves” — there’s no such thing as society. Those who had money were able to leverage more at the expense of those with less, because money translates to power, allowing them to become obscenely rich while everyone else’s income stagnated. We weren’t going to do better than our parents, the first generation in a century to say&nbsp;that.</p>see also <a href="https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/">https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/</a><p>For my parents, stability and community was home, family, the workplace. Young people today are priced out of owning a house, or even stably renting one, there’s no expectation of long-term jobs or even a single career through your working life, let alone staying in the same place. But they still want “food, fire and friends beside water” (and also cats) and where they are looking for it is online, but the neo-liberals got there first and have commodified, monetized and corrupted the will for online community, so they end up basically with “pay-to-play” friends. Is it any wonder people are starting to have romantic relationships with AI Chatbots? The blockchain offers a way round that, a means to create a self-generated trusted community, to build structures that are egalitarian, supportive and nurturing through DAOs and similar. To do this needs more than good will, it needs law, it needs appropriate fences to keep out the thieves, scammers and profiteers. The current global operating system is broken, its head has been severed and it is running on reflexes, not quite aware it is dead yet. Politicians pull the levers and wonder why they no longer work, resorting to “dead cat” distractions to hide the fact they have no functioning policies.</p><p>Nettles need to be grasped and the <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43290/the-second-coming">rough beast slouching towards Bethlehem</a> needs to take&nbsp;form.</p><p>There are ways forward. We need to build&nbsp;them.</p><p>Next, I will take a look at possible ways to do this — watch this&nbsp;space!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/can-the-blockchain-save-the-young-from-themselves-0639b24b335c">CAN THE BLOCKCHAIN SAVE THE YOUNG (from themselves)?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>ID Document Verification was introduced to solve many of the issues that raise from services that require higher levels of authentication. Certain services require more reliable authentication methods, which offers higher assurance of the user’s identity. However, this can cause issues, especially for users of different nationalities. Lower-level authentication methods can often be used by all users regardless of their country of origin, whereas in the case of higher-level methods, it is not always the case. However, with the use of ID Document Verification it becomes easier for all users to prove their identity. In this blog, I will explore the basics surrounding ID Document Verification and some of the main features that support these solutions.</p>
 What is ID Document Verification? 
<p>The basic concept is that – instead of using a &nbsp;user ID and password to sign into an eService, I identify myself by scanning my identity document and taking a selfie or a video clip to prove who I am. I can scan the document by taking a picture of it according to instructions given by the service provider. The service uses different highly sophisticated AI (Artificial Intelligence) driven technologies to verify that the person in the picture or a video matches the one shown in the document.</p>
<p>There are several ID Document Verification service providers in the markets and as you can imagine there are some differences in the principles of how these services function. You might be interested to know how many different countries are supported by the solution, which ID documents are accepted, whether is there a need to install an app, is ID Document chip scanning supported, where is the ID document information stored, what type of fraud detection systems the solution uses and what is the price per authentication transaction, especially during the initial registration.</p>
<p>The most common ID documents accepted by these services are driver’s licenses, national ID cards and passports but depending on the country I am from there can be over ten different documents including residence permits and work permits among others that I can use to prove my identity. Depending on the service provider I can scan the identity documents using a web browser-based or app-based user interface. The result is the same, after the initial ID document scanning procedure I get access to the eService. But what happens when I want to access the same eService again?</p>
<p>The benefit of a browser-based version is that I don’t have to install a new app on my smart device. Generally, it can be a good solution for a one-time authentication. However, if the goal is to reuse my identity again without re-registration, then my ID document information must be sent to the service provider’s servers. Even though the information is stored in an encrypted format, many users do not necessarily like the idea that non-governmental 3rd party operator stores this kind of information in their servers.</p>
<p>The benefit of an app-based solution is that it provides me with the possibility to store the scanned identity document information in an encrypted format on my smart device. I have the option to remove this information at any point I want. However, many eService providers do not want to ask their customers to install additional apps on their smart devices.</p>
 How reliable is the ID Document Verification? 
<p>Can ID Document Verification methods be considered strong authentication methods? Often, strong authentication methods utilise at least two factors from the list of something the user knows (e.g. password, pin code, answer to a security question), something the user has (e.g. security token, digital certificate, an ID card, a &nbsp;phone with a built-in hardware token, software token), and something the user is (e.g. typically biometrics such as fingerprint, iris scan, vein scan etc.).</p>
<p>ID Document Verification uses a variety of AI-driven fraud detection mechanisms, such as face matching to confirm that the person who took the selfie or a video is the same as on the document. Texture analysis makes sure that the pictures or videos are genuine and not copies. In addition, features such as audio processing, face tracking and mouth tracking – where they have to say some specific words, turn my head, blink my eyes etc. – can be utilised to further verify that we have the right person trying to access the service. And if the algorithm is still not sure if it is the right person, some solutions provide an option to ask a trained employee to verify the user and make the final decision. From this perspective, we can say that ID Document Verification Authentication methods can provide strong authentication.</p>
<p>However, as an example, in Finland the official strong authentication methods include BankID, national ID cards (requires a card reader) and Mobile PKI (Mobiilivarmenne in Finnish). These methods have gone through a complex certification process to prove the maturity of the solution. This is indicated by using a Level of Assurance (LoA) levels. LoA levels use the international 4-step scale and the EU 3-step scale in parallel in the following way:</p>



International scale
EU scale
Notes


LoA 1
Not used
(EU uses 3-step scale)


LoA 2
eIDAS Low



LoA 3
eIDAS Substantial
BankID, Mobile PKI


LoA 4
eIDAS High
National Identity Card



<p>eIDAS = Electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services</p>
<p>Since ID Document Verification method vendors are private companies, they do not have such LoA certifications. From a security point of view, it is important to make sure that the vendor follows the latest developments in the standards and technology used to identify fraudulent documents.</p>
<p>Also, it is good to notice that in some European countries, it is possible to open a bank account online using ID Document Verification authentication, indicating that these banks trust their selected vendor’s solution – which is a noteworthy seal of approval.</p>
<p>One way to improve the reliability of the scanning procedure is to scan the microchip in the ID Document. The chips inside of passports and national ID cards include user-specific certificates that are very difficult to forge, thus they can be used to increase the reliability of the document verification procedure. To do this, I have to make sure I have an NFC (Near-Field Communication) chip in my smart device. In addition, some solutions can run backend queries to external databases to validate documents’ ID attributes and execute fraud evaluation against fraud databases.</p>
 Which services can use Identity Document Verification? 
<p>While ID Document Verification authentication methods have often been used in banking services, there are also many other services where they are very useful. This is especially useful where the eService requires a higher assurance of identity verification but the users cannot use the official strong authentication methods of the given country.</p>
<p>One good example of this is the universities. Very often these educational institutes have foreign students and teachers who need to authenticate themselves to access the university eServices to attend online lectures, examinations etc. Username and password methods are just not strong enough in these cases, but reliable online authentication methods are not available. This type of issue can be solved with ID Document Verification Authentication. Notice that the new European Digital Identity (EUDI), which is a part of the eIDAS regulation will allow EU-level cross-border strong authentication services. It will solve this issue for people who have EU-level digital identities. Read more about it here: <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/standards/introducing-european-digital-identity-eudi/" title="https://www.ubisecure.com/standards/introducing-european-digital-identity-eudi/">https://www.ubisecure.com/standards/introducing-european-digital-identity-eudi/</a></p>
<p>In addition, several other eServices can use ID Document Verification for more convenient, passwordless authentication. Instead of writing my username and password I can just take a selfie (biometric facial recognition) or scan a QR code to access the service. Also, if the service has a password, I could reset it by taking a selfie.</p>
<p>Integrating an ID Document Verification Authentication service with a CIAM (Customer Identity and Access Management) solution such as Ubisecure’s Identity Platform makes the onboarding of new users frictionless. This type of solution can utilise the registration form autofill feature during the initial phase of the procedure. Many of the required attributes can be scanned directly from the ID document, thus users do not have to type them in manually.</p>
<p>The integration procedure can be established using the tools provided by the CIAM system. If the ID Document Verification Authentication service supports standard authentication protocols, such as SAML or OIDC, then it is a very straightforward procedure. If the service uses proprietary APIs, then a separate adapter needs to be created to establish communication between the CIAM and the service. This type of solution allows you to easily take the ID Document Verification Authentication service to use for all of your eServices with just a few mouse clicks.</p>
 Pros and cons of ID Document Verification 
<p>Below, I have listed some positives and negatives of the ID Document Verification Authentication services. It is good to remember that the solutions vary between different vendors. So, depending on your needs you can choose a vendor that fulfils your requirements.</p>



Positives
Negatives


+ International authentication method, not limited to one national ID
– Chip scanning requires a phone with NFC functionality


+ Passwordless authentication utilising:<p></p>
<p>+ QR-codes</p>
<p>+ Selfies</p>
<p>+ Videos</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
– Initial registration can sometimes be cumbersome


+ Difficult to forge (especially the methods based on chip scanning)<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
– Not all countries have centralised registries for attribute verification<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


+ Possibility to confirm scanned information from external registries<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
– Cannot cover 100% of customers. Some manual customer service processes still required for certain users<p></p>
<p>– The service can cover a maximum of just over 200 countries at best (depending on the service&nbsp; provider)</p>
<p>– Not all users have the smart devices required available</p>
<p>– Not everyone has the documents required</p>
<p>– Not everyone has the know-how to complete the registration process</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


+ The possibility of doing a password reset using a recheck of a selfie or a video<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
– Initial authentication can be a bit expensive (for the eService provider)<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


+ Frictionless onboarding of new customers with registration form auto-filling when combined with CIAM<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
– Some solutions require the user’s ID Document information to be stored in an external DBs<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


+ Good for services that are subject to stringent KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti Money Laundering) requirements.
– There can be differing levels of accuracy different skin tones, genders and ages, enquire with your vendor about bias mitigation.

<p>As we have seen, the official strong authentication methods are usually national-level solutions. Even with the EUDI service, we can offer only EU-level solutions for the problem. The ID Document Verification Authentication services can offer an option for strong authentication for global users. In addition, it can simplify the onboarding processes and provide passwordless sign-in to eServices. Its AI-powered biometric identification engines for facial recognition and anti-spoofing technologies make it a safe option for a variety of eServices.</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered how a small piece of plastic could be your key to enhanced security and operational efficiency? This article dives into the intricacies of smart card technology, a robust solution in an era increasingly plagued by security breaches and data leaks. You’ll understand what intelligent cards are, how they function, and why their advanced authentication methods are becoming indispensable in various sectors. By the end of this read, you’ll be well-equipped to make informed decisions on integrating this technology into your security infrastructure.</p>
 
Basics of Smart Cards 
 
What is a Smart Card? 
<p>A smart card is a physical card that contains an embedded integrated circuit or chip. This chip can be either a secure microcontroller or an equivalent intelligent device with internal memory or microprocessor components.<br>
Smart cards are often used for personal identification numbers, authentication, data storage, and other applications like secure transactions. They can communicate with readers through direct physical contact or remote connections using contactless radio frequency (RFID) technology.</p>
<p>The utility of smart cards extends across multiple sectors, including banking, healthcare, transportation, and secure access control systems. These cards serve as a secure, portable platform that can perform various functions depending on the programmed data and the applications in which they are used.</p>
 
Types of Smart Cards 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are generally three types of smart cards: contact cards, contactless cards, and hybrid cards. Contact intelligent cards require physical contact with a reader to function. They are commonly used in ATM transactions, secure computer logins, and point-of-sale systems.<br>
On the other hand, contactless hybrid intelligent cards or cards use radio frequency to communicate with the card reader without direct contact. These are often used in public transportation, access control, and quick payment services.<br>
Hybrid cards combine features of both contact and contactless cards. They contain two chips, one for contact operations and another for contactless operations, providing versatility to the user and the systems they interact with.<br>
They are often used in multifunctional systems that require both types of functionality, such as a driver’s license or university ID card that also serves as a payment and access control card.</p>
 
Components of a Smart Card 
<p></p>
<p>Smart cards typically have a microprocessor or memory chip embedded in a plastic card. The chip has an operating system that manages data and provides security features, including cryptographic algorithms.<br>
Smart cards also possess a storage area for data, including personal information, cryptographic keys, or funds for transactional purposes.<br>
The physical form factor of the card can vary. Standard size resembles a typical credit card but can come in other shapes and sizes, such as key fobs, private keys, or even embedded modules in smartphones.<br>
Depending on the card type, the interface may be exposed to electrical contacts, an embedded antenna for contactless communication, or both.</p>
 
How Smart Card Authentication Works 
<p></p>
<p>Smart card authentication is a method that employs the embedded chip in the card to verify the identity of the user certificates.<br>
The chip can generate or store authentication data through cryptographic algorithms that a reader can verify. This approach makes the authentication process for debit cards highly secure and reduces the risk of fraud or unauthorized access.</p>
 
The Authentication Process Explained 
<p>When a smart card is inserted into a reader or a competent card certificate brought within the proximity of a contactless reader, the reader initiates a challenge-response mechanism. First, the reader queries the card for specific information.<br>
The card’s chip then processes this query and generates a response using its information stored in cryptographic keys. To confirm the card’s authenticity, the reader verifies this response against its data.<br>
A back-end server might be involved in more advanced systems to validate the transaction further. This multi-step verification ensures that even if someone gains physical access to a user account or a debit card, it is tough to forge or manipulate the authentication process.</p>
 
Common Protocols and Technologies 
<p></p>
<p>Smart cards often use standard protocols such as ISO/IEC 7816 for contact cards and ISO/IEC 14443 for contactless cards. Other technologies like EMV (Europay, MasterCard, Visa) are popular in the banking sector for secure transactions.<br>
These protocols and technologies govern the physical characteristics, radio frequencies, and data transmission between the intelligent card reader and the reader.<br>
Different sectors might have specialized protocols or custom configurations to make magnetic stripe cards meet specific security or functional requirements.<br>
However, adherence to globally accepted standards ensures interoperability and wider acceptance of the smart card technology.</p>
 
Benefits of Smart Card Authentication 
<p></p>
<p>Smart card authentication brings a plethora of advantages to the table. This technology adds sophistication and efficiency to any integrated system, from enhanced security to streamlined operations.</p>
 
Enhanced Security Features 
<p>The most obvious advantage of using smart card technology is the security improvement. The embedded chip in the smart card can securely store cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.<br>
Because the private key and data are stored in a chip rather than a magnetic stripe, it is much more difficult for unauthorized persons to copy or manipulate the data. This adds a strong layer of security against cloning, skimming, and other forms of fraud.<br>
Additionally, the chip can execute complex cryptographic algorithms, allowing for secure communications between the smart card user and the reader. With the integration of multi-factor authentication, smart cards provide users with a robust defense against many security threats.</p>
 
User Convenience and Efficiency 
<p>While intelligent cards offer users high security, they are also incredibly user-friendly. For most applications, users have to tap or insert their cards into a reader, making the process quicker and more streamlined compared to traditional methods like manual entry of passwords or PINs.<br>
This not only enhances user experience but also improves operational efficiency. In a corporate environment, a single smart card security token can serve multiple purposes—such as access control, secure data storage, and even digital certificates and signatures—reducing the number of credentials a user has to manage.</p>
 
Scalability and Adaptability 
<p>Smart cards are highly scalable and can be easily integrated into existing systems. As organizations grow, the smart card system can be expanded without significant changes to the infrastructure.<br>
Moreover, the cards are adaptable to new technologies and can be updated to meet evolving security standards or to add new functionalities.</p>
 
Challenges and Limitations 
<p></p>
<p>Despite its many advantages, smart card technology is not without its drawbacks.</p>
 
Costs and Budget Constraints 
<p>Implementing a smart card system can be expensive initially. The cost includes not just the cards themselves but also the readers and the back-end infrastructure.<br>
While the long-term benefits may justify the costs, budget constraints can be a significant barrier for smaller organizations or projects with limited funding.</p>
 
Technological Hurdles 
<p>Interoperability can be challenging for smart card devices, especially systems requiring multi-vendor collaboration. If not properly planned, this can lead to compatibility issues.<br>
Moreover, older smart card systems may become obsolete as technology advances, requiring upgrades or replacements.</p>
 
User Training and Acceptance 
<p>While smart cards are generally user-friendly, they do require some level of user training. Understanding how to use the cards correctly, what to do in case of loss or theft, and how to manage PINs or other secondary authentication methods are all essential for the practical usage of intelligent health cards. User acceptance can also be a hurdle, particularly for those who are not tech-savvy.</p>
 
Best Practices for Implementing Smart Card Authentication 
<p>Several best practices can guide the process when implementing smart card technology.</p>
 
Vendor Selection and Compatibility 
<p>Choosing the right vendor is crucial for a successful implementation. Look for vendors who adhere to global standards to ensure interoperability and future scalability.<br>
Also, consider the range of products and services offered by smart card vendors, including the availability of updates and customer support.</p>
 
Software and Hardware Requirements 
<p>Before deploying smart cards, thoroughly assess the existing infrastructure to determine what upgrades or changes are needed.<br>
This includes evaluating the software to manage the smart card system and the hardware that supports smart cards, card readers, and servers. Make sure they meet the required security and operational standards.</p>
 
Ongoing Maintenance and Updates 
<p>Once the smart card system is up and running, it will require regular maintenance to ensure it stays secure and functional.<br>
This includes regular software updates, monitoring for unusual activities, and periodic reviews to assess the need for system upgrades or new features.<br>
Implementing smart card authentication can significantly improve both security and efficiency in a wide range of applications.<br>
While there are challenges for smart card users to consider, the benefits of user authentication often outweigh the drawbacks, making smart cards a worthwhile investment for many organizations.</p>

 In IDnow’s latest webinar, experts gathered to discuss the challenges of preventing fraud, and the crucial role of identity verification services in the fraud capital of Europe. 



 



<p>If we are ever to tackle the scourge of fraud in the UK (which currently claims the dubious honor of being fraud capital of Europe), then more must be done to educate the public of the real harm, according to participants of IDnow’s recent <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/fraud-digital-identity-verification-uk/">webinar, ‘The future of fraud and identity verification in the UK.’</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The panel discussion, which is available now on-demand, gathered an eclectic bunch of experts, including Philipp Mind, Director Digital Technology and Innovation at UK Finance, Francisco Martins, Regional Senior Sales Manager at IDnow, Tony Sales, ex-fraudster and current Chief Product Officer at We Fight Fraud, and Paul Stratton, ex-police officer and current Founder and Lead Trainer at The Fraud Nerd.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Philipp, who was the moderator for the session, started by setting the scene, which included sharing some startling statistics of just how dire the problem of fraud is in the UK. (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy/">Read more about the UK’s problem with fraud here</a>.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>It then seemed only fitting to begin by speaking with the once dubbed “Britain’s greatest fraud star” to give his opinion on the state of fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Criminals have now got more tools and data streams available to them than ever before. When I was a criminal, getting someone’s information was quite difficult, it wasn’t the process that it is now with Telegram, and the dark web, and all these places where criminals can harvest information, so it’s a lot easier to commit than it ever was before.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tony added that the cost-of-living crisis has a part to play in people committing fraud, as does the role of social media in creating unobtainable lifestyles that persuade people to “get involved in deetsing [acquiring funds from account details].&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>They don’t even realize the consequences of their actions. They just want to get that item that they see others have. I think that’s a massive part of why we see the numbers [of fraud] we do nowadays.</p>Tony Sales, ex-fraudster and current Chief Product Officer at We Fight Fraud</blockquote>



<p>Paul, who has been historically at the opposite end of the interview table throughout his career, agreed with Tony, but also added that it was the ‘white collar’ perception of fraud that had a damaging impact on its prevalence, and often had the police deprioritize investigations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Fraud is still seen as just a business crime by a lot of senior officers, but fraud is also about the emotional harm as well as the financial crime. However, some police divisions like Merseyside Police [where Paul worked] are moving away from solely focusing on the financial harm.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Paul believes that it is this perception, or misperception, that is key, citing how police divisions will invariably prioritize more ‘serious’ crimes like burglaries or murders, for example, as the harm is clear, and the public outrage if such crimes weren’t investigated, would be massive. Paul did say that times were slowly changing, though, and that the days of police fraud teams only taking on fraud cases if over a million pounds had been lost, are (in most areas) coming to an end…&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>As a police force, and a society, if we can move toward acknowledging the actual harm that fraud causes, and not just see the financial element, then I think that will make a big difference.</p>Paul Stratton, ex-police officer and current Founder and Lead Trainer at The Fraud Nerd</blockquote>



<p>For insights into what steps the UK government and technology companies should be taking to stop fraud, read my <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy-limitations-police/">interview ‘Mind the education gap? Investigating the limitations of the UK’s fraud strategy, with ex-police officer, Paul Stratton.’</a></p>



 The effect of KYC: A blessing and a curse.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>It’s clear that technology and especially AI has facilitated an increase in new types of fraud (eg: deepfakes) in the UK. Thankfully, other types of technology like digital identity verification and eKYC were helping massively in the fight against fraud. However, while it’s important to be aware of new fraud trends, it’s also important to not forget the basics. For many organizations that means ensuring they have a robust and comprehensive KYC (Know Your Customer) process. For Tony, however, that acronym means something completely different.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We do it differently at We Fight Fraud; we call it Know Your Criminal. From a criminal’s perspective, if an organization does have a thorough KYC process in place, then they will often abandon the onboarding, and just go to a company that doesn’t have such a robust KYC process.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, companies that comply with the bare minimum of KYC and AML requirements (in order to onboard customers quicker or offer a more attractive customer experience) are not only putting their business at risk, but also their customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There’s some great technology out there, especially in some of the banking apps, such as liveness scan functionality. When it’s configured correctly and working as part of comprehensive process, it’s great, but sometimes the drive to onboard customers means some businesses skip steps,” explains Tony.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A few years ago, we (We Fight Fraud) tested some organizations’ onboarding processes, and I was able to onboard my face with my colleague’s ID, and then we reversed it and used my ID document with her face. We even tried and succeeded wearing a bright yellow balaclava and were able to onboard with all three accounts, and deposit and withdraw money. It was a really easy process because the process hadn’t been configured properly or the liveness check wasn’t working in the way it should have been, and everyone’s worried about deepfakes! Let me make it clear, this was not IDnow!”&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Biometrics, as Tony said, is very important. Identity verification vendors need to ensure the same face cannot be onboarded twice and the same document cannot be onboarded with another face, and most identity verification vendors cannot do that. You need risk analysis. You need heavy checks, what we call document and selfie checks, but it needs to be a holistic approach.</p>Francisco Martins, Regional Senior Sales Manager at IDnow</blockquote>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Oscar Santolalla: This week I am joined by Craig Ramsay from Omada, here to discuss the importance of identity governance and how it is helping to solve problems in real-world. Stay tuned to find out more.</p>
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar: Hello, for today’s episode about Identity Governance and Administration, mostly known as IGA, we have invited a super interesting guest who is Craig Ramsay. He is a Senior Solution Architect at Omada. He’s from Edinburgh, Scotland. He has worked for Omada for three years and has previously worked at RSA Security and different financial services organisations in the United Kingdom within their identity functions. Outside of work, Craig’s main interests are hiking and travelling. Hello, Craig.</p>
<p>Craig Ramsay: Hey, Oscar. How are you doing?</p>
<p>Oscar: Very good. Nice talking with you.</p>
<p>Craig: Thank you, you too.</p>
<p>Oscar: So, let’s talk about digital identity. As usual, we want to hear more about our guests. Please tell us about yourself and your journey to this world of identity.</p>
<p>Craig: Sure. So, I mean, thank you for the introduction. And I guess, in terms of my journey into identity, it was a little bit by fluke rather than by design. I studied Computer Science and when I graduated, I joined an operational IT graduate scheme. They had recently started a new IAM project, because I think back in 2008, identity and access management, identity governance wasn’t as mature as it is now. It was still kind of seen as an operational IT project rather than an information security principle. So, the drivers there were more about the efficiency, automated provisioning and stuff. But yeah, they were looking for a graduate on that project. That was me.</p>
<p>And apart from a few years where I decided to try what it was like being a policeman, I have worked in identity ever since either for, as you said, financial services organisations doing the work at the coalface or for vendors, either in project delivery or, and you know pre-sales in my solution architect role.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. So, let’s go first with the basics. We have not talked about IGA yet in this podcast, have not focused on that. So, tell us, what is that? What is Identity Governance and Administration, IGA? What is important?</p>
<p>Craig: Sure. So, I mean, identity governance, when you focus on it, at its core, it’s a solution that will ensure the right individuals have the right access for the right reasons at the right time in your organisation. So, it’s protecting the authorisations or the resource assignments within your organisation. And that’s often policy-driven to ensure that all of, and I think the important distinction here when we talk about IGA, that’s traditionally your internal identities, maybe your third parties and contractors.</p>
<p>And then in terms of the overall importance of identity governance, as I said, it’s evolved over the years from being primarily driving and focusing, looking at the provisioning element of things. But as governance has become more and more important, as we start to take a more holistic view at identity, when you look at the adjacent technologies; privileged access management, cloud infrastructure and tailored management, user endpoint, behaviour analytics, identity governance is now really being seen as the kind of control plane across that identity fabric. So, I think it is becoming crucial. And there’s a lot of visibility on the importance of identity now, right up to C-level and maybe wasn’t 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Oscar: You mentioned this concept about identity fabric. Could you also explain a bit more about that in this context?</p>
<p>Craig: Yeah, sure. So, I mean, identity fabric is a term that’s been coined in the last maybe few years by a lot of industry analysts out there. It’s maybe a new phrase, but I think the concept isn’t necessarily that new. So, I think we also hear people calling it an enriched security ecosystem. So, it’s where you look at these solutions in the PAM space, UEBA, your SIEM solutions, etc.</p>
<p>Those traditionally have worked in perhaps a bit more of a siloed manner. And the integrations have been maybe limited and not as seamless. Whereas now, I think this concept of that enriched security ecosystem, that fabric is that these things should be joined up and they should be – the convergence of intelligence and data between those solutions, I think is becoming more and more important so that you can take a holistic approach to reducing your identity-related risk.</p>
<p>Oscar: It is very important, as you said, because there will be anyway, other solutions working together with IGA. Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>What are the main problems, just – I’m sure there are many, but what are the top main problems that IGA solves?</p>
<p>Craig: Yeah, so from a business problem or business challenge perspective, I think the main thing that we always focus on when we’re helping people build their IGA business case, is that we focus on security, compliance and efficiency. So, it’s looking to increase the efficiency and productivity of your end users and their experience, all whilst ensuring that you’ve got increased compliance, increased security and reduced risk.</p>
<p>So, when we look at that, some of those common challenges and problems within that would be reducing the attack surface in the organisation. So, removing unneeded access, adhering to the principle of least privilege, making sure that your identities only have the access they should. I mean, combining those two things is going to reduce the likelihood and the impact of a potential breach in the organisation. It provides you with a unified view of access across the organisation, which a lot of people often haven’t had previously. So, understanding who has what access.</p>
<p>And then there’s the automation around identity lifecycle management. So that’s reducing the time taken to provision your joiners, your movers, your leavers. You’re putting governance and auditing around all of these processes too. So, when people are requesting access, you’re ensuring they’re getting it for the right reasons with the appropriate approval. And you’re cutting down on things like rogue IT administration and stuff like that.</p>
<p>So that’s high level, there is more obviously, but I think those are the high-level ones that we see frequently when we’re speaking to prospects out there in the market.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s a security compliance, and efficiency. Yeah, we’d like to talk about this. But before actually it will be interesting to – so people can understand the broader concept, how we try to imagine in their minds.</p>
<p>If you can see in a real-world example, how work for a typical corporation that uses IGA. So, tell us what are these main processes that you say, mostly employees, right? What are these main processes? Let’s say a new employee goes from beginning until the end.</p>
<p>Craig: Yes. I mean, if we’re going to talk – the phrase we kind of, is from hire to retire. So, when I try and explain this to my friends, maybe aren’t so technically minded when they ask what I do, I sort of give them an example. I say, OK, you join an organisation, and you are working in their HR department. So, from day one, you should have access to be able to log into the network, an email account, access to various file shares to do with HR to enable you to be productive from day one.</p>
<p>So, the IGA solution will help you identify the policies to automate that process, to make sure that you are productive and also make sure that you’ve only got access to what you should. So, if you’re joining HR, you shouldn’t be getting access to any file shares to do with finance, R and D, anything like that. And then as you move around the organisation or your needs change, you should be able to request access that goes through the appropriate channels.</p>
<p>It should be reviewed regularly to make sure that it is still appropriate as you go through your life cycle as an identity in the organisation. If you are promoted or changed departments, that should change automatically in line with those policies too. And if you either leave the organisation, be it permanently or temporary for maternity leave, garden leave, that kind of thing, your IGA solution should then disable or provision that access in a timely manner too, to make sure you’re reducing risk.</p>
<p>So, I mean, those are kind of some of the high-level things that it’s that right access for the right people at the right time for the right reasons is kind of trying to, in a nutshell.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed, that was in a nutshell, very, very easy to understand. Thank you for that. Some of these at least main problems and how these are being solved. But IGA, let’s start with security as you put security first, how IGA is helping with security?</p>
<p>Craig: So, in terms of how it contributes to, you know, maybe security and risk management, I think, it’s providing stronger access control. So, it’s starting to limit access to your sensitive and privileged information. So, when you start to look at either personal identifiable information, financially sensitive information, or privileged access, so this is when you start to look at integrations with adjacent technologies in the PAM space, you’re ensuring that the access control is limiting that access.</p>
<p>Reducing risk. I already talked about the fact that that principle of least privilege means that if there is a breach in the organisation, the identity of the account that’s breached should have only the access needed to do the job that it can, and it shouldn’t have any elevated permissions permanently. The ability to traverse the network or to have a much more impact on that breach should be reduced. You’re also reducing the likelihood by integrating with identity providers to perform strong authentication. And those unneeded accounts or unwanted accounts or unused accounts have been removed over time as well. So that should be helping you reduce the risk and then improve your security posture.</p>
<p>In combination with that as well, if you look at some of the real-time monitoring and identity incidents or detection and prevention you’re starting to see integration with abnormal access patterns, maybe you know impossible logons, for example, we integrate with the Azure identity risk subscription so that’s looking at – user logged on from Edinburgh one minute and they’re trying to log on from Beijing the next. That’s impossible, so that may be an indication of compromise. And then your IGA solution could lock down that account.</p>
<p>So, there’s many ways you could do that and it’s obviously a maturity journey, you need to crawl before you can walk before you can run. But it’s a maturity journey you go on to take a holistic view in reducing your identity related risk.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed. From basic essential functionalities of security to much more advanced like some of the ones you described.</p>
<p>The second one is, of course, we’re interested about compliance is very common that someone comes, start to ask someone from Omada, or from another company even Ubisecure, we also do identity access management and one of the key drivers for them is compliance especially in some industries, it’s more important that. So, tell us about compliance.</p>
<p>Craig: Yeah. So, I mean, when you go out there in the market and you’re speaking to organisations like more and more and more we are speaking to organisations that operate on a global basis. So, you’ve got country or region-specific things like GDPR, SOCS, HIPAA, PCI, DSS etc that are external regulatory compliance frameworks that you must comply with. And you know we keep a track on with things like Schrems II as well. We’re always keeping an eye on that to ensure that the solution we provide is compliant with those things.</p>
<p>But then we’re also helping our customers comply with how they are storing, processing and managing the data in relation to those things. So, if you look at what I often say is that an identity governance solution is a technical translation of your business processes. I think you always have to look at making sure your people process and technology are working in harmony with each other. Technology alone will not resolve your problems. So, I think as part of a wider identity information security strategy you should ensure that your internal policies and standards are created in such a way that it will help you comply with those external regulations if they apply to you.</p>
<p>But you should always look, I think it’s a healthy thing for any organisation across any vertical to have these well-defined policies and standards and ensure that they can comply with those. And as I said that’s where identity governance comes in, because it helps you comply with those things by defining policies that can detect when you’re non-compliant, you’ve got that audit trail. So, it offers – you’ve got transparent auditing for your internal and external users to prove compliance. You will go through regular recertification, attestation, reviews, whatever you want to call it. But that also ensures that you’re demonstrating regular compliance.</p>
<p>And then we already talked about risk management as well, but compliance and risk often do overlap each other. So, you’re identifying and mitigating compliance risks through the definition and enforcement of these policies as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed. So, there is some reports that can be directly created, right, from the IGA system. And that can be directly taken by the compliance officer or whoever requires it, right?</p>
<p>Craig: Yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: The other you mentioned there was the operational efficiency, right? So, as you mentioned, it’s one of the three main problems. Let’s – I’d like to hear more about that as well, how IGA helps.</p>
<p>Craig: Yeah. And I think that’s one of the things that I think separates IGA and the information security market sometimes. That it’s not always focusing on risk reduction and things that are maybe potentially seen as negative. So, you talk about fear and certainty and doubt within the sales process, etc. When you’re doing that, it can often be quite a hard sell because it’s hard to quantify the risk. We can’t help with that. There are formulas out there of calculating the impact of a risk based on, you know, and the likelihood, the cost of the actual breach, etc.</p>
<p>But to bring it back to what you actually asked about from an efficiency perspective, if you look at – if organisations are still heavily manual in their provisioning and their processes, there’s a huge cost to that from areas like your service desk, your operational IT administrators. And often it leads you to the potential for human error as well. So, if you start to automate those things, you see a reduction in numbers of calls to the desk, a number of manually created events and things that are being done. And you can put a pound, euro, dollar sign against that clearly from an efficiency and a cost reduction perspective.</p>
<p>From an end user perspective as well, I mean, it’s always, I think there’s – we’re still trying to shake off the thing that security is a barrier to efficiency. There’s an old adage that I keep using for it regularly that ‘efficiency is insecure, but security is inefficient’. And I don’t think that’s true anymore. I think if you correctly apply your policies in a way that apply the appropriate level of risk, your users – to them, it should be seamless pretty much all the time. They shouldn’t see these processes as an action. They should see it as; they request the access they need, it gets granted to them in a timely manner. When they move around the organisation, a lot of that should happen automatically.</p>
<p>Overall, you should see an increase in productivity. Your line managers aren’t getting frustrated when people join the organisation and they’re having to submit 10 different requests to get them functioning from day one. So, it’s overall operational efficiency and cost reduction. But the productivity. And end user experience of it as a result of a well-delivered IGA program, I think is clear to see as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, cost reduction is clear and is a great reason to buy a product like IGA. Absolutely. Well, if you quantify that to a buyer, it’s like, wow, you can convince him or her very easily. Yeah.</p>
<p>At Ubisecure, we are working with CIAM, and I experienced directly that sometimes requests come from potential customers, and they are looking for identity and access management. And when we review closely, we see that sometimes what they need is IGA or what they need is both IGA and customer identity and access management. So, and in those cases, the customer will need to deal with these two types of system, right? The IGA and CIAM.</p>
<p>So, what is your perspective from your experience working integrating these two types of tools? What are the main things that a buyer bought from business and technical perspective should know at least?</p>
<p>Craig: Yeah, so, I mean, funnily enough, I have worked on a couple of opportunities where Omada and Ubisecure have been working together on those kinds of joint proposals where people are looking for IGA and CIAM. And I think it’s interesting because you can make a very strong case about where the overlap is, but you can also equally make a very strong case about why they should be separate because of the nature of the requirements.</p>
<p>From a CIAM perspective, you’re looking for that seamless, really quick response for all your consumers. And then you should be able to deal with high demand periods when you’re very, very busy, when your consumers are consuming your services. And from an IGA perspective, you’re very much looking at the internal and the control and the level of these privileges that we’re talking about. And there are similarities in the capabilities in terms of, you know, being able to provision in a timely manner, deprovision in a timely manner, ensuring that it’s the level of appropriateness.</p>
<p>So, if you look at it from an integration perspective, a unified management of the identities, I think, could be important whilst treating them differently. I think your end user experience again should be important. So, you’re balancing security and efficiency for your internal and external customers. And then you should be able to have that from a scalability perspective by seeing those things integrate well with each other as well.</p>
<p>I think what is important when you’re speaking to people, understanding their requirements is crucial. So, when they’re talking about, you know, B2B or B2C capabilities and requirements, it’s OK, well, how do you manage your B2B and B2C use cases? Because I think if you take software or technical organisation where their consumers consume their services in a far, far different way to maybe a retail bank or a supermarket. The requirements for end users from that perspective, they’re opening up a loyalty card in a store and you’re processing their personal data in that manner is very, very different to maybe a software company where people are having accounts created and consuming those services.</p>
<p>So, as you can probably tell, not an absolute expert in the CIAM space, but I think whenever those opportunities arise, I think the first important question is why? To understand what it is exactly they’re trying to achieve. And then you map the use cases to the functionality in each of the appropriate solutions to make sure that it’s well matched. There will be overlap in some cases. But as I said, there’s a strong case for when there’s similarities and when they should be managed separately. But ultimately, it’s part of that wider identity fabric we mentioned earlier that it’s kind of all identity in the end, I guess.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. Indeed. As you say, you put it very clear, the importance of really knowing very well the requirements because in a conversation, they might tell you we need this one, two, three, five things and can be also in a written Excel file or whatever. But then you have to go deeply to understand what they meant by saying this B2B or anything, right? So, yeah. Indeed. Thank you for sharing that.</p>
<p>Looking now at the present and future, let’s say, because IGA, as many other types of products have been evolving, are evolving all the time because there are different needs. So what customers are asking today when they are clear that they need an IGA software? What they’re asking today and what are these new problems that need to be solved, are being solved now and need to be solved if they are not solved today?</p>
<p>Craig: Yeah. So, it’s a very timely question. To be fair, we recently released a <a href="https://omadaidentity.com/resources/analyst-reports/state-of-iga/">State of IGA for 2024 report</a> at Omada and we did a webinar discussing the findings of it and it did exactly that it looked at how seriously people were taking identity. And then as you said what are they looking for currently and what are they looking ahead at as well. So, and we just talked about the why and the use cases, so I think, number one that we still see is that the solution they’re looking at adapts and meets to their changing business needs. So, the requirements they have now and the requirements they think they’ll see in the future, it’s the core capabilities must adapt and must comply with that.</p>
<p>We’re seeing an increased importance being put on the ability for the solution to integrate as part of that security ecosystem we talked about. So being able to play nicely with the adjacent technologies across the identity fabric. And then from a connectivity perspective, I mean I talked earlier about a unified view of access across the board, the nature of organisations has changed massively in terms of on-premises systems to a lot more cloud services being consumed. So the ability to extend and integrate with a growing list of different target systems is important for them.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, we do see AI and Machine Learning coming up again and again. And I think when we see that it’s important to take those as separate things. So, from ML perspective, you know, if you look at kind of the role mining capabilities that have been there for some time, recommendations during reviews, recommendations for decisions or decision support for approvals, that stuff has been around for a little while.</p>
<p>From an AI perspective, I mean there’s a huge buzz around what’s happening in AI. Just now Google just released their Gemini Chatbot to rival Chat GPT and that the generative AI stuff and the practical uses of that are going to start to be seen. So, you know integrating generative AI, we have stuff where it’s looking at… you can ask questions about the documentation. So, like what is this object in Omada and like what’s the difference and it’s starting to respond to that so we’re in the process of testing and releasing that.</p>
<p>And then looking further down the line, it’ll be generative AI within the solution. So, user logs in and it says, “What are you trying to do today?” “I need the same access as my colleague Allison.” And it’ll say, “OK she’s got this, this and this. Maybe this is what you need to request.” Or it’s becoming more mature and more complex or sophisticated in what it can do.</p>
<p>So, I think ultimately what people are looking for is ensuring that the solution they have can do what they need to do today and can do it well, it’s scalable, it’s easy to upgrade, it’s easy to maintain. They’re reducing the complexity of management of it so they’re simplifying it from that perspective. But looking ahead they’re needing that generic connectivity that can allow them to connect to any of the systems they have now and ones they want in the future. And then being able to take advantage of the advances in the AI and ML space to improve end user experience and also the maintenance and administration of the system itself for their administrative users.</p>
<p>Oscar: So, you believe that machine learning and the other what we call artificial intelligence is going to be used. It’s to be solving those problems that today customers are bringing up.</p>
<p>Craig: I think it’ll augment, and I think – because that’s the thing people get worried about AI replacing us and whatnot. And maybe somebody using AI more efficiently than you might replace what you’re doing but AI itself can’t and I think any algorithm that – it does do in the output of it still needs human validation particularly in a field like IGA where OK it’s taken a huge amount of data, provided this output and most that might look OK. There’s probably some human context in terms of exactly what that business does that’s needed to say, “Yes I’m still OK with that.” Because ultimately the human’s going to have to be accountable for the decision that’s made. I don’t think and I don’t think we’re going to see algorithms being fined or sent to jail for data breaches you know, I mean.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, a human will go to jail anyway. Hopefully not. Hopefully that doesn’t happen.</p>
<p>Craig: No, hopefully not that’s what we’re trying to prevent. You’re right, we’re trying to prevent that but yes.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly, exactly. Yeah, yeah definitely. Also, one thing you mentioned, it comes back to what we discussed earlier these identity fabrics. Yeah, the way to coexist all this all these tools, IGA, PAM, CIAM all together that’s also, as you say, it’s something that is becoming more important because the environments are getting more complexes.</p>
<p>Final question for you, Craig. For all business leaders listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Craig: So not to spoil the magic of the podcast but we’re recording this just before Christmas towards the end of the year and I don’t know when it’s going to be released but that’s always a time for reflection and looking at where you’re at and where you want to be going. And I think for any business leader right now, I think conducting an identity maturity assessment is something that you can do actionably right now. So, look at where you’re at from an identity maturity perspective and identify gaps that you need to start filling, or priorities looking ahead and aligning that with your business goals, your business risks to ensure that your information security strategy, your policies and standards support your overall business objectives.</p>
<p>And then from that, building a plan of continuous improvement, some milestones as well. And I think any well-delivered IGA project should be doing that. It shouldn’t be looking to boil the ocean or deliver everything at once at big bang. It should be continuous improvement and continuous demonstration of value.</p>
<p>So, I appreciate that might be – that’s not something cutting edge or brand new or innovative, but I think it is really something actionably you can do now to take a step back, assess exactly where you’re at and then build that plan and start to try an action that. Do that at the end of the year, at the start of the year. There’s never a bad time to take a step back and reflect and put that plan in place. But I think that’s definitely something actionable that they could put on their agenda right now to do from today.</p>
<p>Oscar: I couldn’t agree more an assessment, absolutely. It’s something needed. Yeah, it takes time. And it’s very actionable, as you said. Yeah, thank you very much, Craig, for having this very interesting conversation about IGA and other topics, related topics.</p>
<p>So, let us know for people who would like to continue this conversation with you, or follow you, or find out more about what you do, what are the best ways for that?</p>
<p>Craig: Yeah, absolutely. So, you can find me on LinkedIn, Craig, I think my username is Craig86. Obviously, I work at Omada Identity, but that’s, again, if you search for Omada, you’ll find us there. I mentioned our <a href="https://omadaidentity.com/resources/analyst-reports/state-of-iga/">State of IGA 2024 report</a>, you can download that free from omadaidentity.com. And there’s also an on-demand webinar where myself and Rod Simmons, our VP of Product Strategy, discuss that report in-depth.</p>
<p>But yeah, please do feel free to reach out and connect. If you want to chat about all things identity or just want to know a bit more about Omada or myself. But yeah, it’s been a pleasure talking to you, Oscar, as well. Thank you.</p>
<p>Oscar: My pleasure as well. Well, all the best. Happy New Year. Now, this coming the new year, 2024, I wish you all the best for you, Craig, Omada, and everybody who is doing all this great job in the identity space. Thank you. All the best.</p>
