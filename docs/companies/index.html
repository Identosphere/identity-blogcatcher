Thanks to these features, investigators can create detailed evidence summaries quickly and accurately, which has proven successful in courts all over the world when dealing with crypto-recovery cases (e.g., Pig Butchering scams).</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We are excited to offer Coinfirm Investigator, the most innovative and powerful automated forensic investigation solution currently available. We know it will help with all digital assets investigative needs so investigators can focus on what’s important for their success.” said&nbsp; Dr. Mircea Mihaescu, CEO Coinfirm</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 13th February to 19th&nbsp;February <p>We’re back with another in-depth edition of Veriscope Regulatory Recap. This week, we cover New Jersey’s New York-like crypto regulatory framework, the Indian Finance Minister’s call for global collaboration on crypto regulations, France to turn up the heat against crypto businesses, and Oman to create new crypto regulations. So, let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p> New Jersey Creates New York-like Crypto Framework <p>Following New York state’s footsteps, the state of New Jersey, too, is ready with a crypto regulatory framework of its&nbsp;own.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/Ashean1234/status/1626466892214050816?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>Introduced in February 2022 and amended most recently last month, the proposed framework goes by the name the Digital Asset and Blockchain Technology Act. And many legal experts believe that the New Jersey law could be more comprehensive than its New York predecessor.</p><p>As evident from the draft, the proposed regulation offers directives on what types of persons should engage in a digital asset business activity. It also talks about a licensing system whereby an application for a license under this act has to be submitted through the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System.</p> Indian FM Again Pitches for Global Collaboration on&nbsp;Crypto <p>Indian Finance Minister recently stressed that a collective global effort is an answer to regulating virtual assets rather than a standalone country trying to control the tech-intensive areas of crypto mining, asset, or transaction.</p>(<a href="https://www.dreamstime.com/photos-images/lahori-gate.html">Image Source</a>)<p>She also highlighted the country’s efforts to develop a standard operating protocol through detailed discussions with other G20&nbsp;members.</p><p>According to local industry representatives, the need for strong crypto regulations is even higher in India as the country is witnessing the adoption of digital assets at an exponential rate.</p><p>Yet, so far, India’s approach towards crypto assets has been that of suspicion and doubt. The government has imposed a 30% tax rate on all crypto income, and on top of that, it does not even allow crypto traders to offset losses against&nbsp;gains.</p> France Set Make VASP Licensing Process Difficult <p>The new registration conditions for VASPs (read: crypto businesses), scheduled to come into effect in January 2024, will require companies to comply with additional rules on internal controls, cybersecurity, and conflicts of interest.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1625506509516840965?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>Expert opinion indicates that new requirements for companies to have resilient and secure IT systems could prove difficult for small businesses and even pose a challenge for regulators when monitoring the market for irregularities.</p><p>To date, the text of the regulation is yet to receive approval from the National Assembly.</p> Oman to Establish a New Crypto Regulatory Framework <p>The new regulatory framework for the virtual asset industry in the Sultanate would be set up by its Capital Market Authority, known as the&nbsp;CMA.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1627409416013185028?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>The framework would give powers to CMA to oversee virtual asset activities, VASP licensing, and implement risk identification and mitigation strategies in the virtual asset space. It will also propagate surveillance, enforcement strategies, and mechanisms to prevent market&nbsp;abuse.</p><p>CMA will obtain the necessary guidance and advice about setting up the regulations from XReg Consulting Limited and Said Al-Shahry and Partners.</p><p>Once approved, crypto assets, exchange services, and initial coin offerings will come under new regulations.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/dubais-innovative-virtual-asset-regulations-the-full-picture">Dubai’s Innovative Virtual Asset Regulations — The Full&nbsp;Picture</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">AML and KYC Compliance in Crypto&nbsp;Industry</a></p><p>______________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

 Unleash the Power of Verus — Technological Showcase of Centrally-Issued Token Fully Backed by&nbsp;Gold  In this article, we showcase how to launch a centrally controlled token with minting and burning capabilities, fully backed by gold. We use the innovative Verus blockchain technology with its versatile currency launches, which can be used both for centralized and decentralized projects. And we don’t even need to code anything! <p>📝 Note that this walkthrough is for the Verus Testnet blockchain, which already has the functionalities that the PBaaS-upgrade (Public Blockchains as a Service) will bring to mainnet. Also, the commands are for macOS and Linux, as Windows works a bit differently. We use the CLI wallet for Verus. <a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/releases/tag/v0.9.6-1">Download here</a> 🔗 You can also use Verus Desktop with its incorporated terminal.</p> Fictional Company “Very Good&nbsp;Gold” <p>In this technological showcase, we have a fictional company that is an issuer of a centralized token with 1:1 backing of gold. With a starting supply of 0. The issuer of this token has full control of minting and burning capabilities.</p><p>The mint and burn process however needs to be approved by two signers, making sure one entity doesn’t have full control. For this example we use a 2 of 2 signature setup. Any signature setup is possible (with a maximum of 13 of 25), depending on different use&nbsp;cases.</p> Defining a&nbsp;Currency <p>Defining a currency on the Verus network is simple, just two commands. When the currency is successfully launched it can flow around within the protocol, and outside of the protocol (<a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/get-ahead-of-the-game-with-verus-groundbreaking-1-1-decentralized-currency-mapping-for-erc-20-cc23584a7037">learn how to export a currency as an ERC-20 to Ethereum</a> 🔗). Let’s get&nbsp;started.</p> VerusID Namespace <p>Before defining the currency, we already registered the VerusID VGG@. This cost us 100 VRSCTEST (or 80 when using a referral), which were distributed to the block producers. These costs can drastically vary depending on which PBaaS-blockchain we create a&nbsp;VerusID.</p><p>VerusID is the namespace for currencies and PBaaS-blockchains, among many other things. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/verusid/">Learn more about VerusID</a>&nbsp;🔗</p><p>We also said to have a 2 of 2 signature setup. This means the identity is controlled by two primary addresses, with always two signatures needed to do any action (like launching the currency, minting, burning and sending).</p> Defining the&nbsp;currency <p>Defining a currency costs 200 VRSCTEST. These costs can change depending on which blockchain you want to define a currency on. When launching PBaaS-chains you can define your own costs in the chains’ native currency. Good to know: these costs are going to the miners and stakers of the blockchain.</p><p>With a few simple commands, we&nbsp;will:</p>  Define the&nbsp;currency  Have it signed by a second signature  Launch the&nbsp;currency  <p>Before starting we must fund VGG@ with 200+ VRSCTEST to launch the currency. The chain definition is as&nbsp;follows:</p> ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"VGG", <br>  "options":32, <br>  "proofprotocol":2<br>}' <p>It’s a simple chain definition, with only “options”:32 (= the currency is just a token), and “proofprotocol”:2 (= the controller of the VerusID where the currency is launched from can mint and burn tokens at&nbsp;will).</p><p>These are some options and specifications that are possible when launching a currency: as a simple token, as fractional reserve currency or multi-reserve basket, start &amp; end block, min. &amp; max. preconversions, initial contributions, pre-launch discount &amp; carveout, initial supply and much&nbsp;more.</p><p>⭐ To learn more about the many different launch options when defining a currency on Verus, <a href="https://docs.verus.io/definecurrency/">go here</a> 🔗 We encourage anyone to start testing the protocol to get ahead of the game. <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">The community is happy to help on Discord</a>&nbsp;🔗</p> Approving and launching the&nbsp;currency <p>Now, the second signer needs to come in and sign off on the currency definition, and launch the currency.</p><p>The command from before gives out a HEX. The second signer needs to sign this HEX as&nbsp;follows:</p> ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST signrawtransaction "hex" <p>This gives out another HEX. We use it to submit the transaction to the chain, which in turn launches the currency.</p> ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendrawtransaction "hex" <p>After doing the command above, it takes around 15 blocks before the currency is officially launched on the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Next step is the minting and burning of tokens, according to how much gold the company has in&nbsp;custody.</p> Minting and&nbsp;burning <p>Say a customer put 10,000 ounces of gold into the custody of the company. Now let’s make sure the customer gets that amount of VGG into their&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>We mint 10,000 VGG with this simple&nbsp;command:</p> ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "VGG@" '[{<br>  "address":"Customer1@", <br>  "currency":"VGG", <br>  "mintnew":1, <br>  "amount":10000<br>}]' <p>VGG@ is the change-address, Customer1@ is the address where the 10,000 VGG are minted&nbsp;to.</p><p>The second signer needs to do signrawtransaction and sendrawtransaction, as we have done before, to actually mint the tokens into Customer1@.</p><p>Now, if someone wants to redeem their VGG for gold again, we need to be able to burn that amount from the supply of VGG. We burn with the following command:</p> ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "VGG@" '[{<br>  "address":"VGG@", <br>  "currency": "VGG", <br>  "amount": 5000, <br>  "burn":true<br>}]'  <p>To make it happen, the second signer needs to sign off on it&nbsp;again.</p><p>If we want to check to see the supply of the currency, we can do the following command:</p> ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrency “vgg”  Use VGG in Many&nbsp;Ways <p>This article showcased a simple example of how a business can function using the Verus protocol. What we can do with the network goes far beyond what is possible using current blockchain protocols. And all of that without any programming needed!</p><p>We can also easily export the VGG token to Ethereum as an ERC-20. It can also become one of the reserves in a multi-reserve liquidity basket AMM (automated market maker) as part of Verus&nbsp;DeFi.</p><p>Anybody can define a multi-reserve currency which includes VGG as a reserve with weighted percentage (10–90%). The reserves grow as they retain a small fee whenever assets are traded in/out/through.</p><p>A multi-reserve currency itself can also be used as one of the reserves in another multi-reserve liquidity basket AMM token on&nbsp;Verus.</p><p>👀 Stay tuned for more examples, or start reading <a href="http://docs.verus.io/">docs.verus.io</a>, or <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">join the Discord to&nbsp;learn</a>.</p><p>🫡 Credits for the article go to community member ‘ejuliano’.</p><p>➡️ <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">Explore with the community on&nbsp;Discord</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/VerusCoin">Follow on&nbsp;Twitter</a></p><p><a href="http://www.verus.io/">Go to&nbsp;verus.io</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/unleash-the-power-of-verus-technological-showcase-of-centrally-issued-token-fully-backed-by-gold-dcc9fae7ca0f">Unleash the Power of Verus — Technological Showcase of Centrally-Issued Token Fully Backed by Gold</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin">Verus Coin</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><a href="https://dhiway.com/introducing-the-cord-blockchain-for-building-digital-public-goods/">CORD Blockchain</a> is an ambitious technological innovation project led by Dhiway to modernize and legitimize the century-old process to help organizations manage ownership, transparency, authenticity &amp; globally recognized hassle-free verification.</p>



<p>The core principle of blockchain is to record transactions. These transactions generate a hash (a pattern of alphabets &amp; numbers) which protects the record from any forgeries. Node verifies the hash, writes the block and shares a copy of the chain with many different computers.</p>



<p>Simply put, <a href="https://dhiway.com/introducing-the-cord-blockchain-for-building-digital-public-goods/">CORD Blockchain</a> operates day &amp; night creating records that are impossible to erase. Faking a block means fooling thousands of nodes.</p>



<p>Analogy:<br>“Imagine an advanced Google Sheet where you and everyone else whom the document is shared with can access the file and collaborate in real time. Every time I complete writing on each cell, the data will be shared with every other guest whom I have shared with. I can enter the data on each cell but no options to undo, edit or delete the data from the cell”. That’s precisely how blockchain works, instead of a shared Google Sheet, think of a shared ledger (in blockchain terms).<br>It’s an impossible task to fake the data on every other computer making CORD the best solution to establish trust between two or multiple parties.</p>



<p>Art &amp; artefact (high-value goods) has been a volatile industry for wealthy buyers. Major art auctioneers such as Christie’s and Freeman’s have been operating for the last 200+ years. In recent years, we have seen tremendous technological advancement which is a boon and can be a curse for a few industries. Technological forgeries make the art auction industry unreliable and can hamper both artists’ &amp; company’s reputations.</p>



<p>The case below shows how CORD Blockchain can be used in the art industry for trust, authenticity, verification and multiple ownership changes.</p>



<p>Let’s say you are an art auctioneer, you help art lovers to sell and buy curated products.</p>



<p>The Art Auction Industry process can be categorized into 3 stages.<br>Auction Estimate, Seller’s agreement &amp; Cataloged &amp; Sale.</p>



<p>A. Auction Estimate:<br>Let’s say an art collector decides to sell his art through your auction house. Art doesn’t have intrinsic value, meaning the artwork has some value only if it has a price tag, information about the artist, documentation, who owned it etc. Once these data are collected an estimated price will be discussed with the present owner. Without any of these details, art is just a showpiece.</p>



<p>Collecting these data and creating tamper-proof documentation helps a buyer trust the art’s authenticity and makes buying decisions easy.</p>



<p>Example: Salvator Mundi by Leonardo da Vinci</p>







<p>This unearthed the lowest layer, the very first strokes, one the artist took to outline the general composition of the painting, these first strokes largely matched up with the final product except the thumb. They outlined the thumb in a straight position, rather than the curved shape seen in all known Fake copies of the lost Da Vinci painting. Seems like the artist changes his mind while finishing the painting, which would make no sense when copying a painting.</p>



<p>This hidden stroke served as a crucial piece of evidence that this might be the original Salvator Mundi painted by Leonardo Da Vinci himself.</p>







<p></p>



 



<p>In the art industry, proof plays an important role.<br>Who painted it, who owned it, and who wants it?</p>



 



<p>This example shows how proof can be a deal breaker. Starting from an artist, product material, first sale at £ 45, Inherited by Nephew and later inherited by his daughter, sold to four buyers all these data are important for the next sale. Capturing these data and making these data non-erasable is the job CORD blockchain does.</p>



  
<p>B. Seller’s agreement:</p>



<p>It might be a public or a private auction, agreement is to maintain harmonious and mutually beneficial relationships between two or more parties to set forth certain terms and conditions relating to the sale, reserve price (auctioneer won’t sell below reserve price at auction), fee, marketing, shipping, insurance, etc. covered by the agreement and to ensure that all reasonable measures are provided.</p>



<p>This entire agreement with specific attributes can be captured in blockchain for transparency. Additionally, as an auctioneer, you get to decide what attribute should be captured in blockchain and what not.</p>



<p>C. Cataloged &amp; Sale:</p>



<p>After the agreement, the painting is photographed and cataloged, and ready for sale. Once a successful sale, the seller will receive the payment which was agreed on in advance.</p>



<p>As a seller:</p>



 
 Agreement with the auctioneer is tamper-proof. 



 Non-erasable documentation related to my product makes it easier to sell. 
 



<p>As a Buyer:</p>



 
 I am confident to buy an authentic product. 



 I can resell the product easily as the data is non-erasable. 



 Easily verifiable. 



 I don’t have to carry physical documents to show product proof. 



 I can see the product journey starting from the artist to the last owner. 
 



<p>As an Auctioneer:</p>



 
 I help both buyers &amp; sellers fulfil their customer journey with authentic product data. 



 I am transparent with both buyer &amp; seller with information related to the product. 



 Ownership verification is easy. 



 Blockchain as a part of the service attracts more buyers and sellers. 



 Customer retention, buyers can easily resell it through me. 



 I am creating a trust circle in the art market. 



 Based on the collector’s interest I can keep the identity public or private. 
 
  



 







 



<p></p>



<p>Similarly, the CORD blockchain can be used for digitally sold art products.</p>



<p>E-commerce (high-value goods):</p>



<p>Selling a product in a digital world means creating trust environment for both buyers and sellers. A seller will signup with your business if you have the ability to generate leads and have a trusted financial journey. A buyer will be looking for an authentic product where reviews and rating helps.</p>



<p>Let’s say you sell digital art products. There are 2 types of ownership.</p>



<p>1. Full ownership<br>2. Shared ownership</p>



<p></p>



<p>1. Full ownership:<br>The customer pays the full price of the product, and he/she will be the true owner of the product. This is similar to the example mentioned earlier (Salvator Mundi painted by Leonardo Da Vinci). Here a product is sold to one customer only.<br><br>2. Shared owners:<br>What if, instead of the art market being the sole domain of the deep-pocketed, everyday people could buy shares of a pricey piece of art and sell the shares as they, please?</p>



<p>That’s exactly what a New York based company Masterworks &amp; Maecenas do. They acquire blue-chip art at auctions on behalf of their investors. Creates a holding company for each piece of art to acquire it, store it, promote it, and resell it for profit. It registers the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission and issues shares to people who want to invest in a specific piece of art.</p>



  
<p>Similarly, E-commerce companies can bring the concept to the digital world with the help of blockchain. This helps common people to buy and sell art shares online.</p>



<p>A high-priced artwork is difficult to sell online. Let’s say an e-commerce company is not able to sell a painting priced at Rs. 1,00,000. The easier approach is to make a sale, by bringing shared ownership.</p>
  



<p>The company and artist/present owner of the art together decide to sell the painting in 10 shares, now it’s easier for customers to invest a small amount of Rs. 10,000 for a small part of the painting. In such cases, managing individual shares, and proof of ownership plays an important role in resale. Additionally, the company can retain customers in future resale by creating a proof wallet (for this you may need a mobile application so that DID can be created, DID stands for decentralized identity. also referred to as self-sovereign identity, is an open-standards-based identity framework that uses digital identifiers &amp; verifiable credentials that are self-owned, and independent, and enable trusted data exchange) for all the assets brought by the customer.</p>



  
<p>Seamlessly integrate the CORD blockchain with your existing E-commerce products.</p>



<p>Products with tamper-proof documentation attract more buyers, especially high-value products.</p>



<p>As an E-commerce company:<br>I can charge sellers for tamper-proof documentation as a service which helps sellers grab buyer attention. And the buyer trusts the seller and the company.</p>



<p></p>
  



<p>As a seller:<br>Verifiable documentation helps me increase my reputation. Sell artwork in a secure and efficient manner.</p>



<p>As a buyer:<br>On every art purchase, I get proof documents, which will help me in resale.</p>



<p></p>



 



<p>Potential buyers will be able to access the artwork’s history, track its prior locations and establish genuine value if this information is made publicly available. These data would be considered extremely trustworthy as they are recorded on the blockchain, anonymity can be maintained and could not be tampered with.</p>



 



<p>CORD Network by Dhiway:</p>



<p>CORD is an essential building block of Web 3.0 with its ability to reimagine real-world interactions that best fit a particular purpose, balancing security and control with the convenience and opportunity of sharing data between institutions and individuals. The potential this creates for new business models is endless.</p>



<p>In business, trust is incredibly hard to engineer and impossible to guarantee. Until now, we’ve relied on instruments and institutions to be surrogates for our trust. With CORD, trust can be embodied in the transaction using verifiable attributes. Depending on the participant’s role and the particular transaction, individuals and institutions can be deemed as trusted, semi-trusted or untrusted. For example, a financial institution could trust an overseas partner to do X but not Y. Third parties that were once necessary to broker trust will be disinter-mediated. This codification of trust optimises transactional relationships, making business interactions across ecosystems far more efficient.</p>

<p><br>
The purpose of this blog post is to argue that, instead of expanding controls and imposing unnecessary restrictions on interactions outside their locus of control, single identity system providers should prioritize feeding outputs into identity metasystems to use as trust decision inputs, and allowing these entities operating in metasystems to define their own policies. This is the key to achieving widespread digital trust.</p>
 <br>
Identity System Outputs and Metasystems 
<p><br>
The world is made up of various unique and intricate ecosystems, each with its own context that can be challenging to comprehend, both from an outsider’s perspective and even for those within an ecosystem. Does a goldfish know they’re in water until they’re not?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Understanding the context within an ecosystem can be complicated.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://northernblock.io/is-history-repeating-itself-or-are-we-operating-in-a-context-were-not-aware-of/">recent podcast episode I recorded with Tim Bouma</a>, we discussed how understanding different contexts within an ecosystem can be daunting. Additionally, ecosystems on their own may have dependencies on other ecosystems, which further contributes to the complexity of it all.</p>
<p>Although in recent years, the usage of the term ecosystem has evolved to include groups of people, organizations and other systems, the term ecosystem was originally coined to describe the interconnected systems of nature, such as the complex web of relationships within a forest ecosystem, which is further divided into sub-ecosystems or subsystems. They naturally develop on their own without any restrictions, as the image in this post tries to convey.</p>
<p>In my backyard, there is a maple tree that annually produces and disperses samaras, also known as “helicopter seeds”. These samaras serve as inputs for various ecological communities, including the soil microbiome, plant communities, and insect populations. The maple tree functions as a self-organizing system, managing its own resources and interacting with other entities in adjacent ecosystems through the dispersal of its seeds.</p>
<p>Just like my maple tree, an identity system is its own self-organizing system with its own boundaries, but it is not a metasystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A metasystem can be thought of as a higher-level system that is built on top of other systems. It is a system of systems that can provide consistency and interoperability between multiple systems, creating a more cohesive whole.</p>
 <p>The relationship between identity systems and metasystems and the value they each produce. The value that a metasystem can provide far exceeds the value of any individual system.</p> 
<p><br>
One of the key advantages of a metasystem is that it promotes network effects. By providing a shared infrastructure, a metasystem can be leveraged to serve many different purposes, allowing for more efficient use of resources and increased interoperability between different systems. This can lead to greater adoption of the metasystem, which in turn can increase its value to all participants.</p>
<p>So evidently, an identity metasystem is a grouping of identity systems interacting with each other. They follow a common set of standards, conventions and protocols to increase value to all participants involved. As the above image displays, it’s the interactions that happen outside of single identity systems and within the metasystems which are most valuable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we can distinguish Identity Systems from Identity Metasystems, it creates a better framing for discussions around the roles of governments, private sector and wallet technology providers within the pursuit of widespread digital trust.</p>
<p>It’s important to recognize that single identity systems can play a critical role in building trust, but they are only one piece of a larger puzzle when it comes to addressing the complex challenges of digital interactions.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://northernblock.io/musings-on-wallets-identity-metasystems-with-phil-windley/">podcast I did with Phil Windley in 2021</a>, we discussed the difference between identity systems and identity metasystems. While preparing for another podcast with Phil (soon to be released), I revisited our previous conversation where he explained how a government’s driver’s licence management division found itself operating its own identity system. They were able to set the requirements and design policies that would lead to a driver’s licence output. Although not necessarily wanting to be in the identity business, the driver’s licence authority was able to leverage international norms, driving safety considerations, and data privacy regulations to build the system properly. In this case, it’s important to note that the driver’s licence system is not a metasystem – the driver’s licence document itself represents an output from a single identity system, which in turn becomes an input for a broader metasystem. The metasystem in this case can be the idea that people can carry cards with their pictures on them for authentication purposes wherever they wish, and the data in these cards is trusted or not based on the holder’s presentation of them. The point to consider is that there exists a metasystem of cards and their presentation, and the reason why we trust some and not others is because of the specific system that designs the policies for the issuance of these cards.</p>
<p>The complexity of the situation underscores the fact that there is no single identity system that can solve all the complex problems we encounter in our increasingly digital lives. As noted by Kim Cameron in his Fifth Law (‘Pluralism of Operators and Technologies’) within his <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf">Laws of Identity paper</a>, a variety of operators and technologies are necessary for identity systems to function effectively. </p>
<p>Identity systems cannot exist in complete isolation from one another, rather they must be able to work together in a cohesive manner, much like ecosystems.&nbsp;This means that each identity system must&nbsp; be able to ingest inputs and provide outputs that other systems can consume. Just as my maple tree ingests sun and rain (inputs) from other systems outside of its control and, in turn, creates leaves and buds (outputs) for systems outside of its boundaries. My tree couldn’t thrive on its own – the same is true with identity systems.</p>
<p>If, as an identity system provider, you aim to create a closed and tightly managed ecosystem that doesn’t provide any output for other systems to use as support for making trust decisions, then you won’t be contributing to the attainment of widespread digital trust.</p>
<p>Your identity system is a single, distinct system where you exercise control. It is where you can use policies derived from various legal, business, or technology-driven considerations to create interactions between yourself and your citizens, employees, or customers. In your identity system, you can set the rules. Similarly, the entity you interact with, such as your customers, employees, or citizens, can also set the rules on how they wish to interact with you. With wallets and digital verifiable credentials, we can even look at them as running their own identity system. </p>
<p>In reality, no one operates their whole lives within a single identity system. The world functions using a variety of different identity systems.</p>
 <br>
Avoiding Restrictions At All Costs 
<p><br>
If we aim to create digital trust on a broader scale outside of one simple digital identity system or ecosystem we need to consider how to design infrastructure that provides greater control for all participants while still maintaining an appropriate level of privacy, authenticity, confidentiality, security and suitable levels of trust for participants involved.</p>
<p>Rather than imposing restrictions outside of your identity system’s boundaries, you can think of offering your governance as inputs for other systems to use or not to use. When you begin to impose restrictions beyond your area of control, you end up creating a centralized identity system, rather than being a contributor in a metasystem. As history has shown, such systems have not been successful in achieving widespread adoption.</p>
 <p>Identity systems can contribute outputs into metasystems, which can then be used as inputs to inform trust decisions. These trust decisions can then lead to further cascading outputs into metasystems. These outputs can be in the form of credentials, trust lists/registries, etc.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://reality2.substack.com/p/the-digital-wallet-will-be-the-biggest">blog post</a> of his, Doc Searls discussed the comparison between wallets and web browsers, and while there are some similarities, there are also significant differences that make them not entirely comparable.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>[…] browsers are a bad model for the wallets we need. That’s because we need wallets to be ours and private, and browsers are neither. […] users, and not independent actors able to operate at full agency.”</p></blockquote>
<p>With an understanding that browsers and wallets are like comparing apples to oranges, we can learn from how web browsers allow us to interact with servers and access information from them. Browsers act as open explorers, enabling users to visualize and extract information from servers while implementing security and authentication methods to offer more assurance to the requester that the server they’re interacting with is safe and that they’ve established a secure connection, such as through the use of SSL certificates. Browsers put mechanisms in place to protect consumers from unsafe connections, but they don’t necessarily prevent them from interacting with servers that may not have the level of trust that the browser deems safe. Instead, browsers give a warning, asking users to confirm if they wish to proceed, which helps to protect consumers by giving them an input to help them make a decision. This approach doesn’t impede their control or sovereignty over accessing information from the servers they choose to interact with; rather, it provides them with inputs and not restrictions.</p>
 <p>Your browser provides you with inputs for making a decision. Should I move forward or not with connecting with this server? If I want to continue with my request, I can.</p> 
<p>If we take inspiration from how browsers give consumers a notice of possible security concerns, we can apply the same thinking to consumer-controlled digital wallets. With the main difference being that the consumer owns the wallet, unlike the browser. This means that consumers now have the ability to select, or subscribe to, the types of notices they would like to see from whom. Certain wallets could help consumers by preselecting packages of notices, but the consumer will have the ultimate control to turn them on or off, and to take their advice or not.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Is a verifier trusted enough for a citizen of mine to share a government-issued credential with?”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“How do we verify issuers and verifiers?”&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>The above are types of questions that I’ve been hearing more lately as conversations around self-sovereign identity ecosystem governance have been on many people’s minds. We all want to protect citizens/consumers, but at what expense?</p>
<p>If issuers and verifiers are required to register on a list to interact with a wallet, we are extending the control boundaries of identity systems and creating larger centralized systems that impact individual sovereignty. The maintainer(s) of the lists are third parties who shouldn’t be involved in the interactions between two sovereign entities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s one thing for these third parties to provide governance outputs as value adds into supporting systems that could be consumed by entities within a metasystem, but not applying restrictions or controls over others’ interactions.</p>
<p>Ecosystems are complex, and it’s challenging to understand them alone, let alone with their interdependencies and complexities. Therefore, to protect citizens and consumers, it’s crucial that we view governance elements as inputs for others, and not restrictions. The <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust over IP</a> Trust Registry Task Force is actively discussing these topics to ensure that both parties involved in an interaction or transaction can decide what inputs they require according to their policies to make their trust decisions.</p>
<p>We must also keep in mind that personal information won’t only be shared through self-sovereign identity wallets. If we begin restricting certain types of credential exchanges based on governance, we must question whether we are truly promoting an open and decentralized identity system and making it simpler for end-users to transact using these products.</p>
<p>Identity metasystems have several benefits. They promote self-regulation and prevent the unnecessary proliferation of new identity systems, while also facilitating the monetization of outputs, which can be beneficial for existing identity systems.</p>
<p>Enforcing policies by a third party not involved in the transaction is not appropriate. Instead, we should focus on providing consumers and the private market with more available inputs rather than restrictive decisions. Enforcing restrictive governance on wallets and identity systems is unlikely to lead to network effects that can effectively address the current widespread digital trust issues.</p>The post <a href="https://northernblock.io/offering-outputs-not-restrictions/">Offering Outputs, Not Restrictions</a> appeared first on <a href="https://northernblock.io">Northern Block | Self Sovereign Identity Solution Provider</a>.<p>The post <a href="https://northernblock.io/offering-outputs-not-restrictions/">Offering Outputs, Not Restrictions</a> appeared first on <a href="https://northernblock.io">Northern Block | Self Sovereign Identity Solution Provider</a>.</p>

<p>Digital services should be easily accessible for all citizens and companies and offer clear added value. <a href="https://www.bitkom.org/EN">Bitkom e. V.</a>, the largest association of the digital, information, and telecommunications industry in Germany, has been advocating for this for years. Recently, the association launched a new “Arbeitskreis ‚Digitale Identitäten‘” (new working group on ‘Digital Identities’) to provide a platform for this increasingly important topic. In February 2023, Rayissa Armata, Senior Head of Regulatory Affairs at IDnow, was elected as chairperson for this working group.</p>



 Secure and accountable framework for digital identities. 



<p>Rayissa hails from the San Francisco Bay Area and has extensive experience advancing business and regulatory initiatives both in the U.S., Europe, and the United Nations.</p>



<p>“With more than 2,000 members, Bitkom is one of the strongest voices in Germany to work with government and regulators as our society continues to digitize. The working group provides a great opportunity for the industry to develop and exchange views on digital identity to create a secure, accountable, and interoperable framework for all citizens. I am very much looking forward to exchanging ideas with my colleagues in the working group and am excited to see what we can achieve together,” explains Rayissa.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



 Goals and tasks of the ‘Digital Identities’ working group. 



<p>One of the goals of the ‘Digital Identities’ working group is to bring together different industry and sector-specific technology approaches and improve public awareness of the growth potential created by digital identities. The working group will also focus on coordinating with political stakeholders and expanding the market by providing decision-making and practical aid for companies.</p>



<p>In addition, the harmonization of regulations and the creation of use cases are on the working group’s agenda. The main aim is to highlight the added value of digital identities in everyday applications.</p>



<p>The Bitkom working group will act as a center of excellence for the German digital economy. It seeks to bring together representatives from the fields of law, business, technology, and entrepreneurism to promote the digital transformation of the German economy and society.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“IDnow and Bitkom have been long-time advocates for the creation of a responsible European ID ecosystem with a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">digital identity wallet</a> at its center. This is a remarkable opportunity to join our ideas including those of other German firms and experts to suggest best ways forward. As such, we are highly pleased that digital identity has a dedicated working group to best uphold the mission of Bitkom and the German economy,” says Rayissa.</p>

<p>Anyone remember the last time you used a physical key to unlock and start your car? Me neither! Most modern cars use a smart key fob to unlock and a push button to start, with the added security of the key fob needing to be near to operate the vehicle.</p>
<p>Technology has evolved over the last several years, improving both user experience and security when accessing various products. Yet we still haven’t moved past using passwords – the weakest form of security as they’re easily compromised and reused in multiple applications and websites. When the strength of the password is improved with complex phrases, characters, and length, it leads to frustrating experiences with users often forgetting their password and locking themselves out of their accounts.</p>
<p>With the support for passkeys by all major OS platform vendors (Microsoft, Apple, Google), organizations can now offer a truly passwordless login for users that is both secure and that provides a seamless and enjoyable user experience. <a href="https://futurecio.tech/why-passwords-should-die/">The end of passwords is truly here</a>.</p>
<p>What Passkeys Are</p>
<p>Passkeys let you sign in or log on to applications and services without passwords or even usernames if configured that way. They are digital credentials in the form of cryptographic key pairs, with the public key stored on the application server and a private key stored on your device that can be accessed via biometrics authentication on your device.</p>
<p>Using passkeys to log in to applications and services make it seamless and easy to use, just like you would unlock your phone with Face ID or other biometrics.</p>
<p>How Passkeys Work</p>
<p>Passkeys are cryptographic key pairs typically stored on a user’s device and used to authenticate users into various applications. A public key is stored on the application server and a private key is stored on the user’s device.</p>
<p>When a user tries to log in to an application, passkeys use Bluetooth® to communicate between the user’s phone (FIDO authenticator) and the device from which the user is trying to authenticate.</p>
<p>The application issues a security challenge to the user’s registered device via Bluetooth. The user is then prompted to authenticate via biometrics to accept the sign-in request, which is signed with the private key on the user’s registered device and sent back to the application to be verified with the corresponding public key, after which the user is signed in if successful.</p>
<p>Passkeys: A Gamechanger</p>
<p>Given the increase in <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/200-million-twitter-users-email-addresses-allegedly-leaked-online/">data breaches</a> that involve <a href="https://cybernews.com/news/largest-compilation-of-emails-and-passwords-leaked-free/">email addresses, passwords</a>, profile, and contact information that are being sold on the dark web recently, attackers are orchestrating multiple account takeover (ATO) attacks such as social engineering, credential stuffing, brute force, password spray, phishing and spear phishing, and MFA fatigue/prompt bombing, among others. Users are increasingly facing ATO threats from multiple attack campaigns on multiple applications or services that they access daily.</p>
<p>With passkeys, connecting to the user’s authentication device (mobile device) over Bluetooth requires physical proximity, which means that we now have a phishing-resistant/remote attack resistant way to leverage the user’s phone during authentication to protect against remote-based attacks. Having the capability to support passkeys natively in all platforms helps with large-scale adoption and users finally moving toward a secure passwordless future. In addition, incorporating biometrics allows for increased security as well as a more seamless authentication experience for users when logging in to an application.</p>
<p>In addition, every application generates a unique key pair – eliminating duplication or reuse that we see quite often with password fatigue – making this a highly scalable and secure passwordless solution.</p>

<p>I’ve talked before about how having a strong organisation identity can create significant value, and we’ve seen plenty of use cases where that value is unlocked. At Ubisecure we delivered such a <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Katso-Case-Study.pdf" title="use case">use case</a> over a decade ago that reduced costs for the Tax Office in Finland by 99%. Despite an arguably limited adoption in other jurisdictions, I think we are now at a point where the importance of organisation identity is finally receiving the mainstream recognition it deserves.</p>
<p>In this blog we’ll recap on organisation identity, explore the similarities and differences between organisation and individual identity, and examine the emerging value enablers that are rapidly transforming this field.</p>
 What is digital identity? 
<p>Before delving into organisation identity, let’s just consider digital identity in a broader context. A digital identity is either directly or indirectly a statement about an entity. This statement may include claims or assertions related to the entity, such as their name or age. The reliability and trustworthiness of these claims depends on how the identity was created and validated. Some identities may have low assurance, making their claims untrustworthy, while others may have high assurance, ensuring that their claims are beyond any doubt.</p>
<p>As individuals, we are accustomed to various methods of expressing our online identity, ranging from low assurance claims made via social media to potentially high assurance government or bank-issued identity documents.</p>
<p>Organisation identity parallels individual identity when it comes to assurance, with both low and high assurance forms existing. For instance, low assurance organisations include family units and social clubs, while high assurance organisations include legal entities and government offices</p>
<p>The assurance of an identity is very important when we look to rely on the presentation of such identity to undertake transactions. Higher assurance will reduce transaction risk enabling higher value transactions to occur based on the presented identity.</p>
<p>We are very familiar with this from an individual identity point of view, but the same also holds for organisation identity, although we as individuals tend to be more trusting of organisations than of individuals.</p>
<p>It’s a common example that I use, but consider the last transaction you made, it was most likely individual (you) to organisation (the other), maybe an Amazon order, or a Tesco delivery. You would have been well identified in that transaction, the organisation almost certainly less so.</p>
 Individual Identity vs Organisation Identity: Demonstrating Legal Intent 
<p>There are similarities between these two identity types, but what are the differences?</p>
<p>It’s easy to suggest that the ability to authenticate is the primary difference between individual and organisation identity, I would argue that is not the case. Authentication serves as a mechanism to demonstrate that you are interacting with the same entity. We can think of username and password/passwordless plus MFA plus some sort of biometric lock as mechanisms to demonstrate to a strong level that we are the same entity. In the modern world, this often comes down to the ability to unlock a mobile device, after which most of the process is automated through services like password managers, MFA apps on same device, and secondary biometric checks like Touch-ID. Ultimately as an individual you are technically proving control of a key (or maybe just a password). Organisations have been doing this for years through purely technical means.</p>
<p>Organisations can sign documents using technology such as Org Validated x.509 Certs or eSeals or participate in private API networks using PKI based authentication.</p>
<p>The main difference, and I think the drag on adoption, is the matter of legal intent. In the majority of jurisdictions only individuals can show legal intent, an organisation cannot. We see this embodied in eIDAS Certificates, eSignature certs for individuals and eSeals for organisations.</p>
<p>This difference means that individuals have remained front and centre in executing business, which effectively breaks the ability to automate.</p>
<p>To deliver true business value, it is essential for organisations to have the capability to automate their participation in transactions, while also ensuring compliance with technical risk controls and other governance requirements.</p>
 Today’s Closed B2B Frameworks 
<p>We do see automation between organisations for high value transactions today, think about B2B supply chain management and just-in-time ordering and inventory supply. This capability is possible due to a pre-defined, tightly coupled, tightly controlled framework between the participants.</p>
<p>Think about the saving measured in Finland for the Tax Office, this was a result of a framework referred to as Katso.</p>
<p>Such established frameworks enabled interaction at the organisation level to automate transactions, but they are all private or closed frameworks, essentially proprietary. Like all proprietary frameworks there are limitations on scale and more importantly interoperability.</p>
<p>Now, imagine if such a B2B framework existed globally that enabled organisations to interact, legal intent defined by the framework itself, automations occurring on the basis of risk management from a standardised, highly assured organisation identity. This is the inflection point we are at today.</p>
 Moving Towards Global Transactional Frameworks 
<p>We already see several points of recognition of the value of highly assured organisation identity – vLEI (verifiable credentials), GAIN and eIDAS2 will all be using LEI. But these are not transactional frameworks, they are identity conduits or containers. The transactional frameworks are emerging separately.</p>
<p>The World Trade Organisation is pushing WTO members to adopt digital trade systems and bring in regulations to enable that automation. Considerable effort has been expended in work on <a href="https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/paperlesstrade2022_e.pdf">Paperless Trade</a> and here the organisation identity is as important as any individual identity.</p>
<p>The UK is implementing regulation to enable <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/paperless-trade-for-uk-businesses-to-boost-growth#:~:text=The%20UK%20is%20a%20world,prevents%20industries%20going%20fully%20paperless.">Paperless Trade</a> internationally and is expected to save £1.14B over 10 years and reduce B2B transaction processing time from a week to 20 seconds.</p>
 Moving towards a True B2B Framework 
<p>While we may be increasingly familiar with B2B IAM, which allows one organisation to delegate administration rights over users to another organisation, this approach does not fully address one key aspect: organisation identity. True B2B IAM must encompass the complete lifecycle management, validation, and mediation of organisation identities. Only by doing so can we create a global, scalable, and interoperable framework that fully unlocks the value of both individual and organisation identity.</p>

<p>Capital is the lifeblood of small-to-medium businesses (SMBs) in the United States, and <a href="https://www.fedsmallbusiness.org/survey">52%</a> aren’t getting their financing needs met. Owners are always short on time, but when they apply for a loan, they’re asked to collect a fragmented pile of financial documents from many different sources. It’s a slow process that can give SMB lenders an incomplete picture of the business’s actual financial health. Qualified small business borrowers can be denied access to capital when their finances are depicted by static documents that don’t tell the full story. &nbsp;</p>



<p>If the limited data that legacy processes offer is all lenders have to base their approvals on, there are going to be many unwarranted denials issued in a marketplace of 31.7 million U.S. small businesses. A simple lack of available information can hamper the opportunity for innovative SMB lending partners to serve more customers and grow their portfolios. Fintechs and forward-thinking lending institutions may explore more profitable segments instead, leaving the small business owner with fewer options to fund operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







<p>Business credit cards remain the <a href="https://www.mastercard.us/en-us/business/large-enterprise/smb-providers/open-banking/empowering-smb-study.html">number one</a> way small business owners secure funding, followed by small business loans. Owners are increasingly embracing the speed and ease of digital solutions, however. Within the last year, <a href="https://www.fedsmallbusiness.org/survey/2022/report-on-employer-firms">3</a><a href="https://www.fedsmallbusiness.org/survey/2022/report-on-employer-firms">4% have applied for a loan</a>, and <a href="https://www.finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking-sme/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwsrWZBhC4ARIsAGGUJuogzB0CHXyIbJfQrfaLuWaNStb9RJhgVC48SNZorRXKB1YAm1nd84waApv5EALw_wcB">80%</a> have started using digital channels for operating capital within the last 2 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Timing is crucial to a small business owner, and next-gen solutions that match the speed of today’s digital economy are a necessity. When a small business owner can leverage open banking to permission the limited use of their data with an app or service, the next-generation lending experience begins. With Mastercard’s connections covering 95% of deposit accounts in the U.S., we can enable more of your SMB customers to permission their business account data through a fast, simple, secure process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 How Mastercard’s Open Banking for Business is expanding access to capital with smarter data&nbsp;&nbsp; 







<p>Building open banking into lending services enables SMB lenders to seamlessly gain insights into business operations in real-time and give the SMB owner a low-friction digital experience. Save them time and give them better access to capital – two priceless assets every small business needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lending to SMBs with the limited data that traditional lending processes offer can be slower, riskier and more expensive. Enabling SMB customers to permission their real-time data can fill in the missing pieces in their financial picture, so lenders can qualify more borrowers and acquire more loans with less risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both lenders and borrowers want a streamlined and accelerated lending process. With open banking data, lenders can cut down on costs and borrowers can get loan terms that are based on their actual financial health, not the limited view that manual processes give. Owners don’t have to collect and send as many documents over non-secure channels or endure extended review periods before receiving a lending decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Market fluctuations, seasonal income swings, equipment failure and a host of other concerns can affect how a small business manages its repayment obligations. With teams dedicated to supporting machine learning and artificial intelligence, Mastercard’s Open Banking for Business leverages these capabilities to analyze, detect and categorize up to 24 months of transactions, balances, cash flow, loan payments and NSF histories, delivering a comprehensive view of a business’s finances and its ability to repay a loan.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is the data that lenders need to acquire more of the small business customers whose complex finances can disqualify them for credit, when their approval is based purely on bureau information and bank statements. Smarter data makes for better lending decisions. It can speed up credit decisioning while enabling accurate, predictive modeling for future payment success, powering new innovations like analytics-enabled business cards with dynamic lines of credit. &nbsp;</p>







<p>With smarter data, risk can be better priced and brought in line with safe modeling, opening up the opportunity to help more small businesses grow and flourish. Data and intelligence work together to complement bureau reports, enabling innovators to identify hidden risk factors and create unique lending products, while giving small business owners truly diverse, inclusive opportunities to access capital with better terms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Open banking can deliver a low-friction, intuitive experience to busy small business owners, driving growth for your SMB lending portfolio. With the advantage of more data through open banking, innovators can create unique lending products and go to market faster. Microfunding for small manufacturers, seasonal capital for restaurants or any other niche can be developed for and served.&nbsp;</p>



 Open banking data makes smarter use cases&nbsp; 



<p>The ability to offer customized underwriting for small businesses is only part of the solution. Mastercard’s Open Banking for business adds the ability to open more accounts, manage services and set up payments more effectively, speeding time to market and ease of integration.&nbsp;</p>



 Business Financial Management&nbsp; 



<p>Small business owners can have numerous accounts across an ecosystem with thousands of banks, fintechs and credit unions, and split between business and personal accounts. <a href="https://www.finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking-sme/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwsrWZBhC4ARIsAGGUJuogzB0CHXyIbJfQrfaLuWaNStb9RJhgVC48SNZorRXKB1YAm1nd84waApv5EALw_wcB">Eighty-five percent</a> of them want a consolidated place to check in on the health of their business. Cleaned, categorized data across accounts enables a real-time view for both owners and SMB service providers, with insights that give a welcome advantage in strategic financial planning.&nbsp;</p>







 Open more accounts, fund them and set up payments with less fraud risk&nbsp; 



<p>With Mastercard open banking technology, grow your portfolio while protecting against fraudsters. SMB owners can permission their data easily and have verified accounts up and running quickly on your platform, limiting exposure to fraud and drop-offs. Verified account and routing numbers reduce cost and manual error, increasing payment success. &nbsp;</p>



 Complete Small Business Solutions, Powered by Mastercard&nbsp; 



<p>The Mastercard open banking platform provides a trusted technology base and best-practice API connectivity that enables innovators to achieve scale, speed and agility while empowering SMBs to benefit from their financial data. Using data, analytics, predictive insights and solutions for SMB use cases, we enable financial service providers to develop profitable business opportunities with low risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Hello, Super Admin. <p>If any of your Google Workspace Super Admin accounts are compromised, it can lead to the loss of your Google Workspace. You know that, right? So you are protecting these accounts with extra care. Aren’t you? And you have at least two accounts with Super Admin Privileges, don’t you? And all your Super Admins have two accounts – a Super Admin account that they use only for managing your Workspace, and a regular account for day-to-day work, right? And the Super Admin accounts don’t have access to any services but the necessary ones, right? And you’re not paying for two accounts for your Super Admins, aren’t you? Because you know about Google Cloud Identify, don’t you?</p>

<p>No? Then welcome to the VMGWU – the Vast Majority of Google Workspace Users.</p>
<p>Google Workspace Super Admin accounts are treated differently than ordinary accounts. They have complete access to everything: managing users, security, billing, access to all data, assigning privileges, including the ability to give other people other Super Admin privileges. Because Super Admin accounts are, well, “super,” it’s easy to fall into a configuration trap where they don’t follow the security policies you set for other accounts; This Can Be Bad(™) because If you are not careful, Super Admin accounts can have weaker security than other accounts.</p>

<p>Thankfully, from the moment you signed up, across the countless settings and internal products, Google guided you unerringly to best security practices. Didn’t they? Didn’t think so.</p>

<p>Ok, let’s get real: If you are a founder, you started by using a Super Admin account, you are still using it and odds are you will be until you finish reading this article. How do I know the odds? Because that’s the default UX!</p>

<p>Here’s how it works. Right after you bought your domain name, you went to set up Google Workspace. You then proved ownership of the domain and gave Google your credit card and Google sent an email to their email address and made them the account admin with Super Admin privileges. Google Workspace is a powerful and complex product and setting it up properly is important to make it secure. That’s why everyone starts by spending two days on the FREE <a href="https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/92">,“Introduction to Google Workspace”</a> course watching the 16 videos and reading the 22 documents then two more days on the FREE <a href="https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/92">,Managing Google Workspace course</a> watching 14 videos and reading 30 documents, and then the FREE “<a href="https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/48">,Google Workspace Security</a>” with 9 more videos and 14 more documents. Congratulations on your first day as CISO!</p>

<p>Haha. Nobody does that. Unless you are the CISO. What pretty much everyone does is what we did: live in blissful ignorance until something bad happens, like a breach of SOC2 compliance. So we went through the obvious steps to set things up and searched the Workspace Docs, checked StackOverflow, and asked ChatGPT when we had a problem. Though, to be fair, we got slightly carried away, obsessed even, and decided to build a company to solve this, and other related problems.</p>

<p>So, because that first account was, by default, a super-admin account, and because of the friction involved in fixing it, it’s most probably the account you’re still using. </p>

<p>Let me save you a few weeks, some money, and help you get back to work.</p>
 Don’t use a super admin account for daily activities <p>Google has a handy checklist <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/9011373">,Security best practices for administrator accounts - Google Workspace Admin Help</a> that everyone who doesn’t do the courses knows about because it’s a needle in the vast haystack of Google Workspace documentation.</p>

<p>The first two bullets are about multi-factor authentication. Now, before you go running to talk to your SSO solutions vendor, you should know one of the ways that Super Admin accounts are treated differently is that they are excluded from <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/6341409?hl=en#:~:text=the%20Admin%20console.-,Google%20does%20not%20redirect%20them%20to%20the%20SSO%20sign%2Din%20page.,-When%20super%20administrators">,third-party security solutions</a>, and that’s a good thing that could’ve been communicated better.</p><p>Ok, so the recommendation is “<a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/9011373#:~:text=Don%E2%80%99t%20use%20a%20super%20admin%20account%20for%20daily%20activities">,Don’t use a super admin account for daily activities</a>.” Why? “<a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/9011373#:~:text=If%20one%20account%20is%20lost%20or%20compromised%2C%20another%20super%20admin%20can%20perform%20critical%20tasks%20while%20the%20other%20account%20is%20recovered.">,If one account is lost or compromised, another super admin can perform critical tasks while the other account is recovered.</a>” That makes perfect sense with everything we know and how targeted Super Admin accounts are! And so does the recommendation above it, “<a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/9011373#:~:text=Set%20up%20multiple%20super%20admin%20accounts">,Set up multiple super admin accounts</a>.” </p>

<p>There are two ways to do this. There’s a pretty-easy-way-that-costs-money,  the complex-way-that-is-free-and-more-secure, and - coming soon - a third way: The YeshID semi-automated way; <a href="https://www.yeshid.com/">,subscribe</a>!</p>
 Pay up <p>The simple way is to create another admin account per admin user:</p> 
   admin-maria@example.com, maria@example.com 
   admin-james@example.com, james@example.com 
 <p>Then you set each “admin-” account as a super admin, login as super admin and remove super admin privileges from your normal account. Done!</p>

<p>If you’re like most small businesses that follow Google’s recommendation you probably have one Super Admin for each of the founders and one <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/2405986">,custom admin</a> for the engineering lead. OK, maybe not custom roles, but more on that another time. It would have cost us only a couple of extra hundred a year and more as the organization grew, plus you need to remember to check those admin email boxes for important messages. Not great.
</p> More secure and free! <p>Because super admin accounts are so valuable, it is best to limit the attack surface as much as possible. I like disabling all services associated with a super admin account, such as Google Drive and email. If we disable all the services, we might as well not pay for the unused services! Here’s how:</p>
<p></p><p>1. Add a Google Identity Free. Go to <a href="https://admin.google.com/">,admin.google.com</a> &gt; Billing &gt; <a href="https://admin.google.com/ac/billing/subscriptions?hl=en">,Subscriptions</a>, and add a “Cloud Identity Free” subscription.</p>
<p>2. <a href="https://support.google.com/cloudidentity/answer/7338389">,Turn off automatic Google Workspace licensing during setup</a>. Go to <a href="https://admin.google.com/">,admin.google.com</a> &gt; Billing &gt; <a href="https://admin.google.com/ac/billing/licensesettings?hl=en">,License settings</a>. Press “Automatic licensing” on the right, and change to OFF.</p><p></p><p>3. <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/172176">,Create a new account and give it super admin access</a>. Make sure it has a strong password and MFA activated.</p> 
   Validate the account is using only Cloud Identity Free license 
 <p></p>
<p>Ok, now you have a super admin account, that is free, and has no services attached to it.</p><p>Super admin accounts get special alerts and notifications. Because this account doesn’t have any, we need to solve it, using routing.</p>
<p></p><p>4. <a href="https://admin.google.com/ac/apps/gmail/defaultrouting?hl=en&amp;pli=1">,Add email routing</a>. Go to Apps &gt; Google Workspace &gt; Gmail &gt; Default routing. From there, intercept emails that would be sent to your free Admin account and redirect them to your user account.</p><p></p><p>That’s it! You now have a free super admin account with no services attached to it and all emails are redirected to your user email.</p>

<p>The neat thing about this technique is it’s great if you have a lot of contractors or other limited accounts that you need to bring on board.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrency is becoming increasingly popular for gambling, and this trend has been growing in recent years. The Coinfirm’s Analytics team decided to analyze transfers from one of the largest US exchanges to gambling companies to better understand the phenomenon. This analysis revealed an impressive surge in cryptocurrency transfers starting in 2021 and peaking in 2022, with the value of these transfers increasing by 11 times compared to 2020. We also sought to assess risky transactions by analyzing an almost 500k Ethereum address associated with gambling and found that 2% were linked to crime and fraud.</p>



<p>The analysis began with examining crypto transfers from one of the top US Crypto exchanges to gambling companies over time. Starting in 2021, there was already a notable increase compared to previous years; however, it wasn’t until 2022 that things took off as the value of these transfers increased significantly—by 11 times! This indicates that cryptocurrency is being used more frequently for gambling activities than ever before. Even though there was still an upward trend after 2022 but at lower dynamics levels, some months saw record highs when it came to transfer values.</p>



Transfers from one of the top<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/cryptocurrency-exchange/"> cryptocurrency exchange </a>to Ethereum addresses associated with gambling entities<p>With further analysis, we wanted to understand how much risk is involved when using cryptocurrency for gambling activities. The Coinfirm Analytics team analyzed almost 500k Ethereum addresses and found that 2% were linked to crime and fraud. This shows that there is some risk involved when using cryptocurrency for gambling, although it is still relatively low compared to the number of legitimate transactions being made each day.</p>



<p>In conclusion, cryptocurrency use in gambling has rapidly increased over the last few years; however, there are still risks associated with using crypto for this purpose. Our analysis revealed that transfers from one of the largest US exchanges to gambling companies have significantly increased since 2021; additionally, our further analysis of around 500k Ethereum addresses showed that 2% were linked to criminal activity or fraud. Overall, cryptocurrency use for gambling is here to stay and will likely continue to grow over time.</p>

<p>Like all humans, coders aren’t perfect. They’re vulnerable, which means the software they create is vulnerable as well. This reality, combined with the persistence and evolving technical skills of threat actors, means that all software, whether it’s proprietary or built using open source libraries, is susceptible to attack.</p>
<p>We are all familiar with the breaches associated with Open Source. Log4j, SolarWinds, Kaseya and other large-scale attacks were at least partially attributed to open source vulnerabilities and were well-covered by industry media and analysts. The ubiquity of open source code certainly contributes to attacks like these. But clearly, as we all know from our own operations, there is most often a great deal of tension between speed and security in the development process. There’s so much pressure on getting software to market quickly —to drive revenue, meet customer expectations or maintain competitive advantage — that basic software hygiene doesn’t receive the time and attention it deserves.</p>
<p>A logical path to explore in the face of open source-related breaches is to resort to proprietary code. But this raises two important questions. First, is proprietary code that much more secure? After all, it’s created by humans, so it’s likely vulnerable to persistent threat actors. Secondly, is moving to proprietary code worth the time and cost tradeoffs?</p>
<p>Based on recent articles and social media conversations, it seems that senior leaders charged with making those kinds of decisions are still siding with open source. While the ubiquity of open source libraries presents security challenges, the answer isn’t to make the leap to proprietary code. In fact, in a Red Hat survey, titled The State of the Enterprise Open Source, 89% of 1300 technology leaders indicated they believe open source software is just as secure or even more secure than proprietary. Unsurprisingly, the survey showed their confidence is based on the availability of time-tested code and the quality and accessibility of security patches.</p>
<p>While there may be a bit of overreaction in the aftermath of a major attack, most software engineering and security leaders still believe in the value of open source. They also believe that a more secure path forward needs to be built on improved human behaviors — beginning with taking time to properly manage vulnerabilities and understanding the rationale for selecting specific elements of open source libraries.</p>
<p>These questions are critical, especially because a common practice among software engineers — who are always under pressure to move things along faster — is to incorporate highly available snippets of code or to include dependencies that have been written, tested and executed many times. And why not? If you’re under pressure to control costs and accelerate timelines, why recreate and test something that is already proven? Of course, this is where criticism of Log4j was centered: The Java-based logging framework that was used is deployed in more than 90% of all cloud environments.</p>
<p>These sorts of time-saving and cost-cutting practices are likely here to stay. But what can change is security leaders’ awareness and process. Dependencies are a great example. One dependency, for example, may not trigger a vulnerability, but that dependency may use another dependency that does. In other words, a coder is adding a vulnerability without knowing it. This is a common practice that is often overlooked in the race to get software to market quickly. One way to address this is to leverage a software bill of materials (SBOM), a list of all the open source and third-party components present in a codebase.</p>
<p>An SBOM provides a comprehensive list of all the open source and third-party components that exist in a particular codebase. It also generally includes the licenses for each component and an accounting of which versions of the components are being used, along with the patch status for each. This allows software security teams to isolate potential security or licensing risks.</p>
<p>The concept of an SBOM originated in the manufacturing world. A great example of its use and its value for software is the automotive industry: As a vehicle is manufactured, a bill of materials (BOM) identifies which parts were manufactured by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) itself and which ones are from third-party suppliers. If a part is determined to be defective, the OEM can quickly determine precisely which vehicles are affected.</p>
<p>For software engineers, SBOMs can provide a solution for an often-overlooked problem. They allow development teams to maintain an accurate accounting of the many dependencies across their open source deployments. Like in the automotive example, if a security vulnerability is discovered, software engineers can search their databases and determines precisely which software products are affected. This allows for a faster plan of action when a patch is needed — or if third-party vendors need to be engaged for their elements of the code.</p>
<p>Of course, using SBOMs doesn’t fix everything — they’re just one piece of a broader strategy. For example, the concept works great when a product is first launched into the field. But over time, products change as updates and patches are deployed. It would be difficult for a software company to issue a new SBOM every time a vulnerability was patched.</p>
<p>According to the Red Hat survey, adopting practices like SBOMs and generally improving software hygiene is going to become more important. Respondents said proprietary code will drop from 45% to 37% across their internal infrastructures and in their products, indicating that larger enterprises will reduce the use of proprietary software in their organizations. At the same time, the use of enterprise open source is expected to increase from 29% to 34% — and community-based open source is projected to jump from 21% to 24%.</p>
<p>So why the jump? Part of it can be attributed to growing confidence in the security of enterprise and community open source. According to an annual Veracode study, 35% of the libraries in enterprise open source applications were afflicted with security vulnerabilities five years ago. The most recent Veracode study shows that number is closer to 10% today. This decrease, it seems, was driven more by human behaviors — and general vulnerability awareness — than any purely technical improvements.</p>
<p>At the 2022 Open Source Software Security Summit II, a conference hosted by the Linux Foundation and the Open Source Software Security Foundation (OpenSSF), the largest cloud service providers (CSPs) and other tech companies have said they are planning to spend approximately $30 million to improve security and mitigate vulnerabilities. The spending commitment was accompanied by a 10-point plan to improve open source security.</p>
<p>One of the key points of that plan focuses on the use of SBOMs to gain visibility into the software that comprises tech stacks. In addition to improving vulnerability detection and remediation, the plan outlines steps to accelerate path response times. Also, the plan outlines the need for security education for people throughout the open source community and the eventual elimination of non-memory safe programming languages, such as C++ and COBOL.</p>
<p>Ultimately, addressing the vulnerability of open source is going to be a group effort. Organizations of all sizes will have to implement a security-first approach to the use of open source code. Our global community of tech firms will likely have to band together to create some baseline standards for minimum security requirements. Government organizations will have to be part of the solution, too, by working with enterprises and the broader open-source community to create testing and certification guidelines — and possibly creating impartial third-party certifying bodies.</p>
<p>Open source will remain an important part of our lives for at least the next several years. The cost, convenience and performance it delivers is simply too compelling. It’s up to us to come together to improve the human behaviors and shared processes that surround it.</p>

         nChain and Unisot in Strategic Partnership to boost Supply Chain Traceability 
<p>London, United Kingdom, 15 February 2023. <a href="https://nchain.com/nchain-and-unisot-in-strategic-partnership-to-boost-supply-chain-traceability/">nChain</a>, a global leader in the creation and delivery of Web3 solutions through Research and Development and the implementation of blockchain technology, today announces the signing of a strategic partnership agreement with UNISOT, a leading Platform as a Service enabling supply chain traceability.</p>
<p>UNISOT’s Web3 Supply Chain Traceability &amp; Sustainability platform allows all actors within the supply chain to be part of the “track and trace” journey, ultimately benefitting the end consumer by providing multiple types of information such as the origin and provenance of the products, the environmental impact of their sourcing, or their quality and safety through a Digital Product Passport.</p>
<p>The solution is perfectly aligned with the new <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/business-economy-euro/doing-business-eu/corporate-sustainability-due-diligence_en">EC Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence</a> (CSDD) regulations including the <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/energy-climate-change-environment/standards-tools-and-labels/products-labelling-rules-and-requirements/sustainable-products/ecodesign-sustainable-products_en">EC Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation</a> (ESPR) and the <a href="https://unisot.com/digital-product-passport/">Digital Product Passport</a> (DPP), proposed and mandated by the European Commission in its aim to create transparency and unlock circularity. According to the EC, most companies will be impacted by these regulations in the next few years, as consumers demand more sustainable and better-informed choices.</p>
<p>nChain’s CEO Christen Ager-Hanssen commented:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Our blockchain technology is revolutionising many areas of everyday life. With UNISOT, we are particularly proud of being able to provide the technology for a solution that allows full transparency of the supply chain as well as 360 global interoperability from the source to the recycling point. The implementation of UNISOT’s unique Web3 solution will become widespread across all products within a few years, and we are delighted to partner with UNISOT from the early stages of their growth journey.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stephan Nilsson, CEO and Co-founder, UNISOT said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;“nChain is the partner of choice for us for several reasons. First and foremost, for their unprecedented expertise, experience, and dedication to R&amp;D around public blockchain technology. This will give us the resources we need to excel and scale up globally as well as have access to the core blockchain technologies that enable us to continue building unmatched enterprise applications with the superior characteristics of the BSV Blockchain, Scalability, Integrity, Availability and Efficiency, and most importantly for its Stability. Enabling us to increase adoption manyfold in a shorter period of time.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>UNISOT’s Web3 platform enables supply chain players of all sizes to participate in the global information flow, from small farmers to multinational giants to consumers. By allowing the monetization of information through nano-transactions, new revenue streams incentivise companies to exchange important information on the global data layer which is the public BSV Blockchain. Furthermore, the BSV Blockchain offers unlimited scalability and already allows for approximately 100,000 transactions per second, making it the most cost and energy-efficient public ledger in the world.</p>
<p>About nChain </p>

<p>In today’s crypto regulatory update, we have some interesting news from around the world. The Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued a consultation paper on crypto assets; Panama approved bill 697 to regulate virtual asset service providers; South Korea is introducing a virtual currency tracking system; the Federal Reserve Board published a policy statement regarding banks under federal supervision; Indonesia postponed its launch of national crypto exchange and finally, the European Union seeks to regulate crypto-related smart contracts. All these events indicate that governments are taking an active interest in regulating cryptocurrencies.</p>



 🇵🇭 The Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued a consultation paper on crypto assets 



<p>The Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued a consultation paper covering all financial products, services and financial service providers under the jurisdiction and bringing into its scope crypto assets: “Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Republic Act No. 11765” (IRR).</p>



<p>The IRR is said to “operationalize the newly signed law that aims to protect the interests of financial consumers by strengthening the country’s financial regulators by providing them with rule-making, surveillance, inspection, market monitoring, and more enforcement powers.”</p>



<p>The proposals mention that:</p>



  under the securities definition, tokenized securities products will be included 



 individuals acting as an investment adviser within the jurisdiction, representing, or identifying themselves as investment advisers must register with the Commission. 



 Financial service providers must establish a Financial Consumer Protection Assistance Mechanism (FCPAM), under which they would offer free assistance regarding financial transaction concerns for financial users to file complaints and make inquiries and requests. 



 enforcement actions to be taken: 



 “the restriction on the ability of the financial service provider to collect excessive or unreasonable interests, fees, or charges; 



 disqualification and/or suspension of directors, trustees, officers, or employees; 



 the imposition of fines, suspension, or penalties; 



 issuance of cease-and-desist orders; 



 suspension of operation; 



 disgorgement.” 
  🇵🇦 Panama approved the bill 697, regulating the Marketing and Use of Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers 



<p>In 2022 Panama approved bill 697, regulating the Marketing and Use of Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers, including other provisions.<br>Under Panama’s President, Laurentino Cortizo, the crypto legislation was sent to the Supreme Court of Justice for revision. This development is an alleged violation of the constitution’s core principles by articles 34 and 36, rendering the bill unenforceable.</p>



<p>The press release mentioned that “the legislative initiative requires “adaptation” to the norms that regulate the financial system and the Panamanian monetary model.”</p>



 🇰🇷 The South Korean Ministry of Justice announced its plans to introduce “Virtual Currency Tracking System” 



<p>The South Korean Ministry of Justice announced its plans to introduce by mid-2023 a “Virtual Currency Tracking System” with the scope of countering money laundering and recovering funds linked to criminal activities.</p>



<p>Its functionalities will include:</p>



  monitoring transaction history, 



 transaction data extraction 



 the<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/source-of-funds/"> source of funds </a>(SOF) checks pre and post remittance 
  🇺🇸 The FRB ( Federal Reserve Board) issued a policy statement regarding all banks under federal supervision. 



<p>The scope is to ensure that both “uninsured and insured banks supervised by the Board will be subject to the same limitations on activities, including novel banking activities, such as crypto-asset-related activities”, thus promoting a “level playing field and limit regulatory arbitrage.”</p>



<p>Australian government issued consultation paper</p>



<p>The Australian government has issued a consultation paper to protect consumers and allow innovation. Feedback is welcome until March 3, 2023.</p>



<p>Main discussion points cover:</p>



  strengthening enforcement; 



 bolstering consumer protection; 



 establishing a framework for reform. 
  🇮🇩 The Indonesian Ministry of Trade postponed the launch of national crypto exchange 



<p>The Indonesian Ministry of Trade had previously announced it would be launching a national crypto exchange by December 2022. However, the deadline has now been moved to June 2023.</p>



<p>The Ministry’s exchange’s scope would be acting as a clearing house and custodian in the local crypto market.<br>Currently, there are five crypto exchange entities registered in the jurisdiction. The Ministry aims to incorporate them within its exchange, and to this end, they are currently under revision to identify if they meet all criteria.</p>



<p>A representative of the Ministry stated, “Let us not rush because if it is not ready, things will get messy. The government does not want this to massively take a toll on the public because people do not know much [about crypto trading].”</p>



 🇪🇺 The European Union seeks to regulate crypto-related smart contracts. 



<p>The European Union seeks to regulate crypto-related smart contracts under its broader strategy on data markets.</p>



<p>The European Parliament has re-drafted regulations on smart contracts amending the following:</p>



  sellers or offerers of smart contracts will not need to perform a conformity assessment nor sign a mandatory declaration that they comply with EU requirements. 



 smart contracts will not need to meet technical compliance specifications 



 the new rules will apply only to the contractual party offering a smart contract, instead of groups of vendors or professionals partaking in the deployment of smart contracts

 What’s your name and where are you&nbsp;from? <p>My name is Mathus Kounde and I am from Benin, Beninese in West Africa. I joined Ontology on May 30th 2020 as a moderator of the French-speaking community. I chose the date because it was my birthday.</p> Tell us a bit about yourself. What did you study? What are your hobbies? Do you have any&nbsp;pets? <p>I have a pet dog, and I studied accounting. To keep myself busy, when I’m not active in the Ontology community, I like to play and watch&nbsp;soccer.</p> If you could have a superpower, what would it&nbsp;be? <p>If I had a superpower I would reduce poverty by creating jobs in&nbsp;Web3.</p> What kind of work do you do on a day-to-day basis? <p>Ontology was my first job in Web3. As part of my job, I learn about Web3 concepts and I try to share my experience with my community. There’s always something new to learn, and it’s a space I’m really interested in, so it’s a lot of&nbsp;fun.</p> In your opinion, what makes Ontology stand out from other blockchains? <p>What fascinates me about Ontology is the fact that it allows us to have a decentralized identity in Web3 in a manner that’s truly unique and practical.</p> What is the most exciting part of the project you’re working on for Ontology? <p>I think that Ontology is bound to continue growing over the next decade or so. It’s a great community full of members who care about the project. Between this and the technology itself, it has the tools to&nbsp;grow.</p> What has been the most important moment in your career so&nbsp;far? <p>What I like about Ontology is the fact that I’m participating in the development of the community and the project. I hope to still be working with Ontology in five years, and I’m looking forward to witnessing further&nbsp;growth.</p> Follow us on social&nbsp;media! <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/meet-the-team-community-moderator-mathus-ginoa-5eb01ae411f7">Meet the Team: Community Moderator, Mathus Ginoa</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>TL;DR</p>  With the growing status of the crypto industry, the risks of fraudulent and malicious activities, too, are rising, which can only be dealt with by precise AML and KYC compliance.  Crypto AML is crucial as it prevents the nascent space from becoming the hotbed of money laundering and terrorist financing.  The global standards for crypto AML/CFT were set by the FATF back in 2019, termed the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule.  <p>Despite the ongoing crypto winter, the virtual assets market commands a market capitalization of more than a trillion US&nbsp;dollars.</p><p>New crypto assets are frequently coming up, projects are getting launched, and blockchain technology is moving forward with new solutions. The latest available data shows that nearly <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">550 crypto exchanges</a> facilitate trade in more than 22,000 unique crypto assets to varying&nbsp;degrees.</p><p>While these are promising signs for new investors, enthusiasts, and developers involved in the market, a threat looms large in the industry. Without addressing that elephant in the room, it is difficult for the industry to live up to its promises to the fullest extent. It is the threat of cybercrime.</p><p>Statistically speaking, fraudulent and malicious players used Decentralized Finance exchanges, cross-chain bridges, and coin swap services to obfuscate illegal crypto criminal proceeds worth more than <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-4b-money-laundering-happened-060013049.html">$4 billion</a>. If left unattended, these malicious actors will only grow in size, becoming a massive threat to the very survivability of the entire industry.</p><p>What’s the solution here? The crypto industry must become resistant to money laundering attacks in the most robust way possible. It is equally crucial that the industry conducts holistic due diligence and gets to know its customers better while offering assured privacy and a smooth experience throughout the process. And only then would cryptocurrencies competently serve the needs they are expected&nbsp;to.</p> The Important Role of Cryptocurrency <p>Cryptocurrencies, with their smart contracts, distributed ledger technology, and more, help make the world of finance more inclusive, equitable, intermediary-free, and accessible.</p><p>Gaining financial freedom through crypto assets requires only a mobile phone and an internet connection. It offers a system that is free of censorship and cost-bearing intermediaries.</p><p>The immutability of transactions recorded on a public ledger makes the system transparent. Crypto projects are also developed mainly on an open-source coding structure for developers worldwide to validate its&nbsp;claim.</p><p>With all these advantages, cryptocurrencies play a crucial role in widening the scope of transaction-based financial services. However, since it is based on a technological paradigm that is evolving consistently, there is always the chance of some fraudulent actors exploiting its gaps to launder&nbsp;money.</p> What are the AML Requirements for Cryptocurrency? <p>For cryptocurrencies, anti-money laundering efforts imply laws, rules, regulations, and policies targeted at preventing criminals from converting illicitly obtained crypto assets into fiat currency. FATF Travel Rule and KYCs are part of the anti-money laundering structure.</p><p>Money launderers may exploit crypto exchanges, as well as custodian services, to fulfill their goal. Therefore, all sorts of cryptocurrency service providers must comply with the AML requirements of their jurisdiction.</p><blockquote>From a user perspective, if Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) strictly comply with AML requirements, the end users will benefit from increased security and better access to financial services through a more legitimate and trustworthy industry.</blockquote> Crypto AML Regulations: Global Approaches <p>The global standards for crypto AML/CFT came in 2019 from the FATF or Financial Action Task Force, an intergovernmental policy-making body that defines and sets the international standards to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing.</p><p>The United States Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the European Commission, and many other regulatory compliance bodies across the world have codified a large chunk of the FATF recommendations, making it essential for VASPs, such as cryptocurrency exchanges, virtual currency businesses, stablecoin issuers, DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and others, to comply with&nbsp;them.</p><blockquote>Although only a few countries have adopted the FATF Travel Rule so far, it is expected that we will see the adoption grow in the coming days with many intergovernmental organizations, such as the G20, taking up crypto regulations for discussions and devising ways for a globally-coordinated approach.</blockquote><p>At that point, no matter where the VASPs are headquartered or have their operations, they will have to begin complying with the FATF Travel Rule, and for that, they will require a FATF Travel Rule Solution like Shyft Veriscope.</p><p>VASPs that use Shyft Veriscope can comply with the Travel Rule without sacrificing the user experience and privacy, as all the user data that VASPs exchange through Shyft Veriscope happens in a peer-to-peer mode. At no point does the user data pass through Shyft’s internal servers. <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-veriscope-the-critical-infrastructure-underpinning-fatf-travel-rule">Click here</a> for more details on how Shyft Veriscope works and helps VASPs comply with the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p> How Does Crypto AML&nbsp;Work? <p>KYC in crypto assets is a combination of three consequent mechanisms: identifying customers with precision, conducting due diligence on customers, and monitoring them regularly.</p><p>In the first step, customer identity verification includes knowing the client’s legal name, date of birth, address, etc. At this stage, VASPs will ask for supporting documents in the form of a driving license, passport, business license, articles of incorporation from enterprise customers, etc.</p><p>The next stage is due diligence, which is carried out to assess how risky the dealings with a specific customer could be. It is similar to traditional banking, where providers assign risk ratings to customers in the crypto&nbsp;space.</p><p>To come up with the rating, which might change from time to time, providers conduct background checks on users and scrutinizes pertinent transaction histories.</p><p>Conducting research into what sort of risks a customer pose is an ongoing process, as VASPs keep reviewing transactions to anticipate and preempt any potentially fraudulent activity.</p><p>Aberrations and suspicious activities are flagged. Service providers must file Suspicious Activity Reports with appropriate law enforcement agencies like the FinCEN and&nbsp;others.</p> Why is Crypto AML Important? <p>AML mechanisms help prevent crypto platforms from becoming a hotbed for money laundering. AML and KYC checks are deemed capable of protecting crypto exchanges from falling prey to malicious actors through customer due diligence and suspicious activity&nbsp;reports.</p><p>Europe’s 6th Anti-Money Laundering Directive has even advocated stricter controls with increased penalties for non-compliance. New technology paradigms are incorporated to make crypto AML more efficient and effective. Such technologies include many advanced methods, such as behavioral analytics and artificial intelligence.</p> What are the Potential Criminal Activities in&nbsp;Crypto? <p>Criminal activities in crypto include a range of scams. Often scamsters exploit the privacy-enhancing properties of a blockchain platform, such as the user staying pseudonymous during transactions, to launder money. According to Federal Trade Commission (FTC) data, in the 14 months to Q1 2022, scamsters had stolen more than $1 billion from 46,000 people in crypto&nbsp;scams.</p><p>Cybercriminals in the crypto world often exploit platforms for ransom. According to Chainanalysis data, ransomware payments amounted to more than $692 million in extorted money during 2020. There are also records of surging incidents pertaining to money laundering through DeFi protocols. The Chainanalysis report mentioned a nearly 2,000% increase in cryptocurrency laundered through such protocols.</p> The current state of crypto regulations <p>In most countries worldwide, including the United States, Canada, Singapore, South Korea, China, India, the United Kingdom, etc., cryptocurrencies are not considered legal&nbsp;tender.</p><p>Although there are some countries that consider cryptocurrency legal and treat it as property, such as Australia, Japan, Switzerland, etc., only El Salvador has recognized a cryptocurrency, Bitcoin specifically, as a legal&nbsp;tender.</p><p>Most countries consider cryptocurrencies an unregulated financial instrument, with their respective Central Banks red-flagging their growing usage for a variety of reasons. For instance, India’s Central Bank chief called crypto “poor gambling” and said CBDC is the “currency of the&nbsp;future.”</p><p>Surprisingly, even Singapore, a country earlier touted as one of the world’s leading crypto hubs, now seems to have double thoughts about its plans. Recently, Singapore MAS Chief said he isn’t keen to regulate cryptocurrencies, as, according to him, that would legitimize them.</p><p>In the world’s biggest economy, the United States, industry proponents believe that the government and the relevant authorities are upping the ante against crypto companies and projects, leaving them with no option but to shut down their shops and move&nbsp;abroad.</p><p>Overall, 2023 is dubbed the “Great Reset” by crypto industry leaders, as we will see major regulatory changes, leaving the VASPs with no options but to accept the regulated reality.</p><p>Amid the upcoming regulatory onslaught, Shyft Network is working with all stakeholders to smoothen the transition for the crypto users, with user experience and privacy intact, as the crypto users and the ecosystem at large are our priority.</p> What is know-your-customer (KYC) for&nbsp;crypto? <p>As discussed already in the context of how crypto AML works, KYC, a component of a provider’s AML compliance efforts, aims to check customer identities to ensure that the transaction is legitimate and legal. It is a procedure of identification/verification, background checks, transaction scrutiny, and transaction monitoring continuously.</p> Why is Crypto KYC Important? <p>At their core, crypto exchanges are the same as traditional financial institutions in the sense that these firms and service providers face the same financial risk as all money service businesses. KYC measures and compliance helps these exchanges safeguard their services from money laundering risks and other financial crime risks, including identity theft, fraud, and much more. <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/what-is-kyc-in-crypto-and-why-do-crypto-exchanges-require-it">Click here</a> for more details on Crypto&nbsp;KYC.</p> AML Compliance Tools for&nbsp;Crypto <p>There are several types of crypto compliance software available in the market. These software solutions provide diverse solutions to exchanges and crypto service providers of other&nbsp;kinds.</p><p>For instance, these solutions ensure continuous smart contract verification as developers keep changing their codes. They also scrutinize smart contract business logic to ascertain potential risk&nbsp;vectors.</p><p>Some solutions help create verifiable human identities on-chain to safeguard privacy, screen crypto wallets for AML/CFT and sanctions risk, help market participants meet FATF travel rule guidelines (Shyft Veriscope), and investigate crypto or digital assets and crypto transactions.</p> Risk of Non-Compliance With Crypto Anti-Money Laundering Regulations <p>Such risks could be many. Non-compliance may lead to crypto assets being used to evade sanctions. Even more concerning is the potential use case for terrorist financing.</p><p>Many countries have already flagged this risk as their primary reason behind being suspicious of crypto assets. After all, many fraudulent actors turn illicit fiat currency into crypto to disguise the origin of their&nbsp;funds.</p><p>At a more functional level, non-compliance for crypto businesses may result in being denied a license to operate, forcing a firm to even shut down its operations or go through significant remediation work to get back on its&nbsp;feet.</p> AML Crypto Regulations in&nbsp;Europe <p>In June 2022, pertinent EU authorities struck a provisional agreement on anti-money laundering rules for cryptocurrencies. It was designed to motivate crypto firms to check their customers’ identities. The crypto firms were also asked to report suspicious transactions to crack down on illicit&nbsp;funds.</p><p>According to one of the lawmakers in the Union, the new rules would help law enforcement officials in linking certain transfers to criminal activities and identify the real person behind criminally fraudulent transactions. The rule makers also proposed overseeing unhosted crypto wallets held by individuals exceeding 1,000&nbsp;Euros.</p> Final Note <p>The crypto industry has many advantages. It widens the scope of our existing financial service delivery mechanisms by making them intermediary-free, inclusive, accessible, and more equitable. Yet, fraudulent actors exploit these emerging-tech protocols to launder&nbsp;money.</p><p>While such cyber breaches, attacks, and intrusions in the system result in losses worth billions of dollars, they reduce the trust of the user and investor community toward the entire crypto ecosystem.</p><p>Anti-Money Laundering laws and regulations help resist these exploits by incorporating a robust check and balance system into the process. It helps keep a consistent track of transactions to preempt fraudulent attacks and mitigate potential losses by acting on them beforehand.</p><p>______________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to begin complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

				<p>Trinsic has launched a new podcast called ‘<a href="https://trinsic.id/podcast/">The Future of Identity’</a>. Hosted by Trinsic’s CEO Riley Hughes, ‘The Future of Identity’ talks to the people building the IDtech products of tomorrow. The purpose of the podcast is to be the go-to resource for IDtech entrepreneurs who are looking for valuable insights regarding how to successfully go-to-market with an identity product. For more info about what you can expect from podcast episodes, how to tune in, or even how to be a guest on the show, read more below.</p>

				<p>Trinsic’s number one motivation is the widespread adoption of decentralized identity. The most important driver of decentralized identity adoption is the creation of amazing IDtech products. People do not adopt technologies, they adopt products that improve their lives.<br><br></p><p>In ‘The Future of Identity’, we showcase those amazing IDtech products and their builders. Within episodes, our guests share invaluable insights into finding product-market-fit, creating great user experiences, and overcoming the obstacles of marketing their product within specific industries. We hope the ‘The Future of Identity’ inspires, educates, and gives community to IDtech product builders around the world.</p>

				<p>In each episode, Riley Hughes has in-depth conversation with people who have built identity products and launched them with real users. Each episode is ~30-45 minutes where Riley digs into tactical questions about onboarding stakeholders into a trust ecosystem, tackling the cold start (or, “chicken and the egg”) problems in those ecosystems, and the unique opportunities for identity products across varied industries like medical, professional credentialing, real estate, and more.<br><br></p><p>Trinsic is infrastructure for IDtech products, but we want to be clear—podcast guests are not always Trinsic customers. We highlight any and all IDtech builders that have created and launched products that put people in control of their identity and data. And while we enjoy talking to anyone and everyone about identity, for this show, we specifically focus on product builders instead of thought leaders or protocol-focused experts.

<p>On February 8, Privacy by Design (PbD) officially became an international privacy standard—but the architecture you use to operationalize its principles may matter as much as the standard itself.</p>
<p>To be sure, reports that the International Organization of Standardization (ISO) would adopt PbD as a standard as <a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=5907ff01-d9e8-4563-888f-c6828ec3d699">ISO 31700</a> was, as the kids like to say, kind of a big deal.</p>
<p>PbD calls for privacy protection to be engineered into the development of products, services, and system designs from the ground up—instead of after the fact. This includes websites, mobile apps, and software used to make an online purchase, open or access a bank account, arrange or coordinate healthcare, access government services, and countless other facets of everyday life.</p>
<p>First unveiled in 2009, <a href="https://www.ipc.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/resources/7foundationalprinciples.pdf">Privacy by Design</a> has been adopted by the International Assembly of Privacy Commissioners and Data Protection Authorities and incorporated in the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). But adoption by the ISO marks a significant new milestone.</p>
<p>This network of <a href="https://www.iso.org/about-us.html">167 national standards bodies</a> sets nearly 25,000 different standards covering almost all aspects of technology—including ISO 27001 for information security management systems. Some of these standards are sufficiently critical that organizations can be certified for compliance with them after passing a review from PwC, Deloitte, and other major audit firms.</p>
<p>But to be successful, organizations looking to implement ISO 31700 are going to have to think about the bigger picture.</p>
 Privacy by Design: 14 Going on 30 
<p>To understand why, let’s start with the basics. Privacy by Design isn’t a list of technological components. It’s a set of <a href="https://medium.com/searchencrypt/7-principles-of-privacy-by-design-8a0f16d1f9ce">seven core principles</a>. Chief among them is that data compromise isn’t something you respond to—it’s something you prevent.</p>
<p>With that in mind, maximum privacy should be your default setting, not an afterthought. And you should collect only the absolute minimum amount of personally identifiable information PII and other data as necessary; use it only for the purposes the user has expressly approved, and keep it only as long as needed for those purposes.</p>
<p>In short: Forget the false tradeoff between security and ease of use. PbD is predicated on the notion that the onus shouldn’t be on consumers to protect their identity and other personal data when buying or accessing a product or service. Instead, privacy should be as foundational to UX as friction-free functionality.</p>
<p>ISO 31700 goes even further. Leveraging PbD’s 14-year-old principles as a foundation, it outlines a more detailed set of 30 requirements. As <a href="https://www.isonews.net/post/privacy-by-design-to-become-an-iso-standard-next-month">ISONews.Net</a> reports, these include guidance on enabling consumers to control and enforce their privacy rights, lifecycle data management, corporate governance, avoiding or mitigating a data breach—and more.</p>
<p>Translating these guidelines into the design of each new consumer-facing site, product, app, and service across the enterprise will be challenging. Without the right architecture, it’s likely to be impossible.</p>
 An Architecture Built for (And With) PbD 
<p>The 30 requirements of<a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/84977.html"> ISO 31700</a> necessitate an architectural backbone capable of supporting and managing countless moving parts across all products, services, channels, and more—all the time.</p>
<p>An architecture that’s able to facilitate fast, convenient, and fully-authenticated consumer interactions and transactions—without requiring personal data to be stored on servers where it can be hacked and either ransomed or used to commit fraud. One that no longer even requires passwords—leveraging <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/next-generation-multi-factor-authentication/?utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Digi-mfa-sl-Ext&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw8JKbBhBYEiwAs3sxNyMKKDUvP5kit_UP4XbwzmqYa5SZLqdolxffbwblB9hNwZ2hzC6VihoCYMMQAvD_BwE">biometrics and liveness tests</a> that defeat virtually any attempt at identity spoofing.</p>
<p>Using our <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/customer/">BlockID platform</a> as an example, our entire architecture is based on, and amplifies, the principles of Privacy by Design, giving each user full control of his identity and personal data—how it’s used, how it’s stored, and for how long. Beyond avoiding data theft, this enables users to authenticate their identity without sharing information that might lead to decisioning bias or false matches based on incomplete, out-of-date, or incorrect information stored in other systems.</p>
<p>Obviously, any architecture designed for PbD is only as good as its ability to keep the wrong people from infiltrating corporate systems and accounts. That’s why our platform is also <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST-</a>, <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/cybersecurity/2022/01/white-house-sees-chance-to-design-new-user-experiences-through-zero-trust-strategy/">FIDO2-</a>, and <a href="https://www.ibeta.com/">iBeta biometrics-</a>certified to ensure the authenticity of each user in real time.</p>
 Going From Zero-Sum to Win-Win 
<p>The need for Privacy by Design and other security standards couldn’t be clearer. Over the past year, traditional forms of multifactor authentication (MFA) proved unable to prevent a record number of <a href="https://www.usnews.com/360-reviews/privacy/recent-data-breaches">data breaches</a> and more than <a href="https://www.paymentsjournal.com/19th-identity-fraud-study-shows-52-billion-in-losses-42-million-americans-affected/">$52 billion in direct financial losses</a> just the US. Thanks to <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2022/06/15/24-billion-stolen-breached-usernames-passwords-found-dark-web/">24 billion recently stolen login credentials</a> available on the dark web, prospects for 2023 aren’t promising.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing. Those who argue that fending off such threats requires a tradeoff with user experience are blind to the groundswell behind movements like Privacy by Design and now ISO 31700. Organizations that work toward meeting this new standard aren’t doing it merely to meet performance objectives or comply with regulatory mandates. It’s becoming a competitive differentiator.</p>
<p>According to a recent survey from <a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2022/11/17/marketers-must-be-proactive-data-privacy-maintain-customer-trust">Google and Ipsos</a>, a negative privacy experience involving a data breach can erode brand trust by as much as 44%. By comparison, businesses providing a positive privacy experience can increase brand preference by 43%. And 71% of consumers prefer to buy from brands that are honest about what data they collect and why. With consumer sentiment like that, don’t be surprised if ISO 31700 and its Privacy by Design end up paying dividends.</p>

<p>In the new Crypto Regulatory Update, we will explore some of the recent news in the crypto space, including Hong Kong’s stablecoin regulation plans, Hainan province’s increased oversight on non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Kazakhstan’s proposed enhancements to its crypto-trading framework, and Sberbank’s upcoming DeFi platform launch.</p>



 🇭🇰 Hong Kong – Stablecoins regulation. 



<p>In January 2022, the HKMA issued a consultation paper on crypto assets and stablecoins and one year later, in January 2023, released its conclusion based on the provided feedback.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Respondents were mostly in favor of HKMA’s proposal to regulate stablecoins which “have the potential to develop into a widely acceptable means of payments”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The regulatory regime will include the following:&nbsp;</p>



<p>– Stablecoins backed by fiat currencies will be regulated given their possible impact on the stability of the financial system</p>



<p>– Stablecoin-related activities to be regulated are: governance, issuance, stabilization and provision of wallets</p>



<p>– Entities that are active in Hong Kong will fall under the regulation’s spectrum:&nbsp;</p>



  “Entities that conduct a regulated activity in Hong Kong;&nbsp; 



 actively market a regulated activity to the public of Hong Kong;&nbsp; 



 conduct a regulated activity which concerns a stablecoin that purports to reference to the value of the Hong Kong dollar;&nbsp; 



 the authority is of the opinion that should be so regulated, having regard to matters of significant public interest.” 
 <p>The Conclusions of the consultation paper which will be included in the upcoming framework (to be adopted by 2024) can be accessed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hkma.gov.hk/media/eng/doc/key-information/press-release/2023/20230131e9a1.pdf">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 🇨🇳 Hainan province to increase oversight on NFTs. 



<p>The Chinese Hainan province&nbsp;<a href="https://amr.hainan.gov.cn/zw/tztg/202301/t20230129_3351790.html">announced</a>&nbsp;that it seeks to improve oversight of the NFT space, to promote a healthy development, given the rise of NFT-related fraud, copyright infringement, misleading information and money laundering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The promotion of NFTs as part of the digital economy would also seem lucrative to attract foreign investment in the Hainan Free Trade Port.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Primarily, the authority seeks to educate the public on emerging NFT-related risks and legislation and target false propaganda which leads to copyright infringement and fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chinese authorities are asked to review the crypto ban.</p>



<p>China currently is not in favor of its nationals to transact in crypto coins for fear of money laundering. A former adviser to the Central Bank of China, Huang Yiping, however, commented on the jurisdiction’s inflexibility on cryptocurrencies, remarking that it would be detrimental to the economy in the long run.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to be in line with the international financial developments a regulatory regime for cryptoassets must be first developed within the jurisdiction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Huang Yiping mentioned that “[t]here is no particularly good way to ensure stability and function as to how cryptocurrencies should be regulated, especially for a developing country, but ultimately an effective approach may still need to be found”.</p>

 🇰🇿 Kazakhstan’s AFSA proposed enhancements to its crypto-trading framework 



<p>In a recently published consultation paper, Kazakhstan’s AFSA (Astana Financial Services Authority) proposed enhancements to its crypto-trading framework.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This development was sought out due to “contradictions, inefficient provisions and uncertain definitions within the regime”. The regulator seeks to create a favorable environment for crypto exchanges and to encourage innovation.</p>



<p>The highlights are as follows:&nbsp;</p>



  address contradictions and unclear provisions of the existing framework 



 risk mitigation measures regarding governance, illicit activity, safekeeping of clients’ funds and settlement 



 develop a standalone DATF framework 



 treat crypto exchanges as a multilateral trading facility 
 <p>Feedback is accepted until February 25.&nbsp;</p>

 🇷🇺 Sberbank to launch DeFi platform by May 2023 



<p>Late 2022, Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the Russian State Duma committee on Russia’s financial markets, announced the adoption by February 2023, of a bill allowing cross-border transactions with cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given the sanctions that have been imposed throughout 2022 against Russian financial entities, in the interview, Aksakov was asked if there are “[…]&nbsp;any risks that as soon as such transactions with crypto are legalized, they will immediately try to limit their conduct through sanctions?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.russia-briefing.com/news/russia-poised-to-open-cryptocurrency-exchanges-from-q2-2023.html/#:~:text=Russia's%20State%20Duma%20is%20set,2023%20it%20will%20become%20operational">transcript</a>&nbsp;of his reply is as follows:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There are risks, and sanctions will certainly be imposed, but the digital market is more difficult to crush with sanctions. It is designed in such a way that if restrictions are introduced in one place, other options for economic interaction quickly appear. The miners and cryptocurrency experts I spoke with say that it is impossible to seriously influence such transactions.”</p>



<p>In view of these legislative developments, Sberbank, a sanctioned state-owned Russian bank, announced the launch of a decentralized finance platform by May 2023, its open testing commencing in March.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Konstantin Klimenko, Product Director of the<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/blockchain/"> blockchain </a>laboratory of Sberbank, stated that “[a]t the end of April, the platform will be fully open, and then it will be possible to carry out some commercial operations on it”.</p>



<p>The platform will be compatible with the Ethereum blockchain and will be available to users of MetaMask crypto wallets, allowing them to transfer various crypto assets from other platforms.&nbsp;</p>

				  Interoperable, open-source verifiable credential technology simplifies KYC and enables seamless, secure financial transactions for anything from anywhere with anyone, delivering the privacy and security needed for open banking to flourish.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>Verifiable credential technology solves a fundamental problem in digital banking, fintech, and payments: how can you reliably know your customer is your customer (and from the customer’s perspective, that their bank or financial app is their bank or financial app)?</p>
<p>Issuing a verifiable credential to a customer, if they already have an account or when they create an account and have gone through identity assurance, means that both the bank and the customer have a cryptographically secure, peer-to-peer way to connect to each other and verify who is who.</p>
<p>Practically, this means the beginning of the end for logins and passwords to access your account. You just swipe and share the credential that your bank has issued to you, and the authenticity and ownership is confirmed by the bank checking the metadata and cryptographic signatures on a distributed ledger network. No personal data is needed to confirm you are authorized to access your account.</p>
<p>But the underlying communications protocol does much more than enable password replacement online: DIDComm (<a href="https://indicio.tech/what-is-didcomm-with-pictures/">Decentralized Identifier Communications</a>) can enable verification across different modes of communication. For example, your bank could push a message to your phone asking whether it is really you who is talking to their employee at the bank at this moment, and that message would come through the direct, you-to-bank channel you have previously created.</p>
<p>This simplicity becomes enormously powerful when it comes to payments as other organizations can quickly verify the authenticity of you as the genuine holder of a specific bank account. The verifiable credential is biometrically bound to your device, and it can only be held in your secure digital wallet (it can’t be sent to someone else to use). And, once again, you verify your identity through a uniquely encrypted, peer-to-peer communications channel with each business or organization you are interacting with.</p>
<p>This is just the start of your journey into frictionless, verified payment. Add a bank-issued credential for your credit card, and you can directly share the details with a vendor without having to type them in, thereby eliminating the risk of error. Similarly, direct deposit can be managed through a credential—one you could share with your employer. No worries that your paycheck isn’t hitting your bank account; instead, instant verification and seamless authorization with the capacity to double check that you are the person the organization is interacting with.</p>
<p>Verifiable credential technology is a foundation for authentic digital relationships. With all the benefits of simplicity and speed comes the capacity to know who you are interacting with on a one-to-one basis and the ability to build a meaningful digital relationship through the&nbsp; trust that comes with seamless verification..</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials will transform KYC<br>So far, we’ve just talked about what a basic bank credential identifying an account holder can do for you, the bank customer. It’s important to understand how these benefits help your bank or a financial institution meet its regulatory obligations.</p>
<p>Governments and international law require banks and financial institutions to “know who their customers or clients are” to prevent financial crime, money laundering, and the funding of terrorism. This process, abbreviated to “KYC” (know your customer/client), includes establishing proof of identity and address, along with additional information depending on your relationship to a business and its bank account, risk assessment, and periodic checks.</p>
<p>The higher the financial risk, the more important (and expensive) KYC is. There is no way around the effort required to ensure that your customer is trustworthy enough to be your customer; but a verifiable credential that records this information and enables this information to be shared in a privacy-preserving, tamper-proof way means that expensive KYC can be reused.</p>
<p>Now think about what this means for the multiplicity of financial transactions that require a much higher level of financial approval than creating a basic bank account. Mortgage? Swipe and share the financial information required by your broker from your KYC credential. If the mortgage broker trusts your bank, then they can trust that the information in the credential you hold is authentic, comes from your bank, and hasn’t been altered. This speeds up everything for the customer, removes unnecessary waiting for and duplication of financial documents and their verification, and reduces business costs. Everyone is happier.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials will accelerate open banking<br>But the ability to share more complex financial data in a verifiable way helps propel a wide range of services and products that fall under the category of open banking. Open banking means that financial institutions and third-party fintech providers can share and use customer financial data with the customer’s consent. This has led to the creation of financial apps and services for both consumers and businesses and opens the way for new sectors—like utilities— to offer financial services.</p>
<p>The category of Personal Financial Management includes apps that analyze a person or family’s financial expenditures, bills, and help them execute financial planning or improve their credit scores. Importantly, these apps help with financial inclusion because they can create better ways for people to budget and save and, crucially, avoid high-debt borrowing.</p>
<p>Apps for small-to-medium sized businesses enable financial institutions to provide a range of financial management services from accounting to expenses and time-sheet management. Payment initiation providers can bypass credit and debit card payments and, with permission, initiate payments to and from bank accounts. And small businesses can get much better financial planning and support from being able to share more granular financial data.</p>
<p>The sticking point with open banking? Both <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/financial-services/open-banking-model-strategy-united-states.html">Deloitte</a> in the US and <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/researchstore/fintech-payments/open-banking-market-research-report">Juniper Research</a> in the UK have identified privacy and security as the biggest obstacles to its adoption. And rightly so, there is an enormous amount of valuable information at risk.</p>
<p>These concerns are precisely those that verifiable credentials can solve by enabling the creation of authentic digital relationships. By using verifiable credentials over DIDComm, you can eliminate the risk from point-to-point integrations and centralized information exchanges.</p>
<p>You can improve the functionality of APIs by replacing webhooks with DIDComm, meaning that information can be extracted from an API in a way that can only be decrypted by the intended recipient. We’ll be publishing a more detailed technical article on this, but for now the upshot is that an API plus DIDCom will enable authorized money transfer between accounts and third parties.</p>
<p>For retailers, the headache of chargeback fraud can be solved with an “intent-to-buy” credential or function—a proof that, yes, I authorize this purchase.</p>
<p>And finally, there is the inescapable logic of what happens when banks, financial institutions, third-party fintech providers and businesses and organizations can all rely on verifiable credentials for customer authentication and payment: verifiable credentials will be able to transfer value, not as tokens or equities, but as alternatives to debit and credit cards.</p>
<p>The scope of digital transformation through open-source verifiable credential technology in banking, finance, fintech, and payments is enormous, the implementation, surprisingly easy. Verifiable credentials can be layered on top of existing identity access management systems, and they can orchestrate multiple systems as if they were one. Indicio has developed the automated governance software — DeGov — to make even the most complex information flows work seamlessly for consumers.</p>

<p>NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO UNITED STATES NEWSWIRE SERVICES OR FOR DISSEMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES</p>



<p>Toronto, Canada —&nbsp;February 15, 2023 — <a href="https://liquidavatartechnologies.com/">Liquid Avatar Technologies Inc.&nbsp;</a>(CSE: LQID /&nbsp;OTCQB:LQAVF&nbsp;/ FRA:4T5), (“Liquid Avatar” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce a best efforts, non-brokered private placement of units of the Company&nbsp; (the “Units”) at price of $0.03 per Unit (the “Offering Price”) for gross proceeds of up to $1,000,000 (the “Offering”).</p>



<p>Each Unit will be comprised of one common share of the Company (a “Common Share”) and one Common Share purchase warrant (a “Warrant”).&nbsp; Each Warrant shall be exercisable to acquire one Common Share (a “Warrant Share”) at price of $0.05 per Warrant Share, for a period of 24 months from the closing of the Offering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Company intends to use the proceeds raised under the Offering for working capital and general corporate purposes. The Offering is expected to close on or about February 28, 2023 or on such date at the sole discretion of the Company, and is subject to certain conditions including, but not limited to, the receipt of all necessary approvals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The securities to be issued under the Offering will be offered by way of a private placement in each of the provinces of Canada, and such other jurisdictions as may be determined by the Company, in each case, pursuant to applicable exemptions from the prospectus requirements under applicable securities laws. The Units to be issued under the Offering under Canadian securities laws will have a hold period of four months and one day from Closing.</p>



<p>In connection with the Offering, the Company may pay a finder’s fee in respect of subscribers introduced to the Corporation by an eligible finder of cash up to 8% of the value of the Units subscribed for and options to acquire the number of Units (“Compensation Options”) equal to up to 8% of the number of Units subscribed for, which will be exercisable to acquire one Unit at price of $0.03 per Unit, for a period of 24 months from the closing of the Offering.</p>



<p>Insiders of the Company may participate in the Offering. Pursuant to Multilateral Instrument 61-101 Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (“MI 61-101”), the Offering constitutes a “related party transaction” to the extent that insiders of the Company subscribe for Units. The Company is, to the extent insiders participate, relying on exemptions from the formal valuation and minority approval requirements of MI 61-101, specifically: (i) the valuation requirement of MI 61-101 by virtue of the exemption contained in Section 5.5(b), as the Common Shares are not listed on a market specified in MI 61-101, and (ii) the minority shareholder approval requirement of MI 61-101 by virtue of the exemption contained in Section 5.7(1)(a) of MI 61-101, as the fair market value of all the Units that may be issued to related parties (including the value of any Warrants) will not exceed 25% of the Company’s market capitalization (as determined under MI 61-101). A material change report is not expected to be filed by the Company at least 21 days before the closing of the Offering, as the Company is seeking to close the Offering as soon as possible. In the view of the Company, this approach is reasonable in the circumstances.</p>



<p>The Company may, at its sole discretion, increase the size of the Offering to $2.0 million.</p>



<p>The securities described herein have not been, and will not be, registered under the United States securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “U.S. Securities Act”), or any state securities laws, and accordingly, may not be offered or sold within the United States except in compliance with the registration requirements of the US. Securities Act and applicable state securities requirements or pursuant to exemptions therefrom.&nbsp; This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation to buy any securities in any jurisdiction. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Beyond Blockchain: How Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)&nbsp;Work</p><p>It’s a common misconception that decentralized identifiers (DIDs) always rely on blockchain technology. While it’s true that DIDs are often grouped into the category of web3 technologies that can use blockchain, they don’t necessarily need to. In fact, there are several different types of DIDs that don’t use blockchain at&nbsp;all.</p> Three General Types of&nbsp;DIDs <p>Decentralized identifiers can be boiled down to three general&nbsp;types:</p>  Ephemeral  Web-based  Blockchain   Ephemeral DIDs <p>Ephemeral DIDs such as did:key and did:jwk are essentially public keys for private keys held by the DID controller. However, the keys cannot be rotated and are best suited for short-term use cases like IoT or debugging, rather than long-term identification.</p> Web-based DIDs <p>Web-based DIDs, like did:web, offer a more flexible option. They build on the existing root of trust provided by domain names, allowing the DID controller to easily prove their identity. DID:web also allows for the addition of multiple keys for rotation. However, it does not maintain a record of different states or have a good way of showing when an identifier has been deactivated.</p> Blockchain-based DIDs <p>Blockchain-based DIDs, like Sidetree, offer the ability to create, update, resolve, and deactivate identifiers through anchoring transactions on a ledger. This provides transparency, redundancy, and a record of all transactions available to anyone with access to the ledger. Sidetree can be implemented on both public and private blockchains, such as the did:ion and did:elem methods on public blockchains and the did:photon method on Amazon’s QLDB private&nbsp;ledger.</p><p>There are also decentralized identifier methods based on DNS, like&nbsp;did:dns.</p><p>In conclusion, while DIDs can certainly benefit from using blockchain technology, it’s not the only option. Other methods, such as web, DNS, or using the identifier directly, can also provide the necessary public key infrastructure for decentralized identification.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@benjamincoll875">Benjamin Collins</a>, Transmute’s Technical Product Owner, spent 10 years working with Linux and Open Source as the creator of DashGL.com, a site which provides tutorials for writing simple games for Linux in C using OpenGL and the GTK&nbsp;toolkit.</p><p>Connect with Ben on <a href="https://twitter.com/kion_dgl">Twitter</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/BenjaminMoe">GitHub</a></p><p>About<a href="https://transmute.industries/"> Transmute</a>: Building on the security and freedom that Web3 promised, Transmute provides all the benefits of decentralization to enterprise teams seeking a cost effective, interoperable, planet-forward experience provided by experts in technology and industry.</p><p>Transmute was founded in 2017, graduated from TechStars Austin in 2018, and is based in sunny Austin, Texas.

<p>The enterprise world has firmly embraced the desire to move to Zero Trust. Actual implementation, however, is another matter.</p>
<p>Most organizations with remote workers, BYOD environments and cloud-based assets see the value of Zero Trust. And why not? Continuous protection of high-value assets, the ability to make employees productive wherever they choose to work, seamless integration with business partners, and the power of real-time customer connectivity are all core to modern business growth. Zero Trust makes it possible to do all of this and confidently pursue digital growth strategies.</p>
<p>But while some surveys show that 96% of companies are onboard with pursuing Zero Trust, a study by CRA Business Intelligence shows that only about 25% of those enterprises have successful frameworks in place. About 30% of those surveyed are stuck in the planning phase and another 35% are floundering in the consideration phase. These are not great adoption rates for a widely revered security concept that’s been in the market for nearly a decade.</p>
<p>It seems the biggest roadblock for most organizations is the enormity of the status quo. Organizations have employees and contractors working in offices, coffee shops, kitchen tables, customer sites, and airports around the world. Engineers, coders, salespeople, accountants and other professionals have changing workloads — and someone is always being promoted, transferred, shared or fired. Which means “what they need to do their jobs” can change from day to day. There’s also the issue of digital sprawl, as companies have built not-so-well-planned infrastructures with terabytes of sensitive data and hundreds — or thousands — of apps strewn across multiple clouds.</p>
<p>In other words, Zero Trust is the right desired state for growth-minded enterprises, but day-to-day realities make it tough to implement, despite the intentions of the many dedicated internal champions trying to drive it forward. This is where the concept of Entitlement Management can provide enterprises with the visibility, control, and automation they need to make Zero Trust a reality.</p>
 Quick definition of Entitlement Management 
<p>Building and maintaining an effective Zero Trust framework clearly requires some way of automating approved access to data, apps, collaboration tools, and other digital assets. In addition to initial access, those privileges must be continually managed, as people change roles, get new assignments, quit or get fired. Authorized users need to be given the right access at the right time to ensure productivity — without exposing the enterprise to cyberattacks or other risks. These requirements become considerably more complicated when including authorized users from outside organizations. Even though you may not know precisely who in the other organization needs access and those users in outside organizations may not be certain which applications, groups, or sites your organization utilizes, they must be accounted for in an effective Zero Trust framework.</p>
<p>Entitlement Management is an identity governance approach that enables organizations to accomplish all of this at scale. The right technology-enabled policies can automate critical steps, such as self-service requests, security reviews, expiration and, of course, access to specific data, work groups and apps. Entitlement Management can also be used to manage software licensing rights and ensure that enterprises don’t break the terms of licensing agreements. For example, if an enterprise agrees to pay for a specific number of seats, it needs to make sure that only users who have been given access use the software — and when users no longer need to access the software, their privileges are shut down.</p>
<p>Since most enterprises are moving to a cloud-first approach to everything from engineering to sales to customer service, an optimal approach to this entitlement is Cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM), a solution that leverages analytics, machine learning (ML) and other methods to detect and remediate anomalies in account entitlements, such as unnecessary accumulation of privileges, dormant privileges.</p>
<p>CIEM capabilities are increasingly important, because a 2022 study by Gartner predicts that by 2024 organizations running cloud infrastructure services will suffer a minimum of 2,300 violations of least privilege policies, per account, per year. A good CIEM solution will mitigate these risks and enforce least-privilege principles via continuous privilege right-sizing. This will provide the organization with centralized visibility into existing entitlements, tools for analyzing granted vs. used privileges and ongoing recommendations for optimizing and right-sizing privileges across all user populations.</p>
 Key Benefits of Entitlement Management 
<p>Gain granular visibility across a multi-cloud infrastructure</p>
<p>Most enterprises have built cloud-first infrastructures that allow for remote work, customer and business partner connectivity and on-demand scalability. But with all of this digital agility comes increased risk. As risk expands, enterprise security teams need technologies to provide visibility and control across multi-cloud environments. Modern Entitlement Management solutions provide granular visibility and offer precise, automated control of permissions and user activity within those environments.</p>
<p>Create consistent and centralized security-based policies</p>
<p>The somewhat haphazard collection of cloud services that has been built up in most enterprises creates a considerable challenge for security teams. In most cases, each cloud or app provider has a its own set of policies, which leads to inconsistent security and increased risk. Manually identifying and addressing these security gaps is simply overwhelming for security teams. Even if an enterprise chooses to take a manual approach, it’s bound to fail due to lack of bandwidth and budget.&nbsp;Entitlement Management solutions typically offer automated tools needed to resolve this dilemma. Using these solutions allows security teams to consistently apply best practice security policies and enforce least privilege access across even the most diverse multi-cloud infrastructures.</p>
<p>Automated detection and deactivation of over-provisioned users</p>
<p>Migrating workloads to the cloud can be an overwhelming experience for engineering and DevOps teams. To simplify the task, most of them will apply broader permissions than necessary. They do this to save time, which means they don’t typically provision individual resources based on specific job requirements. For most organizations, this leads to excessive permissions and extraneous entitlements that increase both risk and cost.&nbsp;Entitlement management solutions close this gap by identifying over-provisioning and deactivating unnecessary access.</p>
 Take a Phased Approach and Start with Identity 
<p>There’s enough evidence to prove that pursuing Zero Trust is a worthwhile endeavor, especially for digital-first enterprises. But the thing to remember is that building an effective framework typically takes two to three years and requires a phased approach that begins with identity and then moves to workloads, devices, networks, and data. Deploying an effective Entitlement Management solution needs to be a core part of the first phase. Making it part of your foundation is a good first step towards achieving a truly effective Zero Trust framework.</p>

				 <p>At the Trust Over IP Foundation we have been using the term “Trust Registry” heavily lately. An early protocol specification (TR protocol specification) was even created. However, the term “Governance Registry” came up in some discussions. It may help remove some of the confusion.</p>
<p>So, what is a Governance Registry?</p>
<p>It’s a digital repository that provides access to information managed under a Governance Framework. This information is used to interact with the digital systems that operate under a particular governance framework.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think.</p>
<p>We have ongoing discussions at the Trust Over IP Foundation. Join the ToIP github <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/tswg-trust-registry-tf/discussions">“Trust Registry” (there’s that term again!) community</a> to dive in!</p>
<p>UPDATE (2023-02-17) – We’ve decided to stick to “Trust Registry” while we work through the technical details and to align with the norms and expectations out there. Trust Registry it is!</p>

				  Our goal at Indicio is to make it as easy as possible to get started using verifiable credentials. One of the ways we do that is by providing superlative network services. Here we explain the what and the why of the Indicio Networks —&nbsp;and why it’s the best network to both start developing on and host your mission-critical solution.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Lynn Bendixsen and James Schulte</p>
<p>Learn more from James and Lynn live March 8 2023 – <a href="https://info.indicio.tech/indicio-demonstration-1?_gl=1*s32jpq*_ga*MTU1NDIyODEyMy4xNjU2MzQ1Nzky*_ga_HFY4CW67W2*MTY3NjMxODM3MC41NzMuMS4xNjc2MzE5MTUzLjU5LjAuMA..&amp;_ga=2.53936232.1928974460.1676315533-1554228123.1656345792">Finding the best network for you</a></p>
<p>A decentralized network is a layer of cryptographic trust and a source of truth. You will always be able to know who wrote to the distributed ledger, who issued a credential, and that the information in the credential has not been tampered with — and you will be able to know this through cryptography and metadata only.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No personal data is written to a distributed network. The end user holds and has full control over their data, including who they share it with and how it is shared. Decentralized networks remove the need for personal data to be stored in siloed databases. In doing this, they provide a simple way to comply with data privacy law and remove the risk from data being stored in third-party databases.</p>
<p>Indicio has three publicly available networks for verifiable credential solutions, the TestNet, DemoNet, and MainNet, and can also provide private networks for internal testing or development. All networks are professionally staffed and cater to different use cases. In a nutshell:</p>
<p><a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-testnet/">The TestNet: </a>As the name implies, the TestNet is an environment for testing. This is where the innovation happens, where projects can be incubated before they are ready to demo and become publicly available. The TestNet is reset on a quarterly basis and can be reset at short notice if something breaks, so&nbsp; it’s not a place to build and store long-term projects.</p>
<p>The great thing about the Indicio TestNet is that it is free to use;&nbsp; there is no limit on the number of ledger transactions. Why? Because Indicio believes that verifiable credential technology will drive the kind of digital transformation that will benefit everyone, and that it will do so faster if the entry point to developing solutions is as low as possible. It doesn’t get lower than free.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-demonet/">The DemoNet:</a> Once you’ve tested your product to the point where you are ready for that all-important demonstration to internal stakeholders or customers, you move it to the DemoNet. This is a more robust and stable network than the TestNet — think of it as a stepping stone between the TestNet and the MainNet. The DemoNet is subject to an annual reset and it will be reset if something breaks, but the likelihood of resets is much lower than the TestNet&nbsp;The great thing about the DemoNet? It’s also free to use. </p>
<p><a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-mainnet/">The MainNet:</a></p>
<p>Once you’ve successfully demonstrated your solution, it’s time to release it to the world on the Indicio MainNet. This is a full-production network that delivers 100 percent uptime for enterprise-grade or mission-critical solutions. It’s not reset, meaning that it’s a stable, long-term home for your product or service. It also has a really simple, cost-effective pricing structure: all you can write to the ledger for a flat fee of $5,000 per year. The great thing about this besides the low cost is the simplicity: There is no risk of you accidentally running up massive fees through complex pricing structures that kick in over a certain threshold.</p>
<p><a href="https://indicio.tech/private-networks/">A Private Network (TempNet):</a> Different use cases need different kinds of networks, and with a private network, only the people you designate will have access. Whether you’re interested in running temporarily for load testing, private tests of any kind, or using a private network long term as your own personal production network, we can build a private network to meet your needs. Rates vary depending on specifications.</p>
<p>Why innovators choose the Indicio Network</p>
<p>Indicio customers are building products and services for exchanging and verifying high value data in ways that seemed impossible only a few years ago — which is why they are making use of these extensive features. Immediately verifiable data is the new infrastructure for digital interaction and will fuel a wave of digital transformation.</p>
<p>The Indicio Networks currently supports a wide range of verifiable credential and decentralized identity solutions and use cases, including proving age, education, employment, health status, and travel documentation. One notable example of what decentralized identity technology can do comes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YApp77o0qH4">Bullet ID</a>, which is using verifiable credentials to track ammunition, allowing law enforcement to take a bullet from a crime scene and trace its point of origin back through the supply chain to whoever purchased it.</p>
<p>When getting started with decentralized identity technology, take your time to consider the network you build on. This will be the backbone of your solution. Knowing that the network will be stable and that there is someone on call to fix a problem will save you a headache or several&nbsp; down the road. Indicio is dedicated to our customer’s success and offers several <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-networks/">support packages</a> that range from complimentary help for developers with responses within 24 hours to business critical responses in a matter of minutes.</p>

<p>Modern hacks are getting more and more sophisticated, and this reality includes the rise of advanced phishing attacks.</p>
<p>Why are adversary-in-the-middle attacks dangerous? They are phishing attacks that can bypass MFA security to steal user credentials and system access.</p>
 What Is an Adversary-in-The-Middle Attack? 
<p>An Adversary-in-The-Middle (AiTM) attack is a sophisticated form of hacking that allows fraudsters to inject themselves into network communications to steal credentials, forge or copy encryption and identity verification keys, and launch further attacks to steal data or money.</p>
<p>The entire structure of a functional AiTM attack is comprised of a few key components, common hacks that are combined into a more extensive process:</p>
 Phishing 
<p>Like many hacks, AiTM starts with phishing. Common phishing attacks typically involve the sender attempting to gain credentials from the receiver so the hacker can use them to attack the system.</p>
<p>In AiTM attacks, however, the phishing email will falsely look like they originate from a legitimate organization, up to and including the organization the recipient works for. Within the email will be linked (often embedded into HTML elements like buttons) that will connect to a proxy website.</p>
<p>The text of the email will typically contain some warning or emergency message claiming that there was an accounting error or that the IT department needs to verify credentials–namely, anything that might get the recipient to click one of the links.</p>
 Man-in-The-Middle Attacks (MiTM) 
<p>Once the user clicks on the link, they are directed to one or more redirector pages and, finally, to the AiTM phishing website.</p>
<p>At this point, the attack branches from strict phishing strategies into MiTM tactics.</p>
<p>These attacks are so insidious that the user is not directed to a false page where they are asked to enter credentials. Instead, they are routed to a proxy server inserted in the middle of the transaction.</p>
<p>At this point, the hacker not only gets login credentials from the users. They get session information as well.</p>
 Transport Layer Security 
<p>When we connect to almost every website on the Internet, there’s some security in place. We’ve all learned how to check that a site uses HTTPS security to ensure that web traffic between you and that server is encrypted–this is the backbone of modern online browsing and commerce.</p>
<p>What’s important to note is that such security works through Transport Layer Security (TLS), one of the primary encryption standards for in-transit data obfuscation. TLS uses certificates where an organization provides information to a certificate authority (CA) that issues a certificate that functions as a public key. This certificate facilitates a public key encryption schema that hides data as it is transmitted between parties while assuring consumers that the website is legitimate.</p>
<p>As part of that process, TLS generates a cookie on the user’s side that serves as a session token for that particular visit. So, when you log into a site using TLS, a cookie will be generated to move through secured pages without continually having to authenticate yourself.</p>
<p>AiTM attacks place themselves in the middle of this process. Once a user responds to a phishing email and logs into a phishing site, the attacker not only takes those credentials but also generates and copies these session cookies. At this point, they can use the credentials and the cookies to communicate with the original organization’s servers and services as that user.</p>
 Breaking This Process Down 
<p>That was a bit complex, so let’s simplify:</p>
 
 The hacker sends a phishing email to the user for a site they most likely use, like a business account or bank. 
 The user clicks on a link in the email and is routed to a phishing server posing as the organization in the email. 
 This server accepts user credentials and creates a TLS session cookie based on the user’s browser and identity. 
 The hacker uses those credentials to log in to the secure site. 
 
<p>The implications of this kind of attack are significant. Most importantly, with the information gathered from the MiTM server, hackers can bypass several types of <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/multi-factor-authentication/">multi-factor authentication</a> and assurance mechanisms.</p>
<p>This kind of attack can be used to integrate the attacker into critical enterprise systems like business email or cloud environments, which means more attacks and more sophisticated <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/bec-attack/">Business Email Compromise (BEC)</a> scams.</p>
 How Can I Prevent Adversary-in-The-Middle Attacks? 
<p>This complex and effective hacking form can seem like an impossible challenge. If a hacker can bypass MFA, what else can be done to stop them?</p>
<p>The solution lies in more comprehensive and integrated authentication security coordinated across multiple attack vectors. These security measures should include, at a minimum:</p>
 
 Strong Anti-Phishing Policies: Any solid authentication security starts by educating individuals about the dangers they face. And it’s sad to say that there is a reason that phishing is one of the most popular and effective ways to attack these systems. It’s non-negotiable to train your employees on phishing strategies, including how to identify phishing emails and avoid them.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Additionally, implement email and messaging controls to warn against phishing. For example, it’s relatively simple to deploy in-message warning banners for any email from outside your domain. 
 
 
 System Monitoring and Auto-Access Revocation: Prevention involves monitoring systems for potential breaches. Modern security tools like CISO dashboards, logging utilities, and Security and Information and Event Management (SIEM) suites make monitoring strange behavior feasible.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alongside monitoring, you should have a trip switch that you can use to revoke access rights for any account at any time. If any account is compromised, you must have the power to turn off that account, or any number of accounts, within minutes. 
 
 
 Utilize FIDO 2.0 Authentication: FIDO 2.0 includes several new features for authentication that can mitigate anti-MFA attacks like AiTM. For example, FIDO uses WebAuthn to implement methods to ensure a website is who they claim to be, which can stop website phishing attacks dead in their tracks. 
 Utilize Conditional Access Policies: More advanced access policies can be implemented in the network’s configuration, including who and what a user can access with their machine. Setting conditional policies against connecting to sites that don’t meet client standards or don’t fall into a specific list of domains can cut off AiTM phishing attacks.

<p>Learn about Koii's mission to build a better Internet through blockchain payments to network hosts and a scalable decentralized architecture.</p> A New Incentive Model <p><a href="https://www.koii.network/">Koii</a> stands for Knowledgeable Open and Infinite Internet. Koii was founded in response to the need for a decentralized web that favors open source tools over walled gardens. There are hosting providers out there that have a good reputation and have built quality tools for their customers that keeps them coming back. This is great, but the issue comes when these providers become monopolies, quelling any viable alternatives. Koii seeks to disrupt this by incentivizing individuals to host data while keeping the hosting tools in the public domain. This model is called a CARP (Compute, Attribution, and Reputation Protocol). </p><p>Using the CARP model, potential hosts prove their trustworthiness by completing low-risk tasks and building up their reputation. </p><p>The benefits of this type of model are that no up-front investment is needed (thereby democratizing the network and helping to prevent a hostile buy-out), reputation reduces work replication (because trustworthy hosts can reduce the number of audits), and hosting purchasers can prioritize high-reputation providers. </p> The Koii Stack <p>The Koii stack is a blockchain-based ecosystem with a decentralized storage structure that empowers web app developers and compensates participants through its CARP protocol. </p><p>Let's break down each layer and its tools: </p> Identity Layer <p>Koii created the <a href="https://docs.koii.network/finnie-for-devs/welcome-to-finnie">Finnie Wallet</a>, which offers developers cross-chain compatibility, NFT management tools, decentralized IDs, and attention tracking (a way to earn KOII tokens according to the amount of views and engagement the app or asset receives).</p> Interface Layer <p>This portion of the SDK includes <a href="https://docs.koii.network/build-dapps-with-koii/welcome-to-koii-x">Koii-X</a>, a toolkit that includes UI and app templates and integration of the Finnie Wallet features that ensure permanent ownership and storage of media.</p> Application Layer <p>Serverless hosting is enabled as participants deploy Koii nodes on their home computers. The nodes run "tasks", which are scalable microservices needed to execute a particular project. The scalability keeps costs down so users don't pay for more than they are using. </p><p>According to Koii:</p><blockquote>Koii Tasks are off-chain computation, verified and submitted on-chain, then audited by other nodes. This unique structure of accountability allows Task nodes to perform a range of easily customizable services and provides the foundation for a highly transparent and trustless internet, without the scaling limitations of traditional blockchains.</blockquote> Settlement Layer <p>On the settlement layer, consensus occurs in the K2 blockchain. It utilizes a fork of Solana to register and run computations and holds the KOII tokens and the transparent transaction history ledger.</p> Storage Layer <p>On the final layer, the goal is to provide straightforward standardized storage options via IPFS and Filecoin directly into the Koii stack. web3.storage has already been integrated.</p> Fission + Koii <p>Fission and Koii share a common mission of creating tools that make building decentralized apps easier and more scalable for developers. Therefore, Koii has opted to leverage some of Fission's tools in its overall tech stack.</p><p>The WebAssembly tools Fission has built and included in the Webnative library contribute added security and a better developer experience.</p><p>At the moment, the Koii nodes will feature a built in hook for web3.storage, and Koii is working on implementing Fission's UCAN spec to ensure that this will be a consistent experience across other ecosystem projects! UCAN capabilities also complement decentralized IDs (UCANs are for authorization during browser sessions, DIDs are for authentication).</p><p>Finally, as Fission develops IPVM, improvements in content-addressed computation will lead to a more efficient use of the network and more revenue potential because of the ability to perform more complex tasks.</p> How to Get Involved <p>There are 45,000 devices signed up to participate in the Koii tasks network. Koii is working on giving those devices lots of jobs to do by providing the SDK, development tools, grants, and guidance from their team and the Koii community. </p><p>Koii hopes to eventually provide node operators with the ability to rent hardware from other providers and run larger tasks that provide more revenue. They are already working with IBM and a number of other providers on this front.</p><p>Learn more about Koii and how you can join the network by reviewing the <a href="https://docs.koii.network/">Koii documentation</a>.</p>

<p>AI enabled virtual brand ambassadors provide 24/7/365 service, education, information, and eCommerce subject matter expertise creating new engagement and revenue opportunities.&nbsp; Aftermath Islands also welcomes new senior team members.</p>



<p>February 14, 2023 –Toronto, Canada / Bridgetown, Barbados –<a href="http://www.aftermathislands.com/"> </a><a href="http://www.liquidavatartechnologies.com">Liquid Avatar Technologies Inc.</a> (CSE:LQID / OTC:LQAVF / FRA:4T5) (“Liquid Avatar” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that its controlled subsidiary, Aftermath Islands Metaverse Limited (“Aftermath Islands”) has been actively engaged in developing Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) powered Non-Player Characters (NPCs) avatars that are subject matter experts for the Metaverse.&nbsp; Having completed initial development, training and testing, AI avatars have begun to emerge in the Aftermath Islands Metaverse, with a fully interactive commercial rollout expected this quarter, which provides high fidelity graphics and a no download experience.&nbsp; The early-stage experience is available now at <a href="https://play.aftermathislands.com">https://play.aftermathislands.com</a>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The Company’s new AI avatar technology, using OpenAI GPT3, with over 175 billion parameters, essentially the enhanced version of ChatGPT which only has 1.5 billion parameters, has been primarily developed to provide commercial opportunities for brands and organizations to create virtual brand ambassadors that are easily accessible in the Metaverse and leverages a brand’s existing web resources.&nbsp; Highly detailed, life-like and / or imaginative NPC avatars active in a natural looking virtual setting or in a branded location, will be deployed using the highly trainable, and interactive engagement capabilities of OpenAI GPT3 and Aftermath Islands’ continuous updating and management. These AI powered avatars can naturally converse, initially by text and later by voice interaction with a user, allowing them to have a fulsome conversation with the AI avatar and navigate through a discussion or query on a particular subject or brand program.&nbsp; The technology will also have the capabilities to recommend products and services and provide links to be able to launch an organization’s existing website, information, provide support and / or eCommerce initiatives directly from the Metaverse to a user’s web browser, creating both engagement and activation opportunities for the brand seamlessly and efficiently.</p>



<p>“Artificial Intelligence applications like OpenAI GPT3 provide cost effective opportunities for brands, retailers, educators, travel and tourism operators, governments, and other types of organizations to move from static based information push models to truly interactive capabilities in the Metaverse, creating new and innovative ways to create awareness, engagement, activation and conversion,” commented David Lucatch, CEO of Liquid Avatar Technologies Inc. and Managing Director of Aftermath Islands Metaverse Limited. “We are already seeing strong commercial interest, as AI powered avatars can naturally interact with users and can recommend solutions that can be “clicked” within Aftermath Islands to instantly launch access to a host of web activities including eCommerce sites to support revenue-based activities, and 24/7 automated and intelligent customer service and support.”</p>



<p>With over 10 years in developing systems that support the use of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing for online applications, the teams at Liquid Avatar and Aftermath Islands have embraced the recent developments and opportunities with OpenAI GPT3.&nbsp; &nbsp;Aftermath Islands believes that these recent leaps in the notoriety and curiosity of AI can support the creation and acceptance of trained, autonomous based avatars and applications that can support a variety of interactive use cases inside the Metaverse.&nbsp; This allows users to have a more robust, engaging, and intelligent conversation with in-platform guides, and virtual brand representatives.</p>



<p>Aftermath Islands was recently joined by Michael Gord, a serial entrepreneur and investor focused on the mainstream adoption of Web3 applications and digital assets. Michael is the co-founder of the <a href="https://gda.group/">GDA Group</a>, which specialize in the digital asset capital markets, as well as the Metaverse Group. As Managing Partner and equity investor in Aftermath Islands Metaverse, Gord will focus on capital formation, partnerships, and growth opportunities within Aftermath Islands.</p>



<p>Nathan Paitchel has joined Aftermath Islands as our Business Development Manager for commercial programs. Nathan was formerly at Digital Currency Group where he led the company’s metaverse strategy and portfolio monetization. Spending nearly a decade in New York City real estate development, Nathan is keenly focused on creative deal structure, relationship building, and strategic partnerships.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Aftermath Islands supports the use of the Liquid Avatar Mobile App and Meta Park Pass, providing Proof of Humanity, allowing users to remain anonymous, but still verify that they are a real person, through blockchain based verifiable credentials, working to eliminate fraudulent activities, duplicate and fake accounts and bots.&nbsp; Deploying the technology to its controlled subsidiary’s Aftermath Islands’ Play to Earn game, Lost Kingdom of T’Sara, the Meta Park Pass has been successfully utilized allowing users to sign in with their biometrics, eliminating username and passwords, proving that all users are genuine people, with only 1 account, and supporting the collection of almost 1.2 billion gaming resources, resulting in the creation of about 1.5 million Resource Pack NFTs for use in the Aftermath Islands Metaverse.</p>



<p>Users are engaging for upwards of 70 minutes per day on the platform and have collected a variety of in-game resources, that they have then converted to Resource Pack NFTs that will be used, crafted, traded, and consumed in the Aftermath Islands Metaverse as part of platform activities, allowing the NFTs and the underlying blockchain technology to support in-game inventory management.&nbsp; These also include the ability to work, play, learn, earn, entertain, create, and socialize within the Aftermath Islands Metaverse.</p>



<p>Aftermath Islands has generated over $2 million in retail sales since late 2021 and continue to generate sales on a monthly basis.&nbsp; As the Company works to launch its full Metaverse platform, these revenues are recorded, under IFRS guidelines, as deferred revenue, until such time that the Aftermath Islands meets further launch requirements.&nbsp; However, the Company has had access to the proceeds for working capital.</p>



<p>As one of the first of its kind, the Liquid Avatar Mobile App can also be used to create a host of other credentials that have been already tested for government level access for travel and age verification.&nbsp; The Company is also designing credentials with uses that include online access, validation and marketing in the Metaverse and throughout the Web3 ecosystem.&nbsp; While the Company is ready to deploy to convenience stores and other age restricted programs, current market and economic priorities have caused delays of the rollout of Ontario’s and other jurisdiction’s Digital Identity programs. &nbsp;Liquid Avatar is currently expanding its programs to other online and commercial opportunities that are eager to use verifiable credentials to ensure that their users are real, unique individuals and have only a single account.</p>

<p>It comes as no surprise that digital transformation had a significant impact on the hospitality industry worldwide. Multiple aspects of the industry were transformed forever, from business models to user experience. Indeed, traditional business models evolved, as alternative accommodation rentals and home-sharing platforms entered the arena.</p>



<p>The overall customer experience also acknowledged tremendous changes. Whether booking accommodations, researching a holiday trip, or using a smartphone as a boarding pass, the travel journey has been drastically redefined. And the demand for an even more digitalized experience is growing stronger by the day. According to a <a href="https://www.condorferries.co.uk/millennials-travel-statistics-trends">report from Condor Ferries</a> in 2021, 66% of millennials booked their travel using a smartphone, and 75% had already installed travel apps. Nonetheless, 86% of them were still disappointed by the experience online provided by travel agents on mobile devices.</p>



<p>Airlines and businesses from the transportation industry rapidly adapted to this new paradigm by offering easy check-in processes, enabling travelers to avoid long airport queues and go through a fast-paced travel experience. However, the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/how-protect-owners-guests-holiday-rental-scams/">hospitality industry</a> was a bit late to implement such features.</p>



<p>Digital transformation has altered the way we perform check-ins and check-outs at hotels or airlines. It even guides us in unfamiliar places, by offering alternative services along the customer journey, such as dining establishments and activities. Digitalizing check-in processes is a great way to reshape the user experience and can have numerous advantages.</p>



 The benefits of digital guest check-ins. 



<p>Experiencing a seamless user journey is now required more than ever. Whether traveling, shopping or subscribing to a service, customers are now accustomed to going through multiple digital hoops and have rapidly developed an appetite for them. Therefore, providing a secure and contactless guest check-in experience can <a href="https://wttc.org/Portals/0/Documents/Reports/2021/SSTJ-Biometrics%20and%20Digital%20Identity%20Global%20Guidelines.pdf?ver=2021-02-27-120737-970">provide the following positive impacts</a> on hotel businesses:</p>



  Increased efficiency: Since the guest is able to check-in on his own, through his smartphone or any other device, it saves time for both the guest and the hotel staff. Check-ins are then more efficient and provide a more balanced staff workload, allowing them to complete other tasks;  Improved guest experience: After having spent many hours on a train, an airplane or a car, the last thing guests want to do is wait in a long queue to check-in. They want to go to their room as fast as possible, and start enjoying their stay. Moreover, digital check-ins can be an additional touchpoint where guests acknowledge hotel services, upgrade their room or book a meal at the onsite restaurant, thus providing another source of revenue;  More reliant data collection: Since guests provide personal information through automated identity verification solutions, hotel operators can have more trust in the data they collect, mitigating fraud risks and avoiding hiccups at reception;  Reputation build-up: By providing a transparent user journey, your hotel brand grows stronger in the mind of travelers, who will remember how easy it was to arrive at your location. Customer satisfaction can only increase and positively impact your brand reputation.  



<p>To guarantee that the check-in experience is complete, the guest’s identity needs to be verified in order to prevent the risk of fraudulent behavior. To do so, a robust identity verification solution must be accounted for in the digital check-in experience.</p>



 What technology is needed for automated guest verification? 



<p>An automated guest-verification workflow can be easily integrated into any contactless check-in solution. Any device can be used by guests to verify their identity seamlessly and on their own.</p>



<p>AI or human assisted identity verification systems are now offered by identity verification solution providers like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent</a> from IDnow. Thanks to its SDK, AutoIdent can be easily integrated into an app, a web flow or as a standalone app. It is also highly customizable as it defines patterns to better detect fraud or suspicious behaviors. By verifying one or two governmental issued documents, AutoIdent guarantees that users are thoroughly screened and their identity confirmed. Liveness checks can also be conducted via video calls to avoid identity spoofing.</p>



<p>Combined to a keyless system or coding station, the experience remains transparent and painless for the customer, whether he’s checking-in from a smartphone, a tablet, a desktop, or from the kiosk.</p>



 







 The three stages of identity verification in guest check-in. 



<p>A guest can digitally check-in on his own easily thanks to the latest solutions. Only three stages are usually required between the arrival at the hotel and the moment a guest crosses the door of his hotel room.</p>



  Fill-out registration form: There are different ways for a guest to start a digital check-in. Either through his smartphone, desktop, a tablet available at hotel reception or at check-in kiosks. They allow several guests to check-in at the same time, even while enjoying a welcome drink. Check-in processes are also interconnected, as the guest can start checking-in on his smartphone and finishing paying at the kiosk for example;  Biometric and document verification: After filling-out the personal information, the guest has to scan his governmental-issued document on both sides so that information registered is automatically verified. To confirm the person holding the document is the person making the registration, a selfie is required. This can be completed by liveness checks to ensure that no spoofing mechanism is used and fraudulent tactics are deterred;  Data transfer and system verification: As data is registered and confirmed through the back-end information system, the check-in is confirmed and enables the guest to save his booking on a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/how-digital-identity-improves-passenger-journey/">Wallet Pass</a>, have keyless access to his room, which<a href="https://hoteltechreport.com/news/contactless-check-in#:~:text=Recent%20surveys%20have%20found%20that,asking%20for%20contactless%20payment%20options"> 26% of customers say they prefer</a>, or go to the coding station to grab his key.  



 Taking into account privacy and security concerns. 



<p>While some security and privacy concerns may arise, <a href="https://wttc.org/news-article/majority-of-travellers-willing-to-share-data-for-a-more-seamless-experience">a 2019 report from the WTTC</a> suggested that a majority of travelers were more likely to share their data if it meant a more seamless experience. The perceived benefit in addition to a relieved pressure on their journey also meant “improving safety and security through a better authentication and a reduction of fraud”. Thus, providing a transparent process to collect customer information, while accelerating the booking process is one of the keys to a successful user experience.</p>



<p>Moreover, IDnow identity verification solutions and data storage are thoroughly vetted and tested against <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/data-security/">GDPR rules</a>. Finally, the highest IT security standards are enforced on our information systems to guarantee security at all cost, because data privacy is a non-negotiable priority.</p>



 Digital check-in for successful hotel operations. 



<p>The adoption of digital check-in in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/travel/prevent-vacation-rental-scam/">hospitality industry</a> is becoming widely accepted by hotel operators, who recognize the benefits of freeing up front desk staff to focus on personal interactions with guests. Despite initial concerns about the loss of human interactions, the experience of digitalizing the check-in process has shown that it not only increases efficiency, but also improves the overall guest experience and brand relationship. Secured and transparent, digital check-in offers benefits for both the hotelier and the guest, while reducing friction points.</p>



 FAQs for digital check-ins. 


 
 
 
 How can I create a seamless digital check-in experience for my guests? 
 

<p>Traveling guests want to access their accommodation quickly after a long journey. By leveraging ID verification providers such as IDnow, hotels can implement a digital check-in experience on mobile, on-site, self-service tablets or at the reception, easily improving the guest journey and increasing customer satisfaction.</p>

 
 
 
 Are there any risks associated with using automated guest verification systems? 
 

<p>On the contrary. Implemented efficiently, automated guest verification systems can reduce fraud and impersonation by requiring one or two governmental issued identity documents, comparing them to the user by requesting a selfie, and determining suspicious patterns.</p>

 
 
 
 Can I customize my digital check-in experience to suit my business needs? 
 

<p>It is more than encouraged to tailor digital experiences to suit business model specifications. Customized digital experiences can drive revenues up by providing alternative services. They can be integrated seamlessly into specific guest journey workflows and IDnow is there to assist with every user-case scenario.</p>

<p>HMT has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/future-financial-services-regulatory-regime-for-cryptoassets">published</a>&nbsp;a consultation paper welcoming feedback on proposed crypto regulations from any market participant and users.</p>



<p>The proposals focus on the “future UK regulatory framework for crypto assets used within financial services” to create a safe environment for crypto providers to operate and grow in the UK while ensuring the protection of consumers. To this end, the UK government suggests that the regulatory framework for crypto assets “should follow the standards expected of other similar financial services activities, commensurate to the risks they pose while harnessing potential benefits of the technology behind them”.&nbsp;</p>



 Most eye-catching proposals and questions for the public include:&nbsp; 



  The proposal to leave crypto assets outside of the definition of a “financial instrument”. 



 the financial services regulation of crypto assets is to be part of the regulatory framework established by the UK’s Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA) 



 “Do you agree with HM Treasury’s proposed approach to using the MiFID-derived rules applying to existing regulated activities as the basis of a regime for crypto asset intermediation activities?” 



 “Do you agree with HM Treasury’s proposal to apply and adapt existing frameworks for traditional finance<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/custodians/"> custodians </a>under Article 40 of the RAO for crypto asset custody activities?” 



 already registered market players will have to repeat the registration procedure to be assessed “against a wider range of measures”.&nbsp; 



 “How can the administrative burdens of FSMA authorisation be mitigated for firms which are already MLR-registered and seeking to undertake regulated activities?” 



 algorithmic stablecoins are covered by the regulation as unbacked crypto assets 



 “Do you agree that so-called algorithmic stablecoins and crypto-backed tokens should be regulated in the same way as unbacked crypto assets?” 



 financial services activities will be regulated, rather than the assets themselves – thus if NFTs and utility tokens are used in one of the regulated activities, they will be covered&nbsp; 



 by future regulations&nbsp; 



 “Do you agree with the assessment of the challenges and risks associated with vertically integrated business models?” 



 “Are there any commodity-linked tokens which you consider would not be in the scope of existing regulatory frameworks?” 



 “Do you agree that the scope of the market abuse regime should be crypto assets that are requested to be admitted to trading on a crypto asset trading venue (regardless of where the trading activity takes place)?” 
 <p>The consultation paper is available&nbsp;<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1133404/TR_Privacy_edits_Future_financial_services_regulatory_regime_for_cryptoassets_vP.pdf">here</a>. Feedback is accepted until April 30, 2023.</p>

 Dubai’s Innovative Virtual Asset Regulations — The Full&nbsp;Picture <p>tl;dr</p>  Keeping up with its crypto-friendly image, Dubai’s crypto regulatory body published an extensive framework for the benefit of the local virtual assets ecosystem and&nbsp;users.  Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) makes licenses mandatory for crypto businesses to operate within its boundaries and outlines the fines, penalties, and regulatory actions for those that fail to&nbsp;comply.  VARA is taking a practical approach to risk-taking, considering the volatile nature of crypto&nbsp;assets.  <p>Dubai has always been ahead in responding to the evolving demands of the digital or virtual assets industry. The city-state released its blockchain strategy back in 2016 and the metaverse strategy in 2022. And in February 2023, Dubai’s crypto regulator VARA issued its “Virtual Assets and Related Activities Regulations” — a framework taking into consideration economic sustainability and cross-border financial security.</p> Dubai a Desired Virtual Asset&nbsp;Hub <p>A <a href="https://www.khaleejtimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/dubai-ranked-2nd-most-crypto-ready-city-in-the-world">report</a> published on February 2nd, 2023, showed Dubai ranking second globally as a cryptocurrency hub and was followed by New York, Singapore, and Los&nbsp;Angeles.</p><p>The Study evaluated Dubai, along with other cities worldwide, on the parameters of the quality-of-life score, crypto-specific events, people working in crypto-related jobs, crypto companies, R&amp;D spending as a percentage of GDP, number of crypto ATMs, capital gains tax rate, and ownership of crypto in each country. The ultimate aim of the report, done by Recap, a well-known private crypto tax software and portfolio tracker, was to test the crypto-readiness of the&nbsp;city.</p><p>Dubai has more than 750 crypto-based companies. It also offers a zero percent tax regime, making it lucrative for investors to invest money in building their crypto firms. Many major crypto firms, including crypto.com, Bybit, Binance, Deribit, and others, are planning to make Dubai their&nbsp;home.</p><p>With all these initiatives already setting a crypto-friendly context for Dubai, it has now set up the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority, tasked primarily with licensing and regulating the crypto space across Dubai, the mainland, and free zone territories, including Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC ) that serves as a financial hub for the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia (MEASA)&nbsp;markets.</p> The End Goal of&nbsp;VARA? <p>The implementation of VARA is expected to introduce a competitive edge for the Emirates, along with augmenting its position as a hub globally, in the virtual assets and related services space. The authorities expect this to translate into a more developed regional digital economy. It will spread awareness, encourage innovation, and attract investment in the Virtual Assets, services, and products&nbsp;world.</p><p>From the consumers’ point of view, regulations, rules, and standards are expected to bring efficiency to the system while protecting investors and dealers and putting a check on fraudulent and illegal practices.</p><p>DWTCA, which stands for the Dubai World Trade Centre Authority, will be the competent authority overseeing the efficient implementation of the regulations.</p> The Vision Driving&nbsp;VARA <p>VARA aims at a fair, transparent, and resilient market to prevent fraud and criminal activities. Credit risk, market risk, liquid risk, operational risk — VARA wants to make the market safe from such risks that can take a toll on businesses’ financial resources and affect the entire financial ecosystem and its consumers. Though fairness, transparency, and orderliness do not necessarily mean a lack of volatility.</p><p>VARA takes a practical and balanced approach toward risk — viewing it as “a necessary evil” if the returns are to be high. VARA mandates service providers in the market to inform their consumers beforehand so that they are aware of the risks and make informed&nbsp;choices.</p><p>VARA seeks to move beyond the practice of banning. Unless an activity is illicit or illegal, VARA gives a preference to regulation rather than banning. The aim is also to become a regulatory paradigm that does not become outdated quickly, a significant possibility for an evolving, tech-dependent industry space. Its mission is to put in motion a regime with a balanced&nbsp;view.</p> VARA’s Impact on&nbsp;VASPs? <p>Fulfilling VARA’s licensing requirements requires compliance with four compulsory rulebooks: Company, Compliance and Risk Management, Technology and Information, and Market&nbsp;Conduct.</p>(Image Source: <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1623502307684937735?s=20&amp;t=iILOnocED21pI5yo_cOLAA">Shyft Network’s Twitter&nbsp;Account</a>)<p>There are an additional seven activity-specific rulebooks that Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) must comply with when they obtain the VARA license.. These activities include offering advisory services, broker-dealer services, custody services, exchange services, lending and borrowing services, payments and remittance services, and management &amp; investment services.</p> VARA Safeguarding the Ecosystem <p>Besides bringing the system within a regularized functional framework, VARA will act as an Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) supervisory authority in the Emirates as&nbsp;well.</p><p>VARA has also outlined a defined list of market offenses that include insider dealing, unlawful disclosure, and market manipulations. Additionally, VARA holds the right to classify any other behavior as a market offense apart from what has already been mentioned in the&nbsp;list.</p><p>Insider dealing refers to a situation where an entity that possesses inside information uses it by carrying out a transaction for its account or the account of a third party. And when an entity in possession of inside information discloses it to an entity unrelated to the normal exercise of an employment, profession, or duty, it becomes an offense of unlawful disclosure.</p><p>Market manipulation, the third category of offense VARA is responsible for overseeing, is when a virtual asset’s supply and demand dynamics are affected artificially.</p><p>There are different ways of manipulating a market, including disseminating false or misleading information about a company, conducting a series of transactions with the ulterior motive of making a virtual asset appear more actively traded, rigging quotes, prices, or trades of an asset, and more. VARA will ensure that such offenses do not happen in the&nbsp;market.</p> VARA Enforcement Power <p>To ensure that the regulatory authority of VARA is properly executed, it can enforce fines, penalties, etc., and issue written reprimands and enforcement notices. VARA can ask service providers to rectify the issues of non-compliance within a specific time and can ask a VASP to cease any specific VA activity for a specified or indefinite period. It can impose fines or other civil penalties and even suspend or revoke a&nbsp;license.</p><p>Overall, the purpose of VARA is to create a crypto regulatory framework that would help healthy and sustainable industry growth while safeguarding consumer, investor, and provider interests.</p> VARA Licensing Process <p>The VARA licensing process is multi-staged, starting with a provisional permit. Next is a two-step licensing, including a preparatory MVP license in the first step and an operating MVP license in the second. The final result is a Full Market Product (FMP) license. A provider will obtain an FMP license only after the regulations have been tested with the VARA&nbsp;regime.</p><p>The provisional and preparatory MVP licenses, the only two categories of licenses issued so far, offer an opportunity for providers to enter the VARA regime and work on the rest of the requirements necessary for an FMP license. These requirements include setting up offices, onboarding employees with work visas, securing domestic bank accounts, etc.</p><p>MVP licenses have been issued to several players across a range of industry segments, including broker-dealer services, custody services, exchange services, payments and remittances services, management and investment services, and virtual assets issuance. Providers of advisory services and lending and borrowing services, among others, have not been licensed&nbsp;yet.</p> The VARA Framework Philosophy <p>The driving philosophy of VARA seeks to enforce socio-economic stability, robust consumer protection, and jurisdictional resilience in the virtual assets space. Although no company has yet obtained the third stage MVP operational license so far, some VASPs have already reached stage 2 of the activity-specific licensing procedure. This includes providers like BitOasis, GCEX, Binance, Bybit, Crypto.com, Huobi, and OKx, among&nbsp;others.</p><p>These providers are allowed to offer Virtual Assets (VA) services to qualified and/or institutional investors. The participation of mass retail customers will only be a reality when providers obtain Full Market Product (FMP) licenses.</p><p>The FMP licenses will have provisions for securing borderless economic opportunities across the global VA industry. It will also be VARA’s concern to protect investors and market participants, which will require security, cross-border compliance mechanisms, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>VARA will have to deal, in detail, in the areas of custody and segregation of client money, prudential requirements — such as insurance and liquidity cover, FATF compliance, market manipulation, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>The successful implementation of the checks and balances in these areas will enable VARA to help Dubai become the leading VA hub globally. While it will bring investment and promote awareness about VA services, it will protect all concerned entities from the risk of illegal activities, frauds, breaches, and market manipulations. That said, observers would have to wait until the FMP licenses come into play and mass retail consumers start getting involved. Only then would it be an opportune time to assess the capabilities of VARA in its entirety and its role in prospering Dubai’s Crypto&nbsp;Hub.</p><p>______________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

 Assistive technology: AI can also be used to develop and enhance assistive technology, such as eye-tracking devices and alternative input methods, that can help disabled students access and interact with digital learning materials. 
 



 Helping students to decide career paths 



<p>AI can help students in several ways to decide on their career paths and fields of interest:</p>



 
 Career Assessment: AI can be used to create career assessments that use data and machine learning algorithms to analyze a student's strengths, skills, and interests to suggest career paths that are best suited to their abilities. 
 



 
 Skill Analysis: AI can be used to identify the skills a student possesses, helping them to identify areas where they can improve and supporting their efforts to build relevant skills for future careers. 
 



 
 Career Exploration: AI can provide students with information about various careers and industries, including salary data, job duties, and education requirements, allowing them to explore different options and make informed decisions about their future. 
 



 
 Predictive Analytics: AI can be used to analyze data on student performance, behavior, and interests to predict which careers are most likely to be a good fit for them. This can provide students with valuable insights into their strengths and help them make informed decisions about their future. 
 



<p>In conclusion, AI has the potential to greatly enhance the education experience for students and educators alike by providing students and teachers with new and innovative tools and resources. From personalized learning and intelligent tutoring to automated grading and virtual and augmented reality environments, AI will help to revolutionize the way students learn and teachers teach.&nbsp;AI has the potential to improve access to education for differently abled students and support teachers in managing the increasing demands of the modern classroom.</p>



<p>However, it is important to note that AI technology should be used as a supplement to traditional teaching methods and will not replace human teachers. With careful consideration and responsible deployment, AI has the potential to play a transformative role in shaping the future of education.</p>

So when peoples’ beliefs get out of kilter with the world around them, their actions get out of kilter&nbsp;too.</p><p>Not that long ago for example, medical doctors believed that humans’ health rested on the right balance of the four humours of blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile. So they were united in what they should do about it — bloodletting, to restore the balance — no matter what the ailment was. In this way the establishment — the great, good, learned, respectable and responsible people that others looked to for guidance — did immense harm even when they were trying to do&nbsp;good.</p><p>Our argument in this series is simple. Personal data is now a driving force at the heart of our economy and society. Huge economic benefits are now there, available for the taking, if it can be deployed in the right ways. But, mesmerised by the <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/are-insights-always-good-b5e05e3eb56a">Big Data</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/artificial-intelligence-no-authentic-folly-on-a-grand-scale-e88dbda191b9">Artificial Intelligence</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-economists-cannot-get-their-heads-around-personal-data-661d2dedd589">Economics</a> industrial complex, so far, the establishment has devoted virtually all available attention and resources on solutions that are often harmful and will never deliver what is needed. Bloodletting all over&nbsp;again.</p><p>We need a much better understanding of where personal data’s opportunities lie, and how to unlock this potential. That is what our <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/Hidden_in_Plain_Sight_The_Surprising_Economics_of_Personal_Data/">White Paper</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/economics-of-personal-data/home">blog series</a> has done: lay out painstakingly, in detail, why empowering citizens with their data presents a transformational economic opportunity, what the benefits are, and how it can&nbsp;work.</p> A policy&nbsp;agenda <p>This raises a question: what should enlightened policy makers&nbsp;do?</p><p>In a world where everyone believes in bloodletting (partly because everybody else appears to) it’s can be risky for policy makers to stick their necks out. But what they can do is ask questions. Does bloodletting actually deliver the benefits that people say it does? How exactly does it&nbsp;work?</p><p>And they can experiment with different approaches on the side — where, if they work, it becomes possible to say “Look! We tried this different approach and it works!”. In which case, it’s helpful to have a mental model of what such different approaches might&nbsp;be.</p><p>Below we set out a ten point primer on personal data for decision- and policy-makers; one that captures quickly and simply why personal data is so economically important, the nature of the changes it is triggering, and how to address&nbsp;them.</p><p>What it amounts to is a new agenda for personal data, compact enough to fit on two sides of A4. You can <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/A_10_Point_Primer_on_Personal_Data/A%2010%20Point%20Primer%20on%20Personal%20Data%20-%20Mydex%20CIC%202023.pdf">download it here</a> or <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/A_10_Point_Primer_on_Personal_Data/">view it online&nbsp;here</a>.</p> A New Agenda for Personal&nbsp;Data   Personal data is an elemental economic force, affecting every citizens’ ability to manage their lives and every organisation providing services to these citizens, across all sectors (public, private and third). Access to and use of personal data is pivotal to the efficient and effective delivery of services in public administration (both central and local government), financial services banking and insurance, health and social care, education, retail, transport, leisure, media and entertainment. Services now account for 80% of all economic activity.  As an asset, data is unique because when it gets used, it doesn’t get ‘used up’. Instead, it can be used again and again by many different parties, for many different purposes on many different occasions. Therefore, to unleash the full potential of data it needs to be&nbsp;shared.  Current data systems have a fundamental design flaw at their heart: the ‘organisation-centric’ database where each organisation separately collects, holds and uses the data it needs for its operations in a separate data silo. The organisation-centric database is designed to keep data proprietary: to NOT share&nbsp;data.  Lack of data sharing is generating large-scale friction, effort, risk and cost (‘FERC”) across the entire economy, particularly via:    Immense levels of duplicated effort, as organisations recreate and recollect data that has already been generated and collected elsewhere  Widespread friction and delays because of the time it takes to recreate and recollect data  Endemic risk as organisations are not able to access and use the data they need, when they need&nbsp;it.  <p>5. Organisations do not legally own the personal data they collect and use. Under data protection law, individuals have the right to obtain a copy of their data that organisations are processing (Article 15 of GDPR) and to receive their data from organisations in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format (Article 20 of&nbsp;GDPR).</p><p>6. Personal data stores (or wallets, lockers, vaults, attribute stores, etc) enable individuals to safely and easily gather, store, manage and share their data. By enabling individuals to share personal data that has already been generated or collected about them, as and when needed, personal data stores enable economy-wide re-use of existing data assets. In doing so, they strip out the FERC generated by the organisation-centric database, thereby enabling far-reaching efficiency and productivity savings. These efficiency and cost savings can benefit every citizen and every public, private and third sector organisation that uses personal data to provide services.</p><p>7. By enabling individuals to aggregate data that has been collected about them from many different service providers — e.g. by making individuals the point at which data about themselves is integrated — personal data stores also generate rich new citizen-centric data assets that are impossible to create under the current system, which disperses individuals’ data across many separate databases. These new citizen-centric and citizen-controlled data assets could act as a rich source of new insights, driving the creation of new classes of data-driven services, opening up new vistas of innovation.</p><p>8. Because they place individuals in control of the collection and sharing of their data, personal data stores transcend traditional trade-offs between the demands of privacy and data protection versus those of innovation /&nbsp;growth.</p><p>9. They also deliver far-reaching social benefits. By empowering citizens with their data, they pre-distribute control over personal data and access to its rewards, and help improve access to services and tackle exclusion. They also help address the extreme imbalances of power and reward that currently blight current ways of collecting and using personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>10. Personal data stores thereby open the floodgates to economy-wide breakthroughs in productivity, innovation and growth that are fair, inclusive and socially beneficial. Thanks to the work already done by Mydex CIC, the personal data store infrastructure needed to realise these benefits is available to deploy now at very low cost and&nbsp;risk.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/a-ten-point-personal-data-primer-for-policy-makers-e43de4f8f764">A Ten Point Personal Data Primer for Policy Makers</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Living in a Mattereum World <p>To avert the climate emergency we keep being told we need to move to a circular economy. In this, ideally, things get made, used until they wear out or cease to be useful, and then go off and get recycled by breaking them down and salvaging usable component parts or reducing them to their basic chemicals. Either way, these then go on to make something new that goes round the circle again. This then happens repeatedly with stuff only going to landfill if it really cannot be recycled, thereby minimising waste. It’s how milk bottles used to work in the days of doorstep delivery. Originally, they went back to the dairy, got washed, then used again for the next day’s milk, until someone worked out it was cheaper to just melt them down and use the glass to make new ones for the next day; either way, the same glass went round and round between the dairy and the doorstep and never needed to go near a landfill. Now, we have plastic milk containers and the whole process is more complex and wasteful, while you only get glass milk bottles in vintage shops and use them to put flowers&nbsp;in.</p><p>Mostly, when it comes to achieving a circular economy, things have been getting worse, not better. With Mattereum’s <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-mattereum-universal-bridge-e86bca2db220">Universal Bridge</a>, though, there’s the opportunity to bring literally any physical object to the blockchain, which can reverse all this, and not only that, leapfrog over the circular economy and create a new, efficient “Spiral Economy”.</p><blockquote>The whole idea of recycling is built on a fundamental falsehood</blockquote><p>To put it plainly, even the circular economy has fundamentally got everything completely backwards. The concept of taking something that’s been used, stripping it down to its components, reusing what you can and melting down the rest for chemicals as a means of efficiently preventing waste is bad engineering, at best. The whole idea of <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/09/11/897692090/how-big-oil-misled-the-public-into-believing-plastic-would-be-recycled">recycling is built on a fundamental falsehood</a>, it was something that oil and gas companies conjured up in the 70s to greenwash their new plastics by saying to the public that they could and would be recycled, while knowing that in reality this was not actually practical. Selling recycling sold plastic. “If the public thinks that recycling is working, then they are not going to be as concerned about the environment,” said Larry Thomas, former president of the Society of the Plastics Industry. Most of the plastic that we think we recycle still ends up as landfill, it now just gets shipped to China or somewhere before that&nbsp;happens.</p><p>Image: <a href="https://www.iisd.org/articles/deep-dive/confronting-plastic-pollution-pandemic">https://www.iisd.org/articles/deep-dive/confronting-plastic-pollution-pandemic</a></p><p>Plastics make up a large proportion of pretty much everything we use today and still we have no really viable way of recycling them so that they can be used to make the same kind of thing they came from. It’s not much better for metals and other non-plastic materials, separating them out and turning them into new, useful, things is really not working. For a circular economy to work we are going to need to break down pretty much everything we make into component parts or chemicals and make new versions of the same thing out of these, like the old milk bottles. But we can’t, we’re not even close, and we are not going to get close any time soon enough to have any impact on the climate emergency. So what can we&nbsp;do?</p><blockquote>Your junk suddenly becomes tools for somebody&nbsp;else.</blockquote><p>There is almost nothing that has been produced by western civilisation that is not usable by somebody somewhere and if we can make it possible to market all the “junk’’ in your house to the people who will find it useful, your junk suddenly becomes tools for somebody else. No need to pull it to bits, melt it down or anything, just get it to the people who find it useful. You have an aluminium pan that’s been kicking around in the back of a cupboard since you were a student that you don’t use because someone bought you a set of Le Creuset for a wedding present; for you, it’s just cluttering up the kitchen cupboard and getting in the way, but out there, there’s someone who would happily buy your perfectly decent but unused aluminium pan for 11 cents. Or maybe you have a ball of yarn you bought to fix holes in your clothes made by moths (because <a href="https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/learn/conservation/clothes-moth-research/understanding-clothes-moths/#:~:text=HOW%20DO%20THEY%20CAUSE%20DAMAGE,pile%20in%20patches%20on%20carpets.">moths are bastards</a>) and you only needed 25 metres of it. Half a ball of yarn is kind of useless, but to someone who has a project that has been using that colour yarn, needs more, and can match their batch number with yours so the colour match is perfect, it’s suddenly extremely useful. In an ideal world, you take a tray of junk, run it past an AI, the AI identifies it, gives each item a <a href="https://mattereum.com/mattereum-asset-passports/">Mattereum asset passport</a> (MAP) and sells it to&nbsp;someone.</p><blockquote>Things never hit landfill until every single human being has all of the stuff that they&nbsp;want</blockquote><p>So the spiral economy is this, we continue to run mass manufacturing and it continues to put material into the middle of the spiral. New things get inserted and these new things gradually work their way down the spiral going out to people with tighter and tighter budgets in incrementally wider rings, and with a little bit of luck they never hit landfill until every single human being has all of the stuff that they want. So while at the top end, rich people are still buying new stuff, further down the spiral, everyone is still getting good quality older stuff. It will still need a change to the way things are manufactured, they have to go back to being durable and repairable — nobody wants a plastic bottle with a hole in&nbsp;it.</p><p>Today, there is just a lot of stuff that is not worth fixing — although the definition of ‘not worth fixing’ is still a value judgement depending on how much money you have, how much time you’ve got, what tools you have and how much you need the thing. A bicycle wheel with half the spokes gone is junk to someone, but to someone who needs one, hasn’t got the money for a new one but is willing to put in the time to fix it, it is worth fixing. At the moment ‘not worth fixing’ even applies to a lot of things that are undamaged, for example, the old mugs I have in my cupboard, they’re nothing special, they aren’t from a collectable pottery, they don’t commemorate anything or connect to a geek franchise, just patterned mugs from a supermarket, made in their millions. It’s just too much like hard work to sell them on eBay, charity shops don’t want them, it’s just easier to chuck them into landfill, but in developing countries, they are useful drinking vessels, someone there will want them, no need for them to go to landfill if only the connection can be made. At the moment we can’t do that because those people have very little money and no effective marketplace exists.</p><blockquote>The Mattereum Asset Passport mean that the stuff you are buying is what it claims to&nbsp;be</blockquote><p>That’s the problem, plus some ideas about a potential solution. How does what Mattereum does get us to a practical solution that is feasible in the real world? <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-mattereum-universal-bridge-e86bca2db220">The Universal Bridge </a>connects any physical object to the blockchain so the transfer of legal ownership by means of NFTs is simple. That provides a mechanism by which a marketplace can work without friction while still operating with trust. Important. It means you know you own the stuff you are buying when you buy it and that the person you are buying from has the right to sell it, The legal warranties in the <a href="https://mattereum.com/mattereum-asset-passports/">Mattereum Asset Passport (MAP)</a> also mean that the stuff you are buying is what it claims to be and in the condition it is claimed to be in, or you get financial recompense from the seller. This is what creates the value in your ‘junk’; because the buyer can be certain that you really own the thing and it is exactly what you say it is, it removes the ‘doubt discount’ that undermines sales in the secondary market.</p><p>As a result, you get something like 80–90% of what you paid for the thing when you resell it instead of 50% (at best), and so does your buyer when they sell it on. This means it is always worth selling something on, down the spiral, to the next level of people who want that thing, but have increasingly modest budgets. But it’s no good being able to sell your printer down the spiral if it has been arbitrarily bricked by the manufacturer as they judge you’ve had it for too long and their economic model requires you to bin it and buy a new&nbsp;one.</p><blockquote>There’s an incentive to make things able to&nbsp;survive</blockquote><p>The printer, kettle, milk bottle, or whatever has to be built for longevity, and the MAP helps drive this. It allows for manufacturers to have a warranty that earns them a small amount on every sale down the spiral, so there’s an incentive to make it able to survive to do that, or to set things up so that they can take things back, refurb them and re-inject them into the spiral. Making things with longevity suddenly makes sense for companies, if they do that with a warranty on the MAP that gives them, say, 1% of the purchase price every time the thing is sold on, they are making money for years without having to do any more work. 1% of the cost of a cheap 10th hand pot isn’t much, but 1% of the cost of a million 10th hand pots, well, that amounts to something worth paying attention to.</p><p>You can see that starting to happen, Mattereum are on the verge of announcing a partnership with a cutting-edge manufacturer of high quality, hard wearing, ethically produced jackets. We’ll be starting by doing MAPs for these Every one of these jackets will have its MAP encoded in as a cryptographically protected mobile phone verifiable <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/nfc-tags-explained-271872/">NFC tag</a> that it carries, so that the garments are tied to the blockchain, which enables them to function viably in a spiral economy. You just beep the tag against your phone to access the blockchain records that verify the jacket’s identity.</p><blockquote>Individual jackets will each have their own unique identification immutably entered on the blockchain</blockquote><p>The jacket’s MAP will document the material’s supply chain certifications, backed by legally enforceable warranties that these certifications are genuine. Individual jackets will each have their own unique identification immutably entered on the blockchain, so that anything that happens in the life of the jacket can be documented. Who owns it, if it has been repaired or upgraded, even what adventures it has been through, all these can be written into the jacket’s Asset Passport for posterity and because the jacket’s warranties and the history are connected to the blockchain by the Mattereum tag and Asset Passport, it proves it is genuine to future buyers so it can realise a better price when it is sold on. This will hold true for every buyer so it helps create a spiral economy; instead of being recycled after every user, the jacket remains valuable as it is and passes from buyer to buyer over the years, spiralling down through the economy. They can be returned to the manufacturer for repair and refurb if needed, and all the original promises made to purchasers remain valid whoever buys them next, ensuring that they retain their value for the second, third and tenth wearers. This means that when this year’s throw away gear has become microplastic pollution, clothes born from the partnership between Mattereum and this manufacturer will still be proudly worn by owners who cherish their style and accumulated history.</p><p>Now imagine every item of clothing working like that, and a whole load of other stuff besides, game changer. We’re even seeing big traditional brands starting to do it — <a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/customer-service/services/buy-back/?itm_content=HPBanner&amp;itm_element=services&amp;itm_campaign=fy22_buyback">IKEA</a> is buying back furniture and refurbing it, so is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/oct/04/john-lewis-plans-buy-back-or-take-back-schemes-in-all-product-categories-by-2025">John Lewis</a>, and <a href="https://www.screwfix.com/help/refurbished-products">Screwfix</a> will now buy back your old sander, drill, sonic screwdriver etc, refurb it and sell it on at a reduced price. If they connected this stuff to a MAP, we’d be well on the way. Spiral&nbsp;Economy.</p><blockquote>An AI-powered framework for hyper-efficient web3&nbsp;commerce</blockquote><p>The ecosystem to make the spiral economy happen is starting to condense out of the ether; another of Mattereum’s new partnerships is with <a href="https://neoswap.ai/">NeoSwap</a>. While Mattereum has the trust and identity side of things nailed, NeoSwap have the marketplace side sorted. NeoSwap are an AI-powered framework for hyper-efficient web3 commerce that allows you to find optimal multiway trades that redistribute assets and currency in a win-win-win manner.</p><p>This means that if you want to sell that student saucepan but need a new bucket, you can feed it into the Neoswap system, backed by the information and guarantees in the MAP, and the system will work out an outcome for you where the pan goes to someone who needs it, while you get a bucket from a third party who has one available, and maybe a bit of money changes hands as part of it. The warranties in the MAP are then triggered and the percentages due on resale go to the right people and everyone has what they need. Well, almost. We’ve got everything identified and guaranteed via the MAP, we’ve got a mechanism to sell it efficiently to someone who wants it, and while that’s fine if the product is purely digital, and NFT or something, but these are physical things; how do they get from my cupboard to your&nbsp;stove?</p><p>So, the postage issue. You do not really want to parcel the pan up, queue in the post office and pay to have the thing sent from Delhi to Croydon, and the buyer doesn’t want to have to read the small print like you do on eBay to find that, yes, they’ve paid 11 cents for a pan, but there’s also £25 postage. We’ve got everything slick and effective up to this point and now there’s a big “clunk” as the system falls&nbsp;over.</p><blockquote>The Spiral Economy can piggyback on existing logistics</blockquote><p>But there’s a solution here too, the Spiral Economy can piggyback on existing logistics that warehouses are using. Reverse Logistics. Huge volumes of stuff are going out to people’s homes in delivery vans, which then come back empty. There’s huge underused capacity there, and the plan is to use that reverse logistics capacity to move this stuff back and around again to get it to the people who have bought&nbsp;it.</p><p>Reverse logistics means that even the guy on the bike delivering your takeaway could take stuff back. You could use UberEats, DoorDash and all the rest of the systems that are currently there for food. That again, is an infrastructure that hasn’t been used, it’s very, very fast. It’s very cheap. It’s already got reverse logistics capacity because all those vans and bicycles and mopeds and so on are going back as well as forward. So the idea is that you order a curry, and this person comes and takes three things away with them at the same time as they’re delivering your curry. The stuff piles up in some corner of the restaurant and then the van comes around once every couple days and picks all of it&nbsp;up.</p><p>If you’re willing to piggyback on all the systems which do delivery or empty going back, it becomes possible to move a whole bunch of goods around the system, because you’ve got digital tracking so it’s possible to know where everything is at all times. And so you just never move an empty van. Because right now what happens is the van comes to deliver working goods, then you use the stuff, then it goes out and trash and then another system takes it away and everything is resolved — linear economy. With the spiral economy there’s only a single logistical network that carries value, rather than being one network that carries value and then a reverse network which carries garbage. The garbage network comes down to practically nothing. Cool, awesome. God intended.</p><blockquote>Mattereum’s system was created with AI in&nbsp;mind</blockquote><p>I keep mentioning AI; AI is kind of a big thing in all this. Mattereum’s system was created with AI in mind, whatever Mattereum can do, it does it massively more effectively with AI. I have mentioned our first AI partner, NeoSwap, and AI certifiers, and I’ve written much more about those and other AI opportunities <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/ai-oracles-super-empower-real-world-assets-on-the-blockchain-and-super-empower-ai-to-act-in-the-619aa2ba5bf1">elsewhere</a> but AI has a crucial role in the spiral economy too. First of all, there’s the transport business that I’ve just been talking about; imagine a NeoSwap style AI for working out the optimum way of getting your saucepan from you to the next user, factoring in the delivery guy bringing a pizza to next door, the van delivering the tank of olives to the restaurant, and so on, finding ways for it to leapfrog from one reverse logistics opportunity to another until it rocks up on the desired doorstep.</p><blockquote>MAPs give AIs ‘eyes’ to see things in the physical&nbsp;world.</blockquote><p>That’s without even thinking about how Mattereum makes it possible to use AI as an agent for finding things. You tell it what you want, and it goes out and finds it, whether it’s on eBay, IKEA, in the corner shop or on offer from someone on the other side of the world. To be able to find a thing and reliably buy it for you, an AI must be able to ‘see’ that the physical asset it is considering is truly a physical object that exists and will turn up on your doorstep tomorrow, and not a seductive digital chimaera designed to empty your wallet and vanish. Mattereum Asset Passports are exactly what AIs need for this, they link a digital twin to a real object with legal guarantees that what is described is actually the thing being advertised. AI’s instructed to just look for objects with MAPs will be guaranteed to be buying actual things that are exactly as described, which will provide an incentive for sellers to have MAPs for their assets, and once they do that, the objects are fully equipped to be sold and sold again through the spiral economy. MAPs give AIs ‘eyes’ to see things in the physical&nbsp;world.</p><blockquote>You get access to the entire logistical capacity of the&nbsp;city</blockquote><p>So one of the benefits of living inside of a big city in this future is that you get access to the entire logistical capacity of the city, both things moving backwards and forwards, but also the things which are simply being warehoused in your neighbour’s houses because you’re in a high density environment. And at that point, if the stuff is there, and it’s just waiting for you to come around and pick it up, you don’t even need the reverse logistics, you just go up the street and get it from the&nbsp;seller.</p><p>It can even work as a way to basically share stuff. You might be buying the stuff three or four times from the same person because you buy something off them and use it and then you get bored with it. You sell something to Bob and then Bob sells it back to you when you decide you want it again. Like think of video game consoles, where there are different games on each one of the major game systems. If you could very easily have access to all of the major game systems just by talking to your mates and you swap it with one person and another person. There you go. How much better is that result than the existing&nbsp;system?</p><blockquote>You can use it to find things in the&nbsp;house</blockquote><p>We don’t even have to stop there. If everything has a tag on it telling you what it is, you can use that to find it in the house, Suppose you want something you know you have but can’t find, you can scan the house for it’s NCF tag and go “oh, yeah — third box down in the box on top of the wardrobe” and go and get it. Never lose anything again. And even that can feed into the spiral economy. Imagine, when you get something you can add something to its MAP that defines how often you expect to use it, and if you don’t use it that frequently it comes up with a reminder asking if you really want to keep this thing. That way, instead of turning into <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=kipple">kipple</a> in the back of a cupboard, unused items prompt you to put them back into the spiral economy. You can have a constant churn of stuff in your life, without creating more environmental damage as a result of that churn. You make money, stuff gets used, you get a tidy house. Win all&nbsp;round.</p><blockquote>Eradicate waste and contribute to making our planet habitable again</blockquote><p>Mattereum has the potential to transform our relationship with the objects in our lives, to eradicate waste and contribute to making our planet habitable again by making it possible to track objects through the spiral economy and to use AI to the advantage of everyone from the manufacturer to the 100th&nbsp;user.</p> A future that works for all of&nbsp;us. <p>You might also want to take a look at what Mattereum’s Head of Design Kate Pincott s<a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/enabling-the-spiral-economy-b918df6e0cce">aid about the spiral economy</a> at the designFAO conference in Lisbon&nbsp;recently</p><p>If you are working on a Spiral Economy or AI project that you think could enhance or be enhanced by the Mattereum system get in touch with us via <a href="http://contact@mattereum.com">contact@mattereum.com</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/making-the-spiral-economy-a-reality-8a5930cc80cd">Making the Spiral Economy a Reality</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>According to the latest data, the crypto market has nearly 550 crypto exchanges and more than 22,000 unique crypto assets. The volume of users that deal with crypto assets is equally immense, with a few reports estimating the current number of crypto users worldwide to be more than<a href="https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership-data/"> 420&nbsp;million</a>.</p><p>With this many people engaged in the market, it is crucial to do proper identity management to avoid fraud and protect consumer rights. It is where the Know-Your-Customer (KYC) regime becomes vital in the crypto world while prioritizing user experience throughout the&nbsp;process.</p><p>Before moving forward with the topic of crypto KYC, we would like to reiterate that it is crucial to maintain a delicate balance between compliance and privacy user experience, which, if impacted, can deal a severe blow to the entire crypto ecosystem. This is the exact philosophy that Shyft Network believes in and works for while engaging with all stakeholders, be it Virtual Asset Service Providers, such as crypto exchanges, regulators, and&nbsp;more.</p> Understanding Know Your Customer for&nbsp;Crypto <p>KYC is the very crucial first step towards anti-money laundering due diligence. All financial institutions carry out KYC procedures when onboarding new customers to their platforms. Apart from a robust identity verification process, KYC also helps assess a customer’s risk profile and ascertain the financial risk-taking tendency of individuals.</p><p>When it comes to crypto assets, KYC is applicable to all types of Virtual Asset Service Providers (i.e., crypto exchanges, crypto wallet service providers, staking service providers, etc.).</p> KYC, Crypto Exchanges, and Digital Compliance <p>For crypto exchanges, crypto KYC is a process through which the exchange confirms its end users’ and customers’ personal information. It helps exchanges have a deeper understanding of the intention of their users and verify their legality. It also helps understand how probable it is for a customer to pose money laundering risks to an exchange or even to finance illicit activities.</p> What Does KYC Mean in Crypto Exchanges? <p>For crypto exchanges, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has recommended a risk-based approach for KYC compliance. The intensity of the compliance measure could increase or decrease depending on the customer’s risk&nbsp;profile.</p><p>Under this paradigm, exchanges should start by collecting and verifying identifiable customer information, such as their names, addresses, date of birth, and other relevant information. Once done with this process and onboarding is complete, exchanges should keep tracking their customers’ transactions regularly.</p><p>KYC is considered extremely efficient in preventing any potentially fraudulent or criminal activity. To fulfill their obligations, exchanges keep strict vigilance on unusual transaction patterns that are starkly different from the existing transaction style of a customer.</p><p>Cryptocurrency exchanges also monitor transactions that have high-risk customers as parties or involve locations considered to be high-risk. By doing so, they can track illicit cryptocurrency transactions.</p><p>Keeping consistent track of customers is also relevant because their status may change from time to time depending on the fluctuations in the larger scenario. For instance, they may suddenly come under international sanctions, get politically exposed, or be affected by negative news stories. These factors may result in customers becoming&nbsp;riskier.</p> What Does KYC Compliance Look Like for&nbsp;VASPs? <p>Virtual Asset Service Providers, which is a broader category that includes all crypto-related service providers such as exchanges and more, also have multi-step KYC programs. It starts with the collection of customers’ personally identifiable information, or PII, such as name, place, date of birth, address,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>The next step for the VASPs involves tallying or cross-checking the integrity of this information with available identification documents such as a passport or driver’s license, proof of residence, utility bill,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Then comes the step where VASPs must verify the customer against the list of sanctioned individuals or Politically Exposed&nbsp;Persons.</p> How Does KYC&nbsp;Work? <p>As discussed already, KYC is a process that involves a sequence of identity verification, customer monitoring, screening, and tracking.</p><p>It is a process that results in collecting and storing large amounts of private data. This data includes both digital customer and transaction data. For a decentralized, intermediary-free regime like web3 and crypto, it is sensible that this process runs through automation. And having a software solution embedded in the exchange or VASP terminal helps improve process speed, efficiency, and accuracy. Automation also helps in achieving scalability with&nbsp;depth.</p><p>For example, Shyft Veriscope is a fully automated FATF Travel Rule Solution that helps VASPs fulfill their Travel Rule regulatory obligations without any manual involvement from either the originator VASPs (read: crypto businesses from where the transaction is originating) or the beneficiary VASPs (read: crypto businesses receiving the transaction). Here’s what the entire process of Travel Rule compliance looks like for VASPs using Shyft Veriscope:</p><p>And given the evolving nature of the crypto world, we expect KYC checks to strengthen even further. That’s where automated processes help crypto firms offer enriched KYC compliance mechanisms that align with what the present era of cybersecurity demands.</p> Benefits of crypto&nbsp;KYC <p>Apart from an enhanced level of transparency and trust in the ecosystem, the benefits of KYC processes are multiple.</p> Improved customer transparency and&nbsp;trust <p>While most discussions on KYC compliance methods revolve around preventing fraud and protecting a provider from potential breaches or attacks, its benefits create a win-win proposition for both the provider and the user. Since KYC measures ensure a safe ecosystem, providers with a robust KYC mechanism offer a transparent system to the users. It also helps providers gain trust in the&nbsp;market.</p> Reduced risk of scams and money laundering <p>According to data, crypto frauds are increasing. Market estimates claim that between January and November 2022, cyber attackers stole cryptocurrency worth<a href="https://www.outlookindia.com/business/crypto-year-ender-here-s-a-look-at-major-crypto-scams-of-2022-news-249348"> US$4.3 billion</a> between January and November 2022. It was a growth of 37 percent compared to 2021. Having KYC processes in place will help reduce this volume. Resultantly, stability in the market will increase, and both the user and provider will make profits out of their dealings in this&nbsp;space.</p> Enhanced stability of the crypto&nbsp;market <p>It is also vital that the cryptocurrency market gains stability, as crypto assets are often marked by volatility. As an entirely new regime in concept and implementation, crypto assets often see price corrections resulting in market fluctuations. Adverse news of frauds and breaches in the market amplifies this volatility.</p><p>KYC compliance methods, ensuring a user population of verified customers and consumers, reduce the probability of having anonymous transactions in the market, resulting in a lessened chance of&nbsp;fraud.</p> Reduced legal&nbsp;risk <p>KYCs also empower exchanges with the competitive advantage that a secure business brings with it. Exchanges operating without robust KYC mechanisms not only live in fear of hacks and breaches resulting in losses worth millions of dollars but also stay vulnerable to regulatory changes.</p><p>Jurisdictions that are lenient today might tighten up their regulatory noose tomorrow. Businesses or providers that already adhere to a deeply thought-out KYC process can adjust to these regulatory compliance shifts faster, staying ahead of their competitors in the&nbsp;space.</p><p>That said, every crypto company must design its KYC process with users in mind. Compliance, although important, must not come at the expense of user experience and privacy. Both must be prioritized to provide a smooth transition to a regulated future from an unregulated one for the benefit of crypto&nbsp;users.</p> How Crypto Exchanges Handle Customer Data&nbsp;Safely? <p>Data security is a complex task. To keep their customer’s data safe, crypto exchanges must start with a robust data privacy and protection policy. Most cryptocurrency exchange websites have their privacy policy published on their website. Customers may go and check these pages in detail to understand whether the data handling is adequately safe or&nbsp;not.</p><p>Transparent dealing with third parties is also crucial in the safe handling of customer data. There are two types of third parties involved. The first is the partners who service cryptocurrency exchanges and service providers leverage to maintain their websites and process&nbsp;trades.</p><p>Since such an arrangement requires mutual sharing of data to an extent, exchanges must do it securely and safely. Many well-known exchanges share the name of such third parties on their privacy policy page or at some place on their website. It helps increase trust and transparency in the&nbsp;process.</p><p>There exists a second type of third party from which cryptocurrency exchanges and platforms gather information about their users. These types of third-party providers of information may include banks, government organizations, social networks, anti-fraud databases, public court documents, sanction lists, etc. For authentic and credible data, platforms collecting information must ensure that they use the latest data sources and cross-check from multiple terminals in compliance with bank secrecy acts, terrorist financing laws,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>When it comes to the compliant and secure exchange of cross-party information, Shyft Network’s one-of-a-kind Travel Rule Solution, Shyft Veriscope, enables VASPs to comply with the FATF Travel Rule by exchanging user KYC data with counterparty VASPs securely. And at no point does the user KYC data pass through Shyft’s internal servers, as the exchange of user data on Shyft Veriscope is exclusively done between VASPs in a peer-to-peer (P2P) mode.<a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-veriscope-the-critical-infrastructure-underpinning-fatf-travel-rule"> Click here</a> for more details on Shyft Veriscope.</p> Crypto Exchange KYC&nbsp;Risks <p>Like all scrutiny and identity verification processes, cryptocurrency exchanges also face risks often inherent to designing the KYC process. For instance, KYC requirements and similar due diligence processes often follow a check box approach without going deep about identifying the industry-specific requirements.</p><p>The process often lacks integration with the exchange’s operational model and stays only as a customary addition to abiding by the rules of the land, making the process inefficient. If the KYC technology is inefficient, it may take a lot of time to onboard a customer. It slows up the process and acts as a deterrent to new customer acquisition.</p><p>Since data sharing is involved in the process, the crypto exchange needs to have its data protection mechanism empower its KYC and Anti Money Laundering (AML) efforts to the fullest. Otherwise, investors and consumers using the platform stand the risk of compromising their personally identifiable information.</p> What Challenges do Crypto Exchanges Face With&nbsp;KYC? <p>The most prominent challenge that crypto exchanges face in implementing robust KYC regulations is the lack of homogeneity in the system. Different countries have different crypto laws. For an exchange to become international or global and facilitate crypto transactions between two counterparties sitting in different jurisdictions requires compliance with both laws. Divergence among countries implies that the crypto exchange would have to spend significant effort and resources in streamlining and consolidating its KYC&nbsp;policy.</p><p>Cryptocurrencies belong to an industry that is emergent and evolving. Even if an exchange chooses to operate within a single geography, it may face changing regulatory paradigms from time to time, raising the need for constant updates in the KYC procedure and technological changes.</p> Do Crypto Wallets Need KYC Compliance? <p>KYCs help the industry to become more secure. Every day, countries are introducing new crypto regimes. The EU is coming up with Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation. Crypto service providers are becoming increasingly compliant with KYC needs so that there is no deviation from what the international and global regulators want. It makes them safe and efficient and increases trust among users. Yet, there exist some crypto wallets that do not require KYC and cater to people who want to stay anonymous.</p> Can you buy Crypto&nbsp;Wit  hout KYC? <p>It is still possible to buy crypto without KYC. There are P2P platforms, Decentralized Crypto Exchanges, and some major exchanges that allow buying crypto without&nbsp;KYC.</p><p>______________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to begin complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>Is history repeating itself or if we’re operating in a context that we’re just not aware of?</p>
<p>Looking throughout history was a helpful lens that Tim and I took throughout this conversation to come up with some interesting thoughts to help answer the above question.</p>
 
 Whoever owns the ledger has the power. 
 Ledgers are records of knowledge. 
 Knowledge can be described as claims or balances. 
 The administration of the claims (e.g., Identity) and balances (e.g., Money) shifts between centralized and decentralized over time. 
 Technology advancements shift the dispersion of knowledge, which shifts power dynamics. 
 
<blockquote><p>As Mark Twain once said that “History never repeats itself, but it does often rhyme.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>We’re hopeful that this conversation can help us understand the present a bit better, while helping us foresee where things are heading in the future.</p>
<p>In this podcast episode with Tim Bouma, we discuss,</p>
 
 Why is understanding your context and others’ contexts important important to prioritize in life? 
 How Tim’s new mental model has helped him better understand context, identity, trust and more (model linked below in resource section). 
 The relationship between roots of trust and the centralization/decentralization of societal administration.&nbsp; 
 How we can look at life through two realms: the physical and imaginary realms. How have these two realms evolved throughout history. 
 The origin of personal names! 
 Understanding how registries of claims and balances work and are managed. 
 How the transfer/unlocking of new knowledge has been a catalyst for power dynamic shifts throughout history. 
 Why architectures are important in shaping culture, beliefs, values, intentions, etc. 
 Should we focus less on identity and more on context? 
 How the separation of cryptography-driven protocols from applications shifts knowledge, which in turn shifts power dynamics.

<p>Two weeks ago we published Holochain Beta 0.1.0, an app-stable beta release, which is the next significant leap for Holochain development.</p><p>Today we’ve released a powerful bag of developer tools designed to make it easy to develop a wide variety of P2P apps. With Holochain at their core, these apps will have the capacity to scale up and deliver experiences similar to the Web2 paradigms we’re familiar with.</p><p>Remember when Rails came out with its scaffolding and what that did for building Web2 apps? It only took ten minutes to scaffold an app and have it running. The Holochain CLI scaffolding is just as powerful, but for the Web3 world.</p><p>Now that Holochain Beta 0.1.0 is fully functional and the multiple components and developer tools have been updated to this version, it is time to start building — easily and with confidence.</p><p>Install and try out the updated developer experience with our <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/quick-start/">Quick Start Guide</a>. And for the deep details check out the <a href="https://github.com/holochain">Holochain </a>GitHub org.</p> What this means for developers <p>The alpha releases of Holochain have seen a lot of API churn, with both our team and app devs constantly updating code. While this is great, because it’s been driven by the needs of real Holochain app (hApp) developers, it’s made things challenging for those same developers who often found themselves needing to rework their code instead of working on new features.</p><p>The entire Holochain 0.1.x release series will not have any breaking changes in the HDK and conductor APIs — only bug fixes and potentially new features. The database format and networking protocols may change between releases, but these will be handled automatically if users update their Launcher (see below).</p><p>Essentially this means that the hApp you write now will still work in half a year, no matter what 0.1.x Holochain version your hApp’s users have installed.</p> Dev Portal update <p>In addition to new tools, we are releasing <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/">a refreshed Dev Portal</a>. One of the Holochain Foundation’s primary missions is to ensure that information about our technology is open and accessible. As the new Dev Portal comes online, we invite you to jump in and check out the new knowledge base.</p> New and improved developer tools <p>To support your goal of rapidly prototyping, testing, maturing, and distributing your hApps, we’ve been working hard on a collection of tools. These are the kinds of tools you’d expect from a Web2 stack, and now Holochain’s peer-to-peer software stack has them too. &nbsp;The key tools include:</p>  Holonix: A shell environment with all the tools you’ll need to develop hApps. Holonix has <a href="https://hackmd.io/BKCt3FckSiSDJ4aSJ1Ur6A">recently been retooled</a> to better support macOS and Windows, and has gotten some improvements to dependency management along the way.  Scaffolding: A new rapid application development CLI that lets you define your data schema and generate boilerplate code for the back end, UI (in four different JavaScript front-end flavors), and tests within minutes.  Tryorama: A Node.js-based test framework with which you can write both unit tests and end-to-end multi-party tests.  <code>hc</code> CLI tool: Bundles backend and UI code into one file for easy distribution, as well as launching a test net on your workstation.  DevHub: A hApp for distributing hApp packages to people via the Holochain App Store.  Launcher: An easy-to-use UI that lets people search for, install, and run hApps. With the Launcher release will come a couple demo productivity hApps, distributed via DevHub, that we’re already using to manage some of our internal work.  <p>Over the coming weeks we’ll be dropping blogs detailing each of the new tools so you have clear guides on how to integrate them into your work.</p> Dev training opportunity <p>In March we have a unique education opportunity for Rust devs to <a href="https://www.holochain.org/holochain-developer-training-2/">learn Holochain</a>, led by the Co-founder of HackReactor. With a stable beta, now is the time to learn and grow with the ecosystem.</p> What now? <p>Holochain Beta 0.1.0 has been a huge leap forward for our team and community, and we appreciate your commitment to being on this journey with us. But this is just the start. To support our growing community, we are finishing an updated white paper and already working on a beta 0.2.0 with enhancements to network security and performance, along with any breaking API, SDK, or protocol changes that are discovered to be necessary or useful.</p><p>Beta 0.1.0 will be supported for the next six months, so whatever advancements come alongside it, we are providing a stable release and the opportunity to build in earnest. We are excited for what you will create.</p>

  <p>In diesem Webinar lernen Sie:</p>
 
 Warum Zugriffskontrollen auch über Systemgrenzen hinweg funktionieren müssen und nicht auf SAP-Systeme beschränkt sein können 
 Wie IGA-Lösungen effektive Risikoanalysen und Zugriffskontrollen für SAP und andere kritische Anwendungen in einer Gesamtsicht ermöglichen 
 Welche Informationen im Fokus der Risikoanalyse sein müssen 
 Wie man die Sicherheit von Systemen und Daten durch Risikoanalyse und Zugriffskontrollen erhöhen und automatisiert steuern kann 
 
<p>Kai Boschert, Senior Advisor bei KuppingerCole Analysts, gibt einen Überblick über das sich verändernde SAP-Ökosystem und für Geschäftsanwendungen (LoB, Line of Business Applications), aber auch weitere Systeme, die mit Blick auf Funktionstrennung, Zugriffskontrolle und Risikoanalyse mit einbezogen werden. Er nennt wesentliche Anforderungen an moderne Lösungen und vergleicht Lösungsansätze von auf SAP-Umgebungen spezialisierten Lösungen bis hin zu offenen IGA-Systemen bezüglich ihrer Eignung, heutige und zukünftige IT-Infrastrukturen zu bedienen.</p>
<p>Klaus Hild, Principal Identity Strategist bei SailPoint und Sven Pieper, Operations Director bei Turnkey Consulting, gehen dann im Detail darauf ein, wie man risikobehaftete Zugriffsberechtigungen und deren Nutzung in SAP-Umgebungen analysieren kann, wie sich regulatorische Vorgaben einhalten lassen und Notfallzugriffe umgesetzt werden können, ohne dass dafür spezialisierte Lösungen nur für die SAP-Welt zum Einsatz kommen. Der Fokus liegt dabei auf IGA-integrierten Lösungsansätzen, die die gesamte Bandbreite von LoB-Applikationen unterstützen.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/sap-access-governance-iga"></a>

				  Our regular look at the stories making news from around the decentralized identity community. In this edition, we look at the real focus behind digital wallets, “super apps” and “super credentials,” and the ongoing efforts to provide regulations around digital identity.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbirch/2023/02/01/the-wallet-wars-are-not-about-money-they-are-about-identity/?sh=1cdb0e9c314a">The Wallet Wars Are Not About Money, They Are About Identity</a></p>
<p>David G.W. Birch, a contributor to Forbes magazine shares his thoughts and some insightful statistics into how far digital wallets have already ingrained themselves into our society. For example, a recent study by <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/perspectives/2022/digital-payment-landscape-2022/">Mastercard</a> revealed that “around half of all Brits think that physical wallets will become less relevant, with a fifth of them (and two-fifths of millennials) saying that they do not expect to carry a wallet or a purse within five years.”</p>
<p>The article goes on to discuss the continuing decline of cash, referencing the <a href="https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/system/files/2022-08/UKF%20Payment%20Markets%20Summary%202022.pdf">UK Financial payment Markets Summary</a> and its findings that 10 years ago, 60% of payments were made in cash, and we are on track for that number to fall to 6% by 2031. With people using less cash, there is, frankly, only one reason left to carry a wallet and that is for your identification. Carrying a driver’s license or a membership card still has value for the moment, but with credentials offering a more secure, more convenient alternative, it’s likely only a matter of time before the physical wallet is a relic of the past.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/2022/12/16/super-app-definition-guide/">What is a Super App?</a></p>
<p>Connie Chan writes for a16z defines a super app as “an application that builds upon its core functionality to mix and mash a bunch of seemingly unrelated services.” The term has been gaining in currency, usually in reference to Meta, Microsoft, and Twitter as each tries to provide convenience to their customers by having everything run through their one application. The poster child for these kinds of apps is WeChat, which comes out of China. Through one interface, users have access to texting, city services, utility payment, and even streaming videos.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is everyone going to migrate to one of a few super apps and do everything within one platform architecture— or would it make more sense to use “super” credentials created from strict identity assurance processes to be able to access any platform or service you choose? The distinction isn’t just about freedom to roam an open internet, although that is a powerful argument in favor of credentials over apps; it’s also about who gets to access your data and where your data is stored.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To read a little more on how Indicio see’s super credential technology progressing you can read this <a href="https://indicio.tech/five-verifiable-data-predictions-for-2023/">recent article</a> by Indicio CEO Heather Dahl and VP of Governance Trevor Butterworth.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/security-and-risk/2023/digital-id-and-kyc-platforms-potent-weapons-against-accounts-receivable-fraud/">Latin America Challenges Asia as Super App and Digital Payments Innovation Leader</a></p>
<p>In this summary of a recent interview between Karen Webster of PYMNTS and Francisco Leon, CEO of PayU Latam, we learn that Latin America is looking to position itself as a leader in the global economy through innovations in payments and partnership technologies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pointing to Latin America having a high smartphone penetration, Leon says that this area is “an ideal proving ground for super apps and new forms of instant payments, from P2P to the growing use cases around ‘person to merchant’ (P2M).” The combination of many people with access to smartphones and many small-to-medium-sized businesses creates the need for partnerships and platforms to find these businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PayU is working to be the secure payment method that makes the whole experience quick and easy for the end user on these applications. Leon says the driving force behind many of these partnerships is the recent economic downturn; with fewer investors able to offer funding, new businesses have been forced to adapt and realize that, even if they are working with a competitor, “a rising tide lifts all boats.”&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202301/uk-govt-urged-to-step-up-role-in-digital-id-as-public-good-at-westminster-eforum">UK govt urged to step up role in digital ID as public good at Westminster eForum</a></p>
<p>In Biometric Update, Frank Hersey summarizes the latest discussion on public policy and digital identity held by <a href="https://www.westminsterforumprojects.co.uk/conferences/westminster-eforum">Westminster’s eForum</a>. TechUK, a trade body, argued for interoperability—both for public and private digital identity and for international interoperability as a foundation for building public trust and confidence; a framework to deliver that interoperability was urgent. Iproov, a leading biometrics company, called for political leadership to channel the innovation and policy discussion around digital identity. The lack of political engagement means that no decision has been made on embedding verifiable credentials in digital identity wallets, something the EU has decided to do. Hersey’s summary continues with discussion on the state of fraud and the need to take the security problem away from users and give them technology that solves the problem. There’s lots more and this is well worth a read to get a sense of how important digital identity is becoming.</p>

<p>YeshID Intro</p>
<p>We asked one of our design partners, Chris Hodson, to chat a bit about what security practices look like for startups. If you don’t know Chris - you absolutely should! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Chris is the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cyberhaven-appoints-chris-hodson-as-chief-security-officer-301734672.html">,Chief Security Officer for Cyberhaven</a>. Prior to Cyberhaven, Chris held cybersecurity leadership roles at Contentful, Tanium, and Zscaler.  In addition, Hodson serves as a board advisor at the workforce development platform Cybrary and is a fellow of the Chartered Institute of Information Security. He is also the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cyber-Risk-Management-Prioritize-Vulnerabilities/dp/0749498781">,Cyber Risk Management</a>, a number-one bestseller on Amazon.</p>

<p>Practical Advice</p>
<p>No matter your company’s growth phase, you should apply the principles of good security. What’s “good security” for one company is overkill for another and inadequate for a third. Good security depends on a company's risk level and tolerance. Every company must implement the security controls required by location, industry, and other legal obligations. But that’s the minimum. Many companies don’t proactively and regularly assess likely threats and vulnerabilities and determine their acceptable level of risk. Fortunately, compliance frameworks are starting to address this issue.</p>

<p>Implementing basic security measures for a startup does not require a ton of cash or an army of people. It simply requires ruthlessly prioritizing implementation. No founder has time to dig into standards such as <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/">OWASP ASVS</a> or <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/risk-management/sp800-53-controls/release-search#/">NIST 800-53</a> to figure out what to prioritize. And to make matters worse, the standards have different methods for prioritizing. With cybersecurity being such a broad discipline, where do you start? Is application security more important than infrastructure hardening?  When should I think about penetration testing?  And…someone please tell me what a purple team is!
</p>
<p>Don’t worry! Hopefully, I can provide some very practical guidance for startups to get “good security” in place without breaking the bank or killing the schedule. A lot of this basic hygiene revolves around identity and access management. I’ll summarize the basics into four areas:</p> 
   Visibility: understanding your identity footprint 
   Authentication: Fortifying credentials with multi-factor authentication 
   Controlling: Defining and mapping sensitive data while implementing access restrictions for important systems 
   Responding: Monitoring and having a plan for dealing with to security incidents 
 <p>Visibility - understanding your identity footprint</p>
<p>You’ve got to know who is accessing what applications…and how. This is important for your security and IT team and your finance team will love you for it. In other words, can you identify the credentials being used to access your business applications? </p>

<p>Like everything, visibility is a journey. You can get basic visibility fairly quickly in most of the default dashboards, such as <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/9176657?hl=en">,Google Workspace</a>. As a security professional, I am particularly concerned about credentials: Are company credentials being used to log into or used through OAuth/OIDC to grant access to third-party apps and plugins that you are not aware of? If your company uses "login with Google" everywhere, are you sure that users are not accidentally delegating access to poorly configured or <a href="https://virtualizationreview.com/articles/2020/11/02/fake-apps.aspx">,malicious services</a>?</p>

<p>Authentication - fortifying credentials with multi-factor authentication</p>
<p>Please ensure that MFA is enabled everywhere. Yes…everywhere. MFA is simple and relatively easy to implement. Why settle for single-factor authentication anywhere?  Look at the recent security incident at <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/lastpass-breach-vaults-password-managers/">,LastPass</a>, where cybercriminals managed to obtain the vaults containing all the passwords and secrets. The vaults are typically protected with a single factor - password - and now hackers have all the time in the world to brute-force the vault. While I’m sure you’re NOT an average netizen, one that has a weak password that’s reused often, it’s worth a check nonetheless: <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">,https://haveibeenpwned.com/</a>!  </p>

<p>The level of security needed for MFA should be based on the sensitivity of the asset or environment. Is SMS-based MFA suitable for securing production cloud infrastructure? No. Is it suitable for personal access to my podcast service? Probably. The bottom line is that don't make it easy for attackers to access your systems. It's not worth the risk.</p>

<p>No security solution is infallible.  In the case of multi-factor, opting for the lowest barrier to entry is demonstrably <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/95-of-coinbase-users-rely-on-sms-based-2fa-account-takeover-stats-reveal">,more susceptible</a> to being exploited. Time to consider your cyber risk equation. SMS-based MFA serves as an additional hurdle for a would-be adversary to navigate, but one that persistent, capable cybercriminals are becoming more adept at bypassing. Where you can remove cellular networks from your MFA strategy, that’s a good move!  For the most sensitive of credentials and system access, try to find solutions that require you to have something physically in your possession – a hardware key, a phone’s secure enclave…something that cannot be stolen by clicking on a carefully-crafted phishing link or delivered to a sim-swapped cellphone! Just <a href="https://www.yeshid.com/post/give-passwords-the-finger">,give passwords the finger</a>.</p>

<p>Controlling - Defining and mapping sensitive data while implementing access restrictions for important systems</p>
<p>Lots of companies take a set-and-forget approach to data protection.  Their information protection strategy is predicated on knowing and defining all their sensitive data repositories and creating clunky pattern-matching rules.  Little focus is applied to knowing how data flows or the multitude of identities interacting with information.</p>

<p>To qualify what is ‘good enough’ requires a holistic understanding of the applications, identities, and information usage in your company.  What is sensitive, who has access to it and how do they use it?  When you know what you’re trying to protect  — along with its relative sensitivity and attractiveness to cybercriminals — it is easier to evaluate your tolerance for security-vs-usability.</p>

<p>When working with business stakeholders, try to decompose their business processes into a layered model of applications, infrastructure, and data.  From there, evaluate how and where identities are consumed.  We’re here today to focus on identity controls but for more on building risk management strategies, you might be interested in some of my <a href="https://medium.com/@stods21/how-to-engage-with-the-c-suite-on-cyber-risk-management-1e5fbe07545f">,other musings</a>.</p>

<p>Responding - Monitoring and having a plan for dealing with security incidents</p>
<p>Inevitably, it happens to all of us - an incident. Ideally, the incident is a detected attack with evidence it’s been thwarted. But sometimes you are concerned that something malicious happened on your watch. It is helpful to have a forensic record that can be used in the event of a security incident where credentials could have been compromised or misused. When you have the option, log, log, log. </p>

<p>Also, have an incident response process defined and make sure it’s tested.  When you’re evaluating business continuity plans for your company, try to align scenarios with situations that your executives would care about</p>

<p>My last thoughts</p>
<p>Implementing basic security measures for startups does not have to be a costly or time-consuming process. By understanding your internet presence, enabling multi-factor authentication everywhere, applying granular controls and access restrictions for important systems, and regularly monitoring and having an incident response plan in place, you can significantly improve the security of your company without spending a lot of your well-raised cash. </p>

<p>Security is a practice, not a one-time event. Time to practice the basics!</p>

<p>While phishing and network attacks are still the most common hacks around, old-fashioned system hacking is still a threat to enterprises.</p>
<p>What is credential dumping? It is when a hacker uses exploits to expose authentication credentials that they can use or sell.</p>
 Who Authenticates the Authenticators–Storing Credentials 
<p>When we talk about authentication, we typically talk about identity verification from the outside in–a specific paradigm in which we can offload a significant amount of responsibility to end users. This is not so when it comes to securing authentication credentials.</p>
<p>Usernames, passwords, and PINs must be stored somewhere, and this somewhere is usually in a few specific places. Larger application and system-wide credentials (particularly those associated with online accounts) will often exist in databases. System passwords, such as those with local access to a machine or network, will be stored on a local database or filesystem.</p>
<p>Credential dumping triggers a release of these passwords so that a hacker can steal them for further use. In both cases (databases or local storage), the hacker will use some sort of leverage (like a bug) to force the exposure of password information (called a “dump”).</p>
<p>Let’s dig a little deeper. Some of the common sources from which a credential dump can be triggered include:</p>
 
 Database Dump: A hacker triggers the exposure of critical tables from a database containing user authentication information. Typical approaches include MySQL injections or malformed URLs, like those used in the recent Log4Shell exploit of Java servers. Database dumps will (if the database manager is practicing good security hygiene) include hashed passwords rather than plain text, which means the attacker will still have to crack the hashing algorithm. 
 Security Accounts Manager (SAM): SAM is a database file used on Windows since XP to authenticate system users. It is usually encrypted, but like a database dump, once in a hacker’s possession, they can take their time in breaking the encryption. 
 Local Security Authority (LSA): LSA handles local authentication and security policies and utilizes an area in memory called “LSA Secrets” that protects authentication credentials. This storage area is typically encrypted. 
 Active Directory: Active Directory supports several kinds of authentication, from user login to certificate management and federated authentication services. Authentication credentials are stored in an Active Directory database. 
 
<p>One common factor that astute readers may have noticed is that all of these credential storage locations use hashing and/or encryption. If hackers steal the database, they still have to penetrate the encryption.</p>
<p>An additional, more insidious form of credential dumping can steal plain text passwords in real-time. Since user credentials have to live in RAM for specific and critical operating system tasks, the hacker can exploit some components and dump a password directly to a terminal or text file.</p>
<p>Common attacks that can lead to a credential dump include:</p>
 
 Zero-Day Exploits: Zero-day exploits are those that have just been found, meaning they are not patched. Hackers with knowledge of zero-day bugs in systems may leverage them to gain admin access to a piece of software or system. 
 Unpatched Software: A zero-day exploit at least gives software developers and admins an excuse since it’s brand new. But it is unfortunate that many hardware, software, and platforms end up unpatched even when critical security updates become available. 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/email-phishing/">Social Engineering:</a> If hackers can use email to access an administrator’s system, they have full reign to expose passwords. Phishing attacks are typically the front-line for most hacks, and can serve as the first sign of further attacks. 
 
<p><a href="https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/techniques/credential-dumping/">According to MITRE ATT&amp;CK,</a> several popular and widespread utilities are used for credential dumping, including the trendsetting and open-source mimikatz utility.</p>
 Why Is Credential Dumping Such a Major Problem? 
<p>Any attack that exposes system credentials presents a significant problem to overall system security and integrity. But dumping provides an additional issue in that these attacks use multiple avenues to get into these credentials in a way that system management or users may never know.</p>
<p>Some of the common problems will include:</p>
 
 Total System or Account Control: Dumping local security credentials means losing control of that system. Following that, the hacker is free to install malware, place monitoring software that doesn’t register as malware, or use the computer as a zombie machine in a large botnet. 
 Lateral System Movement: In a system of network computers, a hacker with local security or Active Directory credentials can move throughout the network with the same privileges and authority as the associated user. One of the critical components of an <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/advanced-persistent-threat/">Advanced Persistent Threat (APTs)</a> is the ability to move laterally through a network to attack other systems. 
 Business Account Phishing Attacks: If the hacker gains access to credentials that are shared or reused across enterprise accounts, then they have plenty of leeway to use those accounts to, for example, send emails or direct messages as a user throughout an organization to steal other credentials. 
 The Credentials Black Market: The worst part of a database dump? The propensity of hackers to sell databases, cracked or uncracked, on the dark web. Once these databases are in the wild, it’s only a short time after that these credentials will be signed up for random services or serve as targets for password spraying attacks. 
 
 How Can I Prevent Credential Dumping Attacks? 
<p>In terms of prevention, we run into a more diverse set of best practices as compared to narrow attacks like password guessing or phishing. The fact is that, in some cases, dumping attacks can come through vectors that admins don’t even know about.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean your company shouldn’t follow every possible security practice necessary to prevent the issue. Some of the most important practices to put into place include:</p>
 
 Patch Your Operating Systems and Network Software: Always, always, always patch hardware and software as soon as security alerts come out. These patches are almost always released on the tail end of a security breach or zero-day exploit, and these patches must be installed. 
 Force Use of Unique Credentials: If an employee uses the same credentials across several platforms or systems, then a dump will render all those accounts vulnerable. A crafty hacker can use those credentials, try them across these platforms, and essentially take control of them. By forcing the changing of credentials with unique passphrases, you can reduce the chance of a credential dump affecting other systems. 
 Secure Administrator Passwords: Administrator passwords are essentially the keys to the kingdom. Most security experts recommend using a local admin password solution on top of other advanced security. Additionally, these credentials are best stored off public networks and, where possible, tied to physical media authentication tools (like authentication keys). 
 
<p>Additionally, you can take a few effective steps on the user side to reduce the impact of a credential dump should it lead to hackers gaining access to the system. These include:</p>
 
 Force MFA for All Authentication: While MFA will most likely not stop a hacker who has snuck into a system via a zero-day, it can halt outside attacks. More importantly, MFA can halt a hacker in their tracks if they attempt to move laterally to a system that requires a secondary authentication factor. 
 Use Passwordless Authentication: If someone steals a password from a local system, does passwordless even help? Yes and no. Passwordless is more of a solution for software and platforms, and as such they essentially eliminate the weakness of a password as it relates to the overall network or app security. Much like MFA, utilizing <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/passwordless-authentication/">passwordless authentication</a> can fence in hackers attempting to leverage dumped credentials. 
 Operate Using Principles of Least Privilege and Zero-Trust: Most mission-critical systems in the industrial and government sectors are turning to PoLP and zero-trust specifically to minimize the impact of a vulnerable user account. Depending on your organization’s work and the data processed, this might be the right path for you as well.

We use the CLI wallet for Verus. <a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/releases/tag/v0.9.6-1">Download here</a> 🔗 You can also use Verus Desktop with its incorporated terminal.</p> The Verus-Ethereum Bridge <p>👉 All tokens and currencies flowing over the bridge are never in anyone’s custody, and are proven and verified by consensus rules.</p><p>The Verus-Ethereum bridge is the first of its kind. Because it is permissionless, non-custodial and provable. We&nbsp;can:</p>  send and receive ETH and ERC-20s to and from Verus and&nbsp;Ethereum  send and receive currencies launched on Verus to and from&nbsp;Ethereum  convert currencies through the bridge converter currency. Use on Ethereum as well as on Verus. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/definecurrency/#bridge-converter-launches">Learn more on bridge converter currencies</a> 🔗   Defining a&nbsp;Currency <p>Defining a currency on the Verus network is simple, just two commands are all you need. When the currency is successfully launched it can flow around within the protocol, and outside of the protocol (like an ERC-20, in our example). Let’s get&nbsp;started.</p> VerusID Namespace <p>Before defining the currency, we already registered the VerusID MaxUSDC@. This cost us 100 VRSCTEST (or 80 when using a referral), which were distributed to the block producers. These costs can drastically vary depending on which PBaaS-chain you create a&nbsp;VerusID.</p><p>VerusID is the namespace for currencies and PBaaS-blockchains, among many other things. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/verusid/">Learn more about VerusID</a>&nbsp;🔗</p> Defining the mapped&nbsp;currency <p>Defining a currency costs 200 VRSCTEST. These costs can change depending on which blockchain you want to define a currency. When launching PBaaS-chains you can define your own costs in the chains’ native currency. Good to know: these costs are going to the miners and stakers of the blockchain.</p><p>With a few simple commands we&nbsp;will:</p>  Define a currency mapped to the USDC Ethereum contract with a registered namespace (VerusID) on the Verus Testnet blockchain  Export the currency to Ethereum through <a href="https://ethtest.verus.services/">the non-custodial, provable bridge</a>&nbsp;🔗  <p>Before we can define the currency which is mapped to USDC on Ethereum, we must fund MaxUSDC@ with enough VRSCTEST to launch the currency. And after that with enough vETH or VRSCTEST to pay for the gas fees that export the currency to Ethereum.</p><p>200+ VRSCTEST to launch the currency, and around 0.05 vETH or equivalent worth of VRSCTEST to export the currency to Ethereum.</p><p>Fund your VerusID with vETH in two&nbsp;ways:</p>  Send ETH to Verus (into vETH) with <a href="https://ethtest.verus.services/">the Verus-Ethereum bridge</a>&nbsp;🔗  Convert VRSCTEST or any other currency into vETH using Verus’ protocol level DeFi <a href="https://docs.verus.io/sendcurrency/sendcurrency-examples.html#converting">more info on how to convert</a>&nbsp;🔗  <p>The command that defines our currency MaxUSDC, which is mapped to the ERC-20 USDC (Goerli Testnet) <a href="https://goerli.etherscan.io/token/0x98339D8C260052B7ad81c28c16C0b98420f2B46a?a=0xc2c3c5597e0ef59a92f04a70c8af9f8b8cb342e9">contract address on Etherscan</a> 🔗, is as&nbsp;follows:</p> ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{<br> "name":"MaxUSDC", <br> "options":32, <br> "systemid":"veth", <br> "parent":"vrsctest", <br> "launchsystemid":"vrsctest", <br> "nativecurrencyid":{<br>   "type":9, <br>   "address":"0x98339D8C260052B7ad81c28c16C0b98420f2B46a"<br>   }, <br> "initialsupply":0, <br> "proofprotocol":3<br>}' <p>⭐ To learn more about the many different launch options when defining a currency on Verus, <a href="https://docs.verus.io/definecurrency/">go here</a> 🔗 We encourage anyone to start testing the protocol to get ahead of the game. <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">The community is happy to help on Discord</a>&nbsp;🔗</p><p>When we do the command above we get returned a HEX. Only after we make a transaction with the HEX, will the currency launch be broadcasted to the network. See&nbsp;below:</p> ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendrawtransaction "hex" <p>Now you can see the currency on the Verus network. We just need to make sure it’s on Ethereum as&nbsp;well.</p> Exporting the mapped&nbsp;currency <p>Now, let’s export the currency from Verus to Ethereum as an ERC-20 over the non-custodial bridge. We do this with the following command:</p> ./verus chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "MaxUSDC@" '[{<br>  "address":"0xAD84C9EE28FB4c3b9C6ef1B86D1ED00A82DB84E9", <br>  "currency":"MaxUSDC", <br>  "amount":0, <br>  "exportto":"veth", <br>  "exportcurrency":true, <br>  "feecurrency":"veth"<br>}]' <p>Note: the first MaxUSDC@ field is the change address for fees being returned to you, and the address is the Verus-Ethereum non-custodial smart contract bridge address. You can also omit feecurrency if you would rather pay the export fees in VRSCTEST.</p><p>After the bridge has been notarized to the blockheight where you have exported the currency, you can choose it from the token dropdown <a href="https://ethtest.verus.services/">on the bridge website</a>&nbsp;🔗.</p> ERC-20s on&nbsp;Verus <p>After sending from Ethereum to Verus, the token is free to move through the Internet of Value on the Verus network, across PBaaS-blockchains, and also back &amp; forth with Ethereum.</p><p>As easily as the token was first defined and launched, it can now become one of the reserves in a multi-reserve liquidity basket AMM as part of Verus&nbsp;DeFi.</p><p>Anybody can define a multi-reserve currency which includes MaxUSDC as a reserve with weighted percentage (10–90%). The reserves grow as they retain a small fee whenever assets are traded in/out/through.</p><p>A multi-reserve currency itself can also be used as one of the reserves in another multi-reserve liquidity basket AMM token on&nbsp;Verus.</p><p>👀 Stay tuned for more on this later, or start reading <a href="http://docs.verus.io">docs.verus.io</a>, or <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">join the Discord to&nbsp;learn</a>.</p><p>🫡 Credits for the article go to community member ‘ejuliano’.</p><p>➡️ <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">Explore with the community on&nbsp;Discord</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/VerusCoin">Follow on&nbsp;Twitter</a></p><p><a href="http://www.verus.io/">Go to&nbsp;verus.io</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/get-ahead-of-the-game-with-verus-groundbreaking-1-1-decentralized-currency-mapping-for-erc-20-cc23584a7037">Get Ahead of the Game with Verus’ Groundbreaking 1:1 Decentralized Currency Mapping for ERC-20…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin">Verus Coin</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 What’s your name and where are you&nbsp;from? <p>I’m Alvin Abalos and I am from the Philippines. I joined Ontology’s community in&nbsp;2018.</p> Tell us a bit about yourself. What are your&nbsp;hobbies? <p>I am the Ontology community admin for the Philippines. I am a crypto enthusiast, but beyond that, I like games and&nbsp;anime.</p> What kind of work do you do on a day-to-day basis? <p>I answer community questions and help to guide newcomers on the platform. I also add new community members. To make sure I’m always up to speed with everything that’s going on in blockchain and crypto, I also like to browse Twitter and other social media platforms for the latest crypto updates and&nbsp;news.</p> In your opinion, what makes Ontology stand out from other blockchains? <p>I believe that Ontology’s decentralized identity offerings are what make it stand out. Not many other projects host this service. I also think the network’s EVM compatibility is a key differentiator.</p> What has been the most important moment in your career so&nbsp;far? <p>The day I started in Ontology must be the most important moment, it helped me a lot to grow in crypto and as a person, and to gain friends around the world. It’s a great community and I’m really excited about having an Ontology reunion, where all members of the community gather from around the world to hang out in&nbsp;person.</p> As we mark Ontology’s five-year anniversary, where do you see Ontology and Web3 going in the next five&nbsp;years? <p>I think Ontology has huge potential and I personally predict that it will be among the top 100 projects, if not the top 50 in this space within the next five&nbsp;years.</p> Follow us on social&nbsp;media! <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/meet-the-team-community-admin-for-the-philippines-alvin-abalos-e4cd99992838">Meet the Team: Community Admin for the Philippines, Alvin Abalos</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>At Onfido, we use AI to automate digital identity verification for 800+ businesses worldwide. Our proprietary AI has been built over ten years by a dedicated team of hundreds of researchers and engineers to make our analysis fair, fast and accurate. In most cases, the verification is done using a photo of a government-issued document and matching it with facial biometrics. Processing a diverse set of identity documents poses a significant challenge for building a reliable AI engine that accurately catches fraud. Onfido strives to build a better risk engine while not compromising on automation rates.</p><p>Onfido’s unique AI engine combines machine learning models to automate as many verifications as possible and enable our clients to onboard as many customers as possible without letting fraudulent ones through. Understanding the incremental value of different product initiatives is key to improving our&nbsp;AI.</p> Automation Structural Causal&nbsp;Model <p>We needed to create a model that would provide a high-level overview of our document verification product and would allow us to understand what effect on automation we would get by influencing different parts of our business.</p><p>We turned to Causal Inference because it aims at answering causal questions and estimating causal effects. Structural Causal Models have two key elements: a graph (DAG) representing the causal structure and a set of equations (Structural Equation&nbsp;Model).</p><p>We started with creating a graph of the document verification product. From the point a document is submitted for verification, Onfido’s AI needs to first identify the document, extract appropriate fields and features for fraud detection and generate a result. In some cases, the automation may not be able to create a conclusive result, and a human agent may need to finalise the verification process.</p><p>The graph has two main flows: automated (Onfido’s AI) in green and manual (human agents) in amber. The product consists of different components, grouped logically by the way they impact the auto-completion rate.</p><p>Formally, a causal graph specifies a factorisation of the joint probability distribution of&nbsp;data:</p><p>The next step was to formalise the relationship between variables. Let N be the number of checks submitted for document verification. Enter a Structural Equation Model&nbsp;(SEM):</p><p>We used simple regression models without additive error terms for the modelling. Structural equations provide an alternative representation of the factorisation of probability distributions mentioned earlier. SEM can be written in terms of expectations:</p><p>For this article, we’ll generate a synthetic dataset and use the automation structural causal model to evaluate the impact of a product initiative. We’ll use the pycountry library that provides an ISO dataset of countries. For simplicity, we’ll only use three document types in the&nbsp;example:</p> list_country_names = [country.name for country in pycountry.countries]<br>document_types = ['ID', 'Passport', 'Driving Licence']<br>documents = list(itertools.product(list_country_names, document_types))<br>documents = [' '.join(doc) for doc in documents] <p>We’ll generate all the variables randomly and obtain a dataset, in which one line corresponds to one document (document type and issuing country), with its classification rate, extraction rate, non-fraud rate and whether it’s enabled for automation or not. We’ll also generate several checks corresponding to every document.</p> np.random.seed(0)<br>df = pd.DataFrame(data=documents, columns=['Document'])<br>df['Classification rate'] = np.random.beta(3, 1, df.shape[0])<br>df['Enabled automation'] = np.random.choice(2, df.shape[0], p=[0.1, 0.9])<br>df['Extraction rate'] = np.random.uniform(0.6, 1, df.shape[0])<br>df['Non-Fraud rate'] = np.random.uniform(0.7, 1, df.shape[0])<br>df['Number of checks'] = (np.random.beta(1, 3, df.shape[0] * np.random.normal(15000, 2000, df.shape[0])).astype(int)<br>df['Share of checks'] = df['Number of checks'] / df['Number of checks'].sum()  Classification <p>After an applicant submits a picture of their document, Onfido’s AI will try to classify it: determine the issuing country, type (such as ID, passport, visa, etc.) and other characteristics. Our AI classifies documents in milliseconds and supports over 2,500 documents in 195 countries.</p><p>If the classification score is higher than a threshold, this document will continue in the automated flow; otherwise, it will be classified by an agent. We’ll take a score of 0.2 as a threshold and N equal to 100 in the example. We obtain that 99% of checks pass the classification step:</p> N = 100<br>df_c = df[df['Classification rate']&gt;=0.2]<br>c = df_c['Share of checks'].sum()<br>classified = c * N  Enabled automation <p>To decrease the number of fraudulent applicants who pass our verification process, Onfido doesn’t allow some document types to autocomplete. Non-identity documents, documents without a photo or older documents with fewer security features are potentially high risk, so they are always reviewed by an&nbsp;analyst.</p><p>e * c * N checks continue the automatic flow. In the code, we’ll take the checks that passed classification and filter the ones enabled for automation. 90% of checks&nbsp;pass:</p> df_e = df_c[df_c['Enabled automation']==1]<br>e = df_e['Share of checks'].sum()<br>enabled_auto = e * c * N  Engine <p>The engine is simplified into two components that are executed simultaneously. Extraction refers to an ensemble of Onfido’s AI algorithms that extract the document’s visual information, data and metadata.</p><p>Fraud assessment refers to determining whether the document shows signs of fraud. Our unique micro-model architecture combines over 10,000 machine-learning models trained to detect specific fraud markers. Our models analyse pixel-level variations in document colour, shape, and texture to assess authenticity accurately.</p><p>Let a be the share of checks that pass both two components.</p> Auto-complete <p>Document verifications that passed both auto extraction and auto fraud assessment are auto-complete. For simplicity, we’ll assume that documents that have an extraction rate higher than 0.7 and a non-fraud rate higher than 0.8 pass both components:</p> df_a = df_x[(df_x['Extraction rate']&gt;=0.7)&amp;(df_x['Non-Fraud rate']&gt;=0.8)]<br>a = df_a['Share of checks'].sum()<br>auto_complete = a * e * c * N <p>39% of all checks are auto-complete.</p> A Simple Intervention <p>One of the benefits of causal inference is that it allows us to simulate experiments and evaluate the causal effect knowing the causal connections. It allows us to intervene in the process we’re modelling and control the&nbsp;outcome.</p><p>The do-operator is used in causal inference to denote an intervention. Given random variables A and&nbsp;B</p>  P(A | B) is the probability of A given B (the distribution under a natural state of&nbsp;B),  P(A | do(B = b)) is the probability of A given an intervention that sets B to&nbsp;b.  <p>The do-operator simulates interventions by deleting certain functions from the model, replacing them with a constant and keeping the rest of the model unchanged. Recall the pre-intervention distribution:</p><p>We can simulate an intervention in Extraction by removing an incoming arrow from E to X, and manually setting X to a constant value. The post-intervention distribution resulting from the action do(X = x₀) is given by the equation:</p><p>The new auto-completion rate&nbsp;is:</p><p>Where a₀ is the percentage of checks that pass both Extraction and Fraud Assessment. The uplift from this intervention can be estimated as</p> Example <p>One of the Product initiatives is improving the extraction model’s performance up to 99% on the top three documents from the Seven Stans (countries with a name ending in -stan). We’ll filter out the documents with a high fraud rate since improving extraction on them won’t result in increased automation. The top three documents are:</p> stans = ['Turkmenistan', 'Uzbekistan', 'Tajikistan', 'Kyrgyzstan', <br>'Kazakhstan', 'Afghanistan', 'Pakistan']<br>df_xn = df_e[df_e['Document'].str.contains('|'.join(stans))].copy()<br>df_xn = df_xn.sort_values(by=['Number of checks'], ascending=False)<br>df_a0 = df_xn[(df_xn['Extraction rate']&gt;=0.7)&amp;(df_xn['Non-Fraud rate']&gt;=0.8)].head(3) <p>We’ll set the Extraction rate to x₀ = 0.99 and calculate the&nbsp;uplift:</p> df_a0.loc[:,'Extraction rate'] = 0.99<br>a0 = df_a0['Share of checks'].sum()<br>uplift = c * e * a0 * N <p>The uplift from optimising extraction on the top 5 documents is 0.6 percentage points.</p> Extraction Optimisation <p>Going even further, instead of taking a set of top three documents, we can estimate the uplift of improving extraction to 99% on top one, top two, up to top n documents, where n is the total number of documents from the&nbsp;Stans.</p><p>The first document in the subset has the highest volume in checks and the n-th has the lowest. According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns">law of diminishing returns</a>, there would be a point where the effort associated with improving extraction on a new document type is no longer worth the corresponding auto-completion rate increase. This point is called a knee point (or an elbow point in the case of convex optimisation).</p> Kneedle <p><a href="https://raghavan.usc.edu/papers/kneedle-simplex11.pdf">Kneedle algorithm</a> is an algorithm developed to detect knees in discrete datasets. We’ve used it to detect the optimal tradeoff point for this example and for other simulations.</p><p>This algorithm uses the mathematical definition of curvature for a continuous function as the basis for the knee definition. For any continuous function f, there exists a standard closed form that defines the curvature of f at any point as a function of its first and second derivative:</p>Kneedle Steps<p>The algorithm follows these&nbsp;steps:</p><p>a) We use a smoothing spline to preserve the shape of the original data set as much as possible. The points of the smooth curve are normalised to the unit square. We calculate the Euclidean distances between the curve and the diagonal line (from first to last data&nbsp;point)</p><p>b) The distances are rotated 45 degrees clockwise. The goal is to determine when the difference curve changes from horizontal to sharply decreasing since this indicates the presence of a knee in the original data&nbsp;set.</p><p>c) We find the local maxima of the difference curve. For each local maximum, we define a unique threshold value based on the average difference between consecutive x values and a sensitivity parameter, S. The sensitivity parameter allows us to adjust how aggressive we want Kneedle to be when detecting knees. Smaller values for S detect knees quicker, while larger values are more conservative. Put simply, S measures how many flat points we expect to see in the unmodified data curve before declaring a knee. If any difference value drops below the threshold before the next local maximum in the difference curve is reached, Kneedle declares a knee at the x-value of the corresponding local maximum. If the difference values reach a local minimum and start to increase before reaching the threshold, we reset the threshold value to 0 and wait for another local maximum to be&nbsp;reached.</p> Optimising Extraction rate with&nbsp;Kneedle <p>We’ll use the kneed python package’s implementation of the algorithm and the automation model’s formula to calculate the uplift from onboarding top i documents:</p><p>Plotting the uplift for every document type i, we obtain this graph with the number of document types to optimise as X and automation uplift in percentage points as&nbsp;Y:</p> uplift = []<br>df_xn = df_xn[(df_xn['Extraction rate']&gt;=0.7)&amp;(df_xn['Non-Fraud rate']&gt;=0.8)]<br>for i in range(1, len(df_xn)+1):<br>    df_i = df_xn.head(i)<br>    a_i = df_i['Share of checks'].sum()<br>    uplift_i = c * e * a_i * N<br>    uplift.append(uplift_i)<br><br>x = np.linspace(1, len(uplift), len(uplift))<br>y = uplift<br><br>kneedle = kneed.KneeLocator(x, y, curve="concave", direction="increasing") <p>The knee point is at top six document types, corresponding to an uplift of about 1.2 percentage points. Improving extraction on all document types from the Stans would result in a 1.4 percentage point increase in automation.</p> Conclusion <p>Using causal inference we’ve created a high-level overview of Onfido’s document verification product. It allowed us to discover the relationships between different product parts and understand the dependencies and limitations.</p><p>The model we created allowed us to simulate the potential impact of varying product initiatives on automation without performing many different A/B tests on the components. It was used to estimate the automation uplift of implementing additional changes to our models and prioritise accordingly in&nbsp;2022.</p> Resources <p>[1] <a href="http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/tut06/cambridge_causality.pdf">Cambridge Advanced Tutorial Lecture Series on Machine&nbsp;Learning</a></p><p>[2] <a href="https://causalinference.gitlab.io/">Getting Started with Causal Inference</a></p><p>[3] <a href="http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r402.pdf">The Do-Calculus Revisited</a></p><p>[4] <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/causal-inference-962ae97cefda">Causal Inference</a></p><p>[5] <a href="https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/id/056a11be-ce3a-44b9-8987-a6c68fce8d9b/11283.pdf">Elements of Causal Inference: Foundations and Learning Algorithms</a></p><p>[6] <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5961514">Finding a “Kneedle” in a Haystack: Detecting Knee Points in System&nbsp;Behavior</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech/causal-inference-at-onfido-16fb5357bac8">Causal Inference at Onfido</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech">Onfido Product and Tech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In perhaps the clearest sign to date that the UK government is taking the challenges and opportunities of the crypto industry seriously, HM Treasury has released a new consultation paper, <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1133404/TR_Privacy_edits_Future_financial_services_regulatory_regime_for_cryptoassets_vP.pdf">‘Future financial services regulatory regime for cryptoassets.’&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>In the Foreword, it states:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>“The government’s firm ambition is for the UK to be home to the most open, well-regulated, and technologically advanced capital markets in the world. Delivering on this ambition means taking proactive steps to harness the opportunities of new financial technologies. We believe that crypto technologies can have a profound impact across financial services.”<br>&nbsp;</p>



 Crypto conundrum: To regulate or not to regulate.&nbsp; 



<p>Over recent years, the crypto industry has become increasingly complex as the constantly evolving ecosystem continues to generate a myriad of opportunities and associated risks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although there are currently no crypto-related regulations in the UK, the FCA and Bank of England have issued usage guidelines and warnings about the lack of regulatory and monetary protection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a post-Brexit world, the crypto conundrum has been further compounded by the EU’s decision to create <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">MiCA</a>, one of the world’s first crypto regulatory frameworks. Although MiCA will not apply to UK crypto service providers (or any non-European provider), if UK providers plan on targeting EU investors or offering their services in the EU, then they will need to obtain MiCA authorization and follow <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/transfer-of-funds-crypto/">TFR requirements</a>, to ensure they are compliant with both UK and EU regulations.&nbsp;</p>



 FTX and the industry-wide wake-up call. 



<p>The collapse of FTX in late 2022 sent shockwaves through the industry, affecting global crypto asset markets and investors, and forcing regulators to re-examine its timeline for crypto asset regulation.&nbsp;In January 2023, the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) announced plans to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/crypto-crime-crackdown/">form a brand-new division </a>specifically designed to tackle crypto crime. The NCA’s ‘Crypto Cell’ will initially contain just five officers who will be solely responsible for providing support on new and existing crypto-related investigations.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>The decision by HM Treasury to release a consultation paper covering a potential regulatory regime for cryptoassets, finally addresses the elephant in the room. Timing-wise the consultation could not have been opened at a more opportune moment. The crypto industry has endured numerous high-profile casualties these past months, making the case for crypto regulation that much more palatable.&nbsp;</p>Jason Tucker-Feltham, Head of Crypto Sales at IDnow</blockquote>



<p>The 77-page paper features information on the current regulatory landscape for cryptoassets, definitions of different types of cryptoassets, and geographic scope of cryptoasset activities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As well as more general guidelines regarding cryptoasset investment advice and portfolio management, the new consultation paper sets out a proposed policy approach to bringing cryptoasset activities into the UK regulatory perimeter. For example, it suggests that most initial coin offerings be considered securities offerings, which would mean the equivalent of client asset segregation requirements be applied to crypto firms. As such, future proposed crypto regulatory requirements would fall under the UK’s <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/8/contents">Financial Services and Markets Act 2000</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Up until now, the direction of travel for UK cryptoasset regulation has been anything but clear. A balanced and well thought out regulatory framework will likely lay the foundations in support of the UK becoming a major global crypto hub.</p>



<blockquote><p>The latest developments are music to the ears of traditional financial institutions, as clear rules for conducting crypto business in and out of the UK provides a level of certainty not yet demonstrated by the jurisdiction.</p>Jason Tucker-Feltham, Head of Crypto Sales at IDnow</blockquote>



<p>As a consultation paper, ‘Future financial services regulatory regime for cryptoassets’ allows people inside and outside Parliament to provide feedback on policies and legislative proposals contained therein. Questions for respondents include the following:&nbsp;</p>



  Do you agree with the assessment of the challenges of applying a market abuse regime to crypto assets?<br>  What steps can be taken to encourage the development of RegTech to prevent, detect and disrupt market abuse?<br>  Do you agree with the proposal to require all regulated firms undertaking crypto asset activities to have obligations to manage inside information?&nbsp;  



 Next steps on the UK journey toward crypto regulation.&nbsp; 



<p>The UK government will now undertake a program of stakeholder engagement to gather views and feedback to establish a clear regulatory framework that supports innovation and protects consumers. How closely this will resemble the EU’s regulatory framework, MiCA, remains to be seen.</p>



 Putting the KYC into crypto.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC processes</a> are an integral part in ensuring crypto exchanges can protect themselves and their customers from fraud and money laundering, even amid an <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/british-crypto-balancing-act/">evolving crypto regulatory landscape</a>. Having these controls in place will protect investors from financial losses and add stability to a notoriously volatile market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

				<p>In this blog post, we’ll walk through how to have an interactive experience with the Trinsic API. By following the steps below, you’ll be able to experiment quicker, experience our API’s functionality, and understand how Trinsic Ecosystem works without having to setup any project environment. We’ll teach you how to use two different tools—<a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a> and <a href="https://docs.buf.build/bsr/studio">Buf Studio</a>—which both have an interactive UI for calling the API.</p><p><br>But before we make any API calls, the tools mentioned above require you to have an authorization token. You cannot use your authorization token from the Dashboard directly in the API as it is not meant to be transmitted directly with each call. Instead, you should use the token through the SDK, and it will calculate a derivation of your token that you can use. (We use zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to do so—you can learn more in our&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/learn/platform/security/#oberon-auth-scheme">documentation</a>.)</p><p><br>Let’s get started with our step-by-step tutorial below.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 How to get the token for authentication 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>To get the token for authentication, you’ll need to make API calls. Follow these steps:<br><br></p>  <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/cli/">Get the Trinsic CLI</a> and ensure it’s properly installed by running &nbsp;<code>trinsic </code>from the command line.  Go to your <a href="https://dashboard.trinsic.id/ecosystem">Trinsic Ecosystem Dashboard</a>.  Click View API Token and copy your token.  					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
																										 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>4. Run <code>trinsic config -a &lt;token&gt;</code>. This will set your token in the config file.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
																										 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>5. Run <code>trinsic config</code> and make sure your token is set correctly and your server endpoint is set to <code>prod.trinsic.cloud</code>.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>6. Run <code>trinsic account info</code>&nbsp;and see if the information matches the ones from your account.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>7. Run <code>trinsic —-debug account info</code> and copy the pink text after DEBUG: Authorization. This is the ZKP token for authentication you will use with your calls.<br><br>Please note this is a lot longer than in the below screenshot.</p>

			 Configuring Postman 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>To configure Postman, follow these steps:<br><br></p>  <a href="https://www.postman.com/downloads/">Download Postman</a> and create an account/log in.  Click New &gt; gRPC Request.  					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
																										 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>3. In the field Enter server URL, add <a href="http://prod.trinsic.cloud:443/">prod.trinsic.cloud:443</a> and click the padlock to enable TLS.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>4. In the tab Metadata, add Authorization in the Key field and your token (the one you generated above) in the Value field.</p>

Your page should look like this:</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
																										 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				   <p>6. In Postman, you can save these configurations by clicking on the dropdown next to Save and saving the request inside a Collection.</p>

<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Come and meet the Ubisecure team at the Gartner Identity and Access Management Summit, in London, on the 6th and 7th of March. To find out more, take a look at the Ubisecure events page – <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/events/" title="<em>https://www.ubisecure.com/events/</em>">https://www.ubisecure.com/events/</a>.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thank you for joining a new episode of Let’s Talk about digital identity, particularly for us, myself, working on companies that are building technology products to protect, secure people on Internet. It’s always surprising when we hear stories, when there are people, they just get tricked by other humans and voila, the result is – the company is hacked.</p>
<p>Today we’ll hear fascinating stories about social engineering, and for that we have, special guest Jenny Radcliffe. She’s a world-renowned social engineer who is hired to bypass security systems through a mixture of psychology, con artistry, cunning and guile. Jenny has received many industry awards and was most recently inducted into the prestigious InfoSec Hall of Fame 2022. She has also been named as one of the top 30 female cybersecurity leaders in 2022 by SC magazine, one of the top 25 women in cyber by I.T. security guru and in the top 50 women of influence in cyber in 2019.</p>
<p>Jenny is a sought-after global keynote speaker at major conferences and corporate events and is a multiple TEDx contributor. Jenny’s upcoming book <a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.simonandschuster.co.uk%2Fbooks%2FPeople-Hacker%2FJenny-Radcliffe%2F9781398518995&amp;data=05%7C01%7Cchloe.hartup%40ubisecure.com%7Ccb0fcebf0df44ef56e2008db082b2c45%7Cfeaa11396ffc44229c7b980ad003c1a7%7C0%7C0%7C638112753766638408%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=%2BMumwhGV647%2BoF9pvUJ9m6NiNG1POKAWviNSTV07RWs%3D&amp;reserved=0">People Hacker Confessions of a Burglar for Hire</a> will be released in February, this month, published by Simon and Schuster.</p>
<p>Hello, Jenny.</p>
<p>Jenny Radcliffe: Hi, Oscar. How are you?</p>
<p>Oscar: Very good. Happy to talk with you. This going to be super, super interesting.</p>
<p>Jenny: It’s great to be here.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic. So, we would like to start hearing more about yourself and your journey to what you do today.</p>
<p>Jenny: Certainly. So, I’m a social engineer and I specialise in the human side of security, and that means non-technical hacking. So, my two specialisms are psychology of scams and cons and fraud. But also, physical infiltration, so that’s the kind of red team tests that help us to infiltrate buildings and client sites for educational purposes. So, I’m an ethical burglar for hire as opposed to just a burglar for hire. And then we educate for awareness exercises and to harden the security for our clients.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic and I understand that you started very early in your career, correct?</p>
<p>Jenny: Yes, it was something that – we didn’t used to call social engineering, social engineering. You know that term is relatively new and I’m older. But yes, when I was little, I had a group of cousins and family around me who looked after me, but they also enjoyed urban exploration. You know, and that means getting into empty, derelict buildings, looking around, not to take anything or break anything, but just to look around. And you learn very quickly when you do that kind of job to – a little bit about alarm systems and locks and things. But also, how people work, so that we have to talk way in or, you know, instead of breaking something to get in, a lock or whatever, it is easier to talk your way in.</p>
<p>So that’s where I started and pretty quickly it led to some paid work. And then with the dawn of cyber and cyber security, it was actually the cyber community that sort of told me that there was another name for it and that there were more people than me that did it. So, I’m always grateful to the cyber community for doing that because it gave the jobs. Made it legitimate, and it made me realise that there could be a business in that and a career. But I’d done it since I was really small.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, fantastic. Super interesting and yes, you said, I don’t know how – you have said that the social engineering term is relatively new. Yeah, I hear it for the first time around 2005, I believe. So, I don’t know how long it has been for that –</p>
<p>Jenny: It’s nearly 20 years, Oscar. That’s the thing, time flies, but it’s still quite new, you’re right.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, yes, yes. So since then, to now, has it changed? What you would say is, what would define social engineering today?</p>
<p>Jenny: I think today, firstly, in the industry, in the security industry, it’s a really well-known term now because we’ve realised that a lot of the security problems that companies face and that we face as individuals come from our own human characteristics and ways of thinking. And so now it’s incorporated into lots of pen tests, but also a security awareness training for teams of for staff is so big.</p>
<p>And because social engineering is at the heart of almost everything, you know, so all the cyber – the breaches, the phishing, the phone, scams. A huge proportion of those are down to people being manipulated or making mistakes. So, I think what’s changed in social engineering now, is that it’s a widely known term and that it has shifted the emphasis towards humans.</p>
<p>But of course, humans can only do so much. And so, we need tech as well to do kind of the heavy lifting, to block as much as we can and to stop people being in a position where they have to make a decision as to whether to trust someone or click on a link or open an attachment. So, it’s changed that it’s more widespread but also, it’s now in a nice marriage with technology, which is, which is a good thing.</p>
<p>Oscar: And as you say, your story – you started the with like a playing with entering into houses, abandoned housing, some property. Then it became like a real job entering into properties. Now you have moved to, from physical, good doing these physical attacks, intrusions. To online attacks, you are now online hacker, as that’s my understanding. So, how enjoyable has it been for you, this switch?</p>
<p>Jenny: I mean we still do have to do some physical security. I do less of it now because I’m older and I have a team that, that would do that instead, that I put together a lot of the time. But I still do a few of them because there’s nothing so, so good at proving to a client that there are some issues, than showing them how something was done, you know. So, we do what the bad guys would do, up to the point of harm. So, we still do some of it.</p>
<p>But you’re right, a lot of the job now, did move online because so much of what we all do is remote. And so, the persuasion techniques, the influence techniques, the look – you know, the understanding of human psychology, is very important in terms of what happens with phishing emails or with business email compromise, scams, and breaches. So, we do a lot of those kind of, crafting those messages to show how criminals might do that. And then it’s part of education and awareness to say, well, this is how you might be caught, and this is why it works. So that if people understand how it works, they might be able to protect themselves against it. But you’re right, so much more of it now is online than it used to be. But I don’t think the physical side will ever go away completely.</p>
<p>Oscar: And is it still fun doing that?</p>
<p>Jenny: It is fun. You see, that’s the other thing Oscar, I’m always going to tell you I still do it because it’s still fun. It’s more fun than sitting at a computer but it’s scary as well. Whenever I do a talk or an interview like this, you know, I get lots of DMs from people, lots of emails saying I want to do that job. Can you train me? Can I work with you? Because it does sound like fun and a lot of the time it is quite fun. But it is also dangerous and it’s very hard work. So, to do it properly and professionally requires a lot of research online, and a lot of planning. But I think, people sometimes think, you know, we just tailgate and walk in. And we do that sometimes, but mostly it’s a lot of planning.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, a lot of planning, that might not be the funnest part.</p>
<p>Jenny: No, it really isn’t the fun part, but it’s necessary to do the job properly. I think that’s the thing that, I just need to emphasise in the interviews I do, is that it is a professional part of security. It’s just that it sounds and is more fun than the hours we all spend looking at logs and, you know, sitting at the keyboard. But yeah, it’s still a professional part of the business.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely. You already mention email, which seems to be – that’s my impression from hearing so much – that it might be the top way of getting hacked today and you know better that. So, why email is still one of the ways to get hacked? Even though there are so many advanced email protections, so I hear for instance, there is nowadays advanced filter, an artificial intelligence protection. A lot of these things that are being added to the mail systems, email system. Yeah, but besides that, there’s so much being hacked.</p>
<p>Jenny: First of all, we all receive so many emails every day. So, email is a huge part of our professional and personal lives and that means that we are – it is necessary for all of us to click on links and open attachments and join conversations with people that we’ve never met before, legitimately, as part of business. The technical tools that help with blocking malware and, you know, emails that carry payloads or that will take us to sites that carry payloads, that’s great and it does block a lot of things. But a technical solution has to be looking for something technical to block, the reason emails still get through and are so effective in social engineering attacks, is because that email may not necessarily contain a malicious file, but it might be the opening of a conversation and that’s difficult to detect with technology.</p>
<p>So, if you look at something like business email compromise, which is when, you know, a criminal will infiltrate someone’s email, pretend to be the boss or the finance director or someone we know and ask them usually to transfer money. That will not necessarily have any viruses or malware in that email. But it’s still an attack because they’re asking that person to do something criminal.&nbsp;The problem is, is it’s difficult to detect because it’s words, it’s language, its persuasion, it’s influence. And, you know, the criminals know that, and they know if they get the tone right, if someone has not been trained properly or if what they say is something that resonates with the target, that there’s a chance of that getting through.</p>
<p>So, I think the technology is, you know, amazing these days to help us with emails and to block some of this malicious files and malicious emails and we need it. We need that tech to do it, so that when we see an email that does get through. We’ve not got 15, or 50, or 500 emails to make decisions on whether or not to follow them up and to engage with the with the person. We’ve only got a few and it’s only on a small amount of emails that we really need to worry about people making their mind up about.</p>
<p>So, the tech is brilliant because it’s preventing so many things from getting past. But we still need humans to understand what a malicious approach looks like. And that’s where the awareness and everything still comes into it because they still get through despite the technology.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes indeed. As you said, if they, if that first email just passes, doesn’t have anything of, anything malicious at all, it just passes that level of trust – that okay, I trust in this email I continue the conversation in.</p>
<p>Jenny: But you know, just to say is – so for example there are systems and there is technology in place that for example, will block key words as well. So, it might block invoice. And so, I had a colleague who hadn’t been paid by a client and when they followed that up, it was because his email with ‘invoice – to be paid’ as the title, their sort of filters caught that and stopped that getting through. But that was a legitimate email, and this is the problem, right?</p>
<p>The problem is, is that, of course, criminals are going to use language that we need to use to carry on with our business. And sometimes we have a sort of a false positive and a genuine email get stopped. But actually, it’s probably better that that’s the case, than have all the bad ones get through, you know.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, certainly. That’s why, as you mentioned, education many times is focus key of this helping us. If you move to authentication – thinking of a password. A password can be stolen there, you know, there are many ways to steal a password, if the protection is only based on password. Okay, you steal a password, and you get in. So, it’s hacked.</p>
<p>But nowadays with more advanced technology standards, multi-factor authentication you have here, of course, WebAuthn, Fido. These more advanced authentication techniques. Are people less vulnerable, what would you say?</p>
<p>Jenny: Yes. I mean, I think technology helps massively, you know, and things like, let’s say like FIDO and WebAuthn. All of those things are an extra layer, and the more layers that a criminal has to get through, the harder their job is and that’s what we want. But I think for me, the sort of physical security keys that are in the marketplace, they have a sort of a another positive to them, which is – if you are using one of those things every time, you need to plug that into your machine, every time you touch that, it’s reminding you that security is something we need to be aware of.</p>
<p>So, I love the idea – I think anything is bypass-able, you know, because we can always get the person who’s holding the key or using the technology to go around it. They can be persuaded. But in and of themselves, it’s an extra different type of security that people are using and therefore I’m all for it. I think it’s a great, a great thing to do.</p>
<p>Nothing. Nothing is bullet-proof, but it’s a very good start. And two-factor or multi-factor authentication, is one of the things that I urge everyone to talk to teams about, to talk to their families and people outside of the business about. Because although it can be bypassed and got around, it would stop an awful lot of individual attacks and sort of misery. So, two factor or multi-factor, in any form, is always going to be a good thing. It’s better than like you say one thing, which can be found out or hacked – a password.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. If you see from the perspective of companies like Ubisecure, and many other companies that are building technology products, security products, identity products. What is your best piece of advice for the ones who are building these, these tools, these cybersecurity tools?</p>
<p>Jenny: My advice would be, you have to make them easy to understand and use, right? It has to be easier for a person, a customer, to use your security product, whatever that is, than to get round it and forget about it. People, if something is difficult and it’s easy to do the wrong thing, they will always do the easy thing.</p>
<p>So, people need to understand how to use them. It needs to be as straightforward as possible. And then we need to tell them the why. You know what this prevents, why it matters and why it’s important. And then we need to trust that they will do it, you know, and check-up occasionally, of course. But that’s the key. The key is – make it easy for them to do the right thing and let them understand why it’s necessary.</p>
<p>Now, let me give you an example of something that’s not always good. If we look at one of the things, we tell people in security is to use VPNs, right? Because of course, we know in the business, in the industry that a VPN sort of protects your traffic to the Internet. So, people can’t do man in the middle attacks and things like that. And again, not completely impenetrable, but very good.</p>
<p>But if you ask people and I just mean normal people on teams, not normal people in the street, if you ask them about what a VPN is, it’s hard for them to explain what it does. But then also when you load those up onto your devices, onto your phone and your laptop, you know, this often problems, technical problems, VPN sometimes block websites people want to use. And I’ve had that myself, where I had a VPN on a phone I used, and I couldn’t use the phone because it was so secure that it was stopping me from doing normal things like internet shopping and banking. So, in the end you switch it off and this is the problem is unless people can use that easily, they will just eventually just ignore it.</p>
<p>So, my advice to anyone who makes this type of product and provides these services, is the most important thing is the UX, it’s the user experience every time. Because then they will adopt it and eventually hopefully become advocates for your product. But if you make it difficult, they will abandon it.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, that’s the worst that can happen of course. That you have the best possible tool, but people abandon it because, as you said, it’s not simple enough.</p>
<p>Jenny: Right.</p>
<p>Oscar: Besides email, email phishing. I think, one word that comes up all the time, when we talk about, we hear about hacking breaches is, ransomware. So, what is the link between social engineering and ransomware?</p>
<p>Jenny: So, there are really two, I guess. Ransomware obviously is, gets onto someone’s system becomes a problem through the social engineering methods that we’ve already talked about. So often, these things start with an email, or they start with access escape because someone doesn’t update software. And then, you know, the attackers get onto the network and become, you know, and sort of sleep on the on the network for a while and spy on you and then a ransomware attack is then initiated.</p>
<p>But I think the real link to social engineering is, the key emotions that are used in ransomware, even if no conversation happens between the criminals and the target. Because what ransomware really depends on, are the things that malicious social engineers use all the time. You know, fear and shame are two of them.</p>
<p>So, you know, we’re on your network, we’ve got your files, we’re going to delete them or release the data. Well, people will – that’s a scary thing for a business. It makes your emotion high, your fear high and also, that fear that, you know, this will affect our brand, we’ve missed something on security, we’ve been sort of lax on security and, you know, that will be a problem. So, it relies on a very human emotion in order to make people want to comply with that.</p>
<p>And then there’s that very clear business decision of, you know, do we pay this, because it’s cheaper and easier to pay it than to go through all the problems that might cause if we don’t pay it. And in security, we always say, don’t pay, but it’s not always that simple. For a small company, they might be covered by insurance, pay the ransom and be able to get on with their business in a day’s time, which is a tempting thing. So even though we in security know you should never do that, it’s hard for people in reality to make that decision sometimes.</p>
<p>And it also relies on a big psychological tool, which is urgency. So, you know, typically ransomware, you have a time frame in which to pay the ransom. Usually, they add sort of psychological elements, like you will see counters and, you know, messages telling you the time is running out. And all of that kind of stops us making rational decisions because it’s hard to make good decisions when you’re worried and frightened and anxious about the business and, you know, the time is the factor.</p>
<p>So, it’s important for all those reasons, I always say that ransomware is a big part of social engineering – well, social engineering is a big part of ransomware. In as much as however distant and remote the attacker might be, even if there’s no conversation, the attack, by its nature, is a social engineering attack. It’s putting a human being or a group of human beings under pressure to do something that is not in their interest and that makes it pure social engineering.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, very interesting that viewpoint, you talk about. The ransomware, it shows why many people are unfortunately paying and that this type of criminality continues. I’d like to hear how, I guess some time you have been – someone has tried to social engineer you, I guess. If you can tell us if that happens, if that you have ever felt that you were close to, to fall and how you protect yourself normally if someone wants to attack you this way.</p>
<p>Jenny: I get lots and lots of attempts at social engineering. Obviously, because it would be great to catch me out, as I’m the person that talks about it, probably, or one of the people that talks about it the most. It would be great. So, I get lots of attempts that are very obviously social engineering and particularly the ones that use all my advice or examples I give in keynotes. That’s actually quite strange.</p>
<p>I’ve been caught out a couple of times, one time was, I was at a conference and there was the guy at the conference who I knew, and his wife was pregnant, and she was heavily pregnant. So, she, you know, he was sort of on standby to go home in case anything happened. And he came to me, and he said, my phone’s died, I got a call from my wife, can I borrow your phone? I need to call straight back, because I knew both of them. And then he took my phone and took a picture saying I hacked Jenny’s phone, you know. But, you know, he’s dead now. No, I’m joking. So, there was that.</p>
<p>But no, I get quite funny attempts from kids. So, I think children sometimes see me on social media, maybe. I’ve done a few sorts of shows on social media that – I did an interview for LadBible, which is a quite a big platform. And someone had chopped up the interview and put it on TikTok and of course all the kids watch TikTok more, more I think than adults, right. And I started to get these emails that were, that were really quite funny. So, it was like – I got some that were just threatening, so it was, but really obviously a kid.</p>
<p>So, it was like, we’re going to get you through social engineering, click on this link and quite a lot with QR codes that led to the Rickroll, I got those. Which we open on our dirty machine in the office that we can open things on, and they were quite funny. And I knew they would be Rickroll’s before I did it, but still. I get things like that, and I also get things that try flattery, you know, so, we’re such big fans, and we took a photograph of you at an event, do you want to see and there’d be a little link, you know. And I kind of, when I know it’s just people sort of trying to catch me out and it’s not really malicious, it’s sort of a joke because it’s me, I don’t mind that.</p>
<p>And then I think the rest of the time when they are serious attempts by people who are criminals, I hope I catch most of them, but I would never say I caught all of them. None of us ever do. And that’s really the message is always – it doesn’t matter who you are, if it’s the right script at the right time, we will all fall for it. However alert you think you are, we’re all human and there are times when we just – our guard is down. So, people do try all time, in person I don’t think they try very much, I think probably I would know they were nervous, you know, I’m just thinking of a few times. And they probably know that. But you know, again, you can’t always say it.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, super interesting. Yeah, of course, everybody has to be well protected and as you said, it’s a lot about getting educated, really understanding, how real hackers are acting.</p>
<p>Final question, for all business leaders that are listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agenda today?</p>
<p>Jenny: So, I’m asked this a lot, you know, and there’s lots of advice that we give. We can talk about the red flags of social engineering. You know, I mentioned a couple of them, you know, getting your emotions high, urgency. We could talk about cyber hygiene, we’ve spoken about that, you know, have multi-factor in place, use good tech.</p>
<p>But the key really for me, the thing that I want businesses to do is – you’ve got to know your people better than the bad guys. And what that means is, a really serious attack on a business will look across all of your teams, all of your operations, your network, your architecture, and they will really dig into that to find the best way to get to you.</p>
<p>And if we understand that people are probably the easiest way in, a lot of the time, what we have to be able to recognise is when someone is behaving strangely or has done something wrong – and that means a culture of acceptance and of understanding and of education. So, we need to know those people, that work for all of us, have to feel confident that they can come to you and say, I think I clicked on a link that might be malicious. I think I forwarded money to someone that might not be the finance director or the CEO. I feel that – I’ve been talking to someone on social media and now I’m not sure whether they’re genuine. So, know your people well enough so that they feel they can come to you and not get into trouble for falling for a con by professional con artists.</p>
<p>And if you can put those things in place, we know when someone’s worried, we know when someone is scared or when someone has made a mistake, then we can help prevent it. Because what criminals are relying on, a lot of the time, is isolating their target within a business and making their target too scared to really ask for help and to tell people this might be an issue.</p>
<p>And that’s something that is not easy, because it requires – especially in a huge company, that means line manager level, you know, your level, knowing the people, knowing your team, looking if someone is stressed, helping someone if they’ve got issues outside the workplace, and also knowing if their behaviour is different online and in-person as well, you know, is there a break in the pattern? Are they downloading files, are they being blackmailed into helping someone from the outside?</p>
<p>And to do that’s not easy. It requires time and focus and a genuine interest in your people, but it doesn’t require necessarily lots of money. And I think that’s the thing. I would say, do not think you can throw money at the problem, and it be fixed. Get good technical products, good technical services. Make sure that you have the best technology that you can afford to protect your business, but at the same time, work in harmony with your people so that they are the eyes and ears for your organisation and for their security.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, I couldn’t agree more. It’s a really very good reflection and thanks a lot, Jenny, for telling us your stories. Educating us a lot about social engineering and getting protected. Please tell us, how people would like to know more about yourself on the net, how they can find you.</p>
<p>Jenny: It’s been such a pleasure chatting to you Oscar. If people want to find out more about me, I’m known as the People Hacker online and that’s Jenny Radcliffe. You can find me mostly on LinkedIn and Twitter and Instagram and my website’s <a href="https://humanfactorsecurity.co.uk/">humanfactorsecurity.co.uk</a> and as you say the books out in February 2023, and it’s called People Hacker and you should be able to find it at most, at this point, in Europe. So, the EMEA countries; Europe, Middle East and Africa. The distribution’s a little bit weird, but you can definitely get it in the UK and then soon to be the US and further afield. So, if you keep an eye on my post, you’ll definitely see me shout about that.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Definitely will read your book. Fantastic.</p>
<p>Jenny: Thank you, Oscar.</p>

<p>At Mydex, we’re frequently contacted by academics and think-tanks wanting to research ‘<a href="https://medium.com/mydex/what-is-the-economic-value-of-data-ef129e6485e1">the value of data</a>’. By which they mean they want to put a money price on it. It seems like a simple and obvious question. But behind it lies a paralysing mountain of misconceptions: those of mainstream economics.</p><p>Of course, ‘economics’ includes many schools of thought. Our focus here is the economic doctrines that have dominated policy-making for the last four decades. Its core narrative goes something like&nbsp;this:</p><blockquote>“Wealth is created by firms selling products in markets for money at a price that makes a&nbsp;profit.”</blockquote><p>This blog shows how personal data blows the assumptions behind this narrative apart, taking us to places it cannot cope&nbsp;with.</p> Worlds apart <p>Table 1 sums the differences between two perspectives on the economics of data: ours and those of mainstream economics. They point in entirely different directions.</p>Table 1: The assumptions of mainstream economics means it cannot see the economic opportunities presented by citizen data empowerment. Value <p>What makes something valuable? Is it what it can be used for: e.g. the improvements it can bring to peoples’ lives? Or is it what it can be sold for: e.g the (money) price it will fetch? You might answer ‘both’, but one is more important than the other. Most things sell at a price because they are useful to someone (and many things, like oxygen in the air, are very useful and have no&nbsp;price).</p><p>By defining value in terms of the money price an item can fetch, economists focus attention on abstract symbols (money prices) that stop us asking why things are valuable in the first&nbsp;place.</p><p>Personal data is not valuable because somebody, somewhere can make money selling it. It is valuable because of what people can do with it: make better decisions and plan, organise and coordinate resulting actions better. Trading personal data for a price does nothing to address the central question which is ‘how to use it to improve peoples’&nbsp;lives?’</p><p>Product</p><p>For something to fetch a price on a market, exclusive ownership of it needs to change hands. Traditional products fit this model. But most personal data is not exclusively ‘owned’ by any one party. If you buy an item online, the seller has data about the transaction and so do you. This data is not ‘owned’ by just one party, so legally speaking, this ‘ownership’ cannot change&nbsp;hands.</p><p>What’s more, the more people treat personal data as an exclusively owned ‘product’ the more they reinforce the fatal flaw of the organisation-centric database. Because data does not get ‘used up’ when used — because the data can be used for many different purposes by many different people — it needs to be shared. But the organisation-centric database is all about NOT sharing the data; keeping it under exclusive, proprietary control&nbsp;instead.</p><p>Treating personal data as a product like any other lifeless commodity such as milk, potatoes, or steel, generates an additional set of problems. By definition, personal data relates to a person. It is highly personal and the person it relates to has feelings, sensitivities and rights. For this reason, the sharing and use of personal data cannot be separated from issues relating to human rights and relationships between people using the data. These human (not trading) issues have to be addressed.</p><p>The personal data stores we talk about in this blog series intimately connect human rights and dignity with positive economic outcomes. By focusing attention on data as a ‘product’ — as a commodity to be sold for money — mainstream economics sets up a conflict between these goals. With its framing of “either privacy and data protection or ‘innovation and growth”&nbsp;, one side has to give — and alternative approaches which combine the two get&nbsp;ignored.</p> Markets <p>Despite what economists say, markets are not the engine of wealth creation. It’s obvious really: markets can only sell things that have already been made. For a market for something to exist, first of all it has to be produced. Production is and always will be the engine of wealth creation. It is production, not markets, that makes societies prosperous.</p><p>Personal data is valuable because it is used to produce services and to improve the productivity of these services. This has got nothing to do with markets and a lot to do with mundane but essential processes of planning, organisation, coordination and execution, all of which have to be administered. In turn, such administration depends on data logistics — getting the right data to and from the right places at the right&nbsp;times.</p><p>The more economists focus their attention on markets, the more they ignore the actual ‘how’ of wealth creation. In particular, they divert attention away from building new capabilities to enable the safe, rights-respecting sharing of data, and from the importance of new citizen-empowering personal data logistics infrastructure.</p><p>Firms</p><p>Traditional economics is fixated on the profit-seeking, shareholder-value- maximising private sector firm. But such firms are just one of many potential users of personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>As we’ve stressed, the <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/people-the-dark-matter-of-the-economy-24c00495ca02">dark (unobserved, unexplored) matter</a> of data use lies with people — individuals, citizens gathering and using their own data to improve their lives. Many of the most important users (and generators) of personal data are in the public and third&nbsp;sectors.</p><p>By seeing only the private sector as an agent of change, mainstream economics ignores half the economy. By assuming that innovation only happens in the private sector, economists generate an agenda that diverts attention away from where innovation is urgently needed: how to include citizens in the workings of the data economy and how to improve the ways in which public and third sector services&nbsp;work.</p> Money <p>Mainstream economics assumes that money is the measure of all value. But in the data ecosystem we’ve described no money changes hands and no price is put on data that is shared. Instead, productivity improvements are generated and these productivity improvements are measured by different currencies such as time taken to complete a task, energy and effort used in completing it, and materials used.</p><p>The end result may well be a cost saving measured in money terms, but it also includes other qualitative benefits such as improved outcomes for citizens, increased access and inclusion, and improved policy implementation. Because no money has changed hands and because no prices are involved, these are things economists have little interest&nbsp;in.</p><p>The constant quest to find better ways to ‘monetise’ data boils down to large scale displacement activity: not doing the work that needs to be done to change the underlying reality — of how to use data to improve service delivery and productivity.</p> Profit <p>According to the mainstream narrative, the main purpose of firms is to make profits. A firm is successful if it is extremely profitable, and becomes ‘uneconomic’ if it is not profitable. But in the model we’ve outlined, no profits are directly registered&nbsp;… because no ‘margins’ are made&nbsp;… because nothing is being sold in the first&nbsp;place.</p><p>Profit is a very narcissistic measure. It focuses on what benefits I get for myself, not on the impact I have on the world around me, for better or worse. In fact, the real ‘results’ of organisations always lie on the outside. The real ‘results’ of a hospital are the patients it treats successfully and efficiently. The results of the school or university are graduates who can apply what they have learned in their own life and work. The result of a car producer is improved mobility of the people who use its cars. And so&nbsp;on.</p><p>By focusing attention on a narcissistic measure of success, rather than real economic contribution, economists render the opportunity we talk about in these blog invisible.</p> Contracts <p>Price-focused market-based transactions depend on formal legal contracts that are negotiated, often between parties with conflicting interests. Buyers want to buy cheap and sellers want to sell dear. In the data sharing relationships we’re talking about, there is a mutual recognition of mutual benefit that unfolds and extends over&nbsp;time.</p><p>The attitudes, practices, infrastructure and institutions needed to build and maintain long term trusting relationships are completely different to those needed to win contract negotiations. The more economists focus attention on price negotiations for markets, the more they divert attention from doing what is needed to unleash the full potential of personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Alfred Marshall set the agenda for modern economics a century ago when he defined ‘economic goods’&nbsp;as:</p><blockquote>“those things, external to a man, which (i) belong to him, and do not belong equally to his neighbours, and therefore are distinctly his; and which (ii) are directly capable of a money measure.”</blockquote><p>Personal data fits none of these criteria. In doing so, it bursts the assumptions behind the mainstream narrative of modern economics. It demands a different agenda.</p><p>In this blog series we’ve outlined what this different agenda looks like and why it’s important. Personal data stores help citizens <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/people-the-dark-matter-of-the-economy-24c00495ca02">manage their own lives better</a>, ease their access to services, cut the <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/when-organisations-become-waste-factories-9c893ea18784">costs of providing these services</a>, improve peoples’ experience of using them, <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-are-joined-up-services-so-difficult-to-deliver-e21d762b7d32">joining them to produce better outcomes</a>, helping both citizens and service providers <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-struggle-to-connect-f233bd480d44">find and engage with each other</a> — while also opening up <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/an-engine-of-economic-possibilities-a04a32181f48">new dimensions of innovation</a> and accelerating and enriching <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/what-has-data-got-to-do-with-net-zero-bb48048b04bc">the journey to net&nbsp;zero</a>.</p><p>Together, they add up to an economic transformation <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/google-and-facebook-steam-engines-of-the-information-age-b1b4c9ee22d9">as big as that wrought in the 20th century by electricity and mass production</a>.</p><p>But in this process no money changes hands, no prices are set, no markets are established, no profits can be reported. So most economists simply do not see the opportunity. They are too busy looking in the opposite direction.</p><p>This doesn’t make personal data stores economically irrelevant. Quite the opposite. It makes mainstream economic assumptions irrelevant.</p><p>Three different drivers of selective attention are hampering our society’s ability to unleash the full potential of personal data: a fixation on <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/are-insights-always-good-b5e05e3eb56a">Big Data</a>, on <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/artificial-intelligence-no-authentic-folly-on-a-grand-scale-e88dbda191b9">Artificial Intelligence</a> and on attempts to shoehorn data into the outdated economic narrative.</p><p>That’s the simple message of this series. It’s time to <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/are-insights-always-good-b5e05e3eb56a">stop counting bounces and looked up to see the gorilla in our midst</a> — the opportunities made possible by empowering citizens with their own&nbsp;data.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-economists-cannot-get-their-heads-around-personal-data-661d2dedd589">Why economists cannot get their heads around personal data</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Here’s the latest from our development efforts:  SpruceSpruce    </a><p>At Spruce, we’re letting users control their identity and data across the web. Here’s the latest from our development efforts:</p> SSX <p>SSX (Self-Sovereign Anything), is the easiest way to integrate Sign-In with Ethereum, enable DAO logins, resolve ENS names, and more. It is the go-to library for developers in web3 to get started with decentralized identity. </p><p>Last month, we released a product update covering the latest development efforts on SSX - you can check that out here: </p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/ssx-product-update-optimization-updates-new-features-and-more/">  SSX Product Update - Optimization Updates, New Features, and More  We launched SSX in November to provide developers with the easiest way to integrate Sign-In with Ethereum. We are continuously working on a positive developer experience, and additional features to enable builders to work with emerging decentralized identity paradigms.  SpruceAnukriti Kunwar    </a><p>Additionally, we've released the first of many developer tutorials to come, using SSX with RainbowKit and Alchemy to build your first token-gated dapp: </p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/tutorial-build-a-token-gated-app-with-sign-in-with-ethereum-and-ssx/">  Tutorial: Build a Basic Token-Gated App with SSX, RainbowKit, and Alchemy  This example will show developers how to build and enable token-gated access in their dapp with SSX based on holding an ENS name. Additionally, it will show a developer how to also use SSX with RainbowKit and Alchemy.  SpruceSpruce    </a><p>We've continued to work on ways developers can leverage user-controlled data, wider support for NextAuth and Auth.js, additional test coverage, and a big push for ETHDenver this year. Stay tuned for that upcoming release! </p> Sign-In with Ethereum Core Libraries <p><br>Sign-In with Ethereum is a new form of authentication that enables users to control their digital identity with their Ethereum account and ENS profile instead of relying on a traditional intermediary.</p>  We plan on moving EIP-4361 from <code>Review</code> to <code>Last Call</code> this month to fully advance the standard to <code>Final</code>.  We are currently updating our ReCap library for extended compatibility with other specifications. We plan on updating EIP-5573 to reflect these changes (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-recap/pull/14">siwe-recap #14</a>).  Our next community call for Sign-In with Ethereum is this Wednesday - make sure to tune in to hear from us and our friends at Unlock Protocol!   We're waiting for some additional external review of our changes to the <code>siwe</code> TypeScript library (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe/pull/138">#138</a> and <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe/pull/139">#139</a>).   Kepler <p>Kepler is a decentralized storage network organized around data overlays called Orbits. Kepler allows users to Securely share their digital credentials, private files, and sensitive media to blockchain accounts, all using your Web3 wallet.</p>  We've recently refactored Kepler to rely on <code>libp2p</code>, and <code>libipld</code> while removing the <code>rust-ipfs</code> dependency (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler/pull/132">kepler #132</a>).   We've added support for a capability read function so clients can read capabilities delegated to them and others if authorized (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler/pull/134">kepler #134</a>).   We've updated the Kepler SDK to account for the changes in Kepler for the capability read function (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler-sdk/pull/53">kepler-sdk #53</a>).   SpruceID <p>SpruceID is a decentralized identity toolkit that provides everything you need for signing, sharing, and verifying trusted information.</p> SSI   We've updated our <code>ssi</code> library to use the latest version of <code>json-ld</code> (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/500">ssi #500)</a>.   TreeLDR <p>TreeLDR is a schema definition language that aims to describe the structure and semantics of the defined schema in a comprehensible way. It lies at the intersection between <a href="https://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a> and structure-oriented schema definition frameworks such as <a href="https://json-schema.org/">JSON Schema</a>.</p>  We optimized unification of non-recursive blank nodes. The unification phase now runs in <code>O(n)</code> time average instead of <code>O(n²)</code> (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/issues/101">treeldr #101</a>).   We've added type hierarchy support. TreeLDR now understands what a sub class is. (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/105">treeldr #105</a>).  We re-introduced RDF loader. This will allow the compiler to accept any RDF syntax as input in the future. For now, only N-Quads (besides the TreeLDR DSL) is supported. (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/108">treeldr #108</a>).   We relaxed ordering constraints on layout intersection. Intersecting two structure layouts sharing the same fields but in a different order will not raise an error anymore (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/110">treeldr #110</a>).  We minimalized the <code>rdfs:domain</code> and <code>rdfs:range</code>relations. This simplifies a lot of internal reasoning about properties (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/112">treeldr #112</a>).   Standards and Community   We've contributed a holder-binding focused use-case to the W3C VC use cases (vc-use-cases <a href="https://github.com/w3c/vc-use-cases/pull/129">#129</a>).   <p>Spruce lets users control their data across the web. Spruce provides an ecosystem of open-source tools and products for developers that let users collect their data in one place they control, and show their cards however they want.</p><p>If you're curious about integrating Spruce's technology into your project, come chat with us in our Discord:</p><a href="https://discord.gg/spruce"></a>

<p>tl;dr</p><p>CBDCs are gaining traction in 2023 and dominating conversations in various crypto-related circles, as observed at World Economic Forum 2023. Not everyone is a fan,&nbsp;though!</p><p>There are two camps, one led by the Central Banks and other global financial organizations, such as the IMF, the World Bank, and more. The other comprises the majority of crypto enthusiasts with varied levels of blockchain tech affinity.</p><p>The CBDC detractors see the Central Bank Digital Currencies as another way governments maintain their control over the financial lives of the masses. They believe CBDCs will grant undue surveillance access to the governments, enabling them to prevent anyone from accessing the financial infrastructure.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/respect65/status/1619699365236604928?s=20&amp;t=BuowTtJqNmlMQVXs2oI9wA">Image Source</a>)<p>If we go by what Central Banks and their ilks preach about CBDCs, which they see as a legitimate alternative to cryptocurrencies, some may get the impression that CBDCs are flawless and the rightful currency to power the digital economy of the&nbsp;future.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/StarkNakedBrief/status/1615720018880204800?s=20&amp;t=BuowTtJqNmlMQVXs2oI9wA">Image Source</a>)<p>The question is, which of these two viewpoints is correct? Both sides have some valid points. We are not taking any sides. For Shyft, what matters most is the user. This is why Shyft’s goal is to ensure that the user experience remains intact while compliance requirements are&nbsp;met.</p> Why is the Shyft Network Talking About&nbsp;CBDCs? <p>You may be wondering why all of a sudden, Shyft is talking about CBDCs. Well, as already<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/01/19/china-launches-smart-contract-functionality-on-cbdc-through-e-commerce-app-meituan/"> seen in China</a>, CBDCs can support smart contracts. Once CBDCs start gaining traction and the support of Central Banks worldwide, DApps will also support them along with cryptocurrencies.</p><p>At that point, we expect the FATF to extend the Travel Rule to CBDCs. Similarly, countries may enforce their own set of AML &amp; CFT-focused rules and regulations on CBDC transactions.</p><p>That’s where <a href="https://www.shyft.network/veriscope">Shyft Veriscope</a> comes into the picture, as VASPs will continue using it for Travel Rule compliance, whether it is for crypto transactions or&nbsp;CBDCs.</p><p>For those unfamiliar with CBDC, it stands for Central Bank Digital Currencies. As a concept, CBDCs have become a hot topic globally in a short&nbsp;time.</p><p>As per Atlantic Council’s<a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/"> CBDC tracker data</a>, only 35 countries were considering a CBDC in May 2020, which has grown to 114 countries, covering 95% of the global GDP&nbsp;today.</p>(<a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/">Image Source</a>)<p>Jamaica is the latest country to launch its CBDC, the JAM-DEX. In terms of absolute user numbers, China’s CBDC pilot is leading by a considerable margin, as it has already reached a population as high as 260&nbsp;million.</p> What is a Central Bank Digital Currency? <p>A Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is the digital form of a country’s fiat currency. China’s CBDC, for instance, is called Digital&nbsp;Yuan.</p><p>The United States CBDC goes by the name of Digital Dollar. It is also common to denote a country’s digital currency by adding the prefix “e” before a country’s fiat money. For instance, Uruguay’s CBDC is e-Peso, Sweden’s CBDC goes by the name of e-Krona,&nbsp;etc.</p> Understanding CBDCs — Is it a Type of Central Bank&nbsp;Money? <p>Worldwide, CBDCs are known for some of their common features. Everywhere, it is a sovereign currency that Central Banks issue, and it appears on the Central Bank’s balance sheet as a liability. The central bank issues Central Bank Digital Currencies in line with the country’s monetary and fiscal&nbsp;policy.</p><p>Since a country’s central bank releases its CBDC, it is a legal tender, a valid payment medium, and a store of value for all citizens, enterprises, and agencies using it. There is no bar against converting CBDCs with commercial banks’ money and cash. CBDCs are a fungible legal tender. One may not need to have a bank account to hold Central Bank Digital Currencies.</p><p>There are several reasons why a Central Bank will be keen to bring out a digital currency for the country. The estimates suggest it lowers the cost of the issuance of money flows and transactions and helps deal with many limitations of the paper currency. A digital currency also helps solve the challenges that come with cross-border payments.</p><p>CBDCs reduce the cost associated with physical currency management. It helps reduce cash dependency in an economy by encouraging competition, efficiency, and payment innovation.</p><p>Central Bank Digital Currencies have their advantages over other digital payment systems. Since it is a sovereign currency endorsed by the Central Bank of the country, it seamlessly ensures settlement finality, reducing settlement risks in the system by a large margin. It supports financial inclusion. And as already seen, not only may it not require a bank account to hold it, but it is also an affordable, accessible, convenient, efficient, safe, and secure&nbsp;system.</p> How Many Countries are Considering Central Bank Digital Currencies? <p>To date,<a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/"> eleven countries</a> have already launched their Central Bank Digital Currencies. These countries include Nigeria, Jamaica, the Bahamas, and the Eastern Caribbean (Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Commonwealth of Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat, St Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, and St Vincent and the Grenadines).</p><p>In seventeen countries, Central Bank Digital Currencies are in a pilot phase. These countries include Ghana, South Africa, Australia, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, etc.</p>(<a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/">Image Source</a>)<p>There are 33 countries where CBDCs are in their development phase. Examples of such countries include the United Kingdom, Norway, Tunisia, Turkey, Bahrain, Bhutan, Mauritius, etc. And CBDC research is ongoing in 39 countries, which includes Mexico, Colombia, Paraguay, Morocco, Hungary, the Czech Republic, etc.</p><p>There are 15 countries in the world where CBDC projects are on pause. These countries include the likes of Iceland, Denmark, Egypt, Kuwait, Argentina, Uruguay,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>So far, two countries globally have canceled their CBDC projects, namely Ecuador and&nbsp;Senegal.</p> Types of&nbsp;CBDCs  Wholesale vs.&nbsp;Retail <p>There are two types of broadly accepted CBDCs: the general purpose or retail CBDCs, usually known as CBDC-R, and wholesale CBDCs, denoted as CBDC-W. There could be other CBDC classifications as&nbsp;well.</p><p>For instance, if we go by the models for issuance and management, CBDCs could be Direct, Indirect, or Hybrid. By form, CBDCs could be token-based or account-based. By instrument design, Central Bank Digital Currencies can be remunerated or non-remunerated. CBDCs can also vary as per their degree of anonymity.</p><p>While all these categories exist, one classification that matters the most, as it directly deals with use cases in real life, is the classification by issuance.</p><p>Retail Central Bank Digital Currencies are for use by all private sector and non-financial consumers and businesses. The Wholesale CBDC is meant for restricted access and use by select financial institutions.</p><p>Put simply, the Retail CBDCs are the electronic version of physical cash used in retail transactions. The Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currencies facilitate interbank transfers and related wholesale transactions.</p><p>Direct model Central Bank Digital Currencies are ones where Central Banks are responsible for managing all aspects of the CBDC system. In an Indirect Model CBDC, other intermediaries, such as banks and other service providers, play a role. The indirect model is where the banks manage everything, including distribution, account-keeping, KYC adherence, anti-money laundering checks, transaction verification, etc.</p> Token-based vs. account-based <p>A token-based CBDC is a bearer instrument, which implies that the holder of the token at a given point in time is its presumed owner. An account-based CBDC needs maintenance of the record of balances and transactions of all holders of the CBDC, which denotes the ownership of the monetary balances.</p> Remunerated vs. Non-remunerated <p>Remunerated Central Bank Digital Currencies are interest-bearing, which means this kind of CBDC earns interest. The concept of paying interest will likely make the CBDC more attractive as a financial instrument.</p><p>Non-Remunerated CBDCs, on the other hand, imply non-interest-bearing instruments, i.e., holders of these CBDCs will not earn interest. Presumably, in the case of these CBDCs, the public would have less incentive to switch from holding bank deposits to CBDCs. It would also mean a limited effect of banking disintermediation.</p><p>Finally, ensuring anonymity in a digital currency is difficult — since digital transactions leave some trace. For retail Central Bank Digital Currencies, reasonable anonymity for small-value transactions could be a desired&nbsp;feature.</p> CBDC vs. Cryptocurrencies — Are CBDCs Cryptocurrencies? <p>While both can be thought of as digital money or digital currencies, and both run on the foundation of blockchain technology, the two are different.</p><p>Cryptocurrencies are independent digital currencies that run on decentralization principles, devoid of any predetermined value or backing. CBDCs, on the other hand, enjoy the backing of Central Banks worldwide.</p><p>Cryptocurrencies leverage a permissionless open network. CBDCs typically use a private blockchain network that requires prior authorization.</p><p>We have already discussed the notion of anonymity and how it applies to Central Bank Digital Currencies. CBDCs, usually linked to a user’s bank account, are not anonymous. When users carry out cryptocurrency transactions, they remain anonymous.</p><p>It is easier to scale Central Bank Digital Currencies since a central authority manages them. Changes, upgrades, and modifications in the cryptocurrency network, on the other hand, require consensus among all nodes in the network. Nodes disagreeing on any agenda that impacts scalability could deter the crypto network’s growth.</p><blockquote>Speaking of the impact of CBDCs on cryptocurrencies, Thomas Borrel, COO of Shyft Network, said: “CBDCs are a contentious use of blockchain technology as they could improve our established financial system, but also materially affect individuals’ right to privacy. Implementation and governance are likely key factors on whether CBDCs will succeed in pulling away even a small percentage of crypto curious and crypto enthusiasts.”</blockquote> Most Advanced CBDCs&nbsp;Today <p>The Bahamas launched its CBDC in October 2020. Known as the Sand Dollar, the project received great praise from globally revered firms like PriceWaterhouseCoopers, which described it as the “World’s Most Mature&nbsp;CBDC.”</p><p>The purpose of the Sand Dollar was to increase financial inclusion by enhancing access to digital payments. However, many experts believe it failed to meet its commitments. Two years after its launch, there were<a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/businessreview/2022/11/22/how-is-the-worlds-most-advanced-central-bank-digital-currency-progressing/"> $338,908 Sand Dollars</a> in circulation, implying a per capita circulation of around 86 cents. It was insignificant compared to a per capita circulation of $78 in coins and $1,287 in Bahamian&nbsp;notes.</p><p>There are many Central Bank Digital Currencies that offer a host of benefits. For instance, the Digital Yuan app in China allows users to transfer money from their bank accounts to top up a digital wallet. Subsequently, the users can choose which apps to use the Digital Yuan for. It is as convenient as using other forms of popular online payment platforms in the country, such as WeChat pay or&nbsp;Alipay.</p><p>A digital US Dollar by the federal reserve bank in the United States can enhance policy efficacy by directly reaching the targeted beneficiaries of government assistance and stimulus payments.</p><p>However, how far the committed benefits of CBDCs would be able to aid our financial systems is something that still requires more assessment time.</p> Summary <p>From South America to South Korea, CBDCs are everywhere. From the International Monetary Fund to the World Economic Forum, every major global authority discusses it with vigor and sincerity. In varied use cases, from fueling economic growth through enhanced inclusion to facilitating international settlements, Central Bank Digital Currencies have become a part of many countries’ monetary policies.</p><p>Many experts believe it can radically improve a monetary policy’s effectiveness by strengthening the pass-through of the central bank’s policy rate to the broader structure of interest rates in the financial system. CBDCs can also help counter the credit and liquidity risks from exposures to either private issuers of digital tokens or from the lack of an&nbsp;issuer.</p><p>In September 2022, the White House published a report that outlined the country’s expectations, stemming from the efforts of researching Central Bank Digital Currencies at a large scale in the U.S. The report, titled ‘Technical Possibilities for a U.S. Central Bank Digital Currency,’ deposed full faith in the future potential of CBDCs. It cited President Biden’s vision for America, and that vision of possibilities applies to CBDCs across all countries that have undertaken it. The<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/09/16/technical-possibilities-for-a-u-s-central-bank-digital-currency/"> report</a> said, “a “digital dollar” may seem far-fetched, but modern technology could make it a real possibility.”</p><p>The same holds for all CBDC-aspiring economies.</p><p>…</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

				  Coding in ACA-Py just got a whole lot easier with Indicio’s a simple, hackable repo.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Alexandra N. Walker</p>
<p>Indicio recently unveiled its Minimal Example Repo, built with both experienced developers and those just starting out and in mind.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Indicio’s Minimal Example repo (AME) is a simple, hackable repo containing the building blocks to quickly reproduce an issue or demonstrate a feature within ACA-Py.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who is it for?</p>
<p>Developers and testers (especially those new to ACA-Py) who are looking to build scenarios with ACA-Py will find the repo very useful, whether they are seeking to quickly reproduce an issue (such as revocation, trust pings, issuing and verifying a simple credential, or sending messages between agents) or to demonstrate a feature by writing one simple script or Pytest test.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The repo cuts down on the amount of time searching through documentation, while also being approachable to developers new to ACA-Py. Instead of looking through all the Aries RFCs, Indicio’s Aca-Py Minimal Example will help autofill certain scenarios for you.</p>
<p>How does it make using ACA-Py faster / convenient?</p>
<p>It gives you a significant head start in replicating scenarios in ACA-Py. For example, a traditional exchange between an Alice and Bob¹ agent can be found in `minimal_example.py.` It allows you to quickly copy, paste, and modify the components you need to get your scenario to work, without all of the hassle of sorting through the Aries RFC documentation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is available now?</p>
<p>Presently, we have examples constructed, with revocation support, for a traditional Alice and Bob agent scenario, supporting protocol versions 1 and 2, and are working to add more functionality. Further work will include generators for other common agent setups (`Dockerfile`s + `docker-compose.yml`) such as:</p>
<p>Alice, Bob, Mediator<br>Issuer, Holder, Verifier<br>Endorser, Issuer, Holder, Verifier<br>ACA-Py, Echo (Remote controlled static agent; for sending raw messages)<br>Any combination of the above with a specified set of plugins installed<br>Any combination of the above with tails server and/or tunnel</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Indicio-tech/acapy-minimal-example">Get Started Today</a></p>
<p>In just three simple steps, the <a href="https://github.com/Indicio-tech/acapy-minimal-example">AME repo</a> can reduce the amount of code you need to write and save you time:&nbsp;</p>
<p>A.) Determine the scenario you are writing.</p>
<p>What does this flow look like? What all needs to happen in this flow?</p>
<p>B.) Determine if the AME repo fully or partly supports that scenario.</p>
<p>Is the scenario you are looking for already written?&nbsp;</p>
<p>C.) Copy and paste the portions that are relevant to the scenario you are working on and modify it accordingly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the steps you are looking for aren’t already in `minimal_example.py`, try <br>searching in `protocols.py`</p>
<p>¹ Aries agents are software components that act on behalf of entities—people, organizations and things. These agents enable decentralized, self-sovereign identity based on a secure, peer-to-peer communications channel.</p>

<p>Learn how to build edge apps efficiently and securely using Webnative App Template.</p> Building Edge Apps is Difficult and Time-Consuming <p>Have you ever built an edge app and found yourself disappointed by the in-browser authentication experience? The <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webcrypto/#crypto-interface">Web Crypto API</a> is great for enabling web applications to perform operations such as signature generation and verification and encryption and decryption without requiring access to the user's keys, but it can also be a minefield if not implemented absolutely correctly. Even the developer docs include a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API">large warning message</a> advising developers to have a cryptographic security expert throughly review their work before launching, because it can be so tricky to get right. </p><p>Privacy is becoming increasingly important to users and developers, but building an app with user data that is encrypted at rest is very difficult and time-consuming. Decentralized apps have to solve for access control, sync file data between devices, and ensure user ownership and portability of data. This is a lot to set up before even getting to the features of the app itself!</p> Webnative App Template <p>Acknowledging these roadblocks, Fission built the Webnative App Template, or WAT, to empower developers to build edge apps in the browser without building all of the infrastructure from scratch. </p><p>We launched WAT with built-in passwordless login and device-linking (which uses UCANs for authentication), powered by the Web Crypto API. We also included encrypted IPFS storage (by integrating WNFS). Identity &amp; data, owned by your app users!</p><p>But we didn't stop there. We also made <a href="https://github.com/webnative-examples/webnative-app-template">app customization</a> much more streamlined by including an <a href="https://webnative-template.fission.app/">image gallery app demo</a> in the template. All you have to do is sub in your app's features, adjust the look and feel, and you're on your way! </p><p>Take a look at this speed run that Applied Researcher <a href="http://twitter.com/jessmartin">Jess Martin</a> did during a recent demo day, where he builds a decentralized flickr clone in under 10 minutes!</p> Command Line Generator <p>Alternatively, if you would prefer to access WAT via your terminal, you can use our <a href="https://github.com/webnative-examples/create-webnative-app">CLI generator</a> to spin up either the React or Svelte versions of WAT or WalletAuth by running <code>npx create-webnative-app</code> in the command line. </p> Next Steps <p>This is our first release of the Webnative Application Template. We are actively working on a recovery kit and WebAuthn/Passkey support.</p><p>Check the<a href="https://github.com/webnative-examples/webnative-app-template/milestones"> milestones for open issues</a>, and please suggest your own as you start building.</p><p>We've spent time working on the UX flows and components as a starting point for developers to build secure and usable apps for users, but it's just a starting point. It should work well on desktop and mobile web out of the box, so you can hit the ground running.</p><p>Start building edge apps with <a href="https://github.com/webnative-examples/webnative-app-template">Webnative App Template</a> today, and mention us on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/fissioncodes">@FissionCodes</a>) so we can cheer you on as you build. </p>

<p>The global pandemic had a negative affect on many businesses around the globe. While some are still struggling to make a comeback, one thing is clear – with the rise of sports and online gambling means the commercial casino industry is back and bigger than ever. In fact, the industry <a href="https://www.americangaming.org/resources/aga-commercial-gaming-revenue-tracker/">set a record</a> in Q3 of 2022, surpassing $15 billion in revenue for the first time. While this is a big win for the industry at large, casinos will need to work that much harder to make a lasting impression and keep their valued guests coming back for more.</p>
<p>Building brand affinity and differentiation for a brick-and-mortar casino can at times seem like an enigma, so it’s really important to consider what guests want. In all things, but especially while in a casino, guests are looking for exciting, elevated and exclusive experiences they can’t get anywhere else. They want to live that high roller life with swagger in their step.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of ideas to elevate your guest experience from start to finish, making you the hero and them feel like a V.I.P.</p>
<p>Minimize wait times, maximize game play</p>
<p>Have you ever arrived at a casino, excited about the possibilities, only to be ushered into a very long check-in line? Its not an ideal experience from the get-go. And from the casino’s perspective, that means less time serving guests and building revenue. If this is the experience your guests are having, its time to uplevel your player card issuance program. With an instant ID card issuance system that can print a bold, impressive player card in just seconds can make all the difference in guest flow.</p>
<p>Give them a flashy status symbol they can have fun with</p>
<p>While you are at it, make each guest feel like a V.I.P by personalizing and elevating the card to status symbol level with bold colors exuding luxury with a high-end metallic look and feel. Who doesn’t want to flash an eye-catching, beautifully designed card at a slot machine or table?</p>
<p>But don’t stop at design. Feeling like a high roller means having access to exclusive perks. Consider integrating your player cards into the casino’s access control system. This enables you to give guests perks like access to private V.I.P. rooms; service priority, and more. What’s more, you could take it a step further and make that card an all access pass − a convenient, cashless option for table play, slot machines, restaurants, vending machines, shops, entertainment and parking.</p>
<p>Streamline operations</p>
<p>Another way to make a lasting impression for guests is to make sure casino staff is fully equipped to surprise and delight them. Find a system that allows you to track player status, spending, event participation visits and rewards. The ability to monitor where guests are in their experience allows staff to add those extra touches of personalized service that really make a lasting impression.</p>

<p>Enabling biometrics with FIDO can help create more security for your logins and reduces the risk of login attacks from succeeding.</p>
<p>What is <a>FIDO biometrics</a>? FIDO biometrics are a way to authenticate a user via their face, fingers, or voice; this lends itself to a user having a passwordless experience with their login.</p>
 What Are FIDO <a>Passwordless</a> Standards? 
<p>One of the more significant cybersecurity threats today is the inherent weakness of passwords. In the earliest days of computing, having a simple username and password or PIN combinations proved suitable for security.</p>
<p>In modern cybersecurity and authentication, however, the “always on” nature of the Internet and the proliferation of cloud-based apps and mobile devices have shown us that password authentication is weak against several common attacks like phishing or other social engineering approaches.</p>
<p>There has been a massive shift in authentication from common password systems towards <a>multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a> and passwordless solutions. But, as with many innovations, this move introduced several new issues, namely the fragmentation of the implementation and maintenance of these standards.</p>
<p>The Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) alliance was formed to address two key issues related to strong authentication and adoption:</p>
 
 Passwordless Authentication: The stated mission of the FIDO alliance is to reduce our reliance on passwords by shifting technology toward passwordless systems. 
 Interoperability: While passwordless authentication is a step towards strong authentication, it won’t provide much benefit if it isn’t used. Therefore, FIDO promotes a shared and open industry standard for adopting passwordless authentication. 
 
<p>To provide the required interoperability sufficient for an industry standard, FIDO developed several specifications on their own and in conjunction with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C):</p>
 
 <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-uaf-v1.1-id-20170202/fido-uaf-overview-v1.1-id-20170202.html">Universal Authentication Framework (UAF):</a> This is the passwordless standard for FIDO. UAF architecture provides a framework through which users can authenticate themselves, without a password, through the exchange of asymmetric encrypted key pairs between a FIDO server and a client application or device with the user (most commonly a phone or tablet). 
 <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specs/u2f-specs-master/fido-u2f-overview.html">Universal 2nd Factor (U2F):</a> U2F is a narrower authentication implementation that allows developers to include a second (or more) factor for authentication. U2F allows MFA over UAF passwordless verification, password systems, or USB verification devices. 
 <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">FIDO2</a>: The <a>FIDO2 project</a> results from the FIDO Alliance’s work with the W3C. It combines the Web Authentication API, or WebAuthn (a standardized, <a>secure authentication</a> interface for web applications using public-key cryptography) and the Client to Authenticator Protocol, or CTAP2 (a protocol that allows cryptographic authenticators like USB keys or smartphones with other devices). 
 
<p>While this combination of technologies might overlap, they all serve the primary function of bringing secure, passwordless security to hardware devices and web applications.</p>
 What Are FIDO-Certified Biometrics? 
<p>Simply put, FIDO biometrics are just FIDO-certified biometric devices and technologies that can function on top of FIDO authentication. These biometrics devices are built to conform to FIDO (thus, open) standards to provide strong authentication security that can complement several kinds of identity verification and management requirements.</p>
<p>The benefit of FIDO, and this FIDO biometrics, are that they are open and certified by the Alliance, meaning that they will operate under common standards and share interoperability with other FIDO protocols.</p>
<p>Some of the FIDO-certified types of biometrics include:</p>
 
 Fingerprints 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/voice-authentication/">Voice</a> 
 Facial Recognition 
 <a>Iris Scans</a> 
 
 Biometric Component Certification Program 
<p>To ensure the interoperability of the FIDO biometric component technology, the FIDO Alliance uses a certification process that’s independent of its other programs. This means that the creators of biometric components can apply for FIDO certification for that component without having a fully-functional, FIDO-certified authentication application or platform.</p>
<p>There are, however, rules for component integration–that is, if a biometric component is certified, there are still essential rules around how other authentication platforms can integrate that component if they seek FIDO certification.</p>
<p>Additionally, these certification requirements will depend on the type of FIDO certification. Authenticators seeking certification at FIDO levels 1 or 2 only have the option, not the requirement, to integrate biometrics. Levels 3 or higher, however, require certified biometrics.</p>
<p>In either case, FIDO provides a concrete process by which biometrics components are certified:</p>
 
 Application: Developers seeking certification must apply for a FIDO Alliance account to access the Biometric Dashboard. This Dashboard allows them to navigate the certification process, including initiating their application. 
 
<p>The FIDO Alliance <a>biometric</a> component certification secretariat will review this application, accept it, reject it, or ask for further documentation.</p>
 
 Biometric Testing: The developer submits the component to a FIDO-accredited laboratory for testing. The laboratory will combine online and offline testing with live subjects. The laboratory will also provide an Allowed Integration Document that outlines the changes necessary for authenticators to integrate the biometric component properly. 
 Laboratory Reports: Once the testing is complete, the laboratory will provide a laboratory report to the developer and to the certification secretariat, including the Allowed Integration Document. 
 Certification Requests: After the report is approved, the developer completes a certification request. This step also calls for the developer to provide metadata that describes the component. This metadata must include the Biometric Certification level, the Self-Attested False Accept Rate, and the Self-Attested False Reject Rate. 
 Certification Issuance: If the FIDO Alliance approves the certification, then the certificate is issued to the developer. The developer may submit their metadata to the FIDO Metadata Service. They will also pay their certification fee ($10,000 for members and $13,000 for non-members). 
 
 What Are the Benefits of Moving to FIDO Biometrics? 
 
 Standardized Passwordless Authentication: Passwordless authentication is a critical step in identity and access security. FIDO provides a robust and maintained way to implement passwordless authentication without having to lock into a single vendor or service provider. 
 Flexible Hardware-Based Authentication: A strength of FIDO standards is that it supports hardware-based token authentication, including using USB keys, keycard authentication, and hardware tokens. 
 
<p>With FIDO biometrics, you’ll also get the benefits of stronger security using physical traits (for example, including a fingerprint scan in a USB security key or leveraging FIDO-compliant facial recognition in a Windows laptop.</p>
 
 Regulatory Compliance: Biometrics, hardware-based authentication, and MFA are all components of most regulatory frameworks. 
 
<p>Furthermore, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, governs almost every federal and defense cybersecurity standard and is a member of the FIDO Alliance. Working with FIDO-compliant technology will go a long way to aligning your infrastructure with security standards.</p>
 
 Interoperability: FIDO biometrics won’t require you to lock in with a single provider or vendor. Additionally, the FIDO Metadata Service provides an extensive directory of compliant technology so you can trust any component or solution you adopt.

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 30th January to 5th&nbsp;February <p>Welcome to another in-depth edition of Veriscope Regulatory Recap! This week, the focus is on Britain’s crypto regulation draft, the Philippines SEC’s efforts to get more regulatory powers over the local crypto industry, Australia’s plans for crypto regulations, and Hong Kong Pondering over the pros and cons of new crypto regulations and stablecoin rule amendment. Let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p> Britain’s Crypto Regulation Draft is Open for Public&nbsp;Comments <p>Britain’s Finance Ministry, HM Treasury, has come up with the first set of crypto-asset regulatory rules amid reports that most crypto license applicants have failed to meet the country’s stringent AML standards.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/CamNguyenHome/status/1621121490543579136?s=20&amp;t=Zcvrcs6Nvm7q5GXeiM23DA">Image Source</a>)<blockquote>Any previously unregulated activities will come into the regulatory parameter, including centralized crypto asset exchanges, custody, and lending activities, according to Financial Services Minister of Britain Andrew Griffith.</blockquote><p>Proposed rules, already put out to public consultation, will also look into customer onboarding, public offers, transactions and remittances, platform operations, custody and mining transactions, and blockchain node operations.</p><p>The jurisdiction of these rules will cover crypto firms in Britain or those providing services to Britain. They will also come with definitive licensing and minimum capital and liquidity requirements.</p> Philippines SEC Eyes More Power Over Local Crypto&nbsp;Industry <p>The country’s Securities and Exchange Commission aims to strengthen its control over the local crypto industry.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1620240942694383616?s=20&amp;t=Zcvrcs6Nvm7q5GXeiM23DA">Image Source</a>)<p>The regulatory body has drafted rules on financial products and services, including cryptocurrencies and digital financial products, for public comment, keeping its goal in&nbsp;mind.</p><p>The proposed rules, if approved, will expand the definition of security to accommodate tokenized securities and other blockchain-related products.</p><p>It will also make the SEC more powerful by giving it the authority to restrict Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs: read crypto businesses) from collecting excessive interest, fees, or charges, disqualify or suspend law-violating executives, and even suspend a firm’s entire operation.</p> Australia has big Plans for Crypto Regulations <p>Australia’s Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services, Stephen Jones, recently shined a light on the country’s plans for crypto regulations.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1621534370325532674?s=20&amp;t=Zcvrcs6Nvm7q5GXeiM23DA">Image Source</a>)<blockquote>According to Mr. Jones, the government’s foremost goal is to protect crypto asset customers, and the government will take multiple crucial&nbsp;steps.</blockquote><p>The Australian authorities have first planned to expand their crypto team and enhance enforcement efforts to achieve this&nbsp;goal.</p><p>It also wants to encourage the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) to pay strict attention to properly reporting consumer&nbsp;risks.</p><p>As part of the efforts, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is looking forward to becoming more active in combating fraud and establishing a set of requirements and operating criteria for virtual asset service providers.</p> Hong Kong Mulls New Crypto and Stablecoin Regulations <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is weighing the risks and advantages of new regulations and amending the existing ones on stablecoins.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1620965517530914819?s=20&amp;t=Zcvrcs6Nvm7q5GXeiM23DA">Image Source</a>)<p>On 12th January last year, the authorities published a discussion paper on the same, asking for feedback from stakeholders.</p><p>According to the regulator, the recent responses from public bodies, businesses, professional organizations, and individuals also show that public sentiment is in favor of regulating stablecoins with a risk-based and agile approach that takes evolving market conditions into consideration.</p> Shyft Network Starts Monthly Shyft-wide General and Dev Updates to Keep Community Well-informed <p>We are thrilled to announce the launch of our monthly Shyft-wide general and product-related updates!</p><p>The goal is to provide the Shyft community with comprehensive updates on both general and technical developments happening across the&nbsp;network.</p><p>These posts will keep everyone well-informed and up-to-date on the latest happenings at Shyft, making it easier for our community to stay informed and&nbsp;engaged.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1620422285126504448?s=20&amp;t=JOhP2eezjoY0n6kWsz5JBA">Click here</a> for January’s Shyft overview and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-dev-deep-dive-monthly-jan-2023">here</a> for Dev Deep Monthly Overview.</p> Voting on Shyft DAO’s Proposal for Funding the Ambassador Program is now&nbsp;Live <p>The period for commenting on the Shyft DAO proposal for 300,000 SHFT and $31,400 to fund the expenses for the Shyft Ambassador program has now ended, and voting has begun after receiving sufficient interest from the community.</p><p>Your vote is important and will help decide the future of the Shyft Ambassador Program.

<p>Dock has just released the highly awaited Verification Feature on the <a href="https://certs.dock.io/">Dock Certs</a> platform and <a href="https://www.dock.io/dock-wallet-app">Dock Wallet</a>, which enables organizations to instantly verify their users’ digital credentials.</p> Benefits of Dock’s Credential Verification Features    Organizations can confirm the authenticity of someone’s credentials or documents within seconds instead of taking days, weeks, and months like &nbsp;traditional verification processes.  People can choose which parts of their credential to send to a verifier rather than showing all of the details of a credential, which enables more privacy and security by not providing more information than necessary.  Verifying credentials securely and instantly helps organizations:    Prevent document fraud  Save money on manual and expensive verifications  Enhance efficiency in operations  Comply with data regulations  <p>Nick Lambert, Dock’s CEO, said, "How can people trust each other and organizations in the digital world? Through verifiable, fraud-proof data. When someone presents you with a digital document or credential, it's more important than ever that you can quickly verify if that information is valid and authentic. We are thrilled to see more and more companies use Dock to eliminate fraud and save time and money by speeding up their verification processes."</p> Cutting Edge Ability to Verify Credentials Instantly and Securely <p>It’s never been easier for people to fake physical and digital documents and credentials to commit fraud. Many people around the world are using fake certificates to get high-stakes jobs like engineers, doctors, and nurses which puts many people at risk of injury, losing their assets, or death. It’s becoming harder to know what information is true and what isn’t. </p><p>Here are just a few of many consequences that unfortunately happened as a result of credential fraud:</p>  <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/132700/Fake-surgeon-who-operated-190-times">Fake surgeon operated 190 times at a major hospital</a>  <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/brigitte-cleroux-sentencing-ottawa-court-1.6425978#:~:text=Ottawa%20Police%20Service)-,Brigitte%20Cleroux%20%E2%80%94%20who%20for%20decades%20has%20pretended%20to%20be%20a,patients%20when%20she%20was%20unqualified.">Brigitte Cleroux pretended to be a nurse and school teacher for decades and used needles on patients</a>  <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/world/fake-engineer-and-a-deadly-building-20120914-25xpd.html">Fake engineer supervised a building project that collapsed after an earthquake that killed 115 people</a> &nbsp;   <p>But fraud can be prevented by issuing documents as <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/verifiable-credentials">Verifiable Credentials</a> that can be verified instantly by organizations with Dock’s tools, which enhances trust and transparency. The future of verification is here and it's powered by blockchain technology. Because this approach is quick, efficient, and fraud-proof, people can be confident in the accuracy and authenticity of the information being presented to them. </p><p>With Dock’s blockchain-based credential verification, organizations and individuals can say goodbye to the hassle and uncertainty of traditional verification methods. These older processes often involve manual, outdated, and tedious work of calling issuing organizations like universities, licensing organizations, and waiting a long time to get relevant documents verified. These delays and inefficient processes have resulted in consequences including hospitals not being able to fill enough nursing positions during urgent times and companies losing out on great job candidates.</p> Conveniently Verify Credentials With a QR Code By Phone or Computer <p>By creating a Verification QR Code in Dock Certs, you can request and instantly verify any document from your users. Users who scan the Verification QR Code with their Dock Wallet receive a notification of what data you are requesting. Once the user accepts, Dock instantly verifies the authenticity of the data and presents you with the verification result.</p> Wallet-to-Wallet Verification <p>Verifiers can import the Verification QR Codes to the Dock Wallet to enable Wallet-to-Wallet Verification. This way, they can easily start the verification process on their phone by showing the QR code for a holder to scan or sharing it via email or messaging channels.</p> Verify on the web <p>A Verifier can display the Verification QR Code on the web using a URL that holders can scan with their Dock Wallets.</p><p><a href="https://www.dock.io/guides/credential-verification-guide">Click here to see our complete step by step guide</a> on how to verify credentials with Dock Certs and Dock Wallet.</p> Privacy Enhancing Feature: Enabling People to Share Only the Data They Want With Selective Disclosure <p>With this new release, people will be able to share only the information they choose to, and nothing more with a tool called Selective Disclosure. This approach to data sharing provides a level of control and security that’s not possible with traditional verification methods. An example of Selective Disclosure is when someone sends an employer their license number on their credential but not their full name, address, and date of birth. </p><p>Elina Cadouri, Dock’s Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer, "At Dock, we built our company around the principles of privacy and security. Selective Disclosure is key to enabling these features. We are proud to offer a solution that empowers users to protect their data and ensures that privacy is at the forefront of everything we do." </p><p>By only sharing the information that is necessary for a specific purpose, people can minimize the amount of personal data they share, reduce the risk of their information being misused, and have control over who has access to it.</p><p>Selecting specific attributes to share from a credential is only possible if the credentials were issued using the Dock BBS+ option in Dock Certs. This innovative cryptographic signature enables privacy enhancing features such as Selective Disclosure and, coming soon, Zero-Knowledge Proofs. Zero-Knowledge Proofs is a way for someone to prove a claim without actually revealing what that information is, such as proving to someone that you are over 18 years old, without telling them your exact date of birth.</p> Benefits of Dock’s Verification Tools for Organizations <p>The Old Way</p><p>The Efficient Way</p><p>Outdated, manual,time-consuming, and expensive verification process that involve phone calls and emails</p><p>Simply scan a QR code</p><p>Credential verification takes days, weeks, or months</p><p>Verify credentials in seconds</p><p>Risk of credential fraud</p><p>Invalid credentials will be detected and won’t be verified</p><p>Verifying credentials instantly with Dock’s tools helps organizations: </p>  Reduce the risk of liabilities, fines, and lawsuits by enhancing the credential verification processes  Speeds up the hiring process, which is especially important in sectors like healthcare to fill in staffing shortages efficiently  Saves money and time by reducing the number of resources needed to verify if documents and documents are trustworthy  Helps organizations stay compliant with data regulations  Injuries and death can be prevented by ensuring your hire people with the right qualification process  <p>Get started with <a href="https://certs.dock.io/">Dock Certs</a> and the <a href="https://www.dock.io/dock-wallet-app">Dock Wallet (free)</a>.

  Japan will begin the CBDC pilot program this&nbsp;year.  The Bank of Japan will collaborate with a few regional financial institutions to conduct the pilot&nbsp;program.  If it’s Digital Yen pilot program meets its expectations, the country will launch it for wide-scale public usage in&nbsp;2026.  <p>Japan announced its plans to begin the CBDC pilot program in November 2022, which will launch sometime in 2023 and run for two years from the date of launch. During this period, the Bank of Japan (BOJ), with other banks and regional financial institutions, will conduct the&nbsp;pilot.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/BTCTN/status/1596406657214566402?s=20&amp;t=O9hQLpKrrbuiwshLuV-q6w">Image Source</a>)<p>It will test deposits and withdrawals from accounts and the feasibility of the currency in an emergency when there is no access to the internet. Whether the country adopts the CBDC, digital Yen, in 2026 will depend on the results of this&nbsp;trial.</p><p>This program that BOJ has currently taken up is an end-stage trial. The first or initial stage trials were held last year to test the primary functions, including issuance and circulation. It was an internal trial, while the current one examines the currency’s real-world usage feasibility.</p> Features Japan Wants to Have in Its&nbsp;CBDC <p>Japan wants its CBDC to offer universal access and not avoid any individual, device, or card. It also wants its CBDC to have counterfeit deterrence technology and prevention mechanisms to stop it from being used in illicit activities.</p><p>The CBDC should be available 24/7/365 to all users and offer cash-like settlement finality or instant payment capabilities. To ensure the same for many users simultaneously, the Japanese CBDC must have sufficient processing capabilities and scalability.</p><p>Finally, for it to be a meaningful financial tool, the CBDC has to have comprehensive interoperability features and compatibility with other payment and settlement systems.</p><p>Relevant Article: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/australia-going-the-cbdc-way">Australia Going the CBDC&nbsp;Way</a></p> Purposes Japan wants Its CBDC to&nbsp;Serve <p>Japan would have two main CBDC variants: i)Wholesale CBDC and ii)General Purpose&nbsp;CBDC.</p><p>While Japan has no intention to impose any sort of restrictions on its cash supply, there might come a time when the volume of cash in circulation will drop. In such a case, the Central Bank of Japan thinks general-purpose CBDCs could become a useful payment instrument alongside cash.</p><p>Moreover, irrespective of the levels of cash in circulation and the public’s demand, Japan wants its CBDCs to improve the stability and efficiency of the overall payment and settlement systems.</p> Point of Cautions in Japan’s Trajectory to Launching a&nbsp;CBDC (<a href="https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/cherry-blossoms-spring-chureito-pagoda-fuji-mountain-japan_10824511.htm#query=Japan&amp;position=0&amp;from_view=search&amp;track=sph">Image Source</a>)<p>Japan is cautious about maintaining a balance of its CBDC policy in line with its overall monetary policy. It is careful about designing its CBDC schemes, such as applying limits on the amount of issuance/holdings and remuneration.</p><p>The country wants its banks to carefully decide on the role-sharing arrangement with the payment service providers or PSPs. It believes the data handling part requires in-depth scrutiny, including who obtains and manages what data and under what conditions.</p><p>One of the crucial aspects that Japan’s CBDC is expected to play is cross-border payments.

<p>WiderPoV: Gall’s Law is guidance for starting something new. But continuation and incremental evolution is more normal for most leaders. We wrangle a hodgepodge, ragtag, island of mismatched lost toys. We only wish we could begin anew. </p>



<p>When you can’t start fresh, how do you induce elegance, simplicity, and resilience from your inherited, impossibly intricate, variegated, fragile mass of interconnection and interdependency? That’s the challenge.</p>

If so, the story of IBM’s venture into AI with Watson Health provides a cautionary tale.</p><p>Watson began 10 years ago, in 2012, when IBM decided it could use AI to make medical treatment recommendations that, it would soon be claimed, would put doctors out of their&nbsp;jobs.</p><p>Watson would “quickly find hidden insights&nbsp;… in massive volumes of data” to revolutionise healthcare, claimed IBM. It would transform medical imaging, transform our ability to diagnose rare diseases and extend treatments for scourges like cancer to where doctors are scarce (in places like India). It would understand each individual’s genetic profile to create a new era of personalised health care. And, because it could read and absorb far more medical research than any doctor could ever do in a lifetime, it would transform the ability to provide medical advice. Doctors would be increasingly redundant.</p><p>IBM’s PR machine went into overdrive, as did a sycophantic gullible&nbsp;media.</p><p>Ten years later, IBM quietly sold Watson Health for $1bn. Wow! you might say. That’s a lot of money! But it was nothing compared to what IBM had poured down the drain: over $5bn spent acquiring as many databases as it could, plus the costs of the 7000 people employed on the project. Watson Health — the ‘moonshot’ that was going to revolutionise health care globally — was a total&nbsp;failure.</p><p>Even while IBM was touting Watson as a saviour of mankind, doctors were telling the company it was useless. Either it told them stuff they already knew or made recommendations that were inappropriate for individual patients. Its advice didn’t travel either. The recommendations it gave to medics in India just didn’t fit Indian circumstances because the AI was trained by American doctors in American hospitals.</p> A fundamental fallacy <p>Many reasons have been given for Watson Health’s failure. Perhaps, if it had been trained by Indian doctors in Indian hospitals, it would have been more helpful in India, for example. (Perhaps, though at what&nbsp;cost?).</p><p>Many other criticisms of AI are also unfair: racist and sexist policies, for example, where the real fault lies with the people managing the process, not the technology itself. But what lies behind the Watson fiasco is a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of artificial intelligence itself: a belief that it is somehow replicating or replacing human intelligence.</p><p>This fallacy is now so widespread that it’s almost accepted wisdom. For example, both the UK and the Scottish governments are building AI and digital strategies that define AI in terms of computers doing “tasks commonly (or normally) requiring human intelligence”.</p><p>Watson-fed hype about the supposed feats of AI led Yuval Noah Harari (the supposedly learned author of the best-selling book Sapiens) to declare that with AI, “Humanity will create something more powerful than itself. When you have something that understands you better than you understand yourself, then you’re useless. Anything you can do, this system can do&nbsp;better.”</p><p>The UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt expressed the same thought when, in a recent speech, he asked “Who needs politicians when you have AI?”. No doubt he was joking, but the very fact that he could make such a quip illustrates how far the hype has gone. Because that’s what it is: hype, born of deep misunderstanding.</p><p>So-called artificial intelligence is nothing more or less than a machine — a computer — crunching lots of numbers using mathematical and logical functions in a strictly mechanical fashion. Er&nbsp;… that’s it. The term ‘artificial intelligence’ would lose its glamour (and its enormous value to hand-waving snake oil salesmen) if it said “dumb routine calculation at massive speed and scale”. But that’s what it is — and here is the essential point: such an ability to calculate does not equal human intelligence. AI does not ‘understand’ anything. The two are like chalk and&nbsp;cheese.</p><p>AI is good at solving logical, computable problems with clear, definite boundaries using clearly defined, fixed rules to achieve clearly defined, fixed answers. Like a game of chess, or recognising a face, or processing the way people use language. That’s immensely valuable. We at Mydex are enthusiastic about tools that do such things. But they are not ‘intelligent’&nbsp;.</p><p>Human intelligence did not evolve to solve logic puzzles like chess. It evolved to help humans survive by adapting to their environments — in a world where the most important problems are open-ended, with unclear boundaries (where one problem is likely to blur into other problems), where there are no clearly defined best answers and where, if we do find some good rules and answers, chances are that things will change so we need to change them for tomorrow. Human intelligence is designed for a changing world full of other people, in other&nbsp;words.</p> Spouting nonsense <p>Human intelligence is biological: embedded in a living, feeling body that is the product of billions of years of evolution, that has its own individual history and lives in a society with its own history, culture, morals, values and&nbsp;norms.</p><p>AI has none of this. As a result, it has no common sense. No concept of causation. No ability to ask ‘what if?’ questions. No imagination. No creativity (unless programmed to combine random elements, which is a million miles away from purposeful, intuitive human creativity). No ability to use analogy or metaphor (e.g. noticing the ways in which X is ‘like’ Y in some ways, but not in others). No ability to ‘level jump’ — to question rules as well as operate by them. For example, it cannot stop what it is doing to ask “Hang on! Does this actually make sense?” (which is why it is sometimes very good at generating nonsense). No ability to switch attention (by definition, because it never actually pays attention to anything). No feeling. No empathy. No awareness of context. No ability to sense situations and judge appropriateness. And so on. And so&nbsp;on.</p><p>In fact, as well as displaying all the <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/are-insights-always-good-b5e05e3eb56a">drawbacks and dangers of Big Data</a> discussed in our last blog, AI is so dumb that it is a major feat of AI research — a testimony to researchers’ genius — that, when it is presented with a picture of a cup of tea on a saucer with a spoon, they can teach it to identify the boundaries of the tea cup; an even bigger feat to teach it that the tea cup, saucer and teaspoon are separate objects. Something that every human child knows instantly without even thinking about&nbsp;it.</p> Fish or&nbsp;fowl? <p>AI’s failures on these fronts isn’t because of a lack of access to data or computing power. It’s computation and human intelligence are qualitatively different things. Teaching an AI to think like a human is like teaching an eagle to breathe water and swim and a tuna fish to breathe air and fly. It’s not going to happen because neither eagle nor tuna fish are designed to do these things. No matter how much data, computing power or money you throw at computer-driven number crunching it can never replicate a human being’s thinking, because they are designed in different ways to do different things.</p><p>Talking of design, you may have noticed I used the term ‘an AI’ in the last paragraph. That’s deliberate. There is no such thing as ‘artificial intelligence’ in general, aside from a human discipline: a collection of (very human) skills and knowledge about computing. In practice, there are only specific AI tools designed to do specific things, such as recognise faces or play&nbsp;chess.</p><p>AI tools designed to do these highly specific tasks cannot suddenly decide to do something else such as natural language processing, just as a mechanical tool such as a drill or kettle cannot suddenly decide to become an aeroplane. Both AI tools and mechanical tools are designed and built (by humans) to do specific things, and only those&nbsp;things.</p><p>So when the UK and Scottish Governments declare that AI is about computers doing things that normally require human intelligence, they are spouting nonsense. In fact, the exact opposite is true. The reason why AI can be valuable is because it can do one thing that humans can not do — crunch huge amounts of numbers in no time at all to identify correlations and patterns. That’s fantastic. We should use that ability for all its worth. But as soon as we ask, hope or expect AI to do anything more than that, all we are doing is wasting time, effort and money and risking disaster. As with Watson&nbsp;Health.</p> A deep-rooted misunderstanding <p>To be fair to the UK and Scottish Governments, this deep, fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of the beast has long, venerable roots. It goes back to a seminal paper, published by the father of AI Alan Turing back in 1950 when he asked “Can machines&nbsp;think?”</p><p>In that paper, entitled <a href="https://redirect.cs.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing.pdf">‘Computing Machinery and Intelligence</a>’, he invented the term ‘machine learning’ and laid out what would become an AI research agenda for the next three quarters of a century. Pure genius. But the paper did NOT answer ‘Yes’ to the question ‘Can machines&nbsp;think?’.</p><p>Instead, in the very first paragraph, Turing ducked his own challenge to ask a different question instead: whether machines can imitate human thinking. Then he spent the next half the paper narrowing his ‘imitation game’ down, further and further, setting aside all the ways in which machines can not imitate human intelligence, to finally focus on one tiny area of overlap: making calcuations using&nbsp;numbers.</p><p>Turing’s paper is therefore seminal in two ways: in the research agenda it created, and in the endless misunderstandings it spawned. Today, we are having to deal with both consequences — including folly on a grand scale resulting in:</p>  Billions of £/$/€ and decades worth of effort being spent on wild goose chases such as Watson&nbsp;Medical  Immense harm being done by multiple misapplications of AI, arising from people believing it can do things that it&nbsp;can’t  A failure to invest available resources in uses of data that could bring immense personal, social and economic benefits very&nbsp;quickly.  <p>In this blog series we have shown how providing every citizen with their own personal data store can ease citizens’ access to services, cut the costs of providing these services, improve peoples’ experience of using them, and join them up to produce better outcomes — while also opening up new dimensions of innovation and accelerating and enriching the journey to net&nbsp;zero.</p><p>Yet, in an extreme case of selective attention — <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/are-insights-always-good-b5e05e3eb56a">of counting bounces while ignoring gorillas</a> — all these immediate, practical, definite benefits are being ignored in favour of expensive, futile pipedreams born of gullibility and ignorance. Just imagine the real, demonstrable benefits, as outlined above, that Mydex personal data stores could deliver if it had $5 billion, 7000 staff and a decade to invest in providing personal data logistics infrastructure to inform all service provision!</p> Conclusion <p>To stress once more: we at Mydex are all in favour of AI, deployed correctly, to do what it can do. We have high hopes of personal AI, which crunches individuals’ own personal data to help them make better decisions and manage their lives better — working for them, rather than doing things to them — while protecting their&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Right now, as part of the Peoplehood project for example, we are collecting billions of data points from individuals’ smart meters to identify abnormal behaviour patterns for the old and frail — to generate alerts if they have a fall, for&nbsp;example.</p><p>This is all wonderful stuff. But it is not a panacea. Policy- and decision-makers’ fixation on Big Data and AI are one reason why the real, immediate, practical opportunities presented by personal data stores are being overlooked. But there is another reason too: mainstream economic theory is blinding people to the economic potential of personal data. That’s the subject of our next&nbsp;blog.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/artificial-intelligence-no-authentic-folly-on-a-grand-scale-e88dbda191b9">Artificial Intelligence?

<p>Microservices architecture—often called microservices—is a modern application design model developers use for designing large software projects. This architecture enables you to separate an extensive application into many independent parts, with each piece responsible for performing a single function or operation. Then, when a user requests a service, the application calls each of the relevant microservice components.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, if the user of an e-commerce website wants to purchase a product, the app will only interact with the components responsible for processing transactions. Features like user reviews, product searches, and support communication are independent. Of course, all this occurs behind the scenes while the user interacts with a single interface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A microservices-based approach offers countless benefits, including increased development speed, enhanced application security, rapid and efficient scaling, and improved fault isolation. However, compartmentalizing software in this fashion can also introduce complexities, especially regarding authentication across several disparate services.</p>

<p>Audit all apps, determine which are trusted and then limit scopes for all other applications.</p>

<p>Why?</p>
<p>One of the largest surface areas for data to be unknowingly leaked is through an unmanaged application through OAuth in Google Workspace. OAuth is a widely used protocol for granting access to resources. When a user grants an application access to their Google Workspace data through OAuth, they may not be fully aware of the scope of access they are giving to the application, and the application may have access to more data than the user intended. Additionally, if the application is not properly secured or is malicious, it may misuse the access it has been granted and potentially leak the user's data.</p>

<p>Guidance</p>
<p>You will first want to audit all connected apps, determine which ones are still needed, mark them as trusted, and prevent all other applications from accessing any high-risk/restricted scopes. Before restricting scopes, communicate with your employees about the change and provide a documented path for having new connections approved. </p>

<p>Reviewing Apps</p>
<p>Head to Security &gt; Access and Data Control &gt; API Controls and review your third-party API app access list. This will allow you to view every app in your organization in addition to what scopes have been granted. </p>

<p>Set Apps As Trusted</p>
<p>Look to see if there is an internal list of applications that have been approved. If they are allowed to access data from Google, mark them as Trusted. This will prevent them from being blocked if and when you move to block access for untrusted apps.</p>

<p>Set Access Levels for APIs</p>
<p>Note: Setting access levels will start restricting access. This will prevent employees (including yourself!) from connecting apps to Google that request any scopes you restrict. 

</p>
<p>Under Security &gt; Access and Data Control &gt; API Controls &gt; Google Services - View List, set the access levels that you want to use for each application. For example, if you store proprietary data in Google Drive, set Drive to be a Restricted App so that only trusted apps can authenticate with Drive scopes. </p>

<p>We recommend restricting the following:</p> 
   Drive 
   Mail 
   Calendar 
   Google Workspace Admin 
   Vault 
   Groups 
 
<p>Once complete, add a custom message under Settings to give users a meaningful error and path forward - include a link to your IT helpdesk contact information. </p>

<p>On the main API Controls page you can optionally restrict all third-party API access, but this will also block sign-in scopes. If you would prefer to have awareness of all apps using Google to sign in, this may be the best path. </p>

<p>In Conclusion</p>
<p>We hope that these tips have helped to demystify where to start with securing your Google Workspace environment! Remember, Rome was not built in a day. Start with an initial audit, explore your environment, and do the appropriate amount of testing and planning to make these changes a success. While some hurdles may be a challenge, it is far easier to lay the groundwork for security best practices when you are a smaller company versus when you reach hundreds, or even thousands, of employees. There is no time like the present to gift yourself some peace of mind. </p>

<p>Here’s to a year of good health, good company, and an even better Google Workspace setup than the year before!</p>

With the formation of the <a href="https://openwallet.foundation/">OpenWallet Foundation</a> and major players like Apple, Amazon, and Google developing their wallets, it’s safe to say that the war isn’t coming – the Wallet Wars have started.

				  The Rise of Digital Wallets 
<p>With the growth of digital currencies like Bitcoin and inevitable identity applications, it’s no surprise that the digital wallet market is projected to explode in the next few years. According to several recent reports, the number of digital wallet users is expected to reach 5.2 billion by 2026, with an estimated transaction value of USD 12 trillion. This market is enormous.</p>
<p>Digital Wallets will be versatile and carry a variety of credentials. The most prominent use cases right now are for payment (fiat and, far behind, cryptocurrency), but the potential is vast. In the future, Digital Wallets will hold identity information to expedite everything from travel to health care services.&nbsp;</p>

				  The Battle Ground 
<p>The major players in the digital wallet space are Google, Apple, and Samsung and then a long list of mostly failed bank wallets. They are all jockeying for the top position in the digital wallet race, hoping to make their wallets the default option on mobile devices. The minor players are startups developing innovative new technologies that could significantly advantage the companies that adopt them. These startups are developing new identification and authentication methods to improve the user experience of digital wallets.</p>
 Who Is Already Out? 
<p>In 2019, Facebook took a step into the world of finance with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/18/18682838/facebook-digital-wallet-calibra-libra-cryptocurrency-kevin-weil-david-marcus-interview">its digital wallet Calibra</a> and announced the<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/18/18682290/facebook-libra-cryptocurrency-visa-mastercard-digital-currency-calibra-wallet-announce"> launch of a crypto token Libra</a>. Calibra allowed users to store and exchange fiat currencies and make payments through Messenger and WhatsApp. In 2020, a change in direction saw the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/26/facebook-rebrands-libra-wallet-service-calibra-to-novi">rebrand to Novi</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook has already stepped back, and they shut down the Novi pilot in 2022. If you look at where they are investing, though, they will likely return.</p>

				  Who will win the wallet wars? 
<p>It’s still too early to say who will ultimately win the wallet wars. But one thing is sure: the battle for your digital identity is just getting started.</p>
<p>The fight for payment processing is likely to be won by the company that can provide the most effortless and seamless payment experience for merchants. And the battle for identity is likely to be won by the company that can provide the most secure, comprehensive and convenient digital wallet for consumers.</p>

<p>Around the world the transition from physical wallets to digital wallets is well underway. An Accenture survey of 16,000 customers in 13 countries found that 56% of them were using digital wallets more than five times every month (compared with only 48% using cards that often) and they interpret these results to mean that heading towards a hundred billion dollars of annual payments revenues for banks are “at risk”.

				  Challenge That Remains 
<p>However convenient as digital wallets may be, they are not without drawbacks, and one of the biggest challenges faced is backup and recovery. Chapter 9.7 of the SSI Book states, “a well-designed and engineered digital wallet should be safer and better protected from loss than a physical wallet, but only if the owner takes the necessary recovery preparation steps.”</p>
<p>So, what’s the best way to protect your digital wallet? It’s more complex, and bluntly, there are yet to be compelling answers. But – most of the things we’re putting in our wallets can be replaced, just like what happens if you lose your physical wallet.</p>
<p>User identity management and backup/recovery can be difficult, especially as organizations seek to minimize the risks associated with storing personal information.</p>
<p>Backup and recovery are still challenging, especially as organizations seek to minimize the risks associated with storing personal information. The answer might be that users take back control of their identities and become personally accountable for their security and recovery. Organizations can drastically decrease their risk burden by empowering individual users to manage their identities.</p>

				  Story 
<p>Recently, I discussed the advantages of digital wallets with my parents regarding safety and security. The risks associated with a physical wallet—like getting stolen or lost—are significant. On the other hand, digital wallets require passwords and other forms of authentication to ensure that only authorized individuals can access them. I reminded my dad that at any time, I could take his physical wallet and use his cards. But I would never be able to access his phone or digital wallet because I don’t know the password and can’t pass the biometric identification. My dad was intrigued by these enhanced security protocols and agreed that switching to a digital wallet was worth looking into.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p></p>
<p>What’s to Come</p>
<p>The future of digital wallets is likely to be defined by security and interoperability. Trust registries will anchor both.</p>
<p>On the security front, trust registries will make it impossible for bad actors to share and issue fake credentials. On the interoperability front, we will see the development of new standards that will enable different digital wallets to work together—allowing users to choose the digital wallet that best suits their needs without worrying about compatibility.</p>
<p>If you’re considering entering the digital wallet market, now is the time. With so much growth expected, there’s a massive opportunity for organizations to get involved in this rapidly growing industry.</p>
<p>It’s an exciting time for the industry, and we can’t wait to see what comes next!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Innovation, speed, and scale are the fundamental building blocks for success in tech today. Automation solutions help businesses implement these core principles and enable them to fulfill rapidly evolving customer needs across different ecosystems.</p>
<p>In a Linux ecosystem, bash scripts consisting of a series of shell commands help automate repeated tasks. As a command language interpreter (CLI) tool, it is used in an array of applications in the Linux ecosystem. Combined with Cron Job scheduler, these scripts are often used in DevOps to build business workflows and processes.</p>
<p>You can now utilize these bash scripts to also integrate PKI-based security into your workflows and protect your servers and applications. Digital security ecosystems have evolved to ensure DevOps can leverage their existing knowledge to collaborate with the new tools and make implementing security a smooth, scalable process that matches their speed.</p>
<p>Until now, PKI expertise was a necessary prerequisite for successfully securing applications and servers, making developers wary of integrating security measures in their DevOps builds/processes. Today, it is possible to leverage out-of-the-box tools developed by PKI experts to implement security end-to-end to protect your business.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.entrust.com/-/media/documentation/whitepapers/pk20-1001-001_pki_rest_api_wp.pdf">Entrust CA Gateway (CAGW)</a> Command Line Interface (CLI) tool is one such tool that can be used to automate security for Linux servers and applications. It uses CAGW’s REST APIs to automate certificate and key generation, issuance, and lifecycle management to secure your endpoints at the time of deployment itself. Using this CLI tool it is possible to automate various complex cryptographic operations and integrate security into existing workflows and processes. It is an interactive tool that can be modified based on your requirements.</p>
<p>The CAGW CLI tool can automate the execution of these tasks:</p>
 
 Generating the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) with subject using OpenSSL 
 Listing various certificate authorities (CAs) in the system 
 Listing all profiles for a CA 
 Requesting and enrolling new certificates with CSR 
 Certificate revocation by serial number 
 Bulk certificate issuance 
 
<p>The technical documentation and the bash scripts for the CAGW CLI tool are available on this <a href="https://github.com/EntrustCorporation/pki-utilities">Entrust GitHub page</a>.</p>
<p>A suite of <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/certificate-solutions/products/pki">Entrust PKI</a> products can be leveraged in the DevOps environment to simplify the automation of security essentials. A DevSecOps approach is necessary to ensure your network, servers, and applications are secure at the time of deployment itself. With the threats and attacks modern businesses face, security cannot be an afterthought. And it is now possible to implement security in DevOps without sacrificing the pace of development.</p>

<p>Modern businesses need to adopt a culture of agile collaboration to deliver results and exceed market expectations. DevOps enables organizations to innovate at speed, collaborate efficiently, and deliver results faster.</p>
<p>While helping organizations build better, DevOps often sidesteps implementing security in its need for speed. Traditionally, security has been the complex component that would hit the brakes in the DevOps race. But today, security solutions can match the speed and flexibility needs of DevOps and protect businesses at the same time.</p>
<p>Entrust automation solutions enable DevOps to implement security from day one with scalable solutions that are easy to integrate, iterate, and automate. <a href="https://www.entrust.com/-/media/documentation/whitepapers/pk20-1001-001_pki_rest_api_wp.pdf">Entrust Certificate Authority Gateway</a> (CAGW) provides a RESTful interface to access multiple CAs like Entrust – public and private, Microsoft CA, and AWS for automating certificate provisioning, issuance, deployment, and lifecycle management.</p>
<p>Certificate and key issuance are the first steps in security. But to secure an application end-to-end you need complete visibility and control over the various keys, certificates, and identities in use. Entrust automation solutions like <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/certificate-solutions/products/pki/certificate-hub">Certificate Hub</a> and CA Gateway provide the speed and scalability with an automation layer enabling DevOps to leverage best security practices without slowing them down.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/certificate-solutions/learn/how-does-ssl-work">TLS/SSL certificates</a> and <a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/faq/how-to-manage-encryption-keys">cryptographic keys</a> establish trust in identities and communications. But TLS/SSL encryption/decryption at high volumes can negatively impact a web server’s performance. TLS/SSL offloading is a process by which this encryption/decryption process is moved from a web server to a separate device earmarked for processing TLS/SSL.</p>
<p>F5 BIG-IP is a popular hardware or software-based local traffic manager that “offers a high-performance network load balancer with blazing-fast TLS/SSL offloading and TLS/SSL inspection to secure data from end-to-end between clients and servers. To leverage F5’s network capabilities, organizations need to provision and manage certificates and cryptographic keys for the numerous clients and servers connected to the load balancer.</p>
<p>Entrust CA Gateway Ansible Module enables users to fully automate security implementation in the F5 ecosystem. This module helps to automatically implement the TLS/SSL offloading policies, from certificate issuance to certificate deployment at the desired endpoints. Together with other Entrust services like Certificate Hub, it provides users complete visibility, real-time monitoring, and control of the certificates and keys in their network, enabling them to mitigate business disruptions.</p>

Our ongoing Predict ETH Challenge →<a href="https://t.co/0lxSpl4khC">http://bit.ly/3XrXzHu</a><p>“How do I predict future asset prices?” is the multi-billion dollar question on every trader’s mind. Artificial intelligence can help to accurately predict asset prices. Indeed, the most robust predictive trading algorithms use machine learning (ML) techniques. On the optimistic side, algorithmically trading assets with predictive ML models can yield enormous gains à la Renaissance Technologies… Yet algorithmic trading gone awry can yield enormous losses as in the latest FTX&nbsp;scandal.</p><p>If you code an accurate price prediction model, then the next logical step is to trade with it.

We authors give no warranty about the performance of this algorithm, nor should anything in this article be considered financial advice.</p><p>Moving on to the fun&nbsp;stuff…</p> Setting up our environment <p>First, we’ll set up our environment with a Prophet machine learning model to forecast prices. Easy&nbsp;peasy.</p> Profit with ‘Prophet’ <p>Prophet is a forecasting algorithm originally developed by Facebook that uses additive models. In other words, Prophet sums several different functions that each fit pieces of a historical dataset to create one complete model for predicting future values. This forecasting model can be used for any kind of time-series data, but in this example we will use it to predict ETH crypto&nbsp;prices.</p><p>‘Explain Prophet’s additive models to me like I’m five years&nbsp;old.’</p><p>Prophet sums: 1) a combination of trend functions (including non-linear ones) with 2) seasonal inputs (including yearly, monthly, weekly and daily seasonalities) and 3) holiday effects (customizable to particular regions!). The result is a practical, real-world model that’s much more sophisticated than simple linear extrapolation. Pretty cool,&nbsp;no?</p><p>Prophet is implemented in Python, a widely used programming language for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It’s also open-source!</p><p>Find the full Prophet source code at <a href="https://facebook.github.io/prophet/">https://facebook.github.io/prophet/</a></p> Installing Prophet <p>To install Prophet, you can use the pip command in your Terminal/Git Bash or an equivalent command based on your computer’s package-management system. We’ll install with pip here for ease of use with&nbsp;Python:</p> $ python -m pip install prophet <p>That’s it! Nothing complicated here.</p><p>If you have a fickle environment and encounter issues while installing, we’re here to help! Chat with the Ocean Protocol core team on our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/TnXjkR5">Discord</a> with any questions!</p> Your Crystal Ball: Or how to make price predictions <p>All the code for creating the algorithm to predict ETH is <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KDtCc5K6bXItHggBi2e4bEkl6-GRB2X3?usp=sharing">here</a> in a Jupyter notebook.</p><p>It’s time to use machine learning to forecast prices. We’ll be implementing a basic ML pipeline to forecast future prices for the Ethereum-Tether (ETH/USDT) cryptocurrency pair.</p><p>What is an ML pipeline? A machine learning pipeline usually consists of these&nbsp;steps:</p>  Data gathering and processing  Machine learning&nbsp;modeling  Model evaluation  Model inference  <p>Let’s collect and transform ETH price data from a reliable source into a format that we can use with our Prophet&nbsp;model.</p><p>ETH/USDT prices data can be downloaded from several <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth/tree/main/examples">places</a>, but in this tutorial we’ll use Binance API for a simple solution to getting hourly ETH/USDT&nbsp;prices.</p><p>In your terminal, start the Python&nbsp;console.</p> $ python <p>Then, enter the following steps each in a new&nbsp;line:</p> &gt;&gt;&gt; import requests<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; import pandas as pd<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; url = "https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines?symbol=ETHUSDT&amp;interval=1h&amp;limit=1000"<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; r = requests.get(url)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; cex_x = r.json() <p>Note: The Binance API only works outside of the U.S. American users will need to either run a VPN or use a different data&nbsp;source.</p><p>In the snippet above, cex_x is an object of 500 data points, one for every hour, on the hour. Each data point has a list of 6 values: (0) Timestamp (1) Open price (2) High price (3) Low price (4) Close price (5) Volume. We will use the hourly “Close price” to make our price predictions.</p><p>More information regarding the Binance API is available in their <a href="https://binance-docs.github.io/apidocs/spot/en/#introduction">documentation</a>.</p><p>Initially, the timestamp is a Unix timestamp in milliseconds. We need to convert that Unix timestamp into a Python datetime object. We’ll convert the Unix time interval from milliseconds to seconds, then use a loop to convert the Unix timestamp into a list of Python datetime&nbsp;objects:</p> &gt;&gt;&gt; from datetime import datetime<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; uts = [xi[0]/1000 for xi in cex_x]<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; ts_obj = [datetime.utcfromtimestamp(s) for s in uts] <p>The variable ts_obj contains the list of Python datetime objects. Remember, these datetime objects correspond to the Close prices of ETH/USDT coin pair on hourly intervals, but are not the Close prices themselves… We need to create a Python dataframe containing both the hourly timestamps and their Close&nbsp;prices.</p><p>Let’s create the Python Pandas dataframe using the first two lines of code below. Then, we will split the dataframe into a training set and a test set using the third and fourth lines of code&nbsp;below.</p><p>What is a training set and a test set? A training set is the data fed into the ML algorithm to model the behavior of the data for generating a forecast. A test set is the data your ML algorithm uses to see if its forecast is accurate. If the forecast isn’t accurate, then the algorithm revises its model. Thus, the machine “learns” from the test&nbsp;data.</p><p>We’ll use most of the hourly Close price data as our training set, but we’ll save the last 12 hours of Close prices to test our&nbsp;model.</p> &gt;&gt;&gt; cls_price = [float(xi[4]) for xi in cex_x]<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; dataset = pd.DataFrame({"ds": ts_obj, "y": cls_price})<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; train = dataset.iloc[0:-12, :]<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; test = dataset.iloc[-12:, :]  ‘Fit’ for a&nbsp;model <p>The first step to using Prophet is instantiating a Prophet object. We create a Prophet object called model in the first two steps below. Then, we just call the fit function on our training set to create our forecasting model.</p> &gt;&gt;&gt; from prophet import Prophet<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; model = Prophet()<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; model.fit(train) <p>Et voilá, our Prophet model is created and we can start to predict hourly ETH/USDT crypto&nbsp;prices!</p><p>But how accurate is our model,&nbsp;really?</p> Cross Validation Testing <p>One way to significantly improve our ML model’s accuracy is by using cross validation. Cross validation will help us with two things: 1) selecting the additive functions correctly that create the model and 2) making sure that the model doesn’t fit the training data too closely to reduce&nbsp;noise.</p><p>Additive functions individually model data’s behavior and add together in sequence to create one unified model for the data. Noise is the small, high frequency fluctuations in ETH/USDT prices over time. Since our Prophet model is fitted perfectly to our data including all that noise, Prophet’s forecasted prices will likely deviate from general trends in the data because noise generates a greater number of additive functions in the&nbsp;model.</p><p>What we need is a way to smooth out our Prophet model’s functions to eliminate some of the noise and predict more generally the direction of future ETH/USDT&nbsp;prices.</p><p>How does cross validation work?</p><p>Cross validation takes the training set and splits it into chunks for re-training and testing the model. Starting from an initial time in the past, each chunk has an equivalent timespan called a Horizon to evenly cross validate. The very first horizon is used to train the model, then the second horizon is used to test your model. This pattern repeats in chunks until a final Cutoff time in the training&nbsp;set.</p><p>The ML algorithm tests one last time its model on the data after the cutoff. Then, the error is computed and the ML model does its final&nbsp;tuning.</p><p>All that to say, we can cross-validate with just a few elegant lines of&nbsp;code:</p> &gt;&gt;&gt; from prophet.diagnostics import cross_validation<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; df_cv = cross_validation(model, initial='30 days', period='1 hour', horizon = '12 hours')&gt;&gt;&gt; df_cv = cross_validation(model, initial=’30 dys’, period=’1 hour’, horizon = ’12 hours’) <p>Computing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) is just as&nbsp;easy:</p> &gt;&gt;&gt; from prophet.diagnostics import performance_metrics<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; df_p = performance_metrics(df_cv) <p>You can see in the chart below that the MSE of the prediction increases as we try to predict further in time, which makes sense because uncertainty increases over&nbsp;time.</p><p>Now that we have a working and cross validated ETH price prediction model, let’s see how closely it modeled the data overall using the NMSE&nbsp;metric.</p> How good are we at predicting future ETH&nbsp;prices? <p>We’ll calculate the Normalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE) to assess the accuracy of our cross validated Prophet model. Why? NMSE is the de facto measurement for comparing the accuracy between various ML models, so it will give us a good sense of how we stack up with the competition. Let’s compute the&nbsp;NMSE:</p> &gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy as np<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; forecast = model.predict(test)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; mse_xy = np.sum(np.square(np.asarray(test["y"]) - np.asarray(forecast["yhat"])))<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; mse_x = np.sum(np.square(np.asarray(test["y"])))<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; nmse = mse_xy / mse_x <p>In this code, the variable nmse is the error of the model performing in the unseen test set. The following chart shows a 12 hour ETH price prediction. The dotted line divides the historical data used for training and the unseen testing&nbsp;data.</p><p>And indeed, things are on the up and up 🙂 It’s time to monetize our trade secret ETH price prediction algorithm…</p> Ocean Protocol <p>Ocean Protocol builds open-source tools to monetize datasets and algorithms on the blockchain. Publishers of datasets and algorithms can use Ocean Protocol tools to mint their own data NFTs (including metadata) and grant access to these NFTs using data&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>You can learn more about Ocean Protocol in the <a href="https://www.oceanacademy.io/ocean101/chapter-1">Ocean&nbsp;Academy</a>.</p><p>In this tutorial, we’ll create a data NFT to store our ETH price prediction algorithm and grant access to it for paying consumers.</p><p>Installing Ocean is just one&nbsp;command:</p> $ python -m pip install ocean-lib <p>If you encounter issues, ping us on <a href="https://discord.gg/B5KsHKf8">Discord</a> and the Ocean team will help you! Our <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth/blob/main/challenges/main2.md">official docs</a> are also a reference.</p><p>Let’s set up our environment by creating an Ocean object on our blockchain of choice. We’ll use Polygon in this example for its low gas&nbsp;fees.</p> &gt;&gt;&gt; from ocean_lib.ocean.ocean import Ocean<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; from ocean_lib.web3_internal.utils import connect_to_network<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; from ocean_lib.example_config import get_config_dict<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; connect_to_network(“polygon”)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; ocean = Ocean(get_config_dict()) <p>Next, we have to connect our wallet (Alice impersonates the owner of the wallet in the steps&nbsp;below)</p> &gt;&gt;&gt; # Assuming the private key comes from env var<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; import os<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; from brownie.network import accounts<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; alice_private_key = os.getenv(‘REMOTE_TEST_PRIVATE_KEY1’)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; accounts.clear()<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; alice_wallet = accounts.add(alice_private_key) <p>Now we’re ready for compute-to-data. Drumroll, please!</p> Compute-to-Data <p>Compute-to-data (C2D) is a functionality within the Ocean tech stack that allows data consumers to buy the results of computation on a dataset (i.e. AI model or other data outputs) rather than purchasing the dataset directly.</p><p>In this case, data publishers can upload an algorithm to the Ocean Marketplace by creating an asset through the Ocean Library. The output of this algorithm can then be sold to other users in the marketplace. In other words, data and algorithm owners can monetize this IP while preserving the privacy of the data contents.</p><p>First, the algorithm should be uploaded to a repository — Github for example. Then, the URL from the algorithm is used in the following way to create the asset in the marketplace:</p> &gt;&gt;&gt; ALGO_url = “https://raw.githubusercontent.com/&lt;repository&gt;/&lt;file&gt;.py"<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; (ALGO_data_nft, ALGO_datatoken, ALGO_ddo) = ocean.assets.create_algo_asset(name, ALGO_url, alice_wallet, wait_for_aqua=True)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(f"ALGO_ddo did = '{ALGO_ddo.did}'") <p>The URL of the algorithm is only visible to Ocean Protocol’s technology, but the URL is encrypted to the users who buy the asset. The key printed above is the identifier for the asset created in the marketplace.</p><p>We’re done! The output DID is your algorithm asset’s digital identifier that proves it exists now on the Polygon blockchain. This asset can now be bought on the Ocean Market to compute on data and output those predictions to purchasers.</p><p>Congratulations!</p> Conclusion <p>We trained a forecasting ML model to make predictions about the future values of ETH/USDT crypto pair. We explored how to transform algorithms into sealable assets using the Compute-to-Data (C2D) feature. The end result? Those who follow this tutorial can sell predictions for ETH/USDT for any point in time through the Ocean Market using C2D, allowing you to monetize your IP. This example is only one of the many possible applications of the Ocean Protocol.

<p>Self-sovereign identity gives users the ability to store and manage their own identity and data online. This new identity layer of the internet will fundamentally shift the relationship users have with the applications and services they interact with. When users access websites, they can provision access to their self-managed data, rather than relying on the company that operates said website to store and manage their personal information.</p><p>For example, we can use Bob, an everyday person who uses an ever-increasing number of different online applications and services for various purposes. If you're a human in the modern age reading this, you probably are like Bob in many ways. In the current model for identity on the internet, Bob's online data is stored in siloes across all the different servers for the companies he has accounts with. </p><p>Bob does not own this data—if his favorite photo-sharing social media application decides to shut down his account, he loses all of his memories stored there and the personal connections he has built over time. In a proposed future state of the internet powered by self-sovereign identity, Bob would own and manage all of his own data, then provision access to each of the applications and services whenever he chooses. </p><p>This shift has several benefits for both users and enterprises. For users, self-sovereign identity gives them more control over their personal data. They can choose which data to share and with whom, and they can revoke access at any time. This gives users greater privacy and security, while also improving user experience by allowing for more personalized experiences and reducing the number of unique usernames and passwords that need to be managed.</p><p>For enterprises and companies, self-sovereign identity has clear benefits–more personalized experiences for users, lower compliance costs associated with storing data, and reduced risks of data breaches. </p> Better User Experiences <p>By allowing users to share the data they choose, enterprises can create more tailored experiences that are relevant and engaging for the user. Providing highly personalized experiences can increase customer conversion rates, while also improving customer satisfaction and retention overall. <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-value-of-getting-personalization-right-or-wrong-is-multiplying">A recent report from McKinsey</a> found that companies that excel at personalization see 40% higher revenue than their competitors. Measuring performance across US industries, the report estimates that shifting to top-quartile performance in personalization would generate over $1 trillion in value. Current data aggregation practices to inform personalization strategies are incredibly costly, with billion-dollar companies specializing in collecting and selling customer data for personalization and targeted advertising.</p><p>With self-sovereign identity, we can enable a system where users themselves can selectively disclose their information for a more customized experience, which can increase conversion and retention rates while decreasing the costs of personalization. This may be a tough pill to swallow for companies earning millions (and billions, in some cases) by tracking and aggregating consumer data. However, leveling the playing field to restore user control of personal information will ultimately create unique branding and memorable experiences in the digital world. </p><p>Currently, our online preferences and behaviors are stored in siloes managed by separate companies. There are incredible opportunities unlocked if that data becomes portable. Users can then share a combination of their preferences and other identity attributes within a new application to customize their initial experience immediately. The key to remember here, however, is that the choice to share that information should remain with the user. &nbsp;</p><p>Reducing Compliance Costs</p><p>Decentralized identity can also help enterprises and companies reduce their costs of compliance. By storing less personal information of users on their servers, they can reduce the amount of data that needs to be stored and protected. This can lower costs associated with data management, in addition to reducing costs for maintaining compliance with various data protection regulations, like GDPR and CCPA. </p><p><a href="https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/">GDPR</a> (the General Data Protection Regulation) is a law passed by the EU, effective in May 2018, that enforces guidelines for any organization that targets or collects data related to people in the EU. <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/increasing-it-effectiveness/publications/assets/pwc-gdpr-series-pulse-survey.pdf">PWC</a> surveyed 200 C-Suite executives (CIOs, CISOs, CMOs, CPOs, and General Counsels) from US companies with more than 500 employees about their preparations for GDPR compliance in 2017 before the law became effective. The survey results showed that 68% of respondents had budgeted between $1 million and $10 million for GDPR compliance. Nine percent (9%) of the survey respondents expected to spend over $10 million to address GDPR obligations. The fines for violating the GDPR can be as high as the greater of €20 million or 4% of global revenues, plus damages owed to affected individuals seeking compensation. </p><p>Other jurisdictions, like the State of California, are following suit, passing their own versions of consumer data protection regulations in an effort to curtail the mass surveillance on citizens by Big Tech. The California Attorney General released <a href="https://www.dorsey.com/newsresources/publications/client-alerts/2019/12/ccpa-update">an economic impact assessment,</a> which estimated the total cost of initial compliance with the CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) would approach a staggering $55 billion. As regulators globally address public concerns about data privacy and processing, the costs for companies maintaining compliance will become even more significant, if they do not reframe their philosophy on the data collection practices at a fundamental level. </p><p>A new identity layer of the internet, which allows users to self-opt into disclosing their personal data and manage how their data are shared further, will significantly decrease the overhead and administrative costs associated with managing user data in company servers. </p><p>No Data to Breach</p><p>In addition to improved user experience and lower costs associated with data storage and compliance, self-sovereign identity can help prevent one of the biggest PR crises a large company can face–a data breach.</p><p>By reducing the amount of personally identifiable information (PII) on company servers, the honeypot of large internal databases storing millions of records representing user data, like names, addresses, passwords, and credit card details, is eliminated. This means that hackers will be less likely to target companies’ servers, and if they do, there will be less sensitive information for them to steal. While this also protects companies from the PR nightmare of a data breach, it also protects consumers by reducing the risks that their private information becomes compromised and potentially used for nefarious purposes.</p><p>The cost of data breaches can be significant for companies. According to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach?utm_content=SRCWW&amp;p1=Search&amp;p4=43700072379268739&amp;p5=e&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAoL6eBhA3EiwAXDom5phVM9EeO8XsaQOvGFFAmJdFMbtgH8C9WOwDSMAxf9mGl1qN1PgyXxoCyJ4QAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">a study by IBM</a>, the average cost of a data breach for a company in the United States is $9.44 million, compared to the global average of $4.35 million. This total cost represents expenses such as legal fees, lost business, and damage to the company's reputation. For “mega-breaches” with between 50 to 60 million records affected, the average cost is $387 million.</p><p>In addition to the financial cost, data breaches can also lead to negative press and loss of consumer trust. <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/risk-and-resilience/our-insights/the-consumer-data-opportunity-and-the-privacy-imperative">McKinsey surveyed</a> 1,000 consumers in North America and found that 71% of respondents would stop doing business with a company if it mishandled sensitive data. Data breaches can have a significant impact on a company's bottom line, as well as its reputation. This risk is mitigated in a new digital identity paradigm powered by verifiable credentials. If users are able to self-manage their data and provision access to websites only when needed, the data aren’t housed in centralized databases, which act as a honeypot for hackers or other bad actors looking to sell user credentials or data on the dark web.</p><p>Self-sovereign identity enabled by verifiable credentials can give users more control of their data online and afford them more customizable and personalized experiences as they interact with companies online, if they choose. Companies can see reduced compliance costs for enterprises and reduced risk of data breaches by reducing the amount of consumer data stored on their servers. By adopting self-sovereign identity solutions, companies can protect themselves and their customers from the significant costs and negative press associated with data breaches.</p><p>There is a wide range of industries that rely on data storage and record-keeping that can be supercharged with verifiable credentials and similar technologies. We previously <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/future-state-healthcare/">wrote a blog post</a> about how digital credentials can be applied within the healthcare industry. We will explore other industries in future blogs to come–so subscribe and follow along on this Verifiable Credentials Future State journey with us!</p> <p>About Spruce: Spruce is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

If you claim weekly, you can re-stake your rewards for compound&nbsp;gains.</p> 3. DF23&nbsp;Overview <p>DF23 is part of DF Beta. DF Beta’s aim is to test the effect of larger incentives, learn, and refine the technology. DF Beta may run 10–20 weeks. In any given week of DF Beta, the total budget may be as low as 10K $OCEAN or as high as 100K&nbsp;$OCEAN</p><p>Some key&nbsp;numbers:</p>  Total budget is 75,000 $OCEAN. (This is an increase from 50,000 $OCEAN in&nbsp;DF18).  50% of the budget goes to passive rewards (37,500 $OCEAN) — rewarding users who hold veOCEAN (locked&nbsp;OCEAN)  50% of the budget goes to active rewards (37,500 $OCEAN) — rewarding users who allocate their veOCEAN towards productive datasets (having&nbsp;DCV).  Ocean currently <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/">supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.  <p>As usual, the Ocean core team reserves the right to update the DF rewards function and parameters, based on observing behaviour. Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p><p>DF23’s reward function builds on the prior reward function that was used in DF9-DF22, which are described in the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6">DF9 launch post</a>. The next section describes the specific&nbsp;updates.</p> 3. Update to Reward Function for&nbsp;DF23  3.1 DCV-bound rewards at asset&nbsp;level <p>DF9 introduced the constraint to “bound total rewards by total DCV * mult”. The multiplier keeps shrinking, such that by DF29 it’s no longer profitable to wash-consume.</p><p>We’re pleased with the outcome of this: it’s incentivized data farmers to drive&nbsp;DCV.</p><p>We can make a small change to tune it further. The idea is: rather than bounding total rewards by DCV (global), bound them at the asset level. (Just like RF bounds &lt;= 125% APY at the asset&nbsp;level.)</p><p>Here’s the updated macro algorithm for rewards distribution:</p>  As usual, distribute rewards pro-rata to each asset on its&nbsp;DCV.  Then, for each asset: (a) Compute rewards (b) Further bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY and by its DCV *&nbsp;mult  <p>Benefits:</p>  People can’t rely on a single actor to do wash consume for everyone; instead they need to do it themselves. This catalyzes more engagement from more&nbsp;people.  More robust RF, because it’s specific to each asset: generalizing on the previous point, it likely bounds other undesirable behaviors that we haven’t yet identified  Conceptually simpler implementation, side-by-side with 125%&nbsp;bounding   3.2 Reward on DCV&nbsp;rank <p>DF9 modified the RF such that it first sent rewards to each dataset pro-rata to its DCV, then for a given dataset it sent rewards to stakers based on their stake (veOCEAN allocated to the dataset).</p><p>The challenge was: 1–3 datasets could swamp the DCV, and readily get &gt;99% of active rewards. This is a lost opportunity to incentivize others to publish their datasets and get DCV on&nbsp;those.</p><p>We can address this issue as follows: rather than send OCEAN to datasets pro-rata on the the DCV value itself, send based on the dataset’s DCV rank. The dataset with highest DCV (rank 1) gets the most; then second-highest (rank 2) gets the second-most; etc. This will spread rewards to more data&nbsp;assets.</p><p>This begs a question: what % of rewards should go to rank 1, to rank 2, etc?There are many options here. We approached this question in the following fashion. First, we implemented a prototype. Second, we parameterized the problem according to two variables:</p>  max_n_rank_assets: how many assets get nonzero rewards. E.g. 20, 50, or&nbsp;100  rank_scale_op: scale rank linearly (LIN), logarithmically (LOG),&nbsp;etc.  <p>Then we performed a study to explore the effect of these variables.</p><p>The images below explore the effect of max_n_rank_assets, when LIN scaling. As an example, on the left, assets with rank &gt; 100 do not get any rewards. (Assets with DCV = 0 never get rewards, of&nbsp;course.)</p>Effect of max_n_rank_assets = 10 (left), 50 (middle), and 20 (right). Scaling =&nbsp;LIN.<p>The images below explore the effect of scaling (LIN vs SQRT vs LOG), for is when max_n_rank_assets = 100. Going from LIN to SQRT, the dropoff after the top-ranked asset is sharper. Going to LOG, it’s sharper yet. In LIN, the top-ranked asset gets 2% of OCEAN reward; in SQRT it’s about 2.7%; in LOG it’s about&nbsp;4.8%.</p>Effect of scaling: LIN, SQRT, and LOG. max_n_rank_assets =&nbsp;100<p>The full study is in <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zZdWfywruMPt6r7vfl0nQD8Fgj4wkfuMslZcWJmy3GE/edit?usp=sharing">these&nbsp;slides</a>.</p><p>Using the study as a guide, we chose these final parameters: scaling = LOG, and max_n_rank_assets =&nbsp;100.</p> Conclusion <p>DF22 has completed. To claim rewards, go to<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards"> DF webapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF23 begins Feb 2, 2023. It ends Feb 9, 2023 at&nbsp;12:01am.</p><p>DF23 is part of DF Beta.

				  Hyperledger Aries Bifold is a project focused on building decentralized identity wallets for the purposes of receiving, holding, and presenting verifiable credentials. While there are other exciting use cases for the technology down the road, the immediate goal is to provide open-source tools and wallets for the community.&nbsp;  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By James Ebert</p>
<p>The Hyperledger Aries Bifold Users Group recently hosted its first ever summit to discuss technical priorities for the coming year. The most pressing issues were architectural — how to easily contribute and pull changes in from the project and how to better facilitate customization for individual solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the other important issues raised over the two-day summit included: What does the Bifold community want out of the next Aries interop profile – essentially, what technologies does the community want to be standardized for interoperability? A related question was “where does overlay capture architecture (OCA) fit into the interoperability profile?” This conversation led to several good ideas and is being continued in the Bifold Working Group bi-weekly meetings.</p>
<p>Other questions became action items for additional research, specifically around certain tools and integrations that the group would like to accomplish for the project. One such action item is in regard to Storybook — a tool for UI design and iteration, another one was Expo — a tool used to simplify the development process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most important outcome from the summit is that the project will move toward a focus on a modular, component-based architecture. The goal is to provide building blocks for creating digital wallets, rather than a full application that people can adapt to their purposes. This will provide more flexibility to the end developer trying to build using the software that already has their own requirements and use-cases they need to meet.</p>
<p>What’s next?</p>
<p>The group will also gradually experiment with implementing this new architecture: the consensus was that we don’t want a full refactor but rather a slower inclusion of more features over time. The next steps are getting some of the basics in place — for example, migrating to using Yarn instead of Node Package Manager (NPM) for package management, and setting up new standards for project configuration and repo management.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is certainly plenty still to be done but I think that you could comfortably call the first Hyperledger Aries Bifold summit a success. There was a great turn out from the community, the important conversations for moving the technology forward happened, and now we have a clear development direction for the group and action items to tackle in 2023.</p>

<p>We recommend standardizing on Chrome as your internal browser.</p>

<p>Why?</p>
<p>By standardizing on one browser, IT administrators can more easily deploy and manage security policies, updates, and troubleshoot issues. This can save time and resources for IT staff. It can help to improve security by reducing the attack surface and enabling IT to focus on securing one browser instead of multiple. Also, IT staff can be more familiar with the security features, vulnerabilities and best practices of that browser.</p>

<p>From the compliance perspective, some industries may have regulations or compliance standards that specify which browser must be used, standardizing on one browser can help organizations to meet these requirements. And finally, standardizing on one browser can help to reduce costs associated with purchasing and maintaining multiple browsers.</p>

<p>Guidance </p>
<p>It can be difficult to get employees to sign in to Chrome with their enterprise accounts in order to apply settings. We recommend first <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/9301891?hl=en">,deploying an enrollment token</a> to your managed devices, which will apply Chrome settings to them regardless of whether a user has been signed in. </p>

<p>Once some form of browser management in place, head into Devices &gt; Chrome &gt; Settings &gt; Users &amp; Browsers and set your security baselines. If you’re not sure where to begin, start by taking a look at the <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/google_chrome">,CIS Benchmaks for Chrome</a>. Any major changes should first be applied to an OU of testers (such the IT team) and then expanded out from there.</p>

 What’s your name and where are you&nbsp;from? <p>My name is Erick Pinos and I’m the Americas Ecosystem Lead at Ontology. I grew up in New Jersey. I’m half Costa Rican and half Ecuadorian.</p> Tell us a bit about yourself. What did you study? What are your&nbsp;hobbies? <p>I studied Computer Science and Business Management at MIT. At the moment, my hobbies are centred around virtual reality. I love to play with VR and try out new experiences involving games, 360º videos, VR-guided meditation, and more. I also love to cook, and I really enjoy experimenting with different ingredients and recipes to see how each affects the flavours and textures of what I’m making. It’s a fun application of chemistry and a good way to save money and eat healthier at the same&nbsp;time.</p> What kind of work do you do on a day-to-day basis? <p>On a day-to-day basis, I scout new leads for potential Ontology partners, whether it be a dApp for the Ontology EVM, or an integration partner for one of Ontology’s projects. There are a wide range of projects where we’re constantly seeking out new integration partners to strengthen Ontology’s offerings and use cases. These projects include ONTO Wallet, Ivy Market, Wing Finance, and Orange Protocol. I have regular calls across all time zones with various internal working groups and potential leads. So, I’m kept quite&nbsp;busy!</p> In your opinion, what makes Ontology stand out from other blockchains? <p>I think Ontology’s focus on decentralized identity and data makes it stand out. It was one of the first blockchains to have a working implementation of decentralized identity, complete with decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials that fit the W3C standard. That, coupled with Ontology’s extremely fast turnaround time for product deployments and updates, makes it a strong contender in the blockchain space.</p> What is the most exciting part of the project you’re working on for Ontology? <p>The most exciting part is seeing the many new Web3 projects that are popping up all over the space tackling various different problems. I like that working in outreach and lead generation gives me the opportunity to talk to various different founders and start-ups and to constantly be learning about the cutting edge of Web3, Metaverse, DeFi, DeSci, DAOs, and&nbsp;more.</p> What has been the most important moment in your career so&nbsp;far? <p>The most important moment for my career so far was taking the time to really understand Ethereum in 2016. Despite being involved in Bitcoin since 2014, my ideas in the space were limited to scalability infrastructure or payment systems for Bitcoin. After truly understanding how smart contracts worked, however, my mind was opened to all the possibilities of financial and non-financial systems that could be fully run on a blockchain.</p> What are you most excited for in your future at Ontology? <p>I am most excited to see how the Web3 space will unfold, given that most agree that technological progress occurs during a bear market. I’ve been a huge fan of the metaverse and I would like to continue to have an active role in helping more adoption&nbsp;occur.</p> As we mark Ontology’s five-year anniversary, where do you see Ontology and Web3 going in the next five&nbsp;years? <p>I see further developments in the decentralized identity and data space, led mainly by DAOs that have a growing user base and a growing need to properly manage and safekeep the identity and data being generated by their users via various day-to-day activities. I can see Ontology being a leader in this space, given its longstanding focus on decentralized identity and&nbsp;data.</p> Follow us on social&nbsp;media! <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/meet-the-team-ontologys-americas-ecosystem-lead-erick-pinos-7928a9fe780">Meet the Team: Ontology’s Americas Ecosystem Lead, Erick Pinos</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

			<p>Product Focus</p>
 Tokeny’s 2023 Product Roadmap: Scaling RWA tokenization 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in February 2023.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>We hope you are well. For the first edition of our Product Focus newsletter in 2023, we would like to share our main product development priorities for this year. Our focus is on four key areas: scalability, connectivity, security, and composability.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>Scalability empowers asset owners to efficiently tokenize and manage real world assets (RWAs) and securities,&nbsp;reducing costs and improving accessibility. Our self-service SaaS platform already allows our customers to start tokenization without any tech support. This year, we are taking it a step further by enabling issuers to manage advanced settings directly via the Servicing platform. We are also enhancing the UX and adding multiple new features, which will lower operational costs and increase investor access to digital securities.</p>
<p>For example, we are working on several features to enable large-scale operations for open-ended funds, such as REITs and UCITs. By simplifying blockchain tools for traditional investors and offering fractionalized assets at affordable prices, tokenized asset issuers can boost the accessibility of assets with automated workflows.</p>
<p>Connectivity ensures that tokenized assets are interoperable with the necessary service providers and market solutions to enrich data and facilitate liquidity.&nbsp;Our solutions use the token standard ERC3643. As it is now widely adopted, the number of ecosystem players is rising. Our role is to ensure that our customers can easily connect to any service provider, for example, valuation agents, centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges, as well as DeFi protocols to not only improve liquidity but also to&nbsp;open up new revenue streams&nbsp;(e.g. DeFi services, Billboard ads, etc.).</p>
<p>Security is a top priority to keep data and assets safe from potential vulnerabilities.&nbsp;To continue protecting our customers from any form of technical risks and data breaches, we are taking a multi-pronged approach by conducting more thorough security tests and audits, obtaining certifications such as SOC2, and improving extra measures such as 2FA authentication. In addition, our solutions will be compatible with the&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/erc3643-v4/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_2iuCRRAaZEi4QzWcpx_W7qnzk7wF094pPnPbtN1uzGGqUTR4sONNCS8V9oKq7NefcrdJc">upgradable ERC3643 V4</a>&nbsp;to ensure that issuers always have full control over their assets as it provides the capability to fix any vulnerabilities that may arise.</p>
<p>Composability guarantees that issuers’ tokenized assets will never be blocked on one single blockchain network, providing a future-proof tokenization approach.&nbsp;Thanks to the portability of ERC3643, tokenized assets can switch to any EVM blockchain. Currently, our solution is already multi-chain, supporting Ethereum and Polygon. This year, we plan to integrate with more EVM blockchains based on market demand. We’ll also provide services to bridge assets from private networks to EVM public blockchains as institutions transition from private networks to public ones.</p>
<p>Our outlook for the coming year is exciting, and we look forward to continuing to receive your support as we strive to improve our products in order to assist you in achieving your tokenization goals.</p>

<p>As technology evolves, regulations in various industries also need to do the same. Although Europe is regarded as a “single state” in relation to its economic significance and is governed by the EU, individual countries are still responsible for passing their own laws. This is especially true within the gambling industry since no regulation or legislation standardizes betting throughout the continent. And the same goes for the United Kingdom. Though no longer part of the EU, the gambling market in the UK is still strongly connected to the rest of the EU gambling landscape.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/06/09/2459937/0/en/Global-Gambling-Market-to-Reach-876-Billion-by-2026.html">global gambling market is estimated to reach roughly $876 billion by 2026, evolving at a CAGR of 3.6%</a> over the assessment period. The <a href="https://europeangaming.eu/portal/latest-news/2020/11/10/81248/europe-online-gambling-market-report-2020-2025-featuring-major-players-bet365-888-holdings-gvc-holdings-kindred-group-william-hill-and-betsson/">European online gambling market is expected to grow by 9.20% by 2025</a>, fueled mainly by software and hardware innovations and the rising popularity of gambling. As such, the gambling industry in Europe shows no sign of slowing down. Still, with scams, gambling addiction, money laundering cases, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/prevent-underage-gambling/">underage gambling</a>, and other pressing issues, how is gambling regulated across the European Union? What do online gaming companies need to be aware of?</p>



<p>Regarding compliance and regulations, it is crucial to note that they <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/expecting-consistency-among-eu-online-gambling-regulations-dont-bet-on-it/">vary throughout Europe</a>. That said, KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements are standard regardless.</p>



 A well-regulated market. 



<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/european-gaming-and-betting-association-egba/">European Gaming and Betting Association (EGBA)</a> was formed to keep the casino industry under control. Their main objective was to promote a sustainable iGaming sector in Europe to help players enjoy a safe and fun experience inside a well-regulated market.</p>



<p>Based in Brussels, the association has worked to shape gambling regulations in the region. Online gaming companies associated with EGBA abide by a large set of industry standards designed to complement the numerous licensing guidelines they already adhere to in European nations.</p>



<p>Such European industry standards incorporate Responsible Remote Gambling Measures introduced by the European Committee for standardization and are executed to achieve the below objectives:</p>



  Ensuring the safety of vulnerable gamers  The prevention of underage gambling via age verification  Countering criminal and fraudulent behavior  Safeguarding customer privacy and the protection of private information  Accurate and prompt payments for customers  Responsible and truthful marketing through advertising regulations  Fair and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/responsible-gaming-for-safe-online-gambling-sites/">responsible gaming</a>  The prevention of money laundering  Ensuring a safe, secure, and reliable operating environment  Dedication to customer support and satisfaction  



<p>A growing number of European Union countries have established licensing systems allowing more than one operator to provide services on the market. Under EU law, no system is favored over another.</p>



<p>Gambling regulation in European Union countries involves diverse regulatory frameworks. In several judgments, the Court of Justice of the European Union has legitimized the compliance of national regulatory systems with European Union Law.</p>



<p>The Commission promotes the efforts of EU nations to upgrade their national online gambling legal systems, particularly in administrative cooperation among gambling regulatory authorities. It also offers support to protect gamblers and vulnerable individuals, including minors.</p>



 







 



 Regulations by EU country. 



<p>Each European country essentially shapes its <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/online-gambling-regulation/">gambling regulations</a>. Below are the regulations in some of the most prominent countries in that region.</p>



 France 



<p>Numerous forms of gambling are legal in France, and three central bodies regulate them. The Francaise de Jeux handles betting games and lotteries, the Pari Mutuel Urbain deals with horse racing, and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/arjel/">ARJEL</a> is associated with online gambling.</p>



<p>ARJEL also issues licenses for horse racing betting and forms of gambling that use decks of cards, i.e., poker. It also enforces online gambling regulations. The regulation makes it mandatory for licensees to verify players’ identity, address, age, bank information, and other data.</p>



<p>Technological solutions to verify players’ identities, such as AI applications like VideoIdent, are permitted within the requirements. The adoption of PACTE in April 2019 safeguards minors by fining online gambling companies offering free gambling.</p>



 United Kingdom 



<p>Though no longer part of the EU, the UK Gambling market is still very much connected to the rest of Europe. The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/united-kingdom-gambling-commission-ukgc/">UK Gambling Commission</a> regulates gambling activity in the region, offering some of Europe’s most stringent gambling regulations. Gamblers in the UK <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-49731701">spend 14.5 billion GBP</a> annually, and this number is expected to grow. Based on such findings, the body added a limit to the amount gamblers can place on fixed bets in betting shops. Betting shops in the UK can typically be found in high streets up and down the country, and before these limits were introduced, players could place up to 100 GBP per bet. Currently, players can only wager up to 2 GBP. This resulted in great losses for betting shops, and William Hill had to close over 100 of its betting shops showing how much this decision has changed the betting landscape.</p>



<p>Operators must also verify a customer’s age before allowing them to deposit funds into a gambling account. Regulators encourage operators to use artificially intelligent applications such as AutoIdent to identify gamblers. Non-compliant behavior, such as illegal advertisements, failure to identify age, etc., can lead to severe financial consequences for online gaming companies.</p>



<p>The UKGC may also revoke gambling licenses if the Commission feels that the online <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">gaming</a> company is not abiding by the rules or mistreating customers.</p>



<p>Originally set to release in 2019, the UK Gambling Act white paper is a set of rules put forward by the UK government for the protection of online gamblers. <a href="https://www.translationroyale.com/why-uk-gambling-white-paper-is-delayed-for-approval-again/">Delayed for the fourth time</a>, the white paper also aims to put the UK Gambling Commission under scrutiny to ensure it has sufficient investigation sanctioning powers, and whatnot.</p>



<p>Read on to learn more about <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/online-gambling-regulations-uk/">Online Gambling regulations in the UK – an overview</a></p>



 Germany 



<p>The legal framework governing online gaming is referred to as the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/gluecksspielstaatsvertrag-glustv/">Interstate Treaty for Gambling (ISTG) or Glücksspielstaatsvertrag, GlüStV</a>, introduced in 2012. Germany is known to have some of the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/online-gambling-germany-regulations/">most complex gambling regulations</a> in Europe. The nation has also made numerous changes in the last few years. Recently, the country banned all online gaming platforms save for those offering horse racing betting. EGBA attempted to dispute this decision since it was not adhering to EU rules.</p>



<p>In 2010, the European Court of Justice ruled that the country’s industry was monopolized and had to be made liberal. When the ISTG was introduced, it allowed private companies to offer gambling services.</p>



<p>The new Interstate Treaty on Gambling 2021 <a href="https://thelawreviews.co.uk/title/the-gambling-law-review/germany#:~:text=The%20Interstate%20Treaty%202021%20reintroduced,be%20impracticable%20or%20not%20promising.">came into force in July 2021</a>. It distinguished between online casino games and virtual slots. It offers each state the choice to impose a state monopoly or issue a limited number of licenses to private gambling companies.</p>



<p>Sports betting operators must demonstrate that they are willing to offer safe services <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/germany-aml-kyc-regulations/">in line with the AML measures</a>. Operators are required to authorize all players and ensure all minors are excluded. Video verification lets online gaming companies enter the market in line with online gaming regulations.</p>



 Switzerland 



<p>Switzerland has two levels of gambling laws, i.e., federal and cantonal. The country offers casino licenses via the Swiss Federal Casino Commission (ESBK). The Swiss Lottery and Betting Board handles sports betting, lotteries, and fixed odds.</p>



<p>To urge operators to pay their fair share of taxes, the <a href="https://thelawreviews.co.uk/title/the-gambling-law-review/switzerland">Money Gaming Act</a> was passed in 2018 to block the IP addresses of offshore gambling sites. The law became effective in January 2019, and all unlicensed gambling was banned by the end of June.</p>



 Austria 



<p>Licenses for online gaming companies are issued by individual states in Austria, with no regulations at a federal level. Regulations only cover sports events in most states, but some jurisdictions also allow bets on other types of events. Live betting is prohibited in some states.</p>



<p>Technically speaking, state laws specifically regulate land-based betting. That said, licensed operators can also provide their services online.</p>



<p>The Austrian Ministry of Finance recently announced plans to reform the gambling regulatory framework. The proposal also suggests raising taxes on gambling-based revenues and establishing an authority tasked explicitly with enforcing regulations and providing licenses.</p>

 Malta 



<p>Malta became the first European Union Member State to offer services to gaming companies and is now the most prominent remote gambling jurisdiction internationally. Based on that, a broad range of online gaming services and facilities are available in the industry.</p>



<p>Founded in 2001, the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/malta-gaming-authority-mga/">Malta Gaming Authority</a> was set up to regulate various forms of gambling in the nation. This includes land-based activities like casinos and their online counterparts, including B2B and B2C services.</p>



 Isle of Man 



<p>The Isle of Man Government thoroughly promotes the development of gambling on the island, whether land-based or online. The region is committed to offering a robust regulatory environment backed by a stable government and various attractive business advantages.</p>



<p>In terms of regulation, the island’s <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/gsc-isle-of-man-supervision-authority/">Gambling Supervision Commission (GSC)</a> is an independent gambling operation regulator established in 1962. Aside from licensing and regulating land-based gambling operations, the Commission also regulates all iGambling activities.</p>



 Gibraltar 



<p>Gibraltar is among the world’s leading jurisdictions in the iGaming industry and an internationally recognized innovator in the field. Gibraltar offers all kinds of casino games, slots, poker, machine games, and most other number games without limits. That said, online operators require separate licenses for betting activity.</p>



<p>Two entities, i.e., <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/gibraltar-regulatory-authority-gra/">GRA (Gibraltar Regulatory Authority)</a> and the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/gibraltar-betting-gaming-association-gbga/">GBGA (Gibraltar Betting and Gaming Association)</a>, work collaboratively to ensure the region’s gaming laws.</p>



<p>The GRA issues licenses, ensuring operators comply with established regulations and monitoring possible risks threatening Gibraltar’s iGaming industry. On the other hand, GBGA assumes the role of an advisory body, supporting the region’s licensed gaming companies while certifying they operate responsibly.</p>



 Spain 



<p>Gambling has been legal in Spain since 1276. That said, gambling has been banned and re-legalized numerous times since 1276. It has only been continuously legal since 1977, with the exception of the lottery, which has been continuously legal since 1763.</p>



<p>Currently, the definitive piece of gambling legislation is the Spanish Gaming Act 2011 (i.e., Ley 13/2011, de 27 de mayo, de regulación del Juego) and its amendments.</p>



<p>Gambling in Spain is regulated at the national level and by the 17 self-governing regions, wrestling in a complex legal landscape. However, certain forms of gambling, such as American and French roulette, blackjack, craps, etc., are legal in all 17 regions.</p>



 Cyprus 



<p>Most forms of gambling in Cyprus were illegal until 2012. However, in 2012, the Republic made online and land-based sports betting legal. The NBA (National Betting Authority), established under Betting Law 2012, examines applications, and licenses, audits and supervises betting shops and online gambling operators.</p>



<p>The Cyprus Gaming and Casino Supervision Commission, also known as the Cyprus Gaming Commission, was set up in 2015 under the Cyprus Casino Control Law.</p>



<p>As a result, the 2015 Cyprus Casino Control Law allowed a license to be offered to a sole operator to establish an Integrated Casino Resort along with four “satellite” casinos. The Integrated Resort is Cyprus’ most prominent tourism development.</p>



 Alderney 



<p>Part of the British Channel Islands, but a self-governing dependency of the British Crown, the States of Alderney have their own separate commission that oversees gambling on the island. The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/alderney-gambling-control-commission/">Alderney Gambling Control Commission (AGCC)</a> is the official regulatory authority for gambling in Alderney. It reviews gaming licenses and certification applications and ensures all laws are observed.</p>

 Shyft Dev Deep Dive Monthly — Jan.&nbsp;2023 <p>Welcome to Shyft Dev Deep Dive, our monthly developer update, where we share the new Shyft-wide features and technical changes.</p><p>Shyft Veriscope finished 2022 on a strong note with the introduction of<a href="https://docs.veriscope.network/docs/3.5.0/change-log.html#2022-nov-08-v3-0-0-major-release-pr-70-address-proofs"> Address Proofs</a> that enable VASPs (read: crypto businesses) to prove ownership or control of an address before personal identification information (PII) is shared between&nbsp;VASPs.</p><p>Address Proofs sets Shyft apart from its peers as Shyft Veriscope now solves for both address attribution (i.e., who owns a hosted wallet address without having to ask end-users) and secure, peer-to-peer data transmission between&nbsp;VASPs.</p><p>In the last month, several additional enhancements have been added to Veriscope. These are detailed below. As always, if you have questions or would like a demo, please reach out to us at veriscope@shyft.network. We look forward to hearing from&nbsp;you!</p> Veriscope Releases (Jan-2023)  Node Synchronization Upgrade <p>Veriscope Relay Node has now been upgraded to <a href="https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/releases/tag/1.15.0">Nethermind v1.15.0</a>, which has made data synchronization with the Shyft Blockchain must&nbsp;faster.</p><p>Event transactions, too, take considerably less time to complete, as the time it takes to load and save them to Veriscope has decreased significantly. Events refer to the events emitted from transactions on the Shyft blockchain.</p><p>Earlier, the above-mentioned processes used to take 12+ hours to complete, but the <a href="https://docs.veriscope.network/docs/3.5.0/change-log.html#2023-jan-30-v3-5-0-pr-78-node-synchronization-upgrade">Node Synchronization Upgrade</a> has decreased it to 4–6 hours. <a href="https://docs.veriscope.network/docs/3.5.0/install/node-synchronization.html">Click here</a> for more details on Node Synchronization.</p> Veriscope UI&nbsp;Update <p>With the <a href="https://docs.veriscope.network/docs/3.4.0/change-log.html#2023-jan-20-v3-4-0-pr-77-veriscope-ui-update">new Veriscope UI Update</a>, Discovery Layer Key-value pairs are now sorted A-Z. A new settings page has also been introduced to provide easy access to user settings (email, password, 2FA), webhook URL, and API&nbsp;tokens.</p> IVMS Update <p>Keeping in line with the <a href="http://34.64.107.172/~vasp/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IVMS101-interVASP-data-model-standard-issue-1-FINAL.pdf">IVMS specification</a>, we added additional IVMS fields to Shyft Veriscope. With this, IVMS values saved to Veriscope are now shown in the IVMS form input&nbsp;fields.</p><p>VASPs can also export their IVMS data as either Originating VASP or Beneficiary VASP in the required IVMS format. <a href="https://docs.veriscope.network/docs/3.4.0/learn/ivms101.html">Click here</a> for more details on&nbsp;it.</p> Blockchain Analytics Update <p>In January, we made <a href="https://docs.veriscope.network/docs/3.4.0/change-log.html#2023-jan-20-v3-2-0-pr-75-blockchain-analytics-update">two blockchain analytics updates</a>. The API endpoint for Merkle Science has been corrected, and the API endpoints for each Blockchain Analytics service provider are now shown in the Veriscope user interface, next to where the VASPs can input their API&nbsp;keys.</p> Conclusion <p>Starting the year with significant improvements to Shyft Veriscope, the Shyft Product &amp; Engineering team proved again that what matters the most is user experience. We believe user experience must remain frictionless even while complying with stringent regulations.

<p>On February 1st, 2023, the&nbsp;Lithuanian Company Registry&nbsp;published two lists of VASPs that remain registered in the jurisdiction. Before this action was enforced, the Bank of Lithuania noted that over 800 virtual asset service providers were active. Now approximately 200 remain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Lithuania, an entity may offer two types of virtual asset activities: virtual currency exchange operator and virtual currency wallet operator. These activities are not subject to licensing; however, specific requirements, as foreseen in&nbsp;<a href="https://e-seimas.lrs.lt/portal/legalAct/lt/TAD/TAIS.41300/asr">the Law on the Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing of the Republic of Lithuania</a>, must be abided by to be recognized as a VASP.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>On June 30th 2022, Lithuanian Government created amendments to this law, and&nbsp;<a href="https://e-seimas.lrs.lt/portal/legalAct/lt/TAD/5598b042fde911ecbfe9c72e552dd5bd?jfwid=4qunnhwxb">new provisions</a>&nbsp;were added. Some came into force as of November 1st 2022 and the revision of the VASPs operating within the jurisdiction was based on these. Only operators that met all criteria remained.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The lists of remaining VASPs can be accessed here:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <a href="https://www.registrucentras.lt/jar/sarasai/vvko.php">Virtual currency exchange operators</a>&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://www.registrucentras.lt/jar/sarasai/dvvpo.php">Virtual currency wallet operators</a>&nbsp; 
 <p>The most notable provisions that came into effect in November 2022 are as follows:&nbsp;</p>



  A senior manager must be a permanent resident of Lithuania&nbsp; 



 Registered authorized capital must be at least EUR 125 000&nbsp; 



 The VASP must prove they hold EUR 100 000 per customer claim for indemnity and EUR 500 000 for all customers’ claims for indemnity with a guarantee document issued by an insurance undertaking&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Members of the management and supervisory bodies must not have a criminal background&nbsp;

<p>Restricting unnecessary data sharing is key to any information security strategy. </p>

<p>Why? </p>
<p>It helps to minimize the potential impact of a data breach or unauthorized access to sensitive information. The less data that is shared, the fewer opportunities there are for hackers or other malicious actors to access and exploit that data. When you restrict unnecessary data sharing, you can also reduce the risk of data breaches caused by human error, such as an employee accidentally sending sensitive information to the wrong person. </p>

<p>Additionally, sharing data with third-party companies and service providers can also pose a security risk, as you are entrusting the security of that data to another organization. Restricting unnecessary data sharing helps you to be more selective about which companies you share data with and to ensure that they have adequate security measures in place to protect that data.</p>

<p>Finally, restricting unnecessary data sharing is also important from a compliance perspective as it helps organizations to comply with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA that require organizations to protect personal data of individuals and to limit the sharing of sensitive information.</p>

<p>Guidance</p>
<p>Before making any changes, we recommend using a tool like <a href="https://github.com/GAM-team/GAM/wiki">,GAM</a> or other reporting tool with deep hooks into Google Workspace to better understand how many people are utilizing these features and what the impact of your changes will be. </p>

<p>Gmail</p> 
   Disable settings such as Automatic Email Forwarding under End User Access to ensure that users cannot automatically send all emails outside of the organization or to unauthorized services. 
   Review and adjust Safety settings. We’d recommend settings all of them to ON, with the exception of “Protect against unauthenticated emails” to avoid legitimate flagging emails from misconfigured domains as spam. 
 
<p>Calendar</p> 
   Prevent users from sharing anything other than free/busy information with external sharing for primary and secondary calendars. Depending on the organization, consider also disabling sharing for all information internally as well, or apply a rule to disable it for a group/OU of users with privileged calendar information, such as executives or your People team. 
 
<p>Drive</p>
<p>With Drive, you will need to think through how your employees are utilizing Google Drive to interface with external parties, like customers. In some cases companies may be presenting a Google Drive file as a public link to publish content online. Remember that settings can be applied to groups or OUs to more granularly scope permissions. The settings below represent an ideal:</p>
 
   Disable the ability for users to make files and published web content visible to anyone with a link 
   Only users in your domain can share content outside of your org 
   General access default is set to be private to the owner by default

<p>SSX provides developers with the easiest way to integrate Sign-In with Ethereum, enable DAO logins, resolve ENS names, and more. As we continue working on SSX, we want to show developers how they can quickly get started with easy-to-run example projects. Gating access to content based on a user's NFTs or tokens is a core-building block for building rich dapp experiences. For example:</p>  If a DAO wanted to limit content based on users with a certain amount of token-based voting power.  If an NFT PFP project wanted to offer exclusive content to token holders.  If a project wanted to enable early access to an application based on holding an NFT.  <p>The following example will show developers how to build and enable token-gated access in their dapp with SSX based on holding an ENS name. Additionally, it will show a developer how to also use SSX with <a href="https://www.rainbowkit.com/">RainbowKit</a> and <a href="https://www.alchemy.com/">Alchemy</a>.</p><p>You can also follow along in our documentation <a href="https://docs.ssx.id/appendix/build-a-token-gated-dapp">here</a>.</p> Run our Completed Example <p>Want to jump in and see a token-gated example in action quickly? Use the following commands to download the SSX repository: &nbsp;</p> <code>git clone https://github.com/spruceid/ssx
cd ssx
</code>   Ensure SSX packages are installed from the <code>ssx</code> directory by running <code>yarn install</code>  Navigate to the example directory (<code>cd examples/ssx-test-token-gated</code>)  Add an <a href="https://dashboard.alchemy.com/">Alchemy API</a> key to <code>.env</code>  In your terminal, run:   <code>yarn install
yarn start</code> <p>Once run, you will be presented with a dapp using RainbowKit that prompts you to connect your wallet and Sign-In with Ethereum.</p><p>After signing in, if the wallet used owns an ENS name, you will be presented with the gated content. If not, the dapp should display "No ENS name found"</p><p>The following guide will teach you how to create a token-gated dapp enabled by SSX from our <code>create-ssx-dapp</code> package.</p> Create the Dapp Yourself <p>The initial setup will be done using SSX's dapp creation tool. Type the following in your terminal to get started:</p> <code>yarn create @spruceid/ssx-dapp token-gated-example</code> <p>For this example, we will be using the following explicit options in the setup tool:</p>  Typescript  Leave the other options empty when prompted  The <code>create-ssx-dapp</code> tool Set up the Alchemy SDK and RainbowKit <p>The Alchemy SDK dependency can be installed with the following command in the directory of your dapp:</p> <code>yarn add alchemy-sdk</code> <p><a href="https://www.rainbowkit.com/">RainbowKit</a> is also used in this example. Add the required dependency via the following command:</p> <code>yarn add @rainbow-me/rainbowkit wagmi</code> <p>Additionally, you will also need to add the <code>ssx-react</code> dependency. To add it, use this command:</p> <code>yarn add @spruceid/ssx-react</code> <p>Head to <code>src/index.tsx</code> and add the following to plug things in initially:</p> <code>/** src/index.tsx **/

Add the following to <code>src/App.tsx</code>:</p> <code>/* src/App.tsx */

/**....**/</code> <p>With the SDK configured, we now need to add the logic to verify if the signed-in address owns a token. In this case, we'll be gating based on an ENS name. </p><p>To accomplish this, tokens owned by the address must be fetched and filtered for ENS names. ENS names are under the contract <code>0x57f1887a8bf19b14fc0df6fd9b2acc9af147ea85</code>, so a variable with that value needs to be added. </p><p>Add the following after the <code>import</code> statements:</p> <code>/* src/App.tsx */
const ENS_CONTRACT = '0x57f1887a8bf19b14fc0df6fd9b2acc9af147ea85';</code> <p>Including the modifications above to <code>src/App.tsx</code>, we can now add the additional logic needed to fetch tokens:</p> <code>/*....*/

</code> <p>Now you can gate any content with ENS names just by checking this <code>ownEnsName</code> variable.</p> What's Next? <p>Gating access to content isn't only limited to tokens. You can even gate access based on different forms of on-chain activity like:</p>  The number of trades a user has made on Uniswap.  How much lending activity a user has on Aave.  The number of times a user voted on-chain in a DAO's governance process.  <p>It doesn't stop there - this can even be extended to gating based on off-chain credentials, and more! We'll continue highlighting these examples and show how much is possible by using SSX. </p><p>Happy building!</p> <p>Spruce lets users control their data across the web.

<p>Company’s successful 100+ day early-stage launch creates new commercial opportunities for expansion of verifiable credentials, digital goods and services and the Metaverse.</p>



<p>February 1, 2023 –Toronto, Canada / Bridgetown, Barbados –<a href="http://www.aftermathislands.com/"> </a><a href="http://www.liquidavatartechnologies.com">Liquid Avatar Technologies Inc.</a> (CSE:LQID / OTC:LQAVF / FRA:4T51) (“Liquid Avatar” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce the continued expansion of use of the Liquid Avatar Mobile App and Meta Park Pass, providing Proof of Humanity, allowing users to remain anonymous, but still verify that they are a real person, through blockchain based verifiable credentials, working to eliminate fraudulent activities, duplicate and fake accounts and bots.&nbsp; Deploying the technology to its controlled subsidiary’s Aftermath Islands Metaverse Play to Earn game, Lost Kingdom of T’Sara, the Meta Park Pass has been successfully utilized allowing users to sign in with their biometrics, eliminating username and passwords, proving that all users are genuine people, with only 1 account, and supporting the collection over 1 billion gaming resources, resulting in the creation of over 1.2 million Resource Pack NFTs for use in the Aftermath Islands Metaverse.</p>



<p>Users are engaging for upwards of 70 minutes per day on the platform and have collected a variety of in-game resources, that they have then converted to Resource Pack NFTs that will be used, crafted, traded, and consumed in the Aftermath Islands Metaverse as part of platform activities, allowing the NFTs and the underlying blockchain technology to support in-game inventory management.&nbsp; These also include the ability to work, play, learn, earn, entertain, create, and socialize within the Aftermath Islands Metaverse.</p>



<p>Aftermath Islands Metaverse Limited has generated over $2 million in retail sales since late 2021 and continue to generate sales on a monthly basis.&nbsp; As the Company works to launch its full Metaverse platform, these revenues are recorded, under IFRS guidelines, as deferred revenue, until such time that the Aftermath Islands Metaverse meets further launch requirements.&nbsp; However, the Company has had access to the proceeds for working capital.</p>



<p>In late Q4 2022, the Company also successfully launched its first Aftermath Islands Metaverse servers that provide users with a high-fidelity graphics experience, similar to realistic console gaming, with no download, providing an easy-to-use experience similar to streaming services, on almost any mobile, tablet or computing device.&nbsp; The open platform is available for early engagement at <a href="https://play.aftermathislands.com">play.aftermathislands.com</a>.</p>



<p>The Aftermath Islands Metaverse also seamlessly incorporates the ability for organizations and enterprises to leverage their current websites and eCommerce activities by allowing users to click on an item in the Aftermath Islands Metaverse, creating a new browser tab that display’s the organization’s website, eCommerce programs and social media.&nbsp; Aftermath Islands is one of the first to completely integrate Web2 and Web3 activities in a single click.</p>



<p>As one of the first of its kind, the Liquid Avatar Mobile App can also be used to create a host of other credentials that have been already tested for government level access for travel and age verification.&nbsp; The Company is also designing credentials with uses that include online access, validation and marketing in the Metaverse and throughout the Web3 ecosystem.&nbsp; While the Company is ready to deploy to convenience stores and other age restricted programs, current market and economic priorities have caused delays of the rollout of Ontario’s and other jurisdiction’s Digital Identity programs. &nbsp;Liquid Avatar is currently expanding its programs to other online and commercial opportunities that are eager to use verifiable credentials to ensure that their users are real, unique individuals and have only a single account.</p>



<p>David Lucatch, CEO of Liquid Avatar Technologies Inc. and Managing Director of Aftermath Islands Metaverse Limited commented, “Despite the various market challenges, we have launched and continue to accelerate verifiable credentials. Use of these credentials by Aftermath Islands and its programs continues to reinforce our focus, not only on building a Metaverse with wide appeal, but promoting the positive sentiment that we are seeing from users that have embraced the Liquid Avatar Mobile App and the Meta Park Pass as participants in an ecosystem that insures users are real and that they don’t have to worry about fake or multiple account holders, phishing attempts, bots and other nefarious actors.&nbsp; Our core efforts remain squarely on digital identity, avatars, digital good and services and the Metaverse and we believe that by providing seamless, no download experiences, wide availability on a host of devices and the integration of Web2 with Web3, we will continue to see revenues, engagement, and growth.”</p>



<p>The Company is also continuing to work on its LQID Metaverse Rewards payment card program and is awaiting final network and payment processor approvals.&nbsp; The Liquid Shopz program is currently part of the LQID Rewards program, and the Company is currently reviewing stand alone vendor and affiliate programs for its Metaverse activities and user programs.&nbsp; The Company will provide further updates as they become available.</p>



<p>The Company would also like to express its appreciation to outgoing board member, Mr. Jeff Mesina for his contribution to the Company’s growth and we appreciate the consideration and support he has provided over the last several years.&nbsp; Mr. Mesina has resigned to pursue other endeavours and the Company wishes him every success.</p>



<p>The Company would also like to provide an update on its August 3, 2022, announcement regarding a commitment letter Aftermath Islands Metaverse had received from global investment group LDA Capital.&nbsp; Due to the prolonged decrease in the prices and reduction in market capitalization that several sectors have been experiencing over the last several months, and in conjunction with the evolving regulatory conditions, Aftermath Islands Metaverse has chosen not to actively pursue this opportunity at this time.&nbsp;</p>

   A 13-year quest to save our customers money and improve their security. 

<p>"Most people overestimate what they can achieve in a year and underestimate what they can achieve in ten years." This quote, often attributed to Bill Gates, came to mind as I looked back on the last 13 years at ForgeRock. It continues to amaze me how our customer focus first led us to redefine the IAM space, and then to introduce many innovations that have since become universally acknowledged as critical capabilities.</p>

<p>For ForgeRock's birthday, I wanted to take a trip down memory lane with a focus on a specific area that is near and dear to my heart: our identity orchestration journey (or is it our Journeys journey?).</p>

<p>It all started when some of our earliest customers wanted to provide different login experiences for different types of users. We took inspiration from the Linux Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAMs) and introduced the ability to add Java code to the login flow. We called this capability Chains, and our customers loved it because it allowed them to change login behavior as they desired. However, it required a lot of custom Java coding.</p>

<p>To reduce the customer development time and make orchestration more flexible, we took it to a whole new level with a drag-and-drop designer UI and the ability to branch out in multiple directions based on different conditions. Our engineers called this orchestration engine Trees (branching…Trees, get it?). Even though we named the product Intelligent Authentication and built in many capabilities around context and device data collection, dynamic decisioning, and continuous authentication, many customers still call it Trees. We also started shipping a number of pre-built actions called <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/idcloud/latest/realms/auth-nodes.html">Nodes</a> that make it easy for customers to build orchestration journeys for different needs without coding.</p>

<p>But ForgeRock customers didn't stop there. They decided to use our orchestration engine to not only integrate with their home-grown systems but also with third-party vendors for multi-factor authentication (MFA), user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA), and identity verification, just to name a few. When we found out that many customers were repeatedly building the same set of integrations, we decided to save them some time and money by delivering integration capabilities to everyone. That's how our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/trust-network">Trust Network</a> started more than five years ago. Back then, the notion of having a Marketplace was still new in the IAM space. We did it anyway and today we have the largest ecosystem of integration partners with 200+ integrations available from the <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/marketplace">ForgeRock Marketplace</a>. This is the reason a leading bank threw away their homegrown orchestration and decided to start leveraging ForgeRock Orchestration.</p>

<p></p>

<p>When the IAM market evolved and customers started asking for a single platform to provide full identity fabric capabilities along with governance, we delivered <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">ForgeRock Intelligent Access</a>. Intelligent Access extended our orchestration engine to simplify user self-service capabilities, such as registration, forgotten password, password reset, and so on. [Have you ever created an account on a site, and it immediately turns around and asks you to enter the just-created login and password again? That's because the site's identity management system that created the account and the access management system that secures the access are not talking to each other properly. I don't like that experience at all. With an integrated platform like ForgeRock, your users don't have to experience that friction.]</p>

<p>A couple of years after we launched our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">cloud service</a>, our customers asked us to add a UEBA engine to it. Since we accumulate many signals as part of the cloud service during authentication, the addition of UEBA made a lot of sense, so we launched our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-access">Autonomous Access</a> service. Even there we made it easy to consume the capabilities delivered by a powerful AI engine with easy-to-use nodes that can be integrated into any orchestration journey with a simple drag-and-drop UI.</p>

<p>Over the years, we have also added many orchestration capabilities based on customer feedback — along with our own security and product best practices — resulting in multiple patents in this area. What I love most about these investments is the sheer number of nodes we now ship with our service, the volume of pre-built journeys that incorporate security and usability best practices, and our improvements to the architecture that have helped many customers save countless hours of development and integration time. We hear from new customers again and again that they chose ForgeRock because of our strong orchestration capabilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But we are not stopping there. Our vision is an orchestration engine that drives all the users' IAM journeys, whether for authentication or for access request approvals and beyond. We're building a future where every action within an IAM platform, from configuration management to application onboarding, will be driven by orchestration. By sticking to our founding principles, built on a persistent focus on our customers' needs, we'll continue to innovate on their behalf.&nbsp;</p>

You can see the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJG698U2Mvo">video here</a>. If you haven’t already done it, try it. It’s fun. It only takes a&nbsp;minute.</p><p>The astonishing thing is that a very high proportion of those counting the passes simply don’t notice a gorilla that walks through the game and stands there, right in front of them. Plain as plain can be. They just don’t see it. When asked, many of them even deny it: they are so intent on looking for something else they can’t believe that a gorilla was standing there, right in front of their eyes. This is the phenomenon of selective attention, and it’s extremely powerful.</p><p>In this blog series, we’ve explored many aspects of the economics of personal data, showing how and why personal data stores offer huge opportunities for positive economic transformation. But if this opportunity is so big, why aren’t organisations and governments clamouring for&nbsp;it?</p> A narrative of our&nbsp;times <p>Selective attention is a key reason. One particular narrative has come to dominate the conversation to such a degree that many people simply assume it accounts for the whole picture; counting passes and not seeing the gorilla in front of them. This is the narrative of Big Data and it goes something like&nbsp;this.</p><blockquote>“Data is needed to create the insights that drive improved and innovative services. The more data there is to analyse, the better the insights will be, the greater the benefits. Therefore, everything should be done to help organisations amass as much data as they&nbsp;can.”</blockquote><p>There is a small element of truth to this narrative (every effective lie includes a small element of truth to make it seem credible). Like the telescope and microscope before it, data is helping us see the world in ways we never could before. Tackled the right way, this is indeed an opportunity. But most Big Data today falls far short of this. It’s either flawed, unnecessary, irrelevant or downright dangerous — a bandwagon fueled by&nbsp;hype.</p><p>Big Data, we are being told, is a ‘game-changing’ development, revolutionising industries as diverse as marketing and health care and helping to ‘solve humanitarian issues around poverty, health, human rights, education and the environment’. It’s now ’a key factor in how nations, not just companies, compete and prosper’, a ‘foundation for disruptive business models’, ‘transforming processes and altering corporate ecosystems’. It can even predict the future (apparently).</p><p>Little wonder it dominates Government policies such as the UK Government’s National Data Strategy and the EU’s Horizon Europe research programme. But what is the reality behind this&nbsp;hype?</p> Are Big Data insights really transformational? <p>The Big Data bandwagon revolves around two words: ‘insights’ and ‘analytics’, which are widely referred to with close to mystical awe, as if they had magic&nbsp;powers.</p><p>Genuine insights, used for the right purposes, are wonderful. But Big Data has never generated an insight and never will. Why? Because only humans have insights. This is flaw Number&nbsp;One.</p><p>Big Data analytics are done by a computer crunching lots of numbers to surface correlations and patterns. But, in themselves these correlations tell us nothing because statistical correlation can be meaningless and is not the same as causation. While Big Data analytics can alert us to something we hadn’t seen before, only humans can understand the why; what it all&nbsp;means.</p><p>Confusing the two is one of the reasons why there is currently a crisis in medical research. Around 50% of medical research findings cannot be repeated if the experiment is conducted again. Why? Among the many reasons are that doctors (like most data scientists) are not trained in statistics and frequently confuse correlation with causation.</p><p>The trouble with Big Data is that the more data you crunch, the more noise: the more meaningless correlations pop up. Without clear ways of distinguishing between noise and signal, chances are you’ll end up in multiple wild goose&nbsp;chases.</p><p>This assumes that the data used by Big Data is reliable in the first place. But often it isn’t. One of the best kept secrets about most organisations’ large databases is that the quality of their data is often very poor: incomplete, out of date or simply wrong. And most data sets, no matter how large, are biassed in some way. No matter how big they might be, they are still a&nbsp;sample.</p><p>Building genuinely representative samples isn’t something that happens easily or automatically. In fact, one of the biggest barriers to Big Data research is the cost of accessing reliable data. According to the <a href="https://www.nao.org.uk/insights/improving-government-data-a-guide-for-senior-leaders/">National Audit Office</a> 60–80% of researchers’ time is spent cleaning and merging data. In a world where each individual was able to aggregate information about themselves into their own personal data store, these costs could be slashed — assuming, that is, that the researchers can make a compelling case for the value and ethics of their research.</p><p>But as it is, much of the data used for Big Data analytics is of questionable quality. GIGO is an ancient IT catchphrase. It stands for Garbage In, Garbage Out. With Big Data the risks of Big Garbage are high, such as Big Data-generated algorithms that build racist and sexist assumptions into how they&nbsp;work.</p> Can the insight be&nbsp;applied? <p>Even when a good signal is identified, it doesn’t mean it’s automatically useful. To be useful, it has to be applied. But Big Data doesn’t help here, because it only deals with statistical data — e.g. probabilities — not specifics.</p><p>If you toss a coin many times you can know with certainty that 50% of the time it will be heads, and 50% of the time tails. But complete, certain knowledge of probabilities doesn’t translate into complete, knowledge of the real world — of what it going to happen next. What’s it going to be? Heads or tails? For the real world, we need ways to deal with different, specific outcomes, not just generalised observations.</p><p>This can wreak havoc when it comes to applying Big Data insights in the real world. Say for example that Big Data analysis tells us that if you do X the probability of Y happening is doubled. Great! But if the probability of Y happening has doubled from 2% to 4%, it still means that 96% of the time it won’t happen. How useful is that when it comes to applying the ‘insight’ in the real&nbsp;world?</p><p>OK. What about a 99.9% probability rather than just 4%? You might think you can rely on a 99.9% probability in a real world application. The German Ministry of the Interior thought so when it installed facial recognition programmes outside big railway stations to identify known terrorists.</p><p>The 99.9% figure meant that 0.1% of observations generated false positives: that declared an individual to be a terrorist when they weren’t. With 12 million people passing through big railway stations every day, the German police were presented with 12,000 people a day wrongly identified by the system as terrorists. Acting on this information would have resulted in a large-scale invasion of civil liberties (hundreds of thousands of people being treated as if they were terrorists when they were not), while wasting all available policing resources hounding them. The programme was quickly (and quietly)&nbsp;dropped.</p><p>Behind this lies another flawed assumptions that keeps Big Data hype afloat: confusion between statistical data about populations — data that deals in probabilities — and the actual data about real, individual people that is needed to actually do something useful. The one does NOT automatically translate into the&nbsp;other.</p><p>Once Big Data is applied to an identifiable individual, it stops being Big Data and becomes deeply personal instead. It requires access to and use of personal data, and a matching, testing and application process to see if the generalised statistical ‘insight’ is relevant to this particular case. For that, you need to access exactly the right data, at the right time, for the use case in hand: you need the personal data logistics capabilities provided by personal data&nbsp;stores.</p><p>Without such a translation process from statistical probabilities to personal circumstances, Big Data insights can only be applied in a blanket manner — in a way that is often irrelevant, if not&nbsp;harmful.</p> Do you need Big Data to get big insights? <p>All this assumes that Big Data is the only or main way to generate useful insights. But this isn’t so. Most of the insights used to inform decisions and resulting actions today don’t come from Big Data. Other simpler, easier, cheaper processes such as traditional research or even mundane activities such as filling in forms provide the surprises — the new information needed to keep decisions in line with a changing world — that most people and organisations need to get stuff&nbsp;done.</p><p>So Big Data isn’t the be all and end all of ‘insight’ that it’s made out to be. Far from it. Viewed across the economy as a whole its contribution is actually marginal.</p> Beware hidden&nbsp;agendas <p>When you listen to Big Data hype however, it’s as though Big Data is a magic bullet that is going to save the world: it comes with a touching but naive faith that, by definition, if something is an ‘insight’ it must be ‘good’ — it will be used to help people rather than harm them or take advantage of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Unfortunately this is not true. Much of the hype about ‘insights’ derives from the activities of Silicon Valley advertising giants like Google and Facebook. But their insights weren’t generated to help people live better, richer lives. They were generated for the purposes of manipulation and control, to get people to do what advertisers wanted them to do. Cambridge Analytica was a business driven by Big Data insights. Its agenda was profit via manipulation and control — for which it needed as many ‘insights’ it could&nbsp;get.</p><p>The sad reality behind Big Data hype is that it is widely used as camouflage to extend surveillance capitalism into new areas, to justify a privacy-invading corporate data landgrab; an excuse for even further concentrations of data power and rewards in the hands of a tiny number of organisations (along with increasing pressure to bypass citizens’ data protection rights).</p><p>Are these corporations suddenly really that interested in data analytics for ‘data for good’? Or is this sudden interest a cover for a much more cynical hidden&nbsp;agenda?</p> Squandered resources, missed opportunities <p>The biggest damage wreaked by Big Data hype lies in a different direction, however. In a classic case of selective attention, countless politicians and policy-makers around the world have drunk the Big Data Kool Aid to sanction and promote vast Big Data programmes that promise the world and cost almost as much — billions of&nbsp;£/$/€.</p><p>In doing so, they failing to notice the gorilla in their midst: the immense opportunities for productivity improvements, service quality, outcome improvements and innovation that lie in the opposite direction of empowering citizens with their own data. The result is missed opportunities on a vast scale, coupled with equally vast misallocation of available resources — a misallocation of resources that deepens the imbalances of power and reward that already blight today’s data-driven economy.</p> Conclusion <p>Don’t get us wrong. We have nothing against Big Data per se. We are all for genuine analytics and insights, if done properly and ethically. But we are also all for seeing gorillas as well as counting passes — for seeing opportunities that are NOT reliant on big data, such as empowering individuals with their own&nbsp;data.</p><p>It’s not one versus the other. To really work well, Big Data needs to advance hand in hand with the personal data logistics capabilities offered by personal data stores. Focusing only on Big Data while ignoring personal data logistics — and associated citizen empowerment — is like trying to run with just one leg. Extremely hard work to not get&nbsp;far.</p><p>That, unfortunately, is what we’ve got right now. As long as policy-makers look determinedly in just one direction — only counting the passes — they won’t see the gorilla standing there, right in front of them. It’s time for them to look&nbsp;up.</p><p>Other blogs in this series&nbsp;are:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-great-data-delusion-744b40795f73">The Great Data Delusion</a> 19th century doctors thought bloodletting would cure most diseases.

<p>Last week was a happy week for us at Holochain. It has been a long time coming — years of almost-but-not-quite-ready, of helping the bravest devs succeed with immature tech, of telling more risk-averse projects to wait just a little longer. And now it’s here — Holochain is finally in beta.</p><p>The general mood among colleagues and friends has varied from “quiet satisfaction”, in one person’s words, to open celebration. This is a big milestone for us and you, folks!</p><p>Of course, there is still lots of work to be done — the core devs are already working hard on the 0.2 beta series, which will bring the ‘immune system’ features that are meant to automate communities’ ability to protect their networks and data from attacks. And of course there are still planned features and the regular boring engineering work of performance tuning and bug discovery. And most of the developer tools haven’t been updated yet, although we’ll see that in the next week or two.</p><p>But this is the first point at which we can say, with confidence, that Holochain is ready for most projects (not just bleeding-edge ones) to start building serious apps on. The APIs will not get any breaking changes for the entirety of the 0.1.x release series, and keep our bootstrap and proxy servers running for six months.</p><p>In the coming weeks we’ll be publishing a series of blog posts, videos, and updates to the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org">Developer Portal</a> to help you get started building your first hApp.</p><p>Does this mean that Holochain is now ready for everyone? Not quite. You will be able to build your hApp without fear of refactoring, you’ll be able to get it into your users’ hands, and they’ll be able to use it long-term without fearing data loss on every upgrade. But it’s important to note that, before the immune system and security audits are completed, your hApp should be considered beta-quality and shouldn’t be used in hostile environments.</p> Holochain 0.1.0 release notes <p>Release date: 26 January 2023<br>HDI compatibility: 0.2.0-beta-rc.1 to 0.2.0<br>HDK compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.1 to 0.1.0<br>Breaking changes: app API</p><p>This is largely a ceremonial release — you’ll note that we’ve dropped the <code>beta</code> and <code>rc.x</code> from the end of all of our packages. There are only two changes:</p>  Removed (HDI): The unused <code>validation_package</code> callback is no longer supported, and all types related to it have been removed. Given that no hApps in the wild used this callback (to my knowledge), you shouldn’t need to update your integrity zome code. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1739">#1739</a>)  Breaking (app API): <code>FetchQueue</code> has been renamed to <code>FetchPool</code>. This shows up in one of the fields of the <code>NetworkInfo</code> API endpoint’s return value. If you don’t know whether you need to know about this, you probably don’t — <code>NetworkInfo</code> is generally only used by conductor orchestrators like the Launcher. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1793">#1793</a>)   Dev tools release notes  JavaScript client 0.11.16: Internal refactor <p>Release date: 25 Jan 2023<br>Holochain compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.4</p><p>This release refactors the way the agent’s public key is retrieved; now it gets it from <code>AppInfo</code>.</p> JavaScript client 0.12.0: Version bump <p>Release date: 25 Jan 2023<br>Holochain compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.4</p><p>This release simply marks a shift to Holochain Beta. Note: A breaking change to the <code>NetworkInfo</code> app API endpoint, introduced in Holochain 0.1.0, is not yet supported, but will be supported in the next release. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/pull/172">#172</a>) Most hApps don't use this, though, so it should be safe to use this release with Holochain 0.1.0.</p> Tryorama 0.11.0: Version bump <p>Release date: 27 Jan 2023<br>Holochain compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.4</p><p>This release bumps the included JavaScript client to 0.12.0.</p> Rust client 0.3.0: Initial support for Holochain 0.1.x <p>Release date: 23 Jan 2023<br>Holochain compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.3</p><p>This release brings the supported Holochain version up to 0.1.0-beta-rc.3, which means the following breaking changes:</p>  All zome calls must be signed.  <code>install_app_bundle</code> is renamed to <code>install_app</code>.  <code>archive_clone_cell</code> is renamed to <code>disable_clone_cell</code>.  <code>restore_archived_clone_cell</code> is renamed to <code>enable_clone_cell</code>.  <code>enable_clone_cell</code> is moved to the app API.  <code>delete_clone_cell</code> can only delete a single disabled clone cell.  <code>app_info</code> returns all cells and DNA modifiers.  <code>request_agent_info</code> is renamed to <code>agent_info</code>.  <p>There are two non-breaking changes:</p>  The admin API call <code>get_dna_definition</code> has been added.  There’s now a utility crate for authorising credentials and signing zome calls.  <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-rust/releases/tag/v0.3.0">Read the changelog.</a></p> Scaffolding 0.1.3: Support for Holochain 0.1.0 <p>Release date: 31 Jan 2023<br>Holochain compatibility: 0.1.0</p><p>This is the first time I’ve included release notes for the scaffolding tool. We’ve <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/time-to-start-testing-your-happs/#the-new-scaffolding-tool-like-rails-but-for-dapps">shared</a> <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-beta-released/#preview-of-new-cli-scaffolding-tool">about</a> it already, and I will be sharing more about it soon, but for now, just know that it lets both newcomers and experienced hApp devs generate a lot of boilerplate DNA and UI code in a short time. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/scaffolding/releases">release log</a> if you’ve already been using it.</p> Second security audit completed <p>Last week Least Authority <a href="https://leastauthority.com/security-consulting/published-audits/">published the results</a> of their second security audit of Holochain. The first, which <a href="https://leastauthority.com/static/publications/Least_Authority_Holo_Ltd_Lair_Keystore_Final_Audit_%20Report.pdf">analyzed the Lair keystore</a>, identified only one issue and three further suggestions, all of which were resolved.</p><p>This second one analyzed the Holochain Deterministic Integrity (HDI) crate, which is the hApp developer’s interface between their integrity zomes and Holochain itself. The HDI allows the dev to write validation callbacks that check data for correctness. These callbacks, combined with the plumbing of Holochain’s DHT implementation, are what create the ‘immune system’ that keeps honest participants safe.</p><p>Because the HDI is so heavily dependent on the foundation of Holochain’s inner workings, they found that their analysis had to go further than just this one library. This gave them an opportunity to assess the correctness of Holochain’s model for arriving at consistency and take a look at how the model is implemented.</p><p>The results of this audit were similar to the first, with one issue related to insufficient formal documentation, which they identified as a potential risk for correctly implementing Holochain’s consistency model. We’ve resolved that by writing a formal specification and rewriting the Holochain whitepaper, which we plan to publish soon.</p> Reminder: Holochain Dev Training in March <p>Now that Holochain has its first beta and the dev tools are almost ready, Holochain is pretty much ready for prototyping your hApp and getting it into the hands of beta testers. If you want to skill up yourself or your dev team quickly and effectively, the online Dev Training course in March will get you there. <a href="https://www.holochain.org/holochain-developer-training-2/">Read the details and apply</a> on our website.</p>

				  Digital transformation across all aspects of business makes verifiable data the currency for seamless and secure processes in 2023  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By&nbsp;Trevor Butterworth and Heather Dahl</p>
<p>Across every sector, digital transformation is the agenda. It means doing more and doing better, often with the economic constraint of having less. It means reorienting to changing employee demographics and labor shortages while meeting customer expectations for seamless experiences and greater efficiencies — often managed from a mobile device. It means adopting new platforms for product design, simulation, and lifecycle management, integrating data from sensor-equipped devices, and in-sourcing supplies.</p>
<p>It means adapting to continuous brand or product engagement by creating and integrating new data streams while complying with data privacy law. And it means seeing digital relationships in terms of authenticity: they aren’t just about modified&nbsp; data flows, they are about creating new kinds of genuine, peer-to-peer interaction based on consent.</p>
<p>Successful digital transformation will deliver better products, experiences, and services, for both B2B and B2C companies, while reducing costs, friction, and risk.</p>
<p>Trusted data is the currency of digital transformation<br>Trusted data is data that is verifiable. The quicker it can be verified, the more seamless the process that depends on the authenticity and integrity of the data. That may sound simple and obvious, but the inability to trust the authenticity and integrity of data has throttled digital interaction with punishing costs in fraud and friction. There is no reliable verification layer for people, entities, or the data they wish to share; the internet was built without one.</p>
<p>Verifiable credential technology (often referred to as decentralized identity or self-sovereign identity) changes all this. It means data can be immediately acted upon while reducing the risk of fraud. In practical terms, there’s no need to check in with the source of the data or rely on a third party to store data in order to cross check and manage data verification; the data is issued in a credential from a trusted issuer and is not written to a database or a blockchain; It can be shared by consent and verified through metadata across direct, uniquely encrypted peer-to-peer communications channels. All this removes friction and adds consent, privacy, and security. The result is trusted data, seamlessly verified.</p>
<p>Trusted data not only accelerates seamless processes, it enables new kinds of digital processes and services by removing barriers to digital interaction and enabling interaction to scale.</p>
<p>So how do we think trusted data will be used in 2023 to drive digital transformation? Here are our predictions.</p>
<p>1. Digital wallets will take a backseat to “super” credentials<br>Perhaps because digital wallets are apps, and apps are what make mobile devices powerful, digital wallet apps have come to be seen as “really important” to implementing verifiable credential technology. But — just as a fancy wallet doesn’t do much in the real world if there’s nothing of value in it — a killer digital wallet is only as useful as what it actually stores, which is to say, digital credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Create interoperable “super” credentials for seamless KYC, payments, and travel, and a digital wallet becomes super useful. There isn’t a critical shortage of wallet apps; Hyperledger Aries has an open-source white label wallet — Bifold — that anyone can adapt, build on, and offer with their credentials. This is why we see the hype of a killer wallet being replaced in 2023 by the practicality of a “super” credential.</p>
<p>2. DeGov will gain commercial and public sector traction<br>One of our <a href="https://indicio.tech/the-decentralized-identity-revolution-is-powered-by-machine-readable-governance/?preview_id=3622&amp;preview_nonce=510518f883&amp;post_format=standard&amp;_thumbnail_id=3625&amp;preview=true">earliest insights</a> into consumer needs was that governance needed to be simple to implement and yet capable of handling complex information flows, rapid rule change, jurisdictional hierarchies, and—crucially— offline environments.&nbsp; Governance authorities need to be confident that they are in charge of the governance decisions within their jurisdictions and Decentralized Ecosystem Governance (DeGov) enables that accountability.<a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-demonstrates-decentralized-ecosystem-governance/">DeGov</a> began with machine-readable files that could be cached in the software for each party in an ecosystem, and it has now expanded to a specification, currently under discussion at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/partner/925">Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)</a>, with efforts to standardize and interoperate with other governance implementations at <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">ToIP</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://indicio.tech/governance-editor/">net result</a> is that we have a coherent, powerful, and easy-to-use way for establishing and managing trust in an ecosystem, one that results in a smooth user experience with the capacity for verification in offline situations. DeGov will catalyze commercial and public sector use cases of increasing complexity.</p>
<p>3. KYC credentials pave the way for payment disruption<br>Identity assurance is expensive to do, time consuming, and has to be done over and over again, causing frustration and friction for both the customer and the financial institution. The crypto and banking sectors both <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202212/id-fraud-rises-worldwide-but-biometrics-helps-kyc">experienced</a> a doubling of identity fraud in&nbsp; 2022 from&nbsp; 2021, and payment fraud increased by 40 percent. At the same time, financial losses from identity theft rose to almost $6.1 billion in 2022.A know-your-customer (KYC) credential (with biometric binding to a device) means both one-time identity assurance and proof-of-card ownership without the need for storing and sharing any personally identifiable information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By simplifying KYC, verifiable credentials will save time, effort, friction, and, significantly, cost. This also means that the barrier to performing KYC will be lowered, encouraging&nbsp; identity assurance to be more widely performed.</p>
<p>The combination of reduced friction and increased trust will change ecommerce, invoicing, mortgage brokering, payments — and DeGov — will make this easy to coordinate and manage on a global scale.</p>
<p>4. Passwords will become a relic of the old times — like rotary phones and punch cards<br>No one loves passwords and usernames. According to a <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/fraud-prevention/2022/what-banks-can-do-to-protect-consumers-from-social-engineering-traps/">recent poll</a>, 68% of consumers would be willing to use non-password login options on their mobile apps. There is no digital future where they turn into vinyl and the kids will want to use them because they’re cool. Our digital lives will be immeasurably better once they are gone.The way to replace a username and the password is to create a trusted digital relationship with a verifiable credential. The authentication problem that passwords and user logins are meant to solve&nbsp; vanishes, because they are no longer needed as a substitute for a trusted digital relationship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital-forward companies that use verifiable credentials for login will be able to build stronger relationships with their customers, develop more effective product lifecycle management, and collate product data and consumer feedback. These digital relationships will use DIDComm technology for direct, peer-to-peer secure communication between entities, and they will be data privacy compliant, as data can be shared by explicit consent and in privacy-preserving ways.</p>
<p>5. There will be new models for monetizing credentials<br>First, verifiable credentials will save you money, then they’ll make you money. The immediate value proposition for verifiable credential technology is in fixing inefficient and insecure verification processes, especially around payments. Then they can be deployed to tackle problems that are, presently, filed under “the cost of doing business,” such as chargeback fraud. But as&nbsp; trusted data scales, it also presents opportunities for both better digital relationships and products and&nbsp; services that deliver the customer value (think seamless travel). If the cost of KYC is minimal, the cost and risk of entering a market is correspondingly reduced. Anything that provides a valued customer with more value and efficiency has the potential to become a new business model.</p>
<p>Much of the talk around “super apps” reflects the behavior and expectations of a maturing digital-first demographic that wants to be able to manage everything as simply as possible through their phone. But super apps aren’t going to work without trusted data that’s interoperable across ecosystems. They aren’t going to be super if they can’t deliver privacy, consent, and security.</p>
<p>Verifiable credential technology doesn’t require everyone moving to a new system or companies and organizations trashing their existing systems. It’s a technology layer that transforms what you already have. And because it is open source, there’s no vendor lock in. It’s a tool and a toolbox for innovation and interoperability. Those that have it will be able to accelerate digital transformation. Those that don’t will face equally rapid obsolescence.</p>

<p>On January 18th, FinCEN released an <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/Order_Bitzlato_FINAL%20508.pdf">order</a> regarding Bitzlato Limited (“Bitzlato”), identifying it as a hub for Russian criminals to launder proceeds of crime.&nbsp;</p>



 Key Points:&nbsp; 



  Bitzlato Limited (“Bitzlato”) has been identified as facilitating money laundering for Russian criminals.&nbsp; 
   FinCEN issued an order on January 18, coming into effect February 1st, prohibiting USA’s financial institutions to allow transactions involving Bitzlato-owned<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/blockchain/"> blockchain </a>addresses.&nbsp; 
   As Bitzlato’s activity represents a threat to the international financial system, financial institutions worldwide must pay special attention if and when they detect transactions involving Bitzlato-owned addresses.&nbsp; 
   Coinfirm details on what action has been taken internally to assist its clients in determining whether the addresses they or their users transact with have nexus to Bitzlato&nbsp;&nbsp; 
   Confirm provides its input on how to identify such addresses and where in obliged entities’ AML processes and procedures Coinfirm’s solution fit.&nbsp; 
  Why was the order released?&nbsp; 



<p>USA’s <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2021-title31/pdf/USCODE-2021-title31-subtitleIV-chap53-subchapII-sec5318A.pdf">Combating Russian Money Laundering Act</a>, section 9714(a), states that “if the Secretary of the Treasury determines that reasonable grounds exist for concluding that […] a foreign financial institution is of primary money laundering concern in connection with Russian illicit finance”, the Secretary may:&nbsp;</p>



  require domestic financial institutions and agencies to create and maintain records and/or file reports on the transactions involving an institution identified to be of primary money laundering concern, including “the identity and address of the participants in a transaction or relationship, including the identity of the originator of any funds transfer”, “the legal capacity in which a participant in any transaction is acting”, “the identity of the beneficial owner of the funds involved in any transaction”, “a description of any transaction”, “obtain and retain information concerning the beneficial ownership of any account opened or maintained in the United States by a foreign person” among other such details as described in title 31, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2010-title31/USCODE-2010-title31-subtitleIV-chap53-subchapII-sec5318A/context">section 5318A(b) of United States Code</a>(Special measures for jurisdictions, financial institutions, international transactions, or types of accounts of primary money laundering concern)&nbsp; 
   „prohibit, or impose conditions upon, certain transmittals of funds […] by any domestic financial institution or domestic financial agency, if such transmittal of funds involves any such institution […]”.&nbsp; 
 <p><a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2021-title31/pdf/USCODE-2021-title31-subtitleIV-chap53-subchapII-sec5318A.pdf">Source</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>FinCEN explains in the order that Bitzlato has been identified as an institution of “primary money laundering concern” in connection with Russian illicit finance, based on its detected transactional activity, which allowed Russian criminals to launder proceeds of crime stemming primarily from darknet markets and ransomware activities and decided to „prohibit certain transmittals of funds by any covered financial institution involving Bitzlato Limited (Bitzlato)”.&nbsp;</p>



 Key findings regarding Bitzlato:&nbsp; 



  previously known as ChangeBot&nbsp; 



 VASP (specifically a convertible virtual currency exchanger) is incorporated in Hong Kong, with headquarters in Russia&nbsp; 



 Services offered: exchange and P2P (wallet, escrow and other related services)&nbsp; 



 Cryptocurrencies covered: Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), Dash (DASH), Tether (USDT), Monolith Ruble (MCR) and Dogecoin (DOGE)&nbsp; 



 Allowed Russian and global ransomware groups, such as Conti, DarkSide, Phobos to deposit and transfer funds&nbsp; 



 Facilitated transactions between darknet markets customers and vendors – Hydra, BlackSprut, OMG!OMG!, and Mega&nbsp; 



 between 2019 and 2021, Bitzlato received $206 million from darknet markets, $224 million from scams, and $9 million from ransomware attackers&nbsp; 



 lax KYC controls&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  What measures are imposed by FinCEN upon financial institutions in relation to Bitzlato-related transactions?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>FinCEN acknowledges that there may be „technological limitations that may limit or preclude covered financial institutions from declining CVC transfers originating at addresses outside of their control, and as such, compliant institutions may find themselves in receipt of CVC from Bitzlato despite a desire and effort to limit such exposure”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result, “this order allows covered financial institutions the flexibility to act with discretion based on the facts and circumstances of a particular transaction and comply with this order”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Detailed explanations about required actions by US financial institutions are provided in the order starting with chapter “C. The extent to which the action or the timing of the action would have a significant adverse systemic impact on the international payment, clearance, and settlement system, or on legitimate business activities involving Bitzlato.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 To whom do FinCEN restrictions apply?&nbsp; 



<p>US-covered financial institutions are under the obligation to comply with FinCEN’s decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The definition provided in the order of a „covered financial institution” is same as the meaning as “financial institution” in&nbsp; <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-31/subtitle-B/chapter-X/part-1010#p-1010.100(xx)">in 31 CFR § 1010.100(t):</a> “Financial institution. Each agent, agency, branch, or office within the United States of any person doing business, whether or not on a regular basis or as an organized business concern, in one or more of the capacities” further described in the CFR.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, given the activities, Bitzlato allows and facilitates, it’s safe to say that financial institutions worldwide, especially those in jurisdictions with strong AML regulations, would benefit from applying proper due diligence in relation to transactions with nexus to Bitzlato.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;Mitigating measures applied by an obliged entity would depend on:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  their risk appetite, AML policies and procedures, Customer acceptance policy and Customer risk assessment;&nbsp; 
   available software and tools to detect, stop, prevent and/or mitigate the transactional activity described in the order&nbsp; 
   the decided-upon actions to enforce when such activity is detected&nbsp; 
 <p>Out of these three points, Coinfirm tools can be used to detect the activity, as part of point 2. The decisions to be made upon detection are up to each entity, based on points 1, 2 (tools and software to stop, prevent, mitigate risk), and 3.&nbsp;</p>



 How to comply with the order by using Coinfirm’s tools?&nbsp; 



<p>First we have to mention what were the measures taken by Coinfirm to assist our clients respect FinCEN’s order and detect transactions involving Bitzlato addresses:&nbsp;</p>



  Coinfirm has flagged the entity as “fined for AML failings”, is linked to a “severe risk country” (Russia) and countries subject to targeted sanctions (Hong Kong and Russia), “is allowing anonymous coins trading”, has limited KYC verification (in our due diligence process of verifying the entity we’ve discovered that Bitzlato requested documentation from users upon withdrawal – FinCEN mentions in its report that no proper KYC was conducted at deposit stage – which is conclusive of our findings as well)&nbsp; 
   Coinfirm has clustered over 450,000 addresses as owned by Bitzlato – all these addresses have inherited some of above risk indicators pertaining to the owner.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 <p></p>



 Recommended steps to identify Bitzlato addresses and transactions to/from using Coinfirm tools:&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>&nbsp;<br>1. Direct exposure &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Step 1: all addresses clustered to Bitzlato will show the owner name in their generated&nbsp;AML risk report (Coinfirm tool). In this case, your compliance officers will need to have internal knowledge that Bitzlato is not a reputable owner from/to which you allow transactions.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Step 2: For an easier way to identify that a client is/ was interacting with addresses of an entity that falls out of your risk appetite (i.e. Bitzlato – if this is the case), use the customization feature to Blacklist Bitzlato (owner) – this will result in all clustered addresses to Bitzlato to have the risk indicator “Address belonging to the entity appearing on the private blacklist” applied. By using this measure, your compliance officers will know that any transaction from or to an address with this risk indicator is to be avoided/appropriate measures to be applied based on your AML policy and procedures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>2. Indirect exposure – an address has had a transactional activity with addresses that have sent funds to/ received funds from Bitzlato addresses. &nbsp;<br>This indication of indirect exposure to Bitzlato shows up in the Enhanced AML risk report via the proximity path feature, showing the flag, the address the flag stems from (i.e. risk activity), owner name, amount, and a number of hops (1 hop away, for example, means the address has sent to/received from directly the address which represents the source of the risk). In such cases, your compliance officers will know the origin of the funds and can take appropriate measures as described in your AML policies and procedures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today our focus is on authentication settings. If you are using Google Workspace as your IDP, reviewing your authentication settings to ensure they align with internal policies and are appropriate for any use of Google Cloud Platform is paramount. </p>

<p>We recommend two important settings:</p>

<p>1. Turn on two-factor authentication. </p><p>Why? Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts by requiring a second form of verification in addition to your password. This can be in the form of a code sent to your phone, a biometric scan, or a physical token. By using 2FA, you make it much harder for someone to gain unauthorized access to your accounts, even if they have your password. This is because a hacker would also need to have access to your second form of authentication in order to log in. Additionally, 2FA helps in cases where the password is compromised, and it's a best practice for organizations to secure their online access.</p><p></p>
<p>2. Enforce strong passwords</p><p>Why? Weak passwords can be easily guessed or cracked by hackers using automated tools, making it easy for them to gain access to your accounts. A strong password typically contains a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, and is at least 12 characters long. The longer and more complex the password, the harder it is to crack. Using a unique password for each account is also important because if a hacker gains access to one password, they will not be able to use it to access your other accounts</p><p></p>

<p>If your org is behind a third-party IDP, super admins will still use username/password and Google’s 2FA, so you will still want to ensure that settings are set properly. </p>

<p>To review these key settings, follow these steps:</p> 
   Sign in to the Google Admin Console 
   Go to Security &gt; Authentication 
   Review Password Management to ensure that password policies are properly set. Consider requiring <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/9094506?hl=en">,strong passwords</a> to automatically set a secure default.  
   Go to 2-Step Verification and check enforcement settings. If 2FA is not enforced, kick off a project to require it.  
   If it’s on and all methods are allowed, look into whether it is feasible to disable verification codes over text and phone calls as those are more susceptible to attack. 
  
   If your org uses GCP, check Google Cloud session controls to ensure that reauthentication is required. This way users cannot maintain a persistent connection to GCP resources without reauthentication.

<p>Cyber threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated with the number of bad actors involved increasing at an alarming rate. New and sophisticated techniques are being used that have evolved over the years to leverage modern computational hardware. These developments have aided and abetted the guessing of passwords and hacking of digital credentials. While these threats expose the inherent weaknesses of password-based authentication schemes, simplistic identity-detached passwordless authentication is not the answer either.</p>
 Personnel Onboarding Risks and Requirements 
<p>Organizational risk tolerance for new hire onboarding is very low because of the Day 1 access granted to services and applications. Granting access comes with risk and therefore companies will try the usual means of <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/identity-proofing/">identity proofing</a> via background checks on government-issued documents, work history, address history, etc., as a means to establish trust. But there are limits to background checks that a company normally performs, as these might not extend exhaustively to domestic and international subcontractors. Therefore, establishing trust via identity-linked proofing becomes mandatory.</p>
<p>Passwordless for employees does not by itself inoculate the enterprise against credential compromise. Ensuring the employee is who they claim to be is the gap in most passwordless solutions today because while passwordless only eliminates friction in the employee’s journey, it does not make the journey more secure.</p>
<p>What is needed is a means to mitigate identity theft and identity spoofing to ensure the individual is exactly who they are claiming to be. For the new hire onboarding journey to be secure the employee’s identity must be established irrefutably as well. Companies ask for government-issued identity documents to prove an individual is who they are claiming to be, but that does not prove that the individual logging in to applications at any given time is indeed the same person.</p>
<p>Authorization is another added requirement for onboarding an existing employee to new applications and services. Risk is minimized best when there is continuous authentication as well as transactional authorization in place where the company checks for the identity and authentication assurance level of the individual in real-time before granting them access to critical service and application assets.</p>
 Privacy, PII and the Onboarding Process 
<p>A CIO is interested in simplifying and securing the Information Architecture of the Enterprise and implementing guardrails for preserving user privacy. Data privacy has recently attained critical focus in the international community with violations costing companies billions in penalties and significant reputational damage to boot. The organization has a fiduciary responsibility to protect the Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of their employees and customers.</p>
<p>In essence, there are a few key factors driving the need for a digital transformation of the new hire onboarding process: verify the identity of the individual, secure the PII data in a way that it is impossible to compromise it, secure or even better, eliminate login credentials (i.e., passwords), implement continuous verification of the identity, continuous transactional authorization before granting access, and finally, ensure continuing privacy of the individual by imposing protections and restrictions on any PII release to third-parties.</p>
 Simplified Access 
<p>Simplified access to legacy systems using passwordless sign-on improves productivity, no doubt about that. Even better, enabling quick password resets to legacy apps after the individual has completed a strong <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/identity-authentication/">identity-based authentication</a> roundtrip using live biometrics enables faster and frictionless access to legacy applications. Another strategic benefit of deploying an identity-based passwordless solution is to reclaim 2FA spend on migrating legacy systems to passwordless. Why not re-use the identity from a secure digital identity wallet for onboarding new hires and existing employees to modern and legacy services?</p>
 Reduce Costs 
<p>A CIO’s broad mandate is to reduce IT costs, including personnel onboarding administration costs by implementing projects that automate the self-service workflows for new hire onboarding, identity proofing, and <a href="http://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/identity-verification-system/">identity verification</a>. Another key requirement is to reduce help desk costs, which can be implemented by automating password resets for legacy applications as described previously. This identity-based authentication strategy also eliminates help desk calls for those same password resets and reduces 24/7 helpdesk overhead and support costs with fewer complaints and ‘stalled’ or stuck employees.</p>
 Improve Security 
<p>A quick word is in order for a CISO’s mandate as well. They are looking to improve the overall security posture and prevent – or the more likely scenario – manage losses from data breaches (they are inevitable!). CISOs want to restrict the amount of PII stored in a central user repository to only what is needed to do business. A good information security program also attempts to eliminate vulnerabilities resulting from weak non-identity based authentication techniques.</p>
<p>In summary, CXOs want to simplify the information and information security architecture of the organization, minimize the reputational damage of information breach, and reduce their insurance liability at the same time. Why not go with an identity based authentication and proofing platform that makes mass credential compromise impossible?</p>
<p>It is clear that live biometrics-based aka identity-based authentication that uses pre-proofed identity is much stronger for use in a continuous authentication and continuous authorization paradigm than any other form of identity-detached passwordless scheme. It is the only way to verify that the individual is who they are claiming to be at the time of an access request.</p>
 1Kosmos Identity-Based Authentication 
<p>All these goals can only be achieved if an organization starts with identity and not just authentication. The traditional approach to <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/passwordless-authentication/">passwordless authentication</a> is to focus on MFA or passwordless login. While 1Kosmos is passwordless, we bring identity-based features to an authentication scheme used by the organization. This flexibility may be used to enhance the identity verification process using strong biometrics-based identity and verification of user credentials via industry standards.</p>
<p>What’s unique about 1Kosmos is that we start with Identity, instead of starting with authentication, as the basis for <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/strong-authentication/">strong authentication</a> and this enables us to solve many of the same challenges for both employees and customers. Our biometrics engine allows for continuous identity verification of the individual at login-time, and continuous transactional authorization at access-time, while remaining aligned with the company’s risk policies. It is no longer acceptable to identity-proof an employee or a customer once – for example during onboarding or new hire – and let them use services indefinitely.</p>
<p>By combining authentication with true Identity (NIST 800-63-3a principles and modified versions for corporate applications), you have a much higher assurance to know who is truly at the end of a digital connection every time they authenticate.</p>
<p>These principles apply to customers especially in the banking industry where strong KYC is needed. 1Kosmos is a member of the FIDO alliance, DIACC, The DIF foundation, Linux Foundation (for Trust over IP), W3C, and the COVID Credentials group. This ensures that you will have a partner with a product that is not only open, preventing vendor lock-in, but is on top of the latest trends in Identity.</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 22nd January to 28th&nbsp;January <p>Back with another Veriscope Regulatory Recap! This week in focus — the note from the Biden administration officials urging Congress to intensify crypto regulatory efforts, Indonesia signing a new financial law to regulate crypto beyond trading, and a US Democrat introducing a bill for legalizing crypto payments in New York state. Let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p> US Official Note Urges Congress to Step up Crypto Regulations <p>The Biden Administration presented in its official blog, from January 27th, 2023, a roadmap for addressing potential crypto risks. It aimed to ramp up enforcement and asked the U.S. Congress to step up its regulatory efforts.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1619372444610953216?s=20&amp;t=n6BrR6gfOxRQAufJv_r1gw">Image Source</a>)<p>The post cited some significant failures in the crypto industry in recent times, including the implosion of Terra protocol’s algorithmic stablecoin and the collapse of FTX, the third-largest crypto exchange in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>The lack of applicable regulations, the prevalence of misleading statements, inadequate disclosures, and weak cybersecurity measures are among some of the risk factors that the blog has identified.</p><p>The administration asked not to allow mainstream financial institutions like pension funds to enter crypto&nbsp;markets.</p> Indonesia Wants to Treat Crypto as a&nbsp;Security <p>With Indonesian President Joko Widodo signing a new law on January 12th, crypto regulatory powers will now shift from the Financial Services Authority (OJK) to CoFTRA, a commodities watchdog.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1619848363288961024?s=20&amp;t=n6BrR6gfOxRQAufJv_r1gw">Image Source</a>)<p>ABI, the blockchain trade association of Indonesia, has welcomed the move saying that “this shift has shown a good understanding from the regulator that crypto assets are broader than just trading.”</p><p>According to the Indonesian Government, the regulatory changeover would take two&nbsp;years.</p><p>The country also has plans to set up a national crypto exchange similar to the NYSE, which the government believes will make market monitoring easier for regulators.</p> IMF Issues 5-Point Crypto Regulatory Recommendations <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recommendations ask regulators to license, register, and authorize crypto asset providers. It calls to prohibit crypto entities from conducting multiple functions under one business, as it creates conflicts of interest.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1617945931218911237?s=20&amp;t=n6BrR6gfOxRQAufJv_r1gw">Image Source</a>)<p>The IMF has also asked for regulators to apply robust regulations, as applicable to banks, to the issuers of stablecoins. It has suggested imposing requirements on traditional financial institutions for crypto exposure or engagement.</p><p>The final recommendation called for a consistent global approach to crypto regulation and oversight.</p> US Democrat Introduces a New Bill for Crypto&nbsp;Payments <p>A member of the Democratic Party and the representative of the 33rd district of New York, Clyde Vanel, has introduced a crypto bill to the New York State Assembly. It is asking state agencies to legalize and accept cryptocurrency as a means of payment for fines, taxes, fees, civil penalties, and other state-related dues by forming partnerships with entities that will enable crypto payment settlements.</p>(<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/29/nyregion/assembly-ny-primary.html">Image Source</a>)<p>The bill is now in the hands of the New York State Assembly Committee on Government Operations for further study and possible amendments.</p><p>The bill requires it to be passed by the Assembly and Senate Body and by the Governor of the State before it could become&nbsp;law.</p> Shyft Network Tokenomics Update <p>Last week (January 26th, 2023), we published the Shyft Network token distribution and economic update. At the time of writing, we were at a block 8,884,061, with 595,473,894.1127162 SHFT in circulation.</p><p>The current SHFT unlocked at the time of the publication was 951,904,687 on the 26th of Jan. 2022.

<p>Step-up authentication is an authentication method available for eService providers to allow users to access certain resources with minimal credentials, while requiring additional verification when accessing sensitive information. Matching authentication levels and authentication methods with the sensitivity (or value) of the resource provides a good balance between security and ease of use.</p>
<p>This blog will concentrate on and explore step-up authentication, what it is, how it interacts with SSO and its benefits.</p>
 What is step-up authentication? 
<p>Step-up authentication is the use of two separate authentication methods, at differing intervals throughout login and information access. A lower level of assurance method is used to access the basic information before a higher level of assurance method is then requested if the user wants to access more sensitive information.</p>
<p>Step-up authentication is technically an upgrade to an existing authentication level. The basic concept is that initially, users authenticate themselves using a lower-level authentication method. For example, the username and password created during the account registration or one of the social media methods like Apple, Google, or Facebook. This login creates a session which is typically stored to a web browser cookie, and this allows the users to access certain types of services and information.</p>
<p>If the users want to access more sensitive information or, for example handle money-related transactions, then they must upgrade the authentication level of the existing session to a higher degree. This is where the step-up authentication takes place. From the users’ point of view, it is just another authentication workflow where they use a higher level of assurance authentication method, such as Bank ID, Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) codes, mobile PKI, ID cards or similar. This adaptive approach ensures that only authorised users can access the sensitive information, thereby managing the risk level without negatively impacting the usability.</p>
 Step-up authentication and SSO 
<p>One of the basic features of a modern CIAM System is the single sign-on (SSO). It is a great feature that allows users to move between different services of the same service provider without the need to re-authenticate in between. The SSO between different applications requires the user session to be authenticated to a specific level or re-authentication will be requested. The different MFA authentication workflows utilise the so-called ‘weakest method first’ principle where the lower level of assurance methods are executed first, followed by the higher assurance methods. This is the same principle usually applied in step-up authentication. If users have not yet executed the higher level of assurance within step-up authentication, they may be blocked from using the SSO within applications that require the higher level of authentication. In these cases, the users must execute a new authentication which is not part of the step-up authentication.</p>
 Why choose Step-up authentication? 
<p>There are several so-called multiple authentication request schemes to choose from. These include multifactor authentication (MFA), step-up authentication and risk based authentication (RBA). Although there are some similarities between these, including the authentication methods being the same and step-authentication and RBA both being based on MFA. There are also some fundamental differences, like the conditions of when and where those extra authentication steps are requested. Step-up Authentication sits between MFA and RBA. Making it an ideal authentication method when your system requires a higher level of authentication than basic MFA can provide but does not require the intricacies of RBA.</p>
<p>In comparison to MFA, which requests two authentication methods during the initial login process, step-up authentication only requests the additional higher-level authentication when the user wants to access sensitive information, or perform higher risk, higher value transactions. This not only makes the system more user friendly but also saves costs in comparison to traditional MFA due to only requesting secondary authentication as and when required.</p>
<p>Step-up authentication and Risk-Based Authentication (RBA) differ in that step-up authentication allows access to different parts of a service using both single-factor and multi-factor authentications, while RBA only utilises multi-factor authentication as a means of added security when suspicious activity is detected, without providing any additional access to the service.</p>
<p>By raising the assurance level of an authentication method, we make services more secure. However, at the same time, the access procedure becomes more complex for the end user, thus potentially increasing frustration, which we want to avoid. In addition, added security of MFA usually increases the cost for the service providers in form of transaction-based pricing per authentication action. Step-up authentication and RBA provide optional approaches to solve these issues.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>Nowadays, people understand the role of the cyber security of eServices and are becoming more familiar with the higher level of assurance authentication procedures. However, usability is a key factor for a successful eService. Providing easy access without compromising security can be a separator between you and your competition.</p>
<p>Step-up authentication provides the best of both worlds, easy usability when accessing protected resources and a high-security level when accessing more sensitive information. Even if criminal hackers managed to get users’ credentials to access their services, sensitive information or money-related transactions would not be available without using the higher level of assurance method required to access these resources. This, combined with the cost savings that service providers can achieve with step-up authentication, makes it a very attractive option when evaluating different authentication method schemes for their eServices.</p>
<p>As a Customer and Identity Management System (CIAM) vendor, Ubisecure’s Identity Platform offers various authentication method options for the eService providers. These methods can be used individually, as a single-factor manner, or as a combination of two or more, offering various schemes for authentication.</p>

The grid provided universal, safe, instant, easy, cheap access to something that everybody needs: energy for the purposes of heat, light and motion. Steam may have inspired awe. But ultimately it did not represent the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Today, we have a similar situation. Personal data is something everybody needs to access safely, instantly, easily and cheaply to manage their affairs better: to make better decisions and to plan, organise and coordinate their implementation. So we need the equivalent of a national grid to enable this, via better data&nbsp;sharing.</p><p>But today’s data systems are specifically designed NOT to do this. They revolve around the organisation-centric database — a separate data silo where each organisation keeps the data they collect under lock and key, for its use only. Like steam, a separate database needs to be built for every use case and occasion.</p><p>Yes, back in its day, the organisation-centric database transformed our world by enabling the collection and use of data, to make an increasing range of activities data driven, just as steam made an increasing range of activities steam&nbsp;driven.</p><p>But like the steam engine, the organisation-centric database is also inefficient, cumbersome and expensive, restricting access and use of personal data. Steam demonstrated the power of energy. The organisation-centric database demonstrated the power and potential of data. It opened a door to a different future, But like steam, it does not represent this&nbsp;future.</p> A flawed&nbsp;model <p>This includes Google and Facebook, icons of our age, just as the Flying Scostmen was an icon of its era. As data juggernauts, they have transformed our society, inspiring awe, admiration (and emulation) the world over as they have done so. As steam-powered railways&nbsp;did.</p><p>But they are also severely&nbsp;limited.</p><p>Despite their size and ambition, they are limited in the data they can collect (how many people would share their health or financial data with Google or Facebook?). Economically speaking, they are just skimming the surface of what data can do. Focused as they are on marketing, advertising and media they hardly touch the core — industries such as health, education, banking finance and insurance, public administration in central and local government; any and all services dealing with identifiable individuals. As such, they cannot touch anything more than just a tiny fraction of all economic activity.</p><p>Meanwhile, their business models generate irreconcilable conflicts that constrain them: to keep on growing their profits, they have to hoover up ever more data. But the more they try to do so, the less trustworthy they become and the more they are hounded by regulators and competition authorities. They had an amazing run, but they are already plateauing. They are not the harbingers of the future. They represent an evolutionary dead end. They do NOT represent any sort of sustainable model for the&nbsp;future.</p> From electrification to datafication <p>In this blog series we’ve talked about the transformational power of personal data and personal data stores, their ability&nbsp;to:</p>  unleash <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-vital-issue-people-avoid-talking-about-ed4c36a7de93">breakthrough productivity improvements</a> for both households and service providers  solve the challenges of <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-are-joined-up-services-so-difficult-to-deliver-e21d762b7d32">seamless joined-up services</a>  transform the way people and organisations <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-struggle-to-connect-f233bd480d44">go to&nbsp;market</a>  create <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/an-engine-of-economic-possibilities-a04a32181f48">entirely new person-centric services</a> and industries  accelerate and enrich <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/what-has-data-got-to-do-with-net-zero-bb48048b04bc">the journey to net&nbsp;zero</a>.  <p>We’ve talked in some detail about the how and why of each of these opportunities, but we haven’t explained the common economic principles that unite&nbsp;them.</p><p>One such principle is illustrated by the national electricity grid. By making a universally needed enabler — energy — safe, easy to access and affordable, it lifted previous barriers to its use and opened up an explosion of possibilities. Providing every individual with their own personal data store would do the same for another universally needed enabler — the personal data that lies at the heart of every service that deals with an identifiable individual, across all sectors of the economy (public, private and&nbsp;third).</p><p>The national electricity grid enabled the electrification of the economy. The personal data store enables its datafication, transcending the barriers and limitations of the steam-engine of our age, the organisation-centric database.</p> Applying tried and tested economic principles <p>The national grid analogy is useful in two ways. It captures some key principles that need to be adopted, and it illustrates the nature and scale of the opportunity.</p><p>It also illustrates the importance of key divisions of labour, between electricity generation and distribution. With personal data, today’s organisations act as ‘power stations’ that generate data and personal data stores enable its distribution.</p><p>But what the analogy misses is the ‘how’. To see the underlying economic principles at work here, we need to look at another transformational development of the early 20th century: mass production, the brainchild of Henry&nbsp;Ford.</p><p>Think of any physical product you like. It’s made up of a specific combination of different, specified parts which (if put together in the right way) contribute their own little bit to making the whole product work. Different products require different parts, combined in different ways.</p><p>Henry Ford’s genius was to invent an extremely efficient, generalisable way to bring standardised parts together to create a whole product, using a moving assembly line. It was this that cut the cost of making a motor car by over&nbsp;90%.</p><p>Personal data stores apply exactly the same economic logic to assembling the highly specific combinations of personal data that are needed to deliver specific services. If you think about it, what service providers do with personal data is exactly the same as what manufacturers do with parts to make products: assemble unique configurations of data/parts to produce any and all services/products imaginable.</p><p>The only way to make this work, efficiently and effectively, is to use standardised parts. Previously in manufacturing, when each part was made by hand, it was also unique. Different. Which meant it couldn’t just ‘snap’ to fit to other parts. Each one had to be reworked, even if just a little bit, to make the whole product. And this rework took an enormous amount of&nbsp;time.</p><p>To make the whole thing work, the components that went into the making of products had to be standardised. By using standardised parts and a moving assembly line (which slashed the time, energy and effort needed to get each part to where it needed to be) Ford reduced the costs of making a motor car by over&nbsp;90%.</p><p>In the world of data, verified attributes (or credentials) are the standardised parts of service manufacturing.</p><p>A verified attribute is a piece of information about an individual that has been generated or confirmed by a responsible organisation and turned into a cryptographically secure token — so that it can be shared and used quickly and easily, thereby eliminating the huge amount of re-work that currently takes&nbsp;place.</p><p>A verified attribute could be about anything: the fact that you have a valid driving licence, that you are over 18, what your blood type is, or your credit score, or inside leg measurement. It doesn’t matter. But once it has been verified it can be turned into a token (a standardised part) and used to assemble any service that needs it (thereby eliminating the need to fill in forms, for example).</p><p>By enabling the gathering and sharing of such verified attributes (as well as additional information provided by the individual that only the individual knows), personal data stores apply the logic that revolutionised the manufacture of physical products to the manufacture of personalised services. They achieve what the national electricity grid achieved for&nbsp;energy.</p> Conclusion <p>Breakthrough innovations like the national electricity grid and the mass production moving assembly line, or personal data stores, happen at unique moments in history. They combine novel combinations of things which are relatively new but nevertheless tried and tested. In Ford’s case for example, the oil and electricity industries were relatively new. Standardised parts were already used in arms manufacture. Moving (dis)assembly lines by meat packers. Ford put them together to transform car&nbsp;making.</p><p>In our day, the Internet, cloud storage, APIs for data sharing and technologies to make cryptographically secure tokens are all relatively new but tried and tested. Personal data stores bring these developments to transform the collection and use of personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Such transformations are seismic in their effects. Together, the national electricity grid and the mass production assembly line transformed 20th century economies, making steam engines history. Current organisation-centric approaches to the collection and use of data, including those of the Flying Scotsmen of the information age Google and Facebook, are its steam&nbsp;engines.</p><p>Yes, they paved the way, highlighted the opportunities, and built new capabilities and infrastructure. But they do not represent the future. Personal data stores on the other hand are the 21st century information age equivalents of the electricity grid and the assembly line. They provide the data logistics infrastructure a modern economy needs, making access to and use of personal data universally accessible and available. They do so by applying principles that were tried and tested with the handling of things to the handling of information.</p><p>This raises a knock-on question however: If the resulting opportunity is so big and so beneficial, why haven’t people been falling over themselves to seize it?

<p>Introduction from YeshID</p>
<p>At YeshID, we're big fans of Google Workspace and have adopted it like many other startups. However, we were not fully aware of all the security features it offers. </p>

<p>That's why we reached out to our design partner, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ylanmuller/">Ylan Muller</a>, an expert in Google administration, for guidance on best practices for a Google administrator. Ylan is an IT professional with nine years of experience in managing SaaS applications, including Google Workspace, across industries from financial services to software. She currently runs IT at<a href="https://firehydrant.com/"> FireHydrant</a>.</p>

<p>Ylan provided us with valuable and easy-to-implement advice, even without a dedicated security or IT team. With Ylan's permission, we've turned her advice into a 5-day New Year's challenge to improve our workplace security. Oh and bonus - you don’t have to purchase any new software to put these good practices in place!</p>

<p>We're excited to share Ylan's insights with you.</p>

<p>Introduction to Google Security Basics</p>
<p>Inheriting a Google Workspace environment can be an intimidating experience. While you can address some problems through written policy (don’t send sensitive data outside of the org!), Google Workspace offers ample technical control for locking down the data that matters most to your business.</p>

<p>I’ve honed in on the settings I find most important to review over several years of managing Google Workspace environments for companies ranging from 50 to 1050 employees and am here to share them with you! Below you will find a list of settings to review and ideas to implement as you look to lock down your Google organization. </p>

<p>Welcome to Day 1!</p>

<p>Day 1: Establishing a Secure Foundation - Review and/or Create Your Organizational Unit and Group Structure</p>
<p>Many settings in Google Workspace can be scoped to either a user group or OU. Ideally, groups and/or OUs should be able to represent your organization structure and any other groupings that would be appropriate for slicing and dicing access and settings. For example, you may want to prevent your finance team from sharing files outside of the organization, but your customer success team may need to. Having your groups and OUs set up properly to start will allow you to more easily scope settings. </p>

<p>Groups are also used in Google Cloud Platform - if you or your engineering team plans on utilizing GCP in the future, think about how you would want to handle access. Setting up department and team groups in Google Workspace in advance may save you time when you go to configure IAM. </p>

<p>We also recommend:</p> 
   Avoiding nesting OUs too deeply. Having many layers of nested OUs will get unmanageable quickly since a user can only be in one OU, but they can be in many groups. For example, the nested OU structure below will result in a lot of overheard if you ever need to change a setting for every user who is allowed to share externally:
 
 <p>
With the newly introduced abilities to apply settings to groups, smaller organizations should consider keeping everyone within a general “Employees” OU while applying settings purely through groups. 
</p> 
   Creating a group for IT as a first-stop for new setting assignments for testing 
   Creating a cross-functional group of people in the company, representing all parts of the organization, that can serve as beta testers outside of IT. There is no world in which IT can vet every setting for every use case. Work with this group to collect their feedback about new features or settings you deploy.  
 
<p>If you are on an Enterprise or Education plan you can also <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/10286834?hl=en">,construct dynamic groups</a> based on profile attributes to automate memberships. </p>

 Popular sporting tournament surpasses previous World Cup viewing figures, betting activity, and visits to black-market sites. 



 



<p>As predicted, the unusual combination of winter scheduling and enforced breaks of domestic football leagues resulted in a World Cup with a record-breaking <a href="https://www.gamblinginsider.com/news/19886/bgc-black-market-gambling-site-traffic-tripled-during-2022-world-cup">5.4 billion </a>cumulated views .&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, traffic to <a href="https://www.gamblinginsider.com/news/19886/bgc-black-market-gambling-site-traffic-tripled-during-2022-world-cup">black market gambling sites also tripled</a> during the world-famous sporting tournament. According to the UK Betting and Gaming Council, 250,000 people visited black market sites in December alone, compared to 80,000 during the same month in 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s unfortunate, but not surprising. Consumers are often drawn to black-market gambling sites because of bonus benefits and unclear rules regarding deposit limits. However, users should be aware that there is no consumer protection when using these black-market sites. So, if you win a bet, there is no guarantee that they will pay out. This is why it’s incredibly important for users to use licensed gambling operators that have rigorous player protection and safer gambling tools in place,” said Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk,&nbsp;Director of Global Gambling &amp; Sales at IDnow.</p>



<p>Read more about Roger’s 2023 predictions for the online gambling market, in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/gambling-trends-2023/">‘“Always bet on good regulation.”’ interview</a>.</p>



 Why bettors may go to black-market operators. 



<p>Two of the main reasons players may decide to go to black-market operators is that they tend to offer higher bonuses, along with the promise they don’t have to do <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC</a>. However, it’s worth remembering that the KYC requirement is there to not only protect operators from consumers using the platform for nefarious activities like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering/">money laundering</a> or other types of identity fraud, but also for consumer protection. If consumers use an unregistered, black-market gaming platform then there is no guarantee that they will pay out.</p>



<p>The other reason why some consumers decide to go with a black-market operator could be down to their superior customer experience. </p>



<p>Businesses that enter the online gambling market, and comply with regulations, are also often plagued by sluggish UI, and poor customer experience. In fact,&nbsp;<a href="https://egr.global/compliance/news/report-up-to-30-of-online-gambling-customers-abandon-sign-up-process/">research</a>&nbsp;shows that 30% of online gamblers have abandoned the onboarding process when registering a new account with a gambling website due to its complicated sign-up processes.</p>



<p>The importance of offering a fast and smooth, multi-jurisdictional, and KYC-compliant onboarding experience cannot be overstated. As every potential customer needs to be verified before being allowed to gamble, players will no doubt flock to the website or gambling platform that can verify their information the quickest. This need for speed is becoming increasingly important in both the KYC, and online gambling arenas. If player onboarding is too complicated, or has too many hurdles, organizations run a real risk of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/security-and-risk/2018/online-gambling-authentication-security-digital-identification/">significant drop-off</a>.</p>



 FIFA World Cup 2022 recap. 



<p>The 2018 FIFA World Cup was a massive success for the betting and gaming industry, with an estimated <a href="https://www.gamblinginsider.com/news/5660/uk-wagers-15bn-on-fifa-world-cup">$155 billion wagered on the game, including $1.9 billion in the UK</a> alone. As we predicted in our<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/winter-world-cup-qatar-impacts-sports-events/"> ‘How the Winter World Cup in Qatar impacts other sports events, including the Premier League.’ blog</a>, many bettors appeared to have preferred to stay indoors to watch the winter World Cup tournament, leading to increased demand for online gambling platforms. Indeed, the World Cup 2022 tournament attracted even more gambling activity that World Cup 2018, with a <a href="https://igamingbusiness.com/sports-betting/2022-world-cup-breaks-betting-records-thanks-in-part-to-us-growth/">13% increase in sports betting</a> according to provider of sportsbook technology, content and services, OpenBet.</p>



<p>Key to the growth in betting activity was the recent legalization of online gambling in some states of the United States. GeoComply, a provider of geolocation security and compliance solutions, revealed that the Argentina-France World Cup final actually attracted more US bettors than the final games of the NCAA’s March Madness, NBA final, and NHL’s Stanley Cup final.</p>



<p>In a bit to capitalize on the growing popularity of football, many operators seized the opportunity to offer new products specifically designed for World Cup fans. For example, offering odds on everything from which team will be sent off first, to particular bets, such as how many yellow cards England will receive during one game.</p>



<p>However, now that the World Cup 2022 is over, sportsbooks should not assume that a newly gained customer will continue to bet after the tournament ends, or even place multiple bets throughout the tournament. This was demonstrated on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kambi.com/qatar-2022-what-a-winter-world-cup-means-for-sports-betting/">Kambi network during the Euro 2020 tournament</a>, when 78% of new players bet on the event when given a coupon, but only 76% returned for a second bet during the same event.</p>



<p>Customer acquisition and retention after a big tournament are crucial to successful sportsbooks. The timing of the World Cup 2022 created a real opportunity for operators as the Premier League resumed just a week after the World Cup 2022 ended, allowing for a much shorter retention (and loss) window compared to Euro 2020, which had a gap of over a month.</p>



 Unique operational challenges for gambling operators. 



<p>The last thing sportsbooks need is for consumers to try their platform – whether they are solid bet builders or player props – only to lose interest and vanish when the World Cup ends.</p>



<p>Operators that can offer a great customer onboarding experience, and a product that delivers a wide variety of markets and an outstanding level of combinability, are perfectly positioned to benefit from the opportunities at major sporting tournaments like the World Cup.</p>



<p>Of course, there is no uniform global legislation that governs gambling services. For example, some countries allow all types of gambling, while others&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mondaq.com/cyprus/gaming/1147366/gambling-laws-in-europe">only allow certain forms</a>&nbsp;such as poker or casino games.</p>



<p>Keeping abreast of regulatory differences can be confusing, time-consuming, and expensive. Some of the most common gambling regulations concern age limits, which means verifying the age of players is essential in preventing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/prevent-underage-gambling/">underage gambling</a>. There are also specific national and regional laws that gaming operators must follow. Find out more in our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/online-gambling-regulation/">overview of both the EU &amp; UK Online Gambling Regulations</a>.</p>



 Security and betting fraud. 



<p>During the World Cup 2018, there were major concerns about security and betting fraud. In preparation for the World Cup 2022, gaming operators were warned to be wary of the following:</p>



  Bookmakers offering inaccurate odds – this could be due to a lack of liquidity, and result in customers not being able to place bets.  A lack of transparency –  some bookmakers were accused of fixing matches.  Fraudulent activities – bots operated by criminals were used to manipulate bettors into placing wagers on specific teams or players.  



<p>Betting fraud is a problem that affects all countries where <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/online-gambling-regulation/">online gambling is legal</a>, not just those hosting major sporting events like the World Cup or Olympics. Ahead of the World Cup 2022, fraud prevention service, Cifas warned operators and users about the serious consequences of committing gambling fraud.</p>



<p>As gambling fraud and betting fraud tends to spike during major sporting events, Cifas predicted a huge increase in the number of fraudulent claims that would be submitted in the months following the World Cup 2022.</p>



<p>An increase on figures that were already at an all-time high. Indeed, in the first <a href="https://www.cifas.org.uk/newsroom/betting-fraud-2022-world-cup">nine months of 2022, fraudulent claims for chargebacks</a> (where a person fraudulently claims they didn’t make a purchase or receive a product to recoup costs from bank) rose by 172%.</p>

<p>Identity and access management is a nuanced problem. Everyone <a href="https://twitter.com/JustJake/status/1613348687048224769">,hates it</a>, and with good reason.</p>

<p>So, welcome to YeshID’s metaphorical kitchen. Notice it’s spotless! Let’s take a quick tour, and I’ll point out how we do things differently.</p>

<p>Let’s start over there. Do you see the sign “Customers never hacked because of YeshID”? That is where we create the secure foundation for managing the identities of customers, and employees, the services they need to access, and the authentication methods we provide. Notice the minimalism. How simple everything is. Simplicity minimizes mistakes and ensures precision work. No rough cuts or shortcuts here! The chefs use Golang, a simple, fast, statically typed language created by Google to power our backend. </p>

<p>Next is the frontend station. It’s the one with all the colorful spices and ingredients. Do you see the “Dead simple and delightful to use” sign? We want everything that comes out of the YeshID kitchen to be a perfect balance of security and usability. Every step is continuously refined: customer onboarding, deployment, the employee on and offboarding, security, compliance, privacy, and simplicity. We eat with our eyes first and keyboards next.</p>

<p>The next station, the one with the storage islands, charts and whiteboards, lab instruments, and measuring tools, is our metrics station. Here is where we measure everything we do. The goal here is to identify what – exactly – works. How much time did you spend onboarding a new employee? How many clicks did you have to make? What was the employee’s experience? How can we make it easier and more secure for everyone? We try to measure everything and turn it into actionable information so that the next dish is better for everyone.</p>

<p>The last thing I am going to show you is the most important: our team. Our talented chefs work across all stations. Together, we yesh things into existence–building everything from nothing. We’ve built the kitchen and tools; we’re growing the ingredients, and assembling the dishes. We’re obsessed with the customer experience, your experience as an admin, your experience as an employee, and your experience as a user of the YeshID wallet. We constantly iterate on every aspect and try new ingredients, new combinations. We’re never satisfied. This is why one of the values in our metaphorical kitchen, but very real company, we put in our first blog post: “<a href="https://www.yeshid.com/post/our-values#:~:text=Innovate%20until%20experience%20%26%20security%20exist%20in%20harmony.">,Innovate until experience &amp; security exist in harmony.</a>”</p>

<p>Our chefs are experienced. They have tasted good dishes and bad ones. They experiment and innovate mixing old ingredients and new, and delight when they create something delicious that no one has ever seen, tasted, or smelled before.</p>

<p>Let me tell you a little about why we felt compelled to start YeshID - the frustration that drove us. </p>

<p>Imagine you are responsible for digitally onboarding new employees to your company, AcmeLabs. You just hired Fred or Sally. And you (or someone charged with that duty) need to assign an @acmelabs email address (and temporary password) for each new hire. They need to make sure that the email and password are sent securely and that the new hire enabled 2FA.</p>

<p>So here’s the classic recipe:</p>
 
   Get the new hire’s personal email address (the one that’s been used in the hiring process) 
   Go to Google Workspace and create a new user account. Assign a user name based on the company’s standard (an alias can be added later) 
   Add the personal email and phone number (if known) as backup contact points. 
   Send an email to the personal email address with a log-in link. 
   When they click the link they’ll have to replace the temporary password with a new one. Yikes! Passwords.
Of course, you’ve set up a domain-wide password policy – the minimum and maximum password length; whether to require strong passwords; how often they expire; Yes, replace a password with a password. And users never make mistakes. And they never forget the passwords that they’ve entered or increment that last digit. Never. And they never let the link expire – like you sent it on Friday and they don’t get to it until Monday. Two weeks from now. Oh never! 
   And of course, you’ve enabled 2FA for the domain. So after they replace a password with a password they have to choose their second authentication method. And that’s not dead simple. It’s easy to screw up and then you’ve got to fix it. 
   By the way, how long a grace period do you give new users before they provide their second authentication method? And do you want to enforce it? Hint: if enforcement and no grace period, then they can’t log in! And if there’s a grace period, what happens when the grace period lapses – as it will? And how many steps do they go through to authenticate with their phone?  
   If you’re using a third-party MFA solution, make sure it’s been installed ahead of time and your new hires already know how to use it, or they’ll get locked out. 
 
<p>Taste good so far? Or is it kind of bitter? And that’s not all of it. There are lots more things that can go wrong.</p>

<p>And will.</p>

<p>And we wonder why 40% of help desk tickets have to do with credentials.</p>

<p>What about YeshID? How do we make it dead simple, completely secure, and delightful to use?</p>

<p>Stay tuned as we share more about our special sauce in upcoming posts.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>There has been quite some traction behind the ISO Mobile Driver’s Licence (mDL) recently. Many US States have opted to deploy them, it has recently been suggested in the EU digital identity guidance as an initial use case to be supported, and the mDL mdoc format is starting to be supported by other transport protocols such as OIDC4VC.</p>
<p>We talk a lot about various flavours of verifiable credentials on this podcast. Verifiable credentials aim to give broad expressive capacity to digital credentials for a variety of use cases, while the Mobile Driver’s Licence (mDL) addresses the particular use case of mobile driving licenses.</p>
<p>One of the things that resonated the most to me in this conversation with Andrew was the fact that mDL has the opportunity to be a powerful tool in credential transformation. What does that mean?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Governments today aren’t accustomed to issuing verifiable data to their citizens.&nbsp; And because mobile driver’s licenses are an issuer-oriented standard today, and governments (issuers) are members of the organization that is defining these standards (ISO), there is a clear appetite for them. The thought is that once a use case-specific credential such as a mobile driver’s licence gets issued into the wild, then the next logical step for government issuers is to begin thinking: “Hey! What if I don’t have to issue digital representations of physical documents, but instead start issuing specific claims or attestation?” This is the credential transformation.</p>
<p>Another thing that resonated with me in this conversation was the fact that we need to make sure we separate standard work from implementation work in our discussions, regardless of the standard. Certain features such as privacy, interoperability and security can be built-in, or rather suggested by the standards. It however comes down to implementers to build their solutions around them in the right manner. This also includes how mDL issuers determine how they interact with the large mobile hardware and software vendors (e.g., Apple and Google), who pose risks of walled gardens and control.</p>
<p>In this podcast episode with Andrew Hughes, we discuss, <br><br></p>
 
 Distinguishing the mobile driving licence (mDL) credential type from a verifiable credential (VC). 
 How the mDL standard is working towards being consumed by other credential transport protocols (e.g., DIDComm, OIDC4VC) 
 Can the same ISO standard for mDL be used to issue non-driving licence credentials? And should it? 
 Do issuers of driving licences consider mDL it as a driving licence credential, or an identity credential? 
 What does the ecosystem look like for mDL vs the one for physical driving licences? Who are some new participants that aren’t involved in physical DL production and governance? 
 Why implementation supersedes the standard work. 
 What are some interesting use cases around mDL that are gaining traction? 
 How ISO works and how the relevant mDL sub-committees are evolving the standard. 
 Are there concerns with the mobile hardware and OS providers gaining too much control over the mDL credentials?

<p>The rise of AI has been imminent for quite some time. What was lacking were commercialized products that are relevant for average users. However, 2023 seems to have offered the first real glimpses of a change on this path — many believe that this will be the breakthrough year for AI as more applications and AI utilities become embedded in our day-to-day lives.</p>
<p>With the increased use of AI-based bots, users around the world are relentlessly testing and improving these products – and AI in general. And when it comes to crypto, bots have always been part of the picture. With all these recent developments in mind, it’s becoming increasingly obvious that AI has an undeniable influence on our daily lives.</p>
<p>The rise of a technology like AI, which reduces manual human effort, is probably the next step in human evolution. AI can help bring improvements to various facets of life, and the possibilities are endless. Nevertheless, the drawbacks – and any necessary steps to curb these drawbacks – should also not go overlooked.</p>
 AI for Crypto &amp; Web3 
<p>Bots that utilize AI and machine learning technologies have been used for various purposes within the crypto industry. Anyone with even a superficial interaction with the space will have come across trading bots, anti-spam bots, or similar others that offer unique utilities for users. And with the advent of Web3, the dependency on bots and AI within the crypto industry is bound to increase.</p>
<p>The utilization of AI and its related technology should collectively be beneficial for the crypto community. However, since every coin has two sides, we should always “hope for the best and plan for the worst.”</p>
<p>So what could go wrong with AI or bot usage on Web3 or within crypto communities?</p>
<p>Fundamentally, Web3 is more decentralized and democratic than its predecessors. And these inherent properties enable Web3 platforms to ensure that all value created through these platforms will be shared equally by creators, content-makers, and users without any discrimination or bias towards one party.</p>
<p>Imagine a video-sharing platform that viewers can use to earn tokens for the time they spend on the platform and the work they do to suggest improvements to the overall working of the platform.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, an ideal Web3 platform would treat all parties equally. In such an ideal scenario, everyone associated with the platform will have equal stakes on the platform, making it truly decentralized.</p>
<p>However, an ideal scenario is often not the reality. Bots or AI programs created by bad actors, which can mimic human behavior, can take advantage of this parity and skew the stakes of the platform in their favor. Such behavior can distort the decentralization of a platform and tip the balance toward centralization.</p>
<p>Added to that, by gaining an unfair advantage on a platform, exploiters can theoretically influence voting and gain an unfair advantage over the governance rights of other users, making the system even more biased.</p>
<p>Thus, bots and AI programs have the potential to dismantle the two core properties of Web3, which would effectively take it back to Web2.</p>
 SelfKey Can Help 
<p>Web3 users and platforms can win the race before it even starts by not allowing bots to compete with real human users. To achieve this, platforms may need to employ a decentralized human-proof verification process: Only users who pass the verification as real humans should be allowed to share the value of the platform and subsequently take part in its governance.</p>
<p>A decentralized identity ecosystem like the SelfKey ecosystem can help Web3 users and platforms distinguish humans from bots. Users who verify their identity once will be able to use their verified identity across Web3 using NFTs backed by Soulbound NFT technology.</p>
<p>In this way, the SelfKey ecosystem can keep bots in check, allowing the technology to be used for its benefits, and giving peace of mind to users and platforms alike.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>The AI revolution is here, and like any other technological advancement that can help humanity, we will need to embrace it. However, the exploitation of AI for unfair advantages on new-age crypto and Web3 platforms needs to be kept in check to promote a more decentralized digital environment.</p>
<p>Recent internet history has shown that humans often <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-03/solana-polygon-are-among-blockchains-being-overrun-by-crypto-trading-bots">cannot successfully compete</a> with bots, as they are constantly active and evolving. This doesn’t mean that bots or AI are fundamentally bad technological advancements. In fact, in most cases, it’s quite the opposite: AI is and will play a more active part in our digital lives, performing countless functions that most humans would either be incapable of or unwilling to perform.</p>
<p>It is foolish to fear AI and attempt to arrest its growth. However, communities need to work on solutions to avoid exploits by bad actors who can wield the power of AI for unfair, biased, and centralized benefits. If we don’t, humans will soon be competing against AI bots seeking to skew decentralized systems in their creators’ favor.</p>
<p>A decentralized identity ecosystem like the SelfKey ecosystem can effectively allow human participants to verify their identity and use their verified identity across Web3. This solution does not sideline or ban the usage of AI but allows Web3 platforms to distinguish bots from humans.</p>
<p>AI technology will constantly evolve, which may one day make bots indistinguishable from humans. However, what defines us as humans is our identity. Using projects like SelfKey, we can use this unique attribute to distinguish ourselves on Web3.</p>
<p>It is imperative that Web3 adopts a decentralized human verification system, much like the SelfKey ecosystem, to fight against the potential threat of AI to the fundamental properties of decentralization and democracy that are embedded in Web3.</p>
<p>Identity verification using the SelfKey ecosystem can make AI and bots work for humans – not the other way.</p>

<p>Today we published Holochain Beta 0.1.0, an app-stable beta release, the next step of our Holochain Beta release sequence.<br><br>This is a major leap in the Holochain development roadmap, and it is one we have been diligently preparing since our first Release Candidate published in December.</p><p>Let’s walk through what this means.</p> What does app stability mean for devs? <p>Over the past years of development as a rapidly iterating project we have introduced new fixes, features, and optimization to our code. In our weekly Holochain alpha releases we have typically pushed new features, structural changes, fixes, and updates, many of which would break functionality in existing applications. App developers frequently had to change their app code to access the new fixes and features. Not an easy environment to develop a fully fledged app in.</p><blockquote>With Holochain Beta, the days of us regularly breaking your code are behind us.</blockquote><p>Now we will be updating a beta 0.1.0 branch of Holochain with non-breaking fixes and features for six months. So you know you won’t have to make changes to your app code to keep it running. We’ll also keep the 0.1.x-compatible bootstrap and proxy services running for that entire time, so people using your hApps will be able to find and connect with each other.</p> Holochain’s second security audit is complete <p><a href="https://leastauthority.com/security-consulting/published-audits/">Least Authority</a>, a respected security firm that focuses on decentralized tech recently completed another audit for Holochain. <a href="https://leastauthority.com/blog/audits/audit-of-holochain-lair-keystore/">Their first audit</a>, completed in December 2022, was of the Lair Keystore. In this second security audit, the Holochain Deterministic Integrity library was reviewed.</p><p>Holochain Deterministic Integrity (HDI) is a hApp developer’s interface with the Holochain framework’s consistency and security model and is crucial in allowing devs to write rules that ensure all nodes make the same conclusions and ultimately reach the same state. This required the auditors to go deep into Holochain itself, analyzing the assumptions embedded in the integrity engine and networking protocol.</p><p>Here is what the Least Authority team published today:</p><blockquote>“Our team performed a comprehensive design review and audit of the Holochain Deterministic Integrity (HDI) crate, a critical component of the Holochain system. Overall, we found the HDI crate to be highly modular and organized in a logical, compartmentalized manner.”</blockquote><p>The report identified one issue, related to a lack of up to date design specifications, which we resolved. If you’re interested to read the findings, <a href="https://leastauthority.com/security-consulting/published-audits/">the full report</a> is now available.</p> Dev tools coming soon <p>While Holochain Beta 0.1.0 is fully functional, we now need to update the multiple components and developer tools that are affected by the breaking changes introduced by Beta. We expect to have those complete by 9 February. Once that is announced you will be able to start building more easily and with the confidence that will come with our full, integrated dev stack!</p> Preview of new CLI scaffolding tool <p>In preparation for you being able to run stable apps, we’re making it much easier to build and maintain them. One of the new dev tools is a refreshed scaffolder built on feedback from the developer community. It’s useful for both new and experienced hApp devs, offering a command-line-driven process for rapidly creating boilerplate code. This isn’t just back-end DNA code, but also front-end client code (in vanilla, <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a>, <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>, and <a href="https://lit.dev/">Lit</a> flavors), tests, and a dev environment setup that keeps all your project dependencies in sync. It also supports custom templates, and we expect that the dev community will come up with all sorts of creative uses for this: templates that target that favorite front-end framework of yours, or NodeJS, or Electron or Rust; templates that bundle popular and maturing <a href="https://hrea.io/">hApp</a> <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/">libraries</a>; and more.</p><p>Eric Harris-Braun, Holochain co-creator and a prolific hApp developer himself, has this to say about the scaffolder:</p><blockquote>"For people who have been in the web app development world for a while, you might remember when Rails came out with its scaffolding, how much of a game changer that was for building Web2 apps—the way you could scaffold an app that runs in literally ten minutes. And what we’ve got coming out will be, I believe, just as powerful for Web3 apps. That gives developers a super powerful ability to just get started."</blockquote> What can you do now? <p>With Beta released now and dev tools targeted to be live by 9 February, we encourage you to start developing fully fledged apps on Holochain. We know that there are many projects who have come to love Holochain over the past years but have been waiting for a beta release before they put significant investment of effort into their app development. Now is the time. Let’s show the world what real Web3 apps look like.</p> Dev Training opportunity <p>Do you know Rust? In March we have a unique education opportunity led by the Co-founder of HackReactor. It is synchronous, <a href="https://www.holochain.org/holochain-developer-training-2/">online Holochain developer training</a>. Please apply!</p><p>If you’re not a developer consider sending folks to start building your developer team, or help us create direct hiring opportunities for our next crop of alumni. With a stable beta, now is the time to learn and grow with the ecosystem.</p> What’s next? <p>Three key pieces:</p>  We are working on an updated whitepaper, so you can read about the underlying logic behind the code. Keep an eye out for that.  The Holochain team is also already working towards a beta 0.2.0 with enhancements to network security and performance, along with any breaking API, SDK, or protocol changes that are discovered to be necessary or useful. This will be released and run alongside Beta 0.1.x, giving you time for comprehensive testing and migration without a loss of support.  We’ll also be updating the Dev Portal alongside the release of the components and dev tools to reflect these changes and provide an easy learning environment and knowledge base to help you build.

				  Verifiable credentials are a powerful solution for verifying data, but whose verifiable credentials are trustworthy in any given use case? Two solutions to this challenge—Trust Registries and Trust Lists— have emerged from two different organizations. We explain their strengths, weaknesses, and differences, the effort to unite these groups, and how you can get involved in developing both.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Mike Ebert</p>
<p>“How do we know which agents to trust?” is a problem you encounter quickly when creating a decentralized network (“agents” is the generic term for the software that issues, holds and presents, and verifies credentials; think of an “agent” acting on your behalf). Multiple organizations have come up with different answers to this challenge. Two of the most prominent are the Trust Over IP (ToIP) foundation with “Trust Registries,” and the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) with “Trust Lists.” Coordination of these efforts has begun; and, at some point in the future, joint and separate work will be defined and duplication will be eliminated in order to provide unified standards for sharing trust information. At the moment, there are some key differences to each organization’s approach.</p>
<p>Trust Registries</p>
<p>To date, a Trust Registry has referred to a solution for sharing trust information via an API: You call the API when you have a question about trust and it provides you with that information, usually one item at a time. Trust Registries also allow for a cached copy of the data when necessary. One strength of a Trust Registry is that it is likely to be up to date: as you are constantly asking questions of the API, you will receive updated data the API has found in real time. But one downside to implementing a Trust Registry based on an API is that it requires a relatively high level of expertise and commitment to develop, host, and maintain.</p>
<p>To use a dictionary as an analogy, you can almost think of a Trust Registry as a search tool for an online dictionary — if you want to know the definition of a specific word, you don’t need to read the entire dictionary to find it.</p>
<p>Trust List</p>
<p>A Trust List is usually described as a solution for sharing trust information through a file-based approach that doesn’t require the heavier support requirements of running or using an API. Being able to publish, retrieve, or load a single file requires less effort for developers than building and maintaining an API. Because copies of the governance file are stored with each software agent, trust data is cached with each one. How often you retrieve that file can be configured, so you might retrieve it once a day or once a month; but whatever the setting, you have caching built in. A huge benefit here is that, should you lose connection to the internet, you can still look up the data you need because it is all stored locally. The tradeoff is that caching can be tricky because you have to consider if your information is recent enough and deal with the possibility that information that has been cached differently by different parties.</p>
<p>To go back to our analogy: With a Trust List, you now have the dictionary in your pocket, so you may need to look through all the words, but you can get the definition of a word without needing an Internet connection.</p>
<p>With a good internet connection, the end user will likely not be able to tell the difference between a Trust Registry and a Trust List; problems may arise for the API-based approach when there is poor internet connection and similarly for a Trust List if cached information differs between downloaded files. Each approach has benefits and tradeoffs that ecosystem builders and developers will have to consider.</p>
<p>How do they come together?</p>
<p>Led by Indicio’s Sam Curren, representatives from both organizations met at the most recent Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) and, through discussion, realized that their goals have a significant overlap. This has led to collaboration on compatible solutions and to ensure minimal or no duplication of effort.</p>
<p>The new goal is a coordinated, agreed-upon data format for sharing trust information. By building on the same data formats, anyone who needs to bridge the gap between API or file based solutions should be able to do so without having to resolve fundamental differences in what is being communicated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio is working closely with both the DIF and the ToIP Trust Registry Task Force to help define this specification. Indicio also created an <a href="https://indicio.tech/governance-editor/">open-source governance file editor</a> and is working on open-source reference implementations for how to create, share, interpret, and follow a governance file. Both organizations are likely to stick to their API or file-based approaches as described above, but in providing reference code for delivering trust information in the same format, interoperability between both solutions should be much more achievable.</p>
<p>One useful task for the two organizations would be to agree on a single name, so that people are not confused by artificial distinctions between Trust Registries and Trust Lists. The real differences lie in how the trust information is delivered via an API or a file and not in the core purpose or format.</p>
<p>If you are interested in this conversation, I highly encourage you to get involved in the discussions that are taking place right now as they are shaping the technology. You can find out more information on the ToIP (Trust Registry) solution <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Registry+Task+Force">here,</a> and the DIF (Trust List) solution <a>here.</a></p>

  Digital credentials and self-sovereign identity have the potential to revolutionize the healthcare industry by providing a more secure and efficient way to store and share important health information.

<p>Digital credentials and self-sovereign identity have the potential to revolutionize the healthcare industry by providing a more secure and efficient way to store and share important health information. </p><p>A digital credential (such as the W3C Verifiable Credential) is a tamper-proof, cryptographically secure form of a machine-readable credential. For example, it might be a digital version of your SSN, your passport, or even a concert ticket. Your health records–immunizations, diagnoses for medical conditions, allergies, clinical vitals, lab results, prescriptions, and other health data–can also be represented as verifiable credentials, and therefore, owned and managed by patients themselves.</p><p>In this blog post, we'll explore the benefits of using digital credentials in the healthcare industry, including protecting sensitive health data from data breaches, improving patient care with more complete records, and reducing administrative burdens.</p><p>Protecting from Data Breaches<br>Verifiable credentials can secure health data from cyber threats, such as ransomware and data breaches. Health data is often stored in large centralized databases, which are increasingly vulnerable to these threats. With verifiable credentials, it is possible to decentralize the storage of health data to be accessed only by authorized individuals, which greatly reduces the risk of data breaches. This architecture can transform a centralized honeypot–a single point of failure–into a decentralized network supported with multiple points of resiliency and backups to meet high assurance requirements.</p><p><a href="https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf">The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights</a> tracks all breaches of unsecured protected health information affecting 500 or more individuals, as required by section 13402(e)(4) of the HITECH Act. In 2021, there were over 27 million individuals affected by healthcare data breaches. In 2022, reported cases indicate over 48 million individuals affected by breaches, an increase of over 177% since the previous year. </p><p>The total number of incidents has also dramatically increased, with 601 breach incidents reported in 2022, a 226% increase from the 266 breaches reported in 2021. Breaches reported can result from hacking/IT incidents, theft, loss of records, or unauthorized access/disclosures. In most of these scenarios, wrongful access is granted to sensitive health records, either due to human errors, system errors, or lack of security controls. Currently, the individuals whose data is stored in these records are required to trust their healthcare providers and others who handle their sensitive data to have adequate systems in place to prevent unauthorized disclosures or loss of data.</p>An example architectural shift enabled by digital credentials eliminating a central database as the single point of failure.<p>In a new health records system, powered by verifiable credentials, patients would control disclosures and access to their data. Healthcare providers, pharmacies, or insurance companies would be granted access whenever required, but would not need to store a “honeypot” of sensitive health data on their internal servers, nor would they be able to share with any other third parties (either intentionally or unintentionally).</p><p>Better Care through Complete Records<br>Another key benefit of verifiable credentials in healthcare is that they enable patients to control and manage their own health data. Patients can create a portable, secure record of their health information that they can access and share with healthcare providers, insurance companies, and family members as needed. According to the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/nlsoy.pdf">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, individuals hold an average of 12.4 different jobs between the age of 18 to 54. With each new job, the employer-sponsored health insurance provider may change, which requires the individual to find and establish new, in-network primary care. It becomes increasingly more difficult to piece together health history records with each new doctor’s office visit, primary care physician, specialty doctor, and same-day care facility. </p><p>Let’s use Alice as an example. Alice is an early 30s young professional who grew up in Florida and now lives in New York. As a child and teenager, Alice saw the same doctor every year for her annual checkups and regular vaccinations. After graduating from high school, she moved to California to attend university and enrolled in the student health insurance plan. She had a vague, but imprecise recollection of receiving different vaccines and, as a result, had to request records be sent from her family doctor in Florida to the university health office. Her new health records covering the care administered for her four years of university are stored in her student profile for the university health system. </p><p>After graduating from university, Alice moves to New York to pursue a career in finance. Her health insurance is now provided by the bank she works for, and Alice needs to find a doctor in New York in that health insurance network. She is no longer a student, so she’s lost access to her university student health portal and has to call the university health office to request that her health records be faxed to the new doctor. She also has to contact her family doctor in Florida to fax records to her new doctor, which can take a few days or even weeks. Between the ages of 22 to 32, Alice changes jobs four times, staying at each job for between two to three years. For each new job, Alice has new health insurance coverage, which requires finding new in-network doctors and repeating the process of requesting her health records over and over again.</p><p>Compared to average American workers, Alice is not a unique, fictional character. According to the <a href="https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/total-population/?dataView=1&amp;currentTimeframe=0&amp;selectedDistributions=employer&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D">Kaiser Family Foundation</a>, 49% of Americans, or 156 million people, receive health insurance coverage through their employer. Insights from the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/tenure.pdf">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> show that the average worker tenure for employees aged 25 to 34 is 2.8 years. This means that 156 million people might be faced with establishing new in-network care every 2.8 years as they switch employers and, subsequently, employer-provided health insurance coverage. This results in spotty health records with incomplete care history. </p><p>Alice’s ability to establish care would be simplified dramatically with verifiable credentials allowing her to manage her own health records. Each time Alice needs to visit a new primary care physician, get a routine vaccine, or visit urgent care, it would be a simple, seamless process to share relevant health records and receive new records to store or share in the future. Alice would have a more complete, accurate picture of her health history to help any new doctor, either for routine care or emergency situations, and have all the context required to make informed recommendations for care plans. Medical records currently are often fragmented and incomplete, which can make it difficult for healthcare providers to diagnose and treat patients effectively. Applying self-sovereign identity within healthcare will empower patients to create a comprehensive record of their medical history that can be accessed by healthcare providers, allowing for better diagnosis and care.</p><p>Lowering Healthcare Administrative Costs<br>In addition to the benefits mentioned above, verifiable credentials can also help to reduce administrative burdens and overhead costs for healthcare providers. A study by the American Medical Association and Dartmouth-Hitchcock health system published in the <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M16-0961?articleid=2546704">Annals of Internal Medicine</a> found that physicians only spend 27% of their office day on direct, patient-facing care time, with 49% of their day spent on electronic health records and administrative paperwork.</p><blockquote>“This study reveals what many physicians are feeling – data entry and administrative tasks are cutting into the doctor-patient time that is central to medicine and a primary reason many of us became physicians,” <a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/news/news/2016/2016-09-06-ama-study-technological-administrative-demands.page">said</a> Steven Stack, M.D, Past-President of the American Medical Association. </blockquote><p>With current systems, healthcare providers must spend a significant amount of time and resources verifying the authenticity of health records and other information, requesting health record transfers from previous care providers, and facilitating health record transfers between patients and insurance companies. Verifiable credentials make this process much more efficient, as the credentials can be easily verified using cryptographic algorithms, and, being fully controlled by the patient, accessed quickly on a need-to-know basis. </p><p>This future state with verifiable credentials powering health records wouldn’t completely eliminate the administrative overhead related to record-keeping, but it would streamline the processes with standardized formats that are easily verified. This can help to free up time and resources that can be used to provide better patient care, while also lowering overhead costs for healthcare providers–including fees paid to cloud service providers</p><p>—</p><p>Digital credentials have the potential to significantly improve the healthcare industry by providing a secure and efficient way to store and share important health information. They enable patients to control their own health data, create a full medical history, and protect sensitive health information from cyber threats. As the use of verifiable credentials continues to grow, we can expect to see many more applications of this technology in the healthcare industry. </p><p>Healthcare is just one example–virtually every industry that relies on data storage and record-keeping can be supercharged with verifiable credentials and similar technologies. Watch this space as we explore use cases across different industries.</p> <p>About Spruce: Spruce is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

			  Laurie Cappelle is a Digital Marketing Intern at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p>Hello everyone, I am Laurie, and I am 23 years old. I was born in the north of France, close to Lille, where I have studied almost all my life, but I have always loved traveling, so I finished studying in Italy, and Spain. I am now living in Granada, Spain, and I love the city. During my free time I love to go to hike, take pictures and spend time on social media. </p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>After having studied business administration, I realized that what I really liked was marketing, so I decided to do a master in marketing. When I saw that a position was available at Tokeny, I immediately thought that it would be a good opportunity for me. Effectively, I would help in all the domains of marketing and would learn a lot of things. Moreover, even though I did not know much about blockchain and tokenization, I always thought that it was interesting. </p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>Working at Tokeny is fascinating, I am learning new things every day, as well about marketing as about the blockchain and tokenization world. Moreover, all the colleagues are really nice and helpful, they are always here to help if we need it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, it is a pleasure to see that the company is doing its best to be flexible and for us to feel good at work, and we have colleagues coming from all over the world. </p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>My passion is traveling. I love discovering new cultures, languages, food, landscapes, and cities. I also really enjoy taking pictures and sharing them on social media.</p>
<p>Moreover, I like learning languages. I speak fluent French, Spanish and English, a bit of Italian, and I am learning Russian.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really appreciate learning new things and, since I started working at Tokeny, I have been discovering the blockchain universe and the potential it has into the financial world.&nbsp;</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>I just want to be happy, having the people that I love close to me and traveling to the most places possible. I think that everyone should be able to have a happy life living where they want to live and working of something they like. </p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>I see that Tokeny is growing very fast and that the tokenization sector is only at its beginning. I believe that Tokeny has a bright future and will help to revolutionize the banking sector, and I am glad to do my internship here. </p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p><p>Identity and Authentication</p>
<p>Digital transformation can be defined as a process that organizations go through to deliver digital services to their customers and consumers in the Digital Age. Essentially, delivering digital services requires the management of the digital identities of consumers, customers, and business partners in a secure and seamless manner. Therefore, the success of digital transformation initiatives depends on managing access and managing these digital identities.</p>
<p>In contrast to the increased centralization of digital identity, the authentication layer has become more complex and fragmented. However, it's important to understand the difference between identity and authentication before we get into passwordless authentication. Identity is who you are. Identity proofing is about knowing whether someone is who he or she claims to be. It's the process of verifying the identity of users based on life history, biometrics, and other factors before granting them access to an application or system.</p>
<p>On the other hand, authentication is an ongoing identity-proofing process that ensures both the identity of digital users and the integrity of their devices. Nevertheless, disruptive login experiences and the continued reliance on passwords are creating significant challenges for consumers and enterprises. As a result, organizations are starting to adopt new authentication mechanisms that go beyond the traditional username and password. This passwordless approach leverages public-key encryption and open standards to offer greater flexibility and increase both security and convenience.</p>
<p>The Birth of Passwordless</p>
<p>In today's digital world, identity theft and credential-based attacks are some of the most pressing concerns for companies and consumers alike. For years, the use of passwords as the primary method of authentication has made identity a nuisance in the digital world. Since data breaches are often the result of stolen credentials and compromised passwords, organizations are looking to adopt more modern forms of authentication that can help close the security gaps that are associated with the use of passwords.</p>
<p>As a result of the security risks and inconvenience of passwords, businesses and organizations are starting to embrace passwordless authentication technologies. The evolution of passwordless was driven by the adoption of multi-factor authentication (MFA) and Single sign-on (SSO). The combination of these two technologies, coupled with the exponential growth in smartphone use and the development of open standards such as FIDO2 and WebAuthn has further generated adoption of passwordless systems.</p>
<p>Legacy MFA solutions were supposed to solve the problem with passwords, but these still rely on the password as a backup or first factor of authentication. MFA requires users to provide two or more factors in order to be authenticated: something they are, something they have, and something they know. Unfortunately, some of these factors are prone to phishing attacks, such as mobile SMS codes, voice calls, push notifications, and one-time passcodes (OTP).</p>
<p>SSO is an authentication method that allows a user to enter one set of login credentials (such as name and password) in order to access multiple applications. With an SSO mechanism in place, users only need to authenticate themselves once regardless of which applications or websites they access. While SSO can be paired with password-based authentication, integrating it with passwordless access is the key to unlocking its full potential.</p>
<p>Separating Authentication from Identity</p>
<p>Organizations must choose between adopting a single identity platform or maintaining multiple fragmented identity systems as they move to the cloud. The separation of authentication from identity providers is being implemented by businesses and organizations in order to fully leverage passwordless technologies. It is important for passwordless technologies to have a passwordless authentication layer in front of the various access management systems.</p>
<p>Passwordless authentication should work across everything –all attack surfaces and identity sources, apps and devices, the VPN, SSO, Azure AD, operating systems, workspaces, servers, and whatever your organization has in place. Some solutions in the market are using passwordless at the device, and then federating to other access management services or directly into applications.</p>
<p>Separating identity and authentication is a very important thing. If implemented successfully, organizations will provide their users with a frictionless user experience and a consistent authentication approach. In addition, IT teams will no longer be overburdened with managing multiple identity and MFA products. Thus, fully leveraging the potential of passwordless technologies.</p>

<p>There is a classic juxtaposition within security controls. Organizations need to make data and services available, but if it’s too easily accessible, too open, then a data breach can occur. On the other hand, if data and services are too restricted then the controls are marginalized and ignored. Organizations struggle with balancing the risk between easy access and advanced controls. Whichever approach is taken impacts the user experience, and both can lead to less than desirable results if done poorly.</p>
<p>I’ve asked many IT professionals if they consider the end user when implementing a new security protocol. Surprisingly the answer is often, they don’t. The reasoning for my question is simple. If you know more about the users being asked to perform the task, the task can be implemented with less friction.</p>
<p>Friction, or the user experience, is a critical consideration to security. To achieve the desired security outcome, IT organizations must understand and develop with their customers’ motivations and behaviors in mind. In doing so, the intended ask will be met with less resistance and higher adoption, therefore improving overall security.</p>
 Why SSO Is Still A Must 
<p>Let’s clarify with something first – SSO is still a must in an enterprise infrastructure stack.</p>
<p>An end user will not type in their credentials for every access point. But, SSO in its current form and with 2FA or MFA as part of the access flow does not meet Zero Trust standards. And this construct ties back into what I started with above. Organizations need to balance the risk between easy access and advanced controls.</p>
<p>Zero Trust is a proactive security approach that continuously verifies users, devices, and services before trusting them. This approach is commonly summarized as “never trust, always verify”. Essentially, Zero Trust assumes that anything connecting to a system is a potential threat that should be verified before earning trust. But to do that security teams need to know as much about the identity accessing the resources as possible. Without this fundamental knowledge of identity, security is more hope-based than fact-based and impacts the effectiveness of a Zero Trust architecture.</p>
<p>On its own, the Zero Trust sounds like it will cause friction at the time of user access, a poor user experience. But that doesn’t have to be the case. Many of the access types that are in existence are here because the end users are creating poor passwords. These passwords can be hacked or even phished. So the transition to a Zero Trust architecture can be an opportunity for organizations to improve the user experience and implement technologies that improve security and improve user experience at the same time.</p>
<p>How can that be done? With Identity. What does identity have to do with Zero Trust architecture? It’s a pillar of the Zero Trust architecture because when you verify user identity at each point of access, you proactively verify users before a breach can happen. This is in line with the “never trust, always verify” core principle of Zero Trust. But to securely authenticate a user, one must first implement an indisputable identity proofing process. Because an indisputable proofed ID must involve the triangulation of a user claim with biometrics. Implementing this element of identity management will ensure that every access attempt is tied to a trusted and verified identity.</p>
<p>The result is a secure access infrastructure that is based on verified identities tied to the user’s biometrics. So instead of using passwords and trying to secure them with additional authentication methods, the user’s identity becomes the access method.</p>
 1Kosmos Supports Zero Trust and a Better User Experience 
<p>The 1Kosmos BlockID platform ensures that individuals are who they claim to be by using an identity-based approach to authentication. We bring identity into the security forefront so that organizations implementing a Zero Trust infrastructure know with certainty who is accessing IT assets and online services.</p>
<p>This means we have a quick and convenient way for users to self verify their identity using government, telco, and banking credentials. Then, once verified, workers, citizens, and customers use their digital identity to be utilized at login or transaction approval. This identity pre proofing injects a level of trust into the Zero Trust implementation and provides users with a frictionless experience. Organizations will implement their Zero Trust deployment with a significantly improved access user experience and high level of identity assurance for the identity on the other side of the digital connection.</p>

 What’s your name and where are you&nbsp;from? <p>My name is Dixit and I am from New Delhi,&nbsp;India.</p> Tell us a bit about yourself. <p>I am a blockchain enthusiast and also a web developer. Outside of tech and development, I also have a good experience working in marketing and communications.</p> What kind of work do you do on a day-to-day basis? <p>I am the community manager for Ontology, India and I joined in December 2021. I communicate with the Indian community members and provide them with updates in Hindi Language. I also manage the Ontology, India Twitter account. I find this is an interesting activity because it allows me to interact directly with Ontology’s close-knit Indian community.</p> In your opinion, what makes Ontology stand out from other blockchains? <p>I think the fact that Ontology has been growing continuously for 5 years now is what makes it stand out from other blockchains. This shows that the team is focused on continuous innovation and is here for the long term, which is particularly important during challenging market conditions such as those we’re currently facing.</p> What is the most exciting part of the project you’re working on for Ontology? <p>I’m really impressed by the ONT and ONG token models. Both models have separate functionalities but they still work together in harmony. The low gas fees and flexible API also attract users — so I see huge value in those elements of Ontology&nbsp;too.</p> What has been the most important moment in your career so&nbsp;far? <p>The most important moment for my career so far was taking the time to really understand Ethereum in 2016. Despite being involved in Bitcoin since 2014, my ideas in the space were limited to scalability infrastructure or payment systems for Bitcoin. After truly understanding how smart contracts worked, however, my mind was opened to all the possibilities of financial and non-financial systems that could be fully run on a blockchain.</p> What are you most excited for in your future at Ontology? <p>Coming into the cryptocurrency world was the best move I made and worked for. The past few years have been life changing for me, thanks to blockchain.</p> Follow us on social&nbsp;media! <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/meet-the-team-ontologys-community-manager-for-india-dixit-bb4ae1db5161">Meet the Team: Ontology’s Community Manager for India, Dixit</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

The UN Forum sessions are not recorded, so I thought I would just capture the main points in this&nbsp;article.</p><p>The essential part of my presentation was a live demo, building a supply chain knowledge graph from the bottom up. In doing so, I gradually introduced the full tech stack in&nbsp;play:</p>  The essentials of APIs, JSON and JSON&nbsp;Schema  Adding semantics with JSON Linked&nbsp;Data  Building Knowledge Graphs from LD&nbsp;files  The important role of standardized Web Vocabularies  <p>I typically also talk about Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers. But not this time — this is all about UN semantics and data&nbsp;graphs.</p> Introducing The UN/CEFACT Web Vocabulary <p>The UN/CEFACT Buy-Ship-Pay model is the undisputed semantic model for terms in global trade. It has been around for decades, and is broadly recognized, adopted and implemented.</p><p>UN/CEFACT Web Vocabulary brings this model to the web, expressing the existing trade terms as a library of so-called Unique Resource Identifiers — URIs.</p><a href="https://vocabulary.uncefact.org/">https://vocabulary.uncefact.org/</a><p>The above example shows the definition of the term Trade Party, behind the URI <a href="https://vocabulary.uncefact.org/TradeParty">https://vocabulary.uncefact.org/TradeParty</a>. The URI itself is great for unambiguously express intent; resolving it to the above documentation page makes it human understandable too.</p><p>We will come back to the UN/CEFACT Web Vocabulary shortly and why it matters. But for proper context, we will start a couple of layer down the tech stack, level-setting on some API essentials.</p> APIs, JSON and JSON&nbsp;Schema <p>Since you are reading this, there is a pretty good chance that you have heard of APIs&nbsp;before.</p><p>An API is a way for computer systems to communicate over HTTP. It is the same protocol serving you this article right now, an API is just tailored to be invoked by computers instead of humans. This is done by stripping away all the graphical elements and putting more emphasis on the structure of&nbsp;data.</p> JSON Schema, Defining&nbsp;Data <p>APIs are made up of “endpoints”, each of which can define a data structure for what you sent to it (the request)&nbsp;, and another data structure for what you can expect to get back (the response). A definition of such a data structure is called a schema. Typically, data gets encoded in the JSON syntax, so you can think of an API endpoint consisting of a Request JSON Schema and a Response JSON&nbsp;Schema.</p>The Request and Response JSON Schemas of a sample&nbsp;API.<p>Each JSON Schema defines for example hierarchical structures and naming of attributes. Note that a JSON Schema does not contain data — only how data must be structured.</p> JSON, the Actual&nbsp;Data <p>JSON files carry actual data. JSON is just a file format, much like&nbsp;.doc or&nbsp;.txt. A JSON file can be validated against a JSON Schema — this is how an API controls what data gets exchanged.</p><p>While JSON is designed for data transfers, it is also quite readable by&nbsp;humans:</p> {<br>  "id": "https://sales.online-shop.global/inv/0000112318",<br>  "type": "TradeTransaction",<br>  "applicableTradeSettlement": {<br>    "type": "HeaderTradeSettlement",<br>    "invoiceDocument": {<br>      "id": "urn:uuid:9c3c66a6-f49f-485e-a7b2-013fb4a0e0a8",<br>      "type": "Document"<br>    },<br>    "invoicerParty": {<br>      "id": "did:web:online-shop.global",<br>      "type": "TradeParty",<br>      "postalAddress": {<br>        "type": "TradeAddress",<br>        "attentionOf": "Nis",<br>        "streetName": "Runebergs Alle",<br>        "cityName": "Copenhagen",<br>        "countryName": "Denmark"<br>      }<br>    },<br>    "invoiceeParty": {<br>      "type": "TradeParty",<br>      "postalAddress": {<br>        "type": "TradeAddress",<br>        "streetName": "Sunshine Ave",<br>        "cityName": "Austin",<br>        "countrySubDivisionName": "Texas",<br>        "countryName": "USA"<br>      }<br>    }<br>  }<br>} <p>Unless you have a severe case of code-allergy, you should intuitively get the gist of this JSON file: “Trade Transaction”, “Invoicer Party” and “Invoicee Party” — this is a something about an&nbsp;invoice.</p><p>If you know UN/CEFACT you might even recognize the exact terms used. Trade Transaction, for example, means something very specific to those who “speak the UN/CEFACT language”. Such a common language helps the developer on the receiving side interpret the data according to the sender’s intention.</p><p>While such a “common language” is much better than nothing, the human interpretation aspect entails certain challenges:</p>  Costly, as developers must make data mappings on “both sides” of the&nbsp;API.  Error prone, because all human involvement is, even assuming alignment to a common specification is established.  Does not scale, if you have 10 customers using your API, they must each have a developer team doing data mapping 10 times&nbsp;over.  API breaking, a live API cannot just be changed to align to UN/CEFACT will without breaking the API contract (JSON Schemas), greatly displeasing your customers.  <p>While many organization accept these shortfalls of working with raw JSON, there is a much smarter way,&nbsp;namely…</p> JSON Linked&nbsp;Data <p>What traditional integration developers do is add the context needed for the target computer to work with the data. JSON-LD allows the sender to add this context. Literally, using a keyword called @context. The context maps the “human friendly” terms used in the JSON to “machine friendly” URIs.</p><p>In non-technical terms: when the sender is more explicit, it is less ambiguous for the receiver to understand the&nbsp;message.</p><p>Adding context switches from “encode once, interpret anywhere” to “interpret once, understand everywhere” which is great for scalability economics.</p><p>Even better: adding a line with the@context definition into your JSON doesn’t even break your existing APIs! If the receiver does not have JSON-LD support, the JSON library will just ignore this attribute.</p><p>As an example, the invoiceDocument attribute in the earlier example really isn’t anything but a string. But the @context maps this to a computer-friendly URI such as <a href="https://vocabulary.uncefact.org/invoiceDocument,">https://vocabulary.uncefact.org/invoiceDocument</a>.</p><p>The example below was the first live demo of my presentation. It shows how adding just the@context lets the Linked Data processor automatically structure the&nbsp;data.</p>Adding an @context statement to the JSON (left) makes the data processable by a computer&nbsp;(right).<p>To recap: with very little effort, we can add precise semantics to our data. We make the data meaningful. Our next step will be to turn that meaning into knowledge.</p> Knowledge Graphs <p>The JSON-LD processing we just saw above actually picks apart the JSON, turning it into individual basic statements. Each statement is called a triple, because the consists of three things: subject, predicate and&nbsp;object.</p><p>For example: “The consignment’s (subject) consignor (predicate) is a business called Global Online Shop (object)”.</p><p>Another triple could be “Global Online Shop’s location is the UN/LOCODE DKCPH”.</p><p>We can piece together these two statements: Consignment — Global Online Shop — DKCPH. This way we can infer that the consignment is going to Copenhagen. The JSON-LD file is actually a data graph, which we are traversing for insights.</p>How a sample Bill of Lading data snippet turns into a data graph with&nbsp;JSON-LD.<p>The above diagram illustrates the data graph aspects of a Bill of Lading document which could be transferred through any standard API. But because JSON-LD is based on URIs (and not vague strings like “a business called Global Online Shop”), the graph does not have to be limited to just one JSON file. Say we have another API which deals with invoices, and we route inbound messages to a graph database. A graph database can recognize common URIs and easily deal with overlapping graph segments. This way, we can continuously piece together larger and deeper data&nbsp;graphs.</p>Data graphs from two separate JSON-LD files “snap together”.<p>The above example is also derived from my live demo. By importing a Commercial Invoice “on top of” the previously imported Bill of Lading, we realize&nbsp;that:</p>  The consignee of one document is the same organization as the invoicer party of the&nbsp;other.  We expanded the common knowledge of this organization, now knowing both its postal address and UNLOCODE.  <p>We did this with literally no manual data mapping. The knowledge graph just “snaps”into place like&nbsp;magnets.</p>A knowledge graph constructed from very large amounts of JSON-LD files. Pretty-looking knowledge graph on the right curtesy of https://medium.com/@annalienk/investigation-of-the-flow-of-tweets-d0b1c31d915b.<p>This means we can dump massive amounts of JSON-LD files at the graph database. Data can come from different origins, APIs, data schemas, etc — it will all still snap together automatically. A key feature of graph databases is their ability to reveal hidden relationships across siloed&nbsp;data.</p> Extracting Knowledge <p>Not having to worry about the hassle of fitting data together, we can focus our efforts on data analysis. We can do this with standard data queries. For example “return all consignments to be delivered in Denmark”.</p><p>In my final demo at the UN/CEFACT Forum I it took it a step further, though, introducing some basic data science tooling. This means applying graph algorithms and machine learning on the data graph’s explicit relationships, in the search for its implicit relationships. I used Neo4j’s Graph Data Science which offers rich library of such features.</p><p>Specifically, I ran the Betweenness Centrality graph algorithm on the knowledge graph we created earlier, build from a Bill of Lading and a Commercial Invoice. The result is illustrated graphically below:</p>Betweenness Centrality algorithm applied on the previous&nbsp;example.<p>This result reveals how often shortest paths between nodes pass through a given each node. Unsurprisingly, the “Global Online Shop” node scores high — remember, this was the node which connected the two subgraphs.</p><p>Data scientists typically connect multiple graph algorithms in their search for patterns. Here are links to a couple of examples which I have shared in earlier articles:</p>Determining untrusted subgraphs of the UN Trust&nbsp;Graph.<p>Determination of Verifiable Credential data originating from untrusted subgraphs, based on the UN Trust Graph concept:<br><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/the-united-nations-trust-graph-d65af7b0b678">https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/the-united-nations-trust-graph-d65af7b0b678</a></p>Trade Party Community Detection.<p>Trade Party Community Detection, determined from running a series of graph algorithms on basic verifiable credential issuance patterns: <br><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/neo4j-graph-data-science-with-verifiable-credential-data-98b806f2ad78">https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/neo4j-graph-data-science-with-verifiable-credential-data-98b806f2ad78</a></p> Semantics is Everything <p>We have now gone through the whole tech stack and at the same time progressed from Data to Meaning to Knowledge.</p><p>Without semantic context, raw data is meaningless. Traditional APIs depend on human intuition and labor to make sense of data. But we have seen how simple it is instead to add an explicit, declarative context and let computers do all the hard&nbsp;work.</p><p>When meaning is automated, we can be much more flexible with our data sources yet still shift our attention to gaining knowledge. With all those previously disparate datasets now connected, by leveraging modern algorithms we can extend our knowledge into the implicit relationships, answering questions we would have never thought to&nbsp;ask.</p><p>Web vocabularies provide the common definition of meaning, and strong web vocabularies are vital to this new infrastructure. The best web vocabularies are governed by authoritative institutions, which are relevant for the domain they define. This way, they gain gravitational critical mass and become not only formal, but also de-facto standards.</p><p>Lending from UN/CEFACT’s decades-long established authority, the UN/CEFACT Web Vocabulary is the undisputed global semantic dictionary for terms in&nbsp;trade.</p><p><a href="https://vocabulary.uncefact.org/">https://vocabulary.uncefact.org/</a></p>UN/CEFACT, now available as Linked&nbsp;Data<p><a href="https://medium.com/@nis.jespersen">Nis Jespersen</a>, Transmute’s Solutions Architect, is editor of the United Nations CEFACT JSON-LD Web Vocabulary project.</p><p>Connect with Nis on<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nis-jespersen/"> LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/nissimsan">Twitter</a>, &amp;&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/nissimsan">GitHub</a></p><p>About<a href="https://transmute.industries/"> Transmute</a>: Building on the security and freedom that Web3 promised, Transmute provides all the benefits of decentralization to enterprise teams seeking a cost effective, interoperable, planet-forward experience provided by experts in technology and industry.</p><p>Transmute was founded in 2017, graduated from TechStars Austin in 2018, and is based in sunny Austin, Texas.

<p>Have you received a new payment card either in the mail or from a branch recently? You may have noticed that many financial institutions are transitioning away from using embossing machines for personalization, and toward flat card technology. Is now the right time for your institution to make the move to flat cards? As we enter a new era for consumer payments, reimagining your card design can maximize efficiency and brand impact to give you a competitive edge.</p>
<p>Review your fleet for maximum efficiency</p>
<p>To fully understand your efficiency, it’s important to evaluate the total cost of ownership, or TCO. TCO is an estimation of all the cumulative expenses associated with purchasing and operating a product. The TCO will provide a way to measure how efficient your current operations are and where you can lift the efficacy of your current technology to outperform what was done previously.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With inflation still high and supply-chain, logistical, and <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/09/emv-chip-shortages-putting-a-strain-on-your-bottom-line-increasing-the-durability-of-the-payment-cards-you-offer-might-help/">EMV chip shortage</a> challenges persisting, now is an ideal time to make the move to flat cards for your efficiency and brand. Does your current setup prepare you for your continued success in the time of flat card innovation? Are you considering eco-friendliness and durability before you make your next big purchase? Are you taking full advantage of your cards from a branding and personalization perspective? If you are curious about answers to these questions, you are at the right place. Let’s start reviewing what to consider for your financial institution.</p>
 
 Review your total cost of ownership and identify where you can improve your efficiency. Is your system supported by best-in-class standards for hardware, software, and service? How efficient and durable are your system and its supplies? Find your best possible option in the market to elevate your operations. 
 Take control of your future by starting out with the right solution. Does your solution support modularity to enable future development and innovation into your current fleet? Making the right first choice helps you establish a better fleet, and you don’t have to start all over when there is a new technology in the market. 
 Consider eco-friendliness for your overall operations. Is your current system enhancing durability of your card compared to the industry standard? By reducing waste and minimizing environmental impact from your operation, you will lead the eco-conversation that brings positive brand impact to your business. 
 
<p>Lift your brand impact with flat card printing</p>
<p>Flat card printing enables card layout flexibility by supporting frontside, backside, horizontal, and vertical orientations and provides more real estate for branding and creativity. Now you don’t need to worry about how your card design will look after applying the protective topcoats. Unique and eye-catching payment cards have a stronger chance of being elevated to the top of the consumer’s wallet.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Entrust is exhibiting at this year’s <a href="https://www.iotsworldcongress.com/">IoT Solutions World Congress</a> in Barcelona at the end of January, and I’m proud to be part of a new initiative Entrust is undertaking at the event we’re calling “Demo for a donation.”</p>
<p>A standard part of all events like this is the ‘swag’ offered by all the exhibitors. But with the event theme of “Game Changing,” we got to thinking that instead of little branded tchotchkes like pens, stress balls or socks, we want to change the game by donating to charities that focus on kids in tech.</p>
<p>Together with our exhibition partner Device Authority, we are contributing to the education and development of young minds in the digital world, the young people who&nbsp;will one day&nbsp;“change the game”&nbsp;in the world of cyber security.</p>
<p>If you’re attending the event, helping us to achieve this aim couldn’t be simpler:</p>
 
 Drop by booth D441 in Hall 4 and chat with an Entrust or Device Authority expert 
 For every badge scanned Entrust will donate $10 to your choice of one of three charities 
 You will receive a thank you card confirming the donation 
 
<p>The three charities we have selected are as follows:</p>
 
 <a href="https://everychildonline.co.uk/">Every Child Online</a>– a UK-based charity that provides refurbished PCs, laptops and tablets to underprivileged children for free. The charity’s goal is to help close the digital divide and improve the quality of digital education offered in schools. 
 <a href="https://code.org/">CODE</a>– a US-based charity, it is an education innovation non-profit dedicated to the vision that every student in every school has the opportunity to learn computer science as part of their core K-12 education. 
 <a href="https://www.technovation.org/about/">Technovation Girls</a> – a global charity that equips young women to become tech entrepreneurs and leaders. With the support of volunteer mentors and parents, girls work in teams to code mobile apps that address real-world problems. 
 
<p>I’ll also be presenting together with an expert from Device Authority at two sessions during the show on the topics of <a href="https://www.iotsworldcongress.com/agenda/zero-trust-security-in-the-connected-supply-chain/">Zero Trust Security in the Connected Supply Chain </a>and <a href="https://www.iotsworldcongress.com/agenda/the-challenges-and-considerations-of-preparing-iot-for-pq/">The Challenges and Considerations of Preparing IoT for PQ</a>. They’re both hot topics of discussion, so if either (or both) of those sound of interest, come by and check them out, I’d love to know if you have any questions.</p>
<p>As well as feeling good about helping support one of these fantastic charities, you can also get a pick me up in the form of a candy treat from our “Sugar bar,” so be sure to stop by the Entrust/Device Authority booth and speak to one of our experts.</p>

<p>IDENTOS’ latest FPX version, FPX Vale, features user-led delegation, enriched administrative capabilities, and more </p>
<p><a href="https://www.identos.com/">IDENTOS Inc.</a>, a leader in digital identity and access management, launched the latest Federated Privacy Exchange (FPX) version of its identity and authorization software API offering as a strong kick-off to 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FPX Vale version builds on the company’s previous <a href="https://developer.identos.com/docs/fpx-overview/">FPX version</a> (<a href="https://www.identos.com/2022/09/07/identos-puts-developers-first-in-its-latest-product-release/">FPX Junction</a>), a cloud-based software product that provides fine-grained API authorization and user-centric identity management capabilities. Enabled by and extending <a href="https://kantara.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/uma/overview">User-Managed Access (UMA) 2.0</a>, FPX allows users to safely share their information with trusted digital service partners. This facilitates the efficient flow of data between users and applications benefiting all parties.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are proud to release our latest version, FPX Vale. As identity sits at the root of all digital experiences, we are continually pushing the user-centric experience while keeping security and privacy at the heart of everything. We’re thrilled to empower our customers with added flexibility to execute on use cases that are critical today and in the future.” &nbsp;– Alec Laws, Chief Technology Officer, IDENTOS</p></blockquote>
<p>The highly anticipated FPX Vale version incorporates several capabilities, including User-to-User delegation and new API functions, enabling improved administrative flexibility, user convenience, security, and privacy – critical to sharing personal and sensitive data across digital healthcare, financial, and government services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FPX Vale key capabilities</p>
<p>-User-to-User delegation at the wallet – FPX Vale now allows a <a href="https://developer.identos.com/docs/fpx-components/wallet/user-to-user-delegation/">user to delegate</a> access to another user over certain functions, including consent to share personal information on their behalf. The ability to provide authority over sharing personal information is critically required in healthcare, legal and financial settings where a child, senior, or individual may need the support of their family or trusted party to assume their role in a critical scenario. With FPX Vale, individuals can do so without sharing passwords and avoid compromising security. Moreover, determining connection timeframes and revoking access at any time enables many privacy outcomes.</p>
<p>-New Admin API to configure Resource Server Adapter (RSA) – Resource Server Adapter minimizes data source onboarding effort through pre-integration to other FPX components and configurable extension points for data and API integrations. FPX Vale offers administrative flexibility and ease of use.</p>
<p>-New Disable API – FPX Vale allows for entities within the FPX network to now be disabled, using the new Disable API, allowing system administrators to quickly cut-off access to any resource protected by FPX. This provides the administrators complete lifecycle management of ecosystem partners and services.</p>
<p>Availability<br>
IDENTOS’ FPX Vale updates are available today to new and existing customers.</p>

<p>The new <a href="https://www.kilt.io/">KILT website</a> introduces a way to get a KILT DID (decentralized identifier) without using cryptocurrency. This allows users to have their DID — a “digital fingerprint” at the core of their decentralized digital identity — anchored on the blockchain where no one else can ever delete it. DIDs also provide access to the full range of KILT’s identity solutions.</p><p>In the physical world, identity starts with your face or fingerprint. KILT brings this model of identity to the digital world, with a DID serving as your digital fingerprint. Identity is then built around your DID by adding credentials or digital certificates. On KILT, you can anchor your DID on the blockchain. This means that unlike an identity card (which should not be confused with identity itself — it’s just a credential) no external body can cancel or delete the core of your identity.</p> Anchoring a DID: Pay with&nbsp;KILT <p>Anchoring a DID requires data storage on the KILT blockchain database, which is replicated among multiple computers. Unlike Ethereum, KILT incentivizes cleaning up this database rather than letting it grow for eternity. Every time a user stores data on the chain, they have to put down a small deposit, which they receive back automatically when they remove the data. Storing a DID on the KILT chain requires a deposit of roughly 2 KILT Coins. The deposit never leaves the user’s account. It is just locked and not available for transfers, voting or&nbsp;staking.</p><p>If the DID is no longer required, the user can remove the data at any time, which automatically unlocks the deposit and makes it available again.</p><p>Once users anchor their DID on the chain they can use the full range of KILT identity solutions. Since KILT DIDs meet <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C industry standards</a>, they are also compatible with any applications that also resolve the KILT DID&nbsp;method.</p> Anchoring a DID: Pay without&nbsp;KILT <p>Many people are interested in enjoying the benefits of decentralized identity. But some don’t want the friction of buying or holding crypto in order to put their DID on the blockchain.</p><p>B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH (BTE), a subsidiary of BOTLabs, the initial developer of KILT Protocol, has created two solutions to address these adoption challenges:</p>  A <a href="https://kilt-protocol.org/get-did/index.html">Checkout Service</a> that puts the individual user’s signed DID transaction on the KILT blockchain, and allows payment with&nbsp;PayPal.  An enterprise solution for buying large numbers of DIDs for their customers or employees and paying once via bank transfer.  <p>In both cases, the user’s DIDs are generated on their own device in their private wallet, and are unique to the&nbsp;user.</p><p>These two services utilize a unique feature of KILT: the account that pays the fees and makes the deposit (the service) does not need to be the same as the account that authorized the transactions (the DID owner). This means that the owner of the DID stays in control of their DID while an external account (the service used) can be used to submit the DID operations to the blockchain and lock the deposit on behalf of the user. The user always stays in control of the DID. No one except the user can delete or add to the&nbsp;DID.</p><p>Naturally, both solutions are compliant with KILT’s privacy by design. Here’s how they&nbsp;work:</p> Checkout Service <p>Individuals who prefer not to pay with KILT can use the Checkout Service provided by KILT partner BTE. This service can be accessed via the <a href="https://kilt-io/build-your-identity">KILT website</a> or through KILT’s Sporran wallet. Getting a DID (anchored on chain) using the Checkout Service currently costs a non-refundable service fee of EUR 4,⁰⁰. Users can pay for this service using PayPal, which may also provide options for paying in other fiat currencies.</p><p>The process starts by <a href="https://kilt-protocol.org/files/How-to-Guide-Create-Sporran-Wallet.pdf">creating an account in Sporran</a>, which automatically generates DID details as part of the setup process. After clicking “Get your DID” in the Sporran wallet and selecting the Checkout Service option, users are directed to sign with their password in Sporran to prepare the transaction. Then users will be directed to the Checkout Service, which processes their transaction and offers them PayPal to pay for the Checkout&nbsp;Service:</p><p>The service then puts the transaction on the blockchain, pays the KILT transaction fees as well as the required deposit, and registers the DID on the blockchain on the user’s behalf. When the order has been processed, the Checkout Service website shows the order has been completed:</p><p>Users will be able to see their DID in their Sporran under “Manage&nbsp;DID”.</p><p>The Checkout Service has no control over a user’s DID at any point. Once the service makes the deposit required by the blockchain, the deposit is locked forever. Only the user can delete the DID. The DID is now stored on the blockchain, and the user can start building their digital identity around it, knowing that no external party can turn it&nbsp;off.</p> Enterprise Solution <p>This service is also relevant for enterprises that want to build on their real-word trust reputation to create a business around digital identity. Or need to equip their customers or employees with DIDs for various reasons, without requiring them to acquire KILT Coins. Some enterprises even have policies that prevent them from holding cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Working on a larger scale, these enterprises don’t want to go through the payment process for every single DID and would prefer an automated solution. To meet this need BTE developed an enterprise service. Here’s how it&nbsp;works:</p>  The service allows an entity (e.g. a company) to pay once in fiat for a large number of DID deposits.  The BTE service then acquires the necessary amount of KILT&nbsp;Coins.  The company can develop its own wallet for their customers to store their credentials securely using KILT’s open source software, or integrate the Sporran&nbsp;wallet.  Employees or users of the company’s service can then download the company’s wallet on their device and generate their DID which is anchored on the blockchain.  Following a similar process to the Checkout Service, the BTE enterprise service communicates with the company’s software to register DIDs on the blockchain as requested via an API, up to the number of DIDs paid for in&nbsp;advance.  <p>As in the Checkout Service, neither the BTE enterprise service nor the company have any control over the DIDs; they cannot revoke them or remove them from the KILT blockchain.</p><p>The Checkout Service and enterprise solution represent a significant step forward for KILT Protocol. These innovations add convenience and flexibility that will drive adoption of KILT DIDs across new audiences and industries.</p><p>______</p><p>Still have questions? Browse the FAQs&nbsp;below.</p> FAQs <p>Q: Where do users get their&nbsp;DID?</p><p>A: The DID is generated on your computer when you create your account in your wallet (Sporran for Checkout Service, or the wallet developed by the provider for other services).</p><p>Q: Can other people add credentials to my&nbsp;DID?</p><p>A: No. You can request credentials and store them in your wallet on your device. You decide, which credentials you accept and who you share them with. If you wish to make some credentials public (e.g. email address, social media handles) you may <a href="https://kilt-protocol.org/files/How-to-Guide-Link-Credentials-via-GitHub.pdf">link them to your DID</a>, but no one else can do that for&nbsp;you.</p><p>Q: How do I know that BTE won’t cancel my&nbsp;DID?</p><p>A: BTE / the Checkout Service cannot remove the user’s DID from the blockchain. Only the user can delete their&nbsp;DID.</p><p>Q: Can the Checkout Service / Enterprise service / Company control my&nbsp;DID?</p><p>A: No. Only you have control of your DID. Once it’s registered on the blockchain, no one can delete or turn off the core of your digital identity besides you. However, if you later decide you don’t need your DID, you can choose to delete it&nbsp;forever.</p><p>Q: Once I have my DID anchored on the blockchain what can I do with&nbsp;it?</p><p>A: There are already several services “built on KILT” that utilize DIDs including Social KYC and DIDsign. More applications are in development and will be available soon; keep an eye on <a href="https://twitter.com/Kiltprotocol">Twitter</a> or the <a href="https://kilt-protocol.medium.com/">KILT blog</a> for announcement updates.</p><p>Q: How much does Checkout Service&nbsp;cost?</p><p>A: You currently pay a non-refundable €4 (or Euro equivalent) using PayPal for the Checkout Service. This includes VAT, the transaction fee, a handling fee for the service, and the equivalent of the&nbsp;deposit.</p><p>Q: If I pay for my DID using Checkout Service, can I delete my DID&nbsp;later?</p><p>A: Yes, you can delete your DID from the KILT blockchain. If you do so, this DID cannot be recreated.</p><p>Q: What happens if I delete my on-chain DID. Is it completely removed from the blockchain?</p><p>A: No, records are permanent on the blockchain. However, deleting your on-chain DID invalidates it&nbsp;forever.</p><p>Q: If I pay for my DID using Checkout Service and later delete my DID, do I get a&nbsp;refund.</p><p>A: No, deposits paid by Checkout Service are not refundable. The deposit is locked&nbsp;forever.</p><p>Q: How are deposits calculated?</p><p>A: The deposit amount is calculated using a formula based on the size of the data stored multiplied by a scaling factor that can be decreased or increased by governance vote.,&nbsp;e.g.:</p><p>Number of items * 56 * 0.001 KILT (milliKILT) + (item size, bytes) * 50 * 0.000001 KILT (microKILT)<br> <br>Q: If KILT Coins increase in price, will the price of a DID increase&nbsp;too?</p><p>A: KILT is a decentralized protocol governed by the community of KILT holders; a decision to change the price of a DID would be made by the community. Any KILT Coin holder could create a proposal to change the price, and the community would&nbsp;vote.</p><p>Q: Who owns the KILT blockchain?</p><p>A: KILT is a decentralized blockchain, meaning it is owned and governed by the community of KILT Coin holders.

 New Year, New Launch: <br>KILT Website Features Enterprise and Consumer Onramps to&nbsp;DIDs <p>The new KILT.io website is now live! The redesigned site features a vibrant look and feel, with new tools to “Claim your Independence” and regain control of personal data using KILT’s digital identity solutions.</p><p>The new website continues KILT’s mission of education about digital identity, DIDs and verifiable credentials. New sections highlight enterprise use cases and ecosystem partners, and the Protocol section includes KILT’s governance framework, the new <a href="https://www.kilt.io/protocol/constitution">Constitution</a>, and guidelines for Treasury proposals. Developer resources and documentation provide the information needed to start building with&nbsp;KILT.</p><p>In the physical world, your identity starts with your face or fingerprint. KILT brings this model of identity to the digital world, with a DID (decentralized identifier) serving as your digital fingerprint. Setting up a DID is the first step to building your identity with KILT services, and requires a deposit of around 2 KILT Coins. Users can <a href="https://www.kilt.io/build-your-identity">get their DID with KILT</a> via the new website and KILT’s Sporran&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>But not all users are familiar with or comfortable buying crypto. So today’s relaunch introduces a Checkout Service that makes digital identity and DID creation available to a much broader audience, and doesn’t require crypto knowledge or&nbsp;coins.</p><p>Created by B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH (a subsidiary of BOTLabs, the initial developer of KILT Protocol), the Checkout Service enables individuals to get their DID without using KILT and easily pay for the Checkout Service via&nbsp;Paypal.</p><p>Also available is a new DID solution for enterprises to offer DIDs at scale for their employees and customers. <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/get-your-did-kilt-launches-new-services-for-enterprise-and-consumers-d34be03261f3">Learn more</a> about how enterprises can buy a batch of transactions and anchor the DIDs on the KILT blockchain, while preserving the user’s privacy and&nbsp;control.</p><p>So what are you waiting for? Browse the site, <a href="https://www.kilt.io/build-your-identity">Get your DID</a> with KILT or Paypal via the new Checkout Service, and start building your decentralized identity. It’s time to take back&nbsp;control.</p> About KILT <p><a href="https://www.kilt.io/">KILT</a> is a blockchain identity protocol for generating decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials, providing secure, practical identity solutions for enterprise and consumers.</p><p>Discover more on the <a href="http://www.kilt.io/">KILT website</a>, brainstorm KILT use cases in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/847445252663148565/856523327011291137">Discord</a>, or follow KILT on <a href="https://twitter.com/Kiltprotocol">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/KILTProtocolChat">Telegram</a> to keep up with the latest&nbsp;news.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/new-year-new-launch-kilt-website-features-enterprise-and-consumer-onramps-to-dids-679121f3cd5e">New Year, New Launch:&nbsp;

In association with industry players including Legisym, Center for Supply Chain Studies, <a href="https://medium.com/spherity/rfxcel-integrates-spherity-credentialing-service-to-enable-dscsa-authorized-trading-partner-49bc3cca2e5c">rfxcel</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/spherity/spherity-credentialing-service-now-available-on-sap-store-356ab6a15dca">SAP</a>, <a href="https://www.sap.com/about/customer-stories.html?pdf-asset=d8b2ecc4-1c7e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b&amp;page=1">Novartis</a>, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Bristol-Myers Squibb, AmerisourceBergen, GS1 US and <a href="https://medium.com/spherity/spherity-joins-health-distribution-alliance-hda-as-a-service-provider-member-7a5024317567">HDA</a>, we have addressed the challenge of authenticating a trading partner’s identity and authorizing them in DSCSA-regulated electronic PI verifications that are facilitated by <a href="https://learn.caro.vc/docs/basics/glossary/#v">Verification Router Service (VRS)</a>. The original solution is based on cryptographically <a href="https://learn.caro.vc/docs/basics/glossary/#v">verifiable credentials</a>. This credentialing approach has been developed further collaboratively within an industry collaboration called the <a href="https://www.oc-i.org/">Open Credentialing Initiative (OCI)</a>. The method introduces a new layer of security, efficiency, and convenience to DSCSA compliance for any VRS-enabled pharmaceutical supply chain&nbsp;actor.</p> Innovation hat-trick? <p>The credentialing solution began as a classic technological innovation project in April 2020 with Spherity and other companies representing different segments of the U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain coming together in a cross-functional pilot. Explore the published <a href="https://www.oc-i.org/resources-portfolio/dscsa-atp-pilot">pilot resources</a> for detailed information. After successful conclusion the team realized that true industry-wide innovation will not happen in isolation. A <a href="https://medium.com/spherity/spherity-is-partnering-with-legisym-offering-joint-compliance-product-for-the-u-s-cbf9fd5a217">close partnership</a> emerged from the pilot between <a href="https://www.caro.vc/">Spherity</a> and <a href="https://legisym.com/">Legisym</a>, an expert in regulatory compliance technologies for the pharmaceutical industry. To standardize and evolve the piloted solution, Spherity and Legisym spearheaded the foundation of OCI, a non-profit industry collaboration, in April 2021. Thus, the innovation has been threefold — at technological, compliance, and governance level. 2022 was a pivotal year for the Spherity-Legisym partnership and OCI yielding not only matured architectural and governance frameworks for the latter but also a commercially ready solution for the&nbsp;former.</p><p>Technological innovation: Spherity leverages <a href="https://learn.caro.vc/docs/basics/glossary/#d">decentralized identifiers</a> in combination with verifiable credentials (VCs) as a new layer of trust in digital interactions. Each decentralized identifier is uniquely and cryptographically verifiably associated with a pharmaceutical trading partner. A VC is effectively a translation of existing real-world evidence, including trading licenses, into a specific standardized electronic format. These identifiers and credentials are stored securely in a piece of software called a digital wallet. By presenting an organization’s VC to a counterparty through electronic PI verification messages facilitated by VRS, supply chain actors are able to identify trading partners as intended by DSCSA in secure electronic processes. The key advantage of the described digital credentials is that they can be independently automatically verified unlike other identifiers (see&nbsp;below).</p><p>Compliance innovation: Initially, pharmaceutical supply chain actors intended to rely on existing enterprise identifiers for the accurate identification of trading partners in PI verifications, in particular global location numbers (GLN) or data universal numbering system (DUNS) numbers as well as existing manual or semi-automated look-ups of compliance information, such as trading licenses. However, in electronic interactions, the receiving party cannot be sure that an entity providing the aforementioned identifiers is indeed who they say they are because their identity and provided details cannot be independently verified. It poses a challenge to reliably associate such identifiers with separate evidence for trading authorization increasing the complexity of due diligence. In addition, there have been cases where GLN were not well maintained, e.g., they were not active or not associated with the expected entity. Thus, existing means had left a compliance gap that the credentialing method has now plugged. Besides the technological qualities of VC solving the challenges around the assurance of the interacting parties indeed being who they claim to be and possessing the appropriate trading authorization, Legisym’s assessment of the existing compliance landscape has enabled the adaptation of due diligence processes and available pieces of evidence with a high level of assurance for use with this novel technology.</p><p>Governance innovation: To bring true value to the US pharmaceutical industry as a whole, ecosystem thinking must be applied. To create not only an isolated solution but allow for industry-wide interoperability and adoption, Spherity, Legisym, and others have co-founded OCI as a governance platform for the credentialing method, forum for industry stakeholders, and to create the foundation of an open market for other service providers to join. Under the stewardship of the Center for Supply Chain Studies, the Spherity-Legisym partnership has been a leading force within OCI in the creation of the technological architecture, conformance criteria, and organizational governance as well as industry-wide alliances and educational efforts.</p> Gains in productivity, supply chain safety, and efficiencies <p>Supply chain safety — automation: DSCSA has been enacted to enhance supply chain safety. By enabling the automation of aspects of legal compliance, ATP credentialing directly pays into fulfilling the promise and intent of the&nbsp;law.</p><p>Supply chain safety — auditability: Equipped with monitoring and reporting features, the Spherity solution, named <a href="https://www.caro.vc/">CARO</a>, generates automated audit trails enabling timely investigations.</p><p>Productivity — staff time: Credentialing involves the conversion of real-world evidence provided by each trading partner to Legisym into electronically verifiable credentials in a one-off enrollment. Any interactions between trading partners leverage these credentials through automated checks. Thus, the due diligence process in the context of PI verifications becomes a passive, entirely hands-off exercise for trading partners on either side of an exchange. This means that (1) an individual company does not need to undergo a separate due diligence process with each new trading partner and (2) that staff are freed up from due diligence-related tasks. For example, a manufacturer does not need to vet every single dispenser before reacting to a product enquiry because the dispensers have already been vetted within the credentialing system. Legisym’s ongoing monitoring keeps verifiable credentials active for as long as trading partners maintain their businesses in good standing.</p><p>Productivity — speed: While DSCSA allows for up to 24 hours, there is a drive by trading partners to achieve response times of under one minute to PI verification requests by using automated electronic systems. Consequently, the ATP check must happen in the same timeframe. The credential-based system is able to handle both the ATP and the PI verification requests within far less than one&nbsp;minute.</p><p>Efficiency — operations: The credentialing approach alleviates the additional compliance burden on supply chain actors caused by DSCSA, as it maximizes the use of existing processes as much as possible. (1) Legisym leverages existing licenses/registration etc for due diligence and eliminates the need for repetitive checks. (2) Thanks to fully API-based integration of VRS providers with Spherity’s CARO, trading partners have no technical implementation effort. Hence, ATP authentication can be incorporated into existing processes without disruption.</p><p>Efficiency — market: The ecosystem approach through OCI opens the market to any company aspiring to be a service provider, as shared information and standards are openly available to lay the foundation for industry-wide system interoperability. This avoids monopoly-like pockets, vendor tie-ins, and encourages competition through value-adds or&nbsp;pricing.</p><p>Efficiency — joint innovation: The ecosystem approach through OCI encourages the involvement of various industry stakeholders and, thus, enables the development of solutions that are needed and fit for purpose, as they are born from within the industry.</p> Contact us <p>DSCSA will reach its final enforcement deadline on Nov 27, 2023.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Warwick Ashford</a></p><p>In the digital era, business would greatly benefit from having increased identity assurance levels, be able to interact securely with partners, suppliers, consumers, and customers, and be able to reduce the administrative load during onboarding or ongoing verification of credentials.</p>
<p>One potential solution, that is gaining momentum and support around the world, is the implementation of decentralized Identity systems that use verifiable credentials that are tamper proof, can be stored in a digital wallet, and can contain a decentralized identifier that is globally unique and can be cryptographically verified.</p>
 A user-centric universal digital identity solution 
<p>The ultimate goal is a universal digital ID that can be used to access all digital services without having to enter personal identity information for every single service and without having to trust every service provider to keep that centralized personal information safe.</p>
<p>While we still have some way to go in achieving that goal, organizations can already start using decentralized identities and verifiable credentials, thereby gearing up to enable the wider ecosystem that they will be able to tap into as soon as it is up and running.&nbsp;</p>
 Decentralized Identity highlights in the EIC agenda 
<p>Any organizations interested in finding out more about decentralized identity, verifiable credentials, and how and why to implement them, should attend the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/tracks/922">track</a> at the European Identity and Cloud Conference 2023 dedicated to these topics. The track is designed to provide a wide range of useful and practical information about <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2023/agenda#tab_1_2023-05-10">Decentralized &amp; Verifiable Credentials</a>.</p>
<p>Interworking or interoperability is one of the key challenges to the implementation of Decentralized Identity. To find out how OpenID for Verifiable Credentials can help with this challenge and a lot more besides, attend this track session on: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5274/1">How to Build Interoperable Decentralized Identity Systems with OpenID for Verifiable Credentials</a>.</p>
<p>Learn more about the NFTicket protocol, how it combines the identification power of cryptographic wallets with those of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), and how it has been applied in a pilot to create Renewable Energy Certificates as Verifiable Credentials in this session entitled: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5274/2">Verifiable Credentials and Dynamic NFTs – Two sides of the same medal</a>.</p>
<p>Drilling down even further into the topic of interoperability, the session on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5279/1">Interworking of Verifiable Credential Products</a> examines in detail two projects aimed at fostering wide scale adoption of Verifiable Credentials and discusses their finding.</p>

After all, using personal data doesn’t help us replace fossil fuels with renewable sources of energy, and all uses of data have their own carbon footprint from the energy used to power servers and&nbsp;devices.</p><p>So how can we argue that the proper collection and use of personal data is an essential part of the journey to net zero? To be sure, it definitely isn’t the solution. But it is part of the solution, a <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/data-hidden-key-to-carbon-reduction-d5872032fc7d">hidden key to carbon reduction</a>. Here are six ways&nbsp;how.</p> A human-made, expanding resource <p>First, a new net zero economy has to find a way of reducing dependence on materials extracted from the earth. It needs to go circular. Data, including personal data, is a vital part of this transition because of two&nbsp;things.</p>  It is human-made, generated by humans in the course of their activities — not extracted from the&nbsp;earth.  It is infinitely renewable and more, because every time we use data we generate more of it (including ‘metadata’ e.g. data about the data we are using and generating).  <p>Data isn’t the only, or even the most important human made, renewable, expanding resource. It is part of something even bigger: human culture and knowledge. As economic forces they’re even more powerful than energy (because we use knowledge and our ability to do things together to obtain energy). But data is a key part of this, providing an ever-growing contribution to&nbsp;it.</p> Active carbonisation <p>Second, at a lesser but nevertheless real level, increased use of digital and data processes helps to decarbonise the economy. An enormous amount of energy is required to fell trees, transport them, turn them into pulp and then paper, to move this paper using physical transportation, and to store it. In comparison, an electronic digit is a massive carbon saving. The more we can eliminate paper (by, for example, eliminating form filling and the sending of letters in the post), the&nbsp;better.</p><p>Third, improved data logistics is key to improved physical logistics — eliminating unnecessary carbon-emitting activities by better, more accurate planning and coordination. A parcel that is sent to the wrong place because of a data error produces carbon emissions entirely unnecessarily. Eliminating paper by digitising a data process is just the tip of a much bigger energy saving ice-berg: using data to make better decisions and implementing them more efficiently — decisions involving physical, energy-using processes. This is another aspect of decarbonisation.</p> A deeper, seismic&nbsp;shift <p>More generally and fundamentally speaking, the data revolution is shifting the epicentre of economic activity. For the last few centuries the economy has revolved around one central question: how to use energy to transform and move material things? It was all about making&nbsp;stuff.</p><p>As a society we are now very good at doing that. What we are less good at is two other, equally important economic activities: making the right decisions in the first place (so that we don’t waste time, energy and materials doing the wrong things), and implementing these decisions more efficiently and effectively (which boils down to the data-intensive tasks of planning, organising and coordinating). This is where the biggest opportunities for improvement now lie — opportunities with carbon reducing possibilities at their&nbsp;heart.</p><p>This shift in economic focus from using energy to make and move stuff to using data to make and implement better decisions, is epochal and seismic. It changes the underlying dynamics of all wealth creation. And it is essential for the journey to net&nbsp;zero.</p><p>Closely linked to this, is a slow but inexorable shift in how we think about and understand value and wealth. Wealth is not the ability to consume more things. It is human beings’ ability to live better lives. Yes of course, to do that we need to use and consume stuff. But consuming ever more stuff is not the be all and end all of life. There’s lots more to it than that, nowadays coming under the general heading of ‘wellbeing’.</p><p>Compared to what we know about how to make stuff, we know much less about how to improve human wellbeing in all its dimensions. To understand this better, we need data: detailed data about how people live their lives and, from this, what contributes to improved wellbeing and what does not. This is part of the ‘life management’ revolution we talked about in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/an-engine-of-economic-possibilities-a04a32181f48">our last blog</a>. Because it is so deeply personal, it needs privacy protecting personal data infrastructure to support&nbsp;it.</p><p>More concretely, as we also talked about <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/an-engine-of-economic-possibilities-a04a32181f48">in our last blog</a> personal data stores will help deliver mass scale citizen behaviour change via ‘carbon concierge’ services: services that help each individual understand the unique carbon footprint of the things they buy and do, and to identify ways to eliminate or substitute high-carbon activities for low or negative carbon activities.</p> A positive alternative <p>But there is one more way in which personal data stores have an even deeper contribution to make to net zero. Just imagine, for a second, if by some piece of magic, all fossil fuels were rendered instantly irrelevant by a universal take-up of green, renewable energy sources. We’ve done it! We’ve gone net&nbsp;zero!</p><p>But if all we have done is gone net zero, nothing else has changed. We still have obscene levels of inequality, deep and growing poverty, the super-exploitation of people working in a rights-free gig economy, a collapsing health and care system, a corrupt extractive financial system with huge, unsustainable levels of debt, endless invasions of privacy by predatory, profit-seeking corporations. Would our lives actually be any&nbsp;better?</p><p>Without broader, deeper changes to our economic system net zero, in itself, will not create a fairer, better, more prosperous society. What we need is a journey to net zero that combines with, and brings these broader, deeper changes in its wake. That develops positive alternatives as it does&nbsp;so.</p><p>This is what personal data stores are part of: as well as accelerating the journey to net zero, they develop positive alternatives that make an enriching, circular, well-being focused society and economy possible. Not just old wine in a new&nbsp;bottle.</p><p>Other blogs in this series&nbsp;are:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-great-data-delusion-744b40795f73">The Great Data Delusion</a> 19th century doctors thought bloodletting would cure most diseases.

<p>Businesses have embraced digital to engage with their customers. Keeping pace in this rapidly evolving threat landscape requires businesses to look for innovative ways to build experiences that optimise security without impacting user convenience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en.html">Ping Identity</a> and <a href="https://versent.com.au/">Versent</a> conducted a roundtable luncheon in Sydney and Melbourne in November 2022, with CISOs and related C-level executives responsible for ICT and/or cyber security in their organisations or business units. The aim was to spark thought and engage in a robust conversation about the challenges, issues, and approaches to identity access &amp; management orchestration, with a specific focus on using customer identity to optimise security and convenience, especially in the areas of customer and employee experience. Twenty-eight executives from a very broad range of industries and backgrounds attended the event.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steve Dillon, Head of APAC Architecture at Ping Identity, and Eddie Smith, GM Identity and Security at Versent hosted the events. Both 2.5-hour events were moderated by Craig Baty, Principal of <a href="http://www.datadrivenservices.com.au/">DataDriven</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leaders must collaborate with teams across the business to develop and execute a customer-facing digital strategy that ensures a frictionless experience, enhanced security, protection from fraud, and regulatory compliance. Using customer identity, leaders can establish a firm foundation of collaboration with different stakeholders to orchestrate digital experiences that drive sales, lower fraud losses, and meet business objectives.</p>

<p>We launched SSX to provide developers with the easiest way to integrate Sign-In with Ethereum, enable DAO logins, resolve ENS names, and more. We are continuously working on a positive developer experience, and additional features to enable builders to work with emerging decentralized identity paradigms. </p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/announcing-ssx/">  Announcing SSX: Self-Sovereign Anything  We’re happy to announce the release of SSX: Self-Sovereign Anything - the easiest way to get started with decentralized identity and install Sign-In with Ethereum  SpruceSpruce    </a><p>Our most recent work on SSX focused on two areas: adding optimizations, and adding additional features and support for various dapp setups. We recently took some time to consolidate and optimize code to reduce existing technical debt through some refactoring and added plenty of additional tests to make adding new features to SSX a breeze. </p><p>In our efforts to support various existing authentication setups, we've released support for NextAuth via our <code>ssx-react</code> package. Additionally, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/tree/main/examples/ssx-test-nextauth">we've added an example</a> in our growing example library to show how to integrate it. To support <a href="https://wagmi.sh">wagmi's</a> recent updates beyond version 0.7.15 and NextAuth in a variety of different development environments, we are updating our <code>ssx-react</code> library to improve support for different Javascript module types (ESM and CJS modules).</p><p>Additionally, we added support for custom paths for endpoints on both the client and server sides to support various application setups in our core libraries. We also updated the <code>ssx-react</code> API to allow for additional options to pass to the SSX instance, widening the number of supported providers (such as <a href="https://docs.ssx.id/configuring-ssx/configuring-ssx-with-react#other-providers">Blocknative’s web3-onboard provider</a>!). </p><p>Speaking of providers, SSX now also has <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/tree/main/examples">multiple examples</a> showing a developer how they can build an SSX-enabled dapp with WalletConnect’s web3modal-v2!</p><p>Finally, we’re happy to announce support for Lens profile resolution. This enables any developer using SSX to easily pull in Lens profile information to the dapps they’re building by simply turning on a <a href="https://app.gitbook.com/o/YHxbgvbOJwARzKZAVAA0/s/Yk3peyHr3yYsgyIYXUky/configuring-ssx#resolvelens">feature flag</a>. &nbsp; </p><p>For more information on our recent updates, check out the following:</p> Features:   <code>ssx-react</code> now supports NextAuth, and we’ve added corresponding documentation (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/pull/49">#49</a>).  We added support for resolving Lens profiles (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/pull/50">#50</a>).  We updated the <code>ssx-react</code> API to use additional providers. We added this support alongside an example using Blocknative’s <a href="https://github.com/blocknative/web3-onboard">web3onboard</a> (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/pull/34">#34</a>).  We added flexibility in SSX to let developers configure what endpoints they want to use for issuing nonces, and handling login/logout functions (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/pull/36">#36</a>).  We added examples of how to use SSX with <a href="https://web3modal.com/">web3modal-v2</a>. We have one example for each web3modal v2 package: <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/tree/main/examples/ssx-test-web3modal-v2-html">web3modal/html</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/tree/main/examples/ssx-test-web3modal-v2-react">web3modal/react</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/tree/main/examples/ssx-test-web3modal-v2-standalone">web3modal/standalone</a>.   We also updated our <code>ssx-test-dapp</code> to also support testing this new integration (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/pull/58">#58</a>).   Testing and Code Refactor:   We are over 70% in code <a href="https://app.codecov.io/gh/spruceid/ssx">coverage</a> with tests and are currently working on continuing to get to full coverage this month.  We optimized try/catch blocks, cleaned up existing code, and created a new package for functions and utilities used across our other packages <code>ssx-core</code> (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/pull/26">#26</a>).  We updated how we bundle our packages to prevent typescript build issues for builds using gulp (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/pull/52">#52</a>).   What’s Next <p>The team is working on improving interfaces in SSX to enable any developer to use it as a core building block, and extend it toward various decentralized identity use cases. </p><p>Additionally, we’re working on how developers with existing email or OAuth flows can easily enable Sign-In with Ethereum in their existing applications using SSX. We hope to eventually migrate applications to a world where Sign-In with Ethereum is the default way of logging in.</p><p>Finally, we think of SSX as a core enabler of user-controlled identity, where anyone can bring their own data anywhere they wish. We are working on a service that enables users to obtain credentials that they can take with them across the web using SSX. Stay tuned for more information late next month, closer to ETHDenver! </p>

<p>This Data Privacy Day it is time to address those who serve on Boards of Directors because there is an opportunity to turn 2023 into the year of Cybersecurity culture building – starting at the very top.</p>
<p>These days when it comes to an organization’s cybersecurity strategy, the question isn’t IF a breach will occur, but WHEN. Cybercriminals are becoming more sophisticated and the frequency of attacks is rising. Staying on top of each and every threat is like trying to ice skate uphill. And with the average cost of a data breach <a href="https://www.scmagazine.com/news/email-security/average-cost-of-a-data-breach-expected-to-hit-5-million-in-2023">expected</a> to hit $5 million in 2023, it is vitally important to prioritize your security strategy to protect your most sensitive data.</p>
<p>With the number, frequency and sophistication of threats increasing, it’s important that organizations build a security-minded culture, where employees at all levels feel empowered and accountable to not only protect sensitive data, but also to build resiliency into the business. However, organizations often turn their attention to employee security training and forget to bring along those at the top. As Boards become acutely aware of data privacy and data protection, they are increasingly interested in participating in the governance of both.</p>
<p>Here are five useful steps Board and C-suite members can take now to ramp up their cybersecurity expertise in 2023 and beyond.</p>
 
 Add a cybersecurity expert to the Board. This will help drive a cybersecurity culture and make data privacy governance and data security a priority at the highest level of the organization. Visibility is key to building trust by helping people to understand how data privacy, data security and compliance are maintained in the background. This applies to the Board as well. Having clear and well-understood policies and solutions can drive investment and buy-in. In fact, the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-39">recently proposed</a> a new rule that mandates cybersecurity experience at the Board level, as well as regular reporting among its recommendations. And not just regulatory bodies are pushing for more of this knowledge at the Board level – MIT <a href="https://fortune.com/education/articles/cybersecurity-risks-can-no-longer-be-ignored-mit-sloan-launches-course-to-teach-board-members-prevention-tactics/">recently launched</a> a course to teach Board members security tactics. 
 Create a cybersecurity committee in which qualified Board members can participate in advising and mitigating risks. Creating this committee opens the door to more resources and support as the CISO and their team have the opportunity to build allies and champions within the Board, C-suite, and across the organization. 
 Conduct a cost-benefit analysis on cybersecurity insurance. While cybersecurity insurance can be an effective part of an organization’s overall security strategy, it’s expensive and it usually doesn’t cover everything. Cybersecurity insurance is a tool within a company’s security toolbox to recoup losses from unforeseen incidents – it’s not meant to be a substitute for risk management. An insurance payout may cover the cost of a breach, but it won’t cover the damage to reputation and trust. Each company is different and so are its security needs, so it’s important to <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/post/Do-companies-need-cyber-insurance">evaluate all factors</a> and decide if it meets your business needs. 
 Learn the distinct differences between data privacy and data security. These terms are often mistaken as interchangeable ideas; however, while they are connected, they are fundamentally different. Data privacy focuses on how personal data is collected, used, and shared. Data privacy laws and regulations can vary by regionally, with each having varying degrees of rigor and enforcement. Conversely, data security is focused on how sensitive data is protected from external and internal threats. From a compliance perspective, taking ownership of data security means responsibility to abide by data privacy regulations in place like the EU’s GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and the CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act), to name a few. If an organization gets its data security framework right, then it can achieve data privacy for its clients. If not, then that’s a problem. Of all the information available, a person’s identity is the most coveted data there is and when it’s mishandled that’s when the opportunity for fraudsters occurs. 
 
 
 For user authentication, it’s time to embrace some friction For years experts have touted the need to remove friction (or passive authentication) in the consumer, workforce and citizen identity verification experience. However, when friction is completely removed, that’s often when a breach happens – particularly when that friction is reduced by workarounds rather than reducing complexity. There’s an idea circulating among experts that some level of friction can serve as a trust builder – if people have no impediment to accessing applications and services, they start to question whether or not there are any security measures in place at all. This tells us organizations need to strike the right balance between minimizing friction and maintaining customer trust in an organization’s or government’s ability to keep their personal data safe – because when systems are secured, employees are enabled, partners are confident, and customers feel safe doing business with the organization, then you know you’ve got a formula that works. 
 
<p>Board-level involvement in the governance of data privacy and security for an organization can only enable an improved security posture and help mitigate risks. So go ahead and seek out opportunities to engage with your organization’s CISO to see how you can help keep sensitive data safe.</p>

<p>The payment card issuance industry continues to be challenged by production inefficiencies as a result of global pandemic supply chain disruptions. Of course, the usual operational hiccups exist, but the added pressures that come from the on-going global chip shortage have strained the entire industry. In this blog, we’ll explore some of these challenges and how they affect issuers and integrators. Most importantly, we’ll explore how to mitigate these risks and optimize operational footprints with increased agility and production throughputs.</p>
<p>The usual suspects</p>
<p>Vendor diversification is intentionally limited to organizations. Global chip suppliers often act to restrict issuers from looking for alternative suppliers. Pre-printed card stocks limit design and force higher carrying costs with increased volume inventories for anyone downstream. Both contribute to the same MRP inefficiency, steering the front-end procurement of specific items from specific vendors, contributing to higher overall costs and volumes which translate to operational inefficiency.</p>
<p>Too many designs can proliferate supply. With chip issuers and stock card designers constantly adding new card models to their portfolio, there is an added burden on production personnel and procurement systems to keep track of different SKU’s and maintain costs. Vault monitoring, production planning and material flow are all exacerbated by incremental stocks within complex MRP systems, sometimes driving multiple facilities with multiple lines to satisfy issuance demand across different regions. Static “card programs” can easily translate to production inefficiency if respective volumes do not align with overall customer demand.</p>
<p>Personalization systems limit issuance architectures. Most personalization systems in the market do not support the ability to mix and match different chips into one single job, causing significant inefficiencies in production volumes. Similarly, static card designs contribute to an identical concept — running independent batch sizes for specific programs. A recent ICMA study, concluded that the average worldwide production batch-size for financial bureaus is less than 20 cards, contributing to 20% of the total volume per day.</p>
<p>Piling on the on-going global chip shortage</p>
<p>Much of the focus on chip shortages has been on automotive manufacturing and consumer electronics, but payment cards and point-of-sale devices are also under significant strain from global shifts in supply chains. “The entire payments industry relies on semiconductors, chip cards, smartphones and digital point-of-sale devices, which are all impacted by the shortage,” said Oliver Manahan, the San Francisco-based senior director of business development for Infineon Technologies in Neubiberg, Germany. Manhan, who oversees partnerships with card vendors, issuers, payment networks and other firms at Infineon, is also co-chair of the Secure Technology Alliance and is on the steering committee of the U.S. Payments Forum.</p>
<p>The median chip inventory companies have on-hand fell from a 40-day supply in 2019 to less than five days in 2021, according to a 2022&nbsp;<a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2022/01/commerce-semiconductor-data-confirms-urgent-need-congress-pass-us">report</a>&nbsp;by the U.S. Department of Commerce that does not take the Russian war in Ukraine and China’s recent coronavirus lockdowns into consideration.&nbsp;Supply chain experts and economists agree that the semi-conductor challenge is expected to persist through 2023 and perhaps into 2024 as wafer capacity is strengthened with new sources of western supply.</p>
<p>It’s highly unlikely that these supply chain disruptions would prevent issuers from producing replacements for lost or stolen cards, or card expirations. However, if we get to that point we’ll have a significant industry-wide customer service nightmare on our hands. Calculated and careful management throughout the supply chain can help the issuance and greater payments industry minimize potential disruption to the cardholder experience.</p>
<p>Overcoming the odds</p>
<p>Amidst each of these challenges, bureaus and integrators can optimize production with the Entrust Adaptive Issuance and Print-on-Demand solutions. Both offer flexibility in a parallel issuance environment:</p>
 
 Adaptive Issuance EMV Data-Prep and Perso Software, in conjunction with rainbow decking (mixed chip card stocks), provide maximized production by aggregating card stocks and running them together in one batch, and 
 Print-on-Demand solutions such as UV-curable Drop-on-Demand and Artista VHD Retransfer offer unlimited efficiency options by allowing individual card designs vs batched, pre-printed stock. Both eliminate major lead-time inconsistencies across chip supply and reduce total Operating Expenses (OPEX) with greater throughput. This design and chip-agnostic approach allows Entrust Central Issuance customers to mitigate the leading supply chain constraint in the industry today—semi-conductor lead-time, affording Issuer’s the ability to choose any combination of card stock suppliers regardless of chipsets.

 We sit down with our Director of Global Gambling &amp; Sales, Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk to discuss the challenges of complying with multi-geographical regulations, why the era of black-market operators is coming to an end, and which gambling trends to bet on in 2023.&nbsp; 



 



 Digital identity proofing has become an essential part of every sector’s digital offering. Although the application of identity proofing technology may be similar, how important is it to be aware of the intricacies of a particular industry, for example with gambling and offering solutions that promote responsible use?&nbsp; 



<p>I would say there’s two sides to this. On one hand you have the supply side, and on the other side you obviously have the operator side. On the supplier side, it’s important to be aware of where the industry is, what the industry is doing, and what the use cases are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our solutions are being used by operators to make their lives easier, to make the players’ lives easier and safer, and at the same time prevent any harm or any wrongdoing. Nowadays, the regulations are very tight and rightly so, especially with regards to protecting minors from underage gambling, and those who may develop a gambling addiction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, it is very important that we as suppliers know what to offer, how to offer it, and whether the solution can do enough.&nbsp;</p>



<p>KYC and identity verification is a business enabler for online gambling because operators don’t see their customers face to face, so they don’t know what kind of situation they are in, or what they’re doing. The most superior identity verification experiences are safe, secure, and easy to use.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As KYC is regarded as an enabler, compliance should be at the top of every operator’s mind, whether they’re at C-level or account management, in fact everyone involved in the technical teams that implement those solutions need to be concerned with compliance.&nbsp;</p>



 As online gambling regulations change and evolve with such regularity, what difficulty does this present to operators, especially those that operate across multiple geographies?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>It can be very challenging because in some countries, for example, Germany, if you wanted to get a gambling license, you would need to fill out the applications in German, which obviously restricts the ability for certain international organizations to enter the market, unless they have somebody on staff who can speak the language.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding regulations, the biggest problem is that there are different ways to interpret certain rules or requirements. So, one company might read it one way, and another operator might see it another way, and that’s a big problem. A good example is what you see with the Alcohol and Gaming Commision of Ontario (<a href="https://www.agco.ca/#modal">AGCO</a>), which essentially <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/canada/regulation-igaming-ontario/">regulates operators in Ontario</a>; they’ve done a fantastic job with their regulation. They want to protect the players, but at the same time, they’re also considering how to enable the operators to do that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are a clear and proactive regulator, like the AGCO, you will always get better results for that region, or that country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are, unfortunately, many bad or frustrating examples of regulations, which may have four or five different interpretations of one paragraph. This does not do anyone any good because there will always be bad players and unscrupulous operators who want to grow quickly that will exploit those grey zones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gambling operators tend to be well prepared when it comes to these things. They use lawyers and consultants to make sure they are going down the right path and take steps to implement the right technology along the way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So yes, it is challenging, but this is also what makes this sector so interesting, because there are always new challenges and new markets to enter, with different regulations and nuances.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall, I would say regulation is necessary, but it is extremely hard to find good regulation.</p>

 Are there any specific risks that operators should be aware of in the gambling sector, and how can operators protect themselves against them?&nbsp; 



<p>Bonus abuse is one example. This is where people create multiple accounts to get the sign-up bonus and then attempt to withdraw the money. Money laundering is another issue in certain countries, as is addiction, and feeding customers’ addiction rather than providing information that helps them to stop. Operators need also to be wary of minors attempting to onboard using the details of their parents, as well as people just not being honest about who they are and what they do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What can operators do? Well, there is great technology available now where identity verification providers and KYC providers can monitor how users are behaving. There is a lot of focus right now on behavioral screening of players and how to spot addiction a lot earlier than ever before. This involves monitoring after a customer is verified. Operators are now utilizing technology to perform the screening stage because doing it manually is no longer feasible. In fact, in certain regulations you are not even allowed to do it manually anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would even say that in some cases the gambling industry uses more tools, or more innovative applications of solutions than the financial industry, such as technology that can identify ‘at-risk behavior’, predict and prevent incidents of fraud and even customer churn.&nbsp;</p>



 Which region, or country would you say has a) the most developed and lucrative online gambling sector, and b) the most regulated? Is there a link between how much potential a country’s gambling sector may have, and how regulated it is?  



<p>Oh, yes, 100% the link is there. Bad regulation is not good for the players and not good for the operators. If you look in Germany, the tax is very high and player limitations are super strict. So, there’s an argument that people are being forced into the black market, and that’s not good for the country because obviously the government is not going to benefit from the associated tax, and secondly the players are not protected if they go to the black market.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>If you’re using a black-market operator, your winnings are totally in their hands. For example, if you hit a jackpot of €1 million, they don’t have to pay you out, because there is no consumer protection.&nbsp;</p>Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk Director of Global Gambling &amp; Sales at IDnow</blockquote>



<p>The most developed and consistent regulation is probably the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/united-kingdom-gambling-commission-ukgc/">UK Gambling Commission</a>, and the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/malta-gaming-authority-mga/">Malta Gaming Authority</a>, both of which have been regulating online gambling for many years and making sure it’s an attractive proposition for both the operator and the consumer – because to have a healthy market, you need to appease both sides. Of course, a national market needs protection, but it also needs tax revenue too; it needs to be commercially viable. You must strike a balance.&nbsp;</p>



 With gambling via offshore, unregulated gambling sites still a major problem within the industry, how can operators attract players away from unregistered sites? Are there any unique benefits that regulated operators can provide?&nbsp; 



<p>Regulated operators should promote their compliance with consumer protection laws, and all the aforementioned responsible gambling tools. One thing that regulated operators probably don’t do enough of is mentioning consumer protection. However, adverts have changed in recent years to incorporate responsible gambling messages and moved away from promoting bonuses to showcasing responsible functionality like deposit limits and setting gaming time limits. I still think they could do more in terms of promoting regulation and consumer protection. I also believe the role of the regulator should bear some of this reasonability too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Why do you think some bettors go to unlicensed, or offshore gambling operators as opposed to registered/ domestic platforms?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>In Germany, for example, if you have gone over your deposit limit, you’re not going to be able to play anymore within that country as deposit limits also often don’t correspond to your withdrawals. So, let’s say you have deposited €500 euros into your account, and you’ve won €20,000, your deposit limit is not adjusted. It’s fixed as standard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This doesn’t make sense, because some people gamble for a living, so if they can’t continue to play, they’re obviously going to go to a black-market operator. Also, regulation forbids certain amounts of bonuses you can give out. An interesting situation is in the New York-New Jersey area, where you won’t see any adverts for bonuses in New York, but on the tunnel to New Jersey, which is just a few hours away, you will see many adverts and billboards promoting bonuses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Black market players can obviously lure players with high bonuses, and with the promise they don’t have to do KYC. Black-market operators can literally do the total opposite of what the regulated operators are doing, and still attract players.</p>Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk Director of Global Gambling &amp; Sales at IDnow</blockquote>



 What online gambling trends do you foresee in 2023?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>I think 2023 will be all about responsible gambling, and I expect a lot of regulators to start introducing regulations to promote this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Responsible gambling will be the biggest thing in 2023, especially in the current economic situation where we are heading into uncertainty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second trend to affect the industry in 2023 is going to be a focus on the customer experience, and operators providing an experience rather than just an account to transfer your money into. There’s also going to be a lot more innovative uses of technology. In our industry, we obviously speak with a lot of operators, and some of those solutions are mindboggling. I also think that online gambling will seek to replicate the social aspect of traditional gambling, like the experience of visiting casinos with friends. So, operators will be able to play with friends online and share the winnings online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Personally speaking, I hope in 2023, digital IDs will take further strides forward because we probably spend more time in the digital world than in the physical world where we actually use physical IDs.&nbsp;</p>



 Why do you think online gambling and crypto has struck up such an unhealthy relationship?  &nbsp; 



<p>Crypto casinos are not very popular, so I don’t think crypto will remain in the gambling market for too long time. Right now, crypto is being used with some of the black marketplace platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, the most famous online casino is a crypto casino, which is being endorsed by big celebrities, and is an unregulated casino. However, in my opinion, I don’t think any major operator will be offering crypto anytime soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>All the operators that we work with are heavily AML-regulated, KYC-regulated, and will not be able to bypass such regulations by offering crypto payments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the perspective of an operator, they will have to perform a KYC check to verify a person either way. Every regulator has a certain deposit limit, so users will have to provide the source of their funds, and that will be either via bank statements, or crypto exchange statements.</p>

 Lubna Dajani joined Wider Team  



  
<p>Wider Team welcomed <a href="https://wider.team/team/lubnadajani/">Lubna Dajani</a> to help clients on digital innovation and transdisciplinary collaboration. Lubna’s dives into <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Hardware-Roots-of-Trust">Hardware Root Of Trust</a> and strategic alliances deepen our strengths. Lubna is based in New York. </p>
  



 Wolff co-wrote a paper on accountability for human harms in trust ecosystems  



<p>Wider’s <a href="https://wider.team/team/philwolff">Phil Wolff</a> co-authored a white paper at <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">ToIP</a> with with <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/nickyhickman">Nicky Hickman</a>. They identified human harms that can come from trust systems. The <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/Overcoming-Human-Harm-Challenges-in-Digital-Identity-Ecosystems-V1.0-2022-11-16.pdf">Trust Over IP’s “Overcoming Human Harm Challenges in Digital Identity Ecosystems” paper</a> (pdf) calls for the SSI community and identity industries to acknowledge the risks of harm and build in preventive measures to avoid negative externalities. ToIP announced the paper this year as “<a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2023/01/17/why-the-digital-identity-juggernaut-needs-safety-belts/">Why the digital identity juggernaut needs safety belts</a>” (“a systemic view of how human harms function in digital identity ecosystems – and how to mitigate them”). Phil asked “<a href="https://wider.team/2023/01/17/what-if-your-identity-ecosystem-caused-pollution/">What if your identity ecosystem caused pollution?</a>” as part of a series on applied ethics, risk management, and <a href="https://wider.team/tag/accountabilitybydesign/">Accountability By Design</a> to every layer of the trust stack. </p>



<p>WiderPoV: “When thousands of parties become part of a digital identity ecosystem, you diffuse responsibility for side effects that ruin, starve, and kill people. Accountability By Design, anyone?” </p>



 Sovrin IoT Paper on traceability for digital twins 



<p>Michael Ford of Aegis Software and Wider’s <a href="https://wider.team/team/damianglover/">Damian Glover</a> and <a href="https://wider.team/team/lubnadajani/">Lubna Dajani</a> wrote and presented “<a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/stc/2022/886400a166/1Ip7DKjUrUk">A practical approach to a holistic digital twin</a>” to the October 2022 IEEE Software Technology Conference. (DOI Bookmark:&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/STC55697.2022.00030">10.1109/STC55697.2022.00030</a>) </p>



<p>WiderPoV: Digital transformation is bottlenecked by interop problems. Interoperability is being held up by concerns of data security and privacy. “We don’t compete, we complete each other.” Using SSI establishes a chain of trust, enabling integration of siloed data sets. Lubna explained “Let’s say a chip goes into an engine that goes into a pacemaker, in a human. How does your twin of the pacemaker let you trace all the way down to its components.” The IPC-2551 electronics industry standard can be paired with decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials to let digital twins provide trust and provenance across silos.</p>



<p>We also presented this to the <a href="https://www.gsaglobal.org/iot/ties/">Global Semiconductor Trusted IoT Ecosystem Security</a> (TIES) group in November. </p>

 Shea’s Clinical Internet of Things leadership 



 

 



<p><a href="https://wider.team/team/michaelshea/">Michael Shea</a> shepherded the IEEE P2933 Trust &amp; Identity team to final draft on their chapter in the <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/2933/7592/">Clinical Internet of Things (IoT) Data and Device Interoperability with TIPPSS – Trust, Identity, Privacy, Protection, Safety, Security</a> standard. </p>



<p>WiderPoV: Within a device, “identity of components” is the same as “traceability,” from circuit board parts to modular components. This is another area for security compromise and risk in sensitive devices. A future direction: integrating DIDs and Verifiable Credentials into electronics manufacturing processes. </p>



 IHSCM presentation  



<p><a href="https://wider.team/team/damianglover/">Damian Glover</a> and <a href="https://wider.team/team/mmc/">Michael Morgan-Curran</a> presented to the <a href="https://ihm.org.uk/">Institute of Health And Social Care Managers</a> about how the digitisation of care is impacting healthcare professionals, and how healthcare organisations can support them. We looked at how integrating high assurance digital identity into digital health apps and backend systems can help improve the caregiver experience. </p>







<p>WiderPoV: “High assurance digital identity promotes confident telehealth interactions by providing automatic know-your-patient and know-your-doctor capabilities. It supports appropriate care decisions by letting providers trust data from remote devices.” </p>



 New DIF IoT SIG, new leadership, building on a year of work at Sovrin. 



<p><a href="https://wider.team/team/damianglover/">Damian Glover</a> and <a href="https://wider.team/team/lubnadajani/">Lubna Dajani</a> started steering the new <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/SIG-IoT">Decentralized Identity Foundation Internet of Things Special Interest Group</a> at the end of 2022. Bi-weekly tempo in Q1. The <a href="https://discord.gg/xG2ZeXX6">IoT Sig Discord</a> channel. Ongoing theme: SSI in <a href="https://wider.team/tag/digital-twins/">digital twins</a>,.</p>



<p>Damian: “This is an exciting opportunity to influence how DIDs and VCs are integrated within the internet of things, and to accelerate adoption.”  </p>



 Wider at European Identity Conference 



<p>“<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5096/2">In Transition – From Platforms to Protocols</a>” drew an appreciative crowd for Wider’s <a href="https://wider.team/team/michaelshea/">Michael Shea</a> and Danube Tech’s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/markus-sabadello-353a0821/">Markus Sabadello</a> at EIC 2022 in Berlin. “Only a few years ago the identity ecosystem seemed to be ‘set’ with little chance for change or dislocation of the large federated identity providers. Today the entire identity technology ecosystem is in flux. What will emerge? OIDC? OIDC/SIOP? DIDComm?” </p>



<p>WiderPoV: The changing protocol landscape and shifting identity power centers means we are living in a heterogeneous world where standards are the key to building interoperability and nurturing ecosystems.</p>



 Wider at Grad School 



<p>Damian Glover and Michael Shea gave a Masterclass on the identity of things at the April <a href="https://www.bayes.city.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2022/april/bayes-mba-london-symposium-2022-kicks-off-looking-into-londons-post-covid-role-on-the-world-stage">Bayes MBA London Symposium 2022</a>. It was “about developments in digital identification and the need for decentralised systems to achieve supply chain efficiencies and facilitate ‘reusable, verifiable and universal’ characteristics of online identity.”</p>



<p>WiderPoV: “Someone asked about sanctions on Russia and if SSI affected the ability to implement them and prevent sanction dodging.” (Not so much. Yet.) </p>



 AI Ethics Talk 



<p><a href="https://wider.team/team/lubnadajani/">Lubna Dajani</a> spoke on <a href="https://www.academia.edu/79546094/Smart_cities_through_the_lens_of_human_rights">Smart Cities Through The Lens of Human Rights</a> (paper). </p>



<p>WiderPoV: Injecting “liability regimes” into large projects should help their civic and industrial ecosystems improve accountability in ways that preserve public confidence. </p>



 Wider at Future Identity  



<p>Michael Shea moderated a panel on the Future Identity stage at the Fintech Talents Festival in the City of London. “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/digital-id-driving-data-quality-up-healthcare-costs-down-widerteam/?trackingId=8vPjtJG1RqqdS6TI5Ifwpw%3D%3D">Leveraging Digital Identity In Healthcare</a>” featured <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-mccann/">Maria McCann</a>, who is leading implementation of the Individual Health Identifier (IHI) at the Health Service Executive in Ireland; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/iain-mccallum-96640818/">Iain McCallum</a> at techUK, which is being consulted by DCMS on the UK Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gillan-ward-7724706/">Gillan Ward</a> from ID Crowd, which is working on a framework enabling NHS Trusts to use digital credentials issued by other Trusts during staff onboarding; and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaychopard/">Kay Chopard</a> of Kantara Initiative.</p>

 The ethical use of human generated data 



<p><a href="https://wider.team/team/lubnadajani/">Lubna Dajani</a> gave an ethics talk to the IEEE SA P2895 standards group (<a href="https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/2895/10319/">Standard Taxonomy for Responsible Trading of Human-Generated Data</a>) in November. Themes included whether human-generated data is personal property under law, which human-generated data can be traded (or not) and how to address privacy concerns when trading human-generated data. </p>



 Workshop on catalyzing change  



<p><a href="https://wider.team/team/lubnadajani/">Lubna Dajani</a> designed and hosted <a href="https://catalysingchangeweek.catalyst2030.net/events/catalysing-change-from-humankind-to-kindhuman/">a workshop</a><a href="https://catalysingchangeweek.catalyst2030.net/events/catalysing-change-from-humankind-to-kindhuman/"> at the 2022 Catalyzing Change Week</a>. “Humanity is in a state of flux. Digitization, Decentralization, and Decarbonization are disrupting every sector. … Achieving a sustainably prosperous society can be as simple as choosing to shift where we place emphasis and measure value. Do we want to continue to be the humankind we were taught to be or the ‘kind human’ we can be?” </p>

 Problems with Passwords 
<p>Are passwords the weakest link in cybersecurity? We all know that it is risky to authenticate workers, citizens, and customers with passwords. The proof is in the seemingly endless list of credential-based security breaches that we see in the news every day.<br>
There is also no doubting the devastating business impact of these breaches. It’s estimated that the average ransomware payment reaches almost $1.5 million and the average cost of business interruption from ransomware tops $5 million, according to a Lockton report.<br>
But what is actually the root cause of all of these breaches? Passwords really aren’t the problem. It’s anonymous users hiding behind compromised credentials that represent the weakest link in cyber security.<br>
What can we use instead of passwords that will prevent these breaches and keep our workforce, citizens, and customers safe? And when we finally decide to go passwordless, what should our strategy be? If eliminating passwords isn’t enough, what are the three things that are missing in your current passwordless strategy?</p>
 1. Password Reset 
<p>When you go passwordless, it’s almost impossible to get rid of all of your passwords simultaneously. That’s why it’s important to build a password reset mechanism into your passwordless strategy. With BlockID Workforce, the user never has to contact the help desk to reset a legacy password. Instead, all a user needs to do is open the account screen on his or her BlockID application, select the persona associated with the invalid password, enter and confirm a new password, and authenticate with LiveID. Not only does self-service password reset create a substantially easier user experience, it also saves your company $50-$70 each time a user doesn’t need to contact the help desk to reset their password. Another benefit with 1Kosmos legacy password self-service is that in less than 30 minutes, BlockID can integrate with your workstation, network, cloud apps, remote access solutions, or identity platforms.</p>
 2. Interoperability 
<p>You work with a multitude of platforms, all with a multitude of requirements and technologies, making it difficult to scale, securely manage, and modernize. Today one of the biggest challenges organizations face is interoperability. Interoperability is one of the limiting factors to digital transformations and passwordless experiences. You need to blend the new with the old to deliver services and data securely and efficiently. But how? You can’t rip and replace everything as that’s cost-prohibitive. When looking to new security standards your investment needs to look beyond the problem at hand. Many times when asking prospects what their 1-3-5 year road map is, they don’t have one, and that’s a problem. Without a plan, we end up with siloed infrastructures held together with duct tape and hope. So when investing in new technologies there are a couple of questions you need to ask yourself:</p>
 
 Is it built on modern architectures, and will it meet demands beyond my current needs? 
 Does it have open APIs and an SDK so that you can integrate with new and old technologies? 
 Can it scale to meet current and future requirements? 
 Is it certified? Does the technology adhere to industry standards and regulations like – ISO/IEC 27001, Kantara for Identity Proofing, FIDO for Passwordless and iBeta Biometric certification, etc.? 
 
<p>Answering these questions can set you on the path to success as you’ll implement a technology that is fit for purpose and will grow with the business. You’ll be able to connect the old with the new while you continue down your modernization path keeping everything online, accessible and secure.</p>
 3. Identity 
<p>Identity is the foundational element to security. It’s critical you know who is accessing resources, so you can better determine what they should or shouldn’t have access to. The more you know about that identity the better. That’s why the 1Kosmos BlockID platform ensures that individuals are who they claim to be by using an identity-based approach to authentication. We bring worker, citizen, and customer identity into the security perimeter so that organizations know with certainty who is accessing IT assets and online services.<br>
This means we have a quick and convenient way for users to self verify their identity using government, telco, and banking credentials. Then, once verified, workers, citizens, and customers use their digital identity to be utilized at login or transaction approval. This provides users with a frictionless experience and organizations with a high level of assurance for the identity on the other side of the digital connection.<br>
By adding identity as a key pillar to network security, we help CISOs and Digital Experience leaders regain control of their IT services from anonymous users hiding behind compromised logins. With identity based authentication, organizations will no longer be held hostage to data breaches, ransomware, and financial fraud perpetrated via identity deception.</p>
<p>Are you interested in learning more? Edward Amoroso and I dig much deeper into all three of these points in our on-demand webinar, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/webinars/identity-based-authentication-journey-to-passwordless/">Identity-Based Authentication and the Journey to Passwordless</a>. Watch the session to explore passwordless security, zero trust, and understanding who is on the other side of your digital connections.</p>

<p>With the expected date of Holochain’s first-ever beta release this week, I thought it’d be good to go into the sequence of events that are coming before and after that moment. If you’re a developer who’s been waiting for stability before you jump into developing hApps, or if you’ve got an existing codebase and have put it on pause, this will tell you when you can jump back in.</p><blockquote>Keep in mind that this is our best estimate of timelines; things may roll out slightly differently depending on what we encounter. In a project like this, there’s a big difference between “we’ve made a release” and “our whole ecosystem of dev tools is ready for you to use”. So there’ll be a bit of time after the release date as we update all the dependencies.</blockquote><p>After that, I’ll share some release notes for updates that’ve happened since <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/time-to-start-testing-your-happs/">last Dev Pulse</a>. Note that these are still just release candidates, so they’ll only be relevant if you’ve been keeping up with them in order to help us hunt for bugs and missing features in the leadup to beta.</p><p>And lastly, <a href="https://www.holochain.org/holochain-developer-training-2/">we've got another developer course coming up!</a> If you wanted to attend the first one but couldn't, now's your chance — it's all online and happening in March.</p> Releasing a full DWeb app dev stack, piece by piece <p>Because Holochain is a full development stack for P2P apps, dev tools are important. And with every change in the core runtime and its APIs, all those tools have to be updated and re-released. We learned a lot of valuable stuff about what this means after our <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/full-featured-holochain-beta-rc/">first release candidate</a> in December — it was the first time we tried to update all the components in sync with each other. It became a dress rehearsal for 0.1.0-beta, and we feel well prepared now.</p><p>Last week we released Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.3 and rc.4. We intend for rc.4 to be the final one before beta, which should happen later in the week — 26 January is the date we’re aiming for.</p><p>‘Beta release’ means simply that there will be an <code>0.1.0</code> release tag on <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/releases/">GitHub</a> (note the absence of <code>-beta</code>), along with downloadable source code so you can compile your own binaries.</p><p>After that, devs will be able to update all the things that depend on it — specifically developer and user tooling. We’re anticipating that this will take a couple weeks, which should mean that everything will be ready to use by 9 February.</p><p>Here’s a roughly sequential list of everything that needs to happen for a ‘minimum usable release’:</p>  Holochain 0.1.0 release: A particular commit in the Git history is marked as the official release. It includes the conductor runtime, the host SDKs (HDI and HDK), the proxy service binary, and the <code>hc</code> dev tool. You’ll be able to see it on our <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/releases/">GitHub releases page</a> and download the source code to compile yourself. Binaries will appear on crates.io a day or two afterward, along with the <a href="https://docs.rs/hdi">HDI</a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk">HDK</a>, and <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api">conductor API</a> documentation reference.  The <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js">JavaScript</a> and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-rust">Rust</a> clients, for building application front-ends, will be updated, released, and made available on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@holochain/client">NPM</a> and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/holochain_client">crates.io</a>. Many core parts of the dev and user ecosystem rely on these clients.  The <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama">Tryorama</a> test framework, used to write tests for your hApps and ours, will be updated, released, and made available on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@holochain/tryorama">NPM</a>.  After the above components are updated, the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/scaffolding">scaffolder</a>’s templates will be updated to include any changes. This is a new iteration of our rapid app development tool that can generate boilerplate back-end and front-end code for your hApp, along with tests and a Holonix dev environment setup to match your project’s Holochain dependencies.  The <code>hc launch</code> dev command will be updated. This runs a bare-bones version of the Launcher to provide a minimal conductor environment, UI, and one or more agent nodes to test your full hApp.  <a href="https://github.com/holochain/devhub">DevHub</a>, a hApp package repo (that’s right, a hApp for distributing hApps) will be updated to support any changes in Holochain, and will be incorporated into the Launcher. Internal QA testing will make sure it all works.  The <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher">Launcher</a>, an easy-to-use container for downloading and running hApps, will be updated and released, with installers for Linux, macOS, and Windows available on GitHub. Launcher includes DevHub so devs can upload apps and users can download them.  <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holonix">Holonix</a>, a shell environment that includes all the software needed to develop and test hApps, will be updated to include all of the above. It will be made available via the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/install">quick start installation</a> method.  Time to start building!   Holochain release notes  Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.3: Bugfixes, zome name included in signals <p>Release date: 17 January 2023<br>HDI compatibility: 0.2.0-beta-rc.1, 0.2.0-beta-rc.2<br>HDK compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.1, 0.1.0-beta-rc.2<br>Breaking changes: app API</p><p>This is mostly a bugfix release, with one breaking change requested by hApp developers.</p>  Breaking (app API): App-generated signals now include the name of the zome that generated them, along with the existing cell ID. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1750">#1750</a>)  New/bugfix: Pressing Ctrl+C on the command line gracefully shuts down the conductor, processing and cleaning up remaining cell tasks. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1761">#1761</a>)  Bugfix: Calling <code>emit_signal</code>` from a <code>post_commit</code> callback caused a panic; now it succeeds. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1749">#1749</a>)  Bugfix: Disabling and re-enabling an app caused all of its cells to become unresponsive when it tried to access the DHT. This happened because the agent had a zero storage arc when they rejoined; now their storage arc is recreated. Known issue: cells are still occasionally unresponsive when they’re re-enabled; the workaround is to disable and re-enable the whole hApp again. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1749">#1744</a>)   Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.4: WASM metering, host API versioning, bundle format change <p>Release date: 20 January 2023<br>HDI compatibility: 0.2.0-beta-rc.1 to 0.2.0-beta-rc.3<br>HDK compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.3<br>Breaking changes: admin API, app API, host API, hApp bundles, HDK</p><p>In addition to some new and clarified content in the documentation (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1778">#1778</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1765">#1765</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1767">#1767</a>), there are a few bugfixes and some low-level WASM, host interface, and bundling format changes that will require rebuilding your hApp but probably won’t require you to modify your code.</p>  Breaking (host API): Functions in the host interface are now versioned, and are also prefixed differently. For instance, <code>__zome_info</code> becomes <code>__hc__zome_info_1</code> until its signature changes. This helps end-user hApp managers like Launcher and DevHub manage conductor/app compatibility. If you’re using the HDI and HDK, this will not require code changes; the names of the functions you use will stay the same (e.g., <code>zome_info</code>) and simply point to the newest supported underlying host function. You will need to recompile your zomes though, and of course if you’re bypassing HDI/HDK and calling the external functions directly, you will need to change your code. Also note that guest callbacks such as <code>validate()</code> are not yet versioned. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1781">#1781</a> and holochain-wasmer <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-wasmer/pull/90">#90</a>)  New, possibly breaking (hApps): WebAssembly metering has been re-enabled, this time increased from 10 to 100 giga-ops. This means that, after 100 billion WASM instructions, any zome call or callback will terminate, preventing buggy or malicious zomes from using up a machine’s resources. While this is 10× higher than the previous limit, we’re still asking you to test your code to see if it hits this limit. Also note that you’ll need to recompile your zomes, as the means of getting and setting input and output data has changed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1781">#1781</a> and holochain-wasmer <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-wasmer/pull/88">#88</a>)  Breaking (admin API, hApp bundles): The <code>resources</code> of a bundle are now encoded as byte arrays rather than sequences of numbers, changing the format of hApp bundles. You’ll need to repackage your hApps to update them. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1723">#1723</a>)  Breaking (app API): Each <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/0.1.0-beta-rc.4/holochain_conductor_api/enum.CellInfo.html"><code>CellInfo</code></a> variant has its own cell type now: <code>Cell</code> is split into <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/0.1.0-beta-rc.4/holochain_conductor_api/struct.ProvisionedCell.html"><code>ProvisionedCell</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/0.1.0-beta-rc.4/holochain_conductor_api/struct.ProvisionedCell.html"><code>ClonedCell</code></a>. Additionally, <code>CellInfo</code> enum variants are snake-cased during de-/serialization. The <code>CreateCloneCell</code> and <code>EnableCloneCell</code> endpoints now return <code>ClonedCell</code> instead of <code>InstalledCell</code>. The unimplemented endpoint <code>SignalSubscription</code> has also been removed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1763">#1763</a>)  Breaking (app API): The <code>AppInfo</code> endpoint now includes the agent public key used to instantiate the app in its return value. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1786">#1786</a>)  Breaking (admin API): The <code>StartApp</code> endpoint, meant as a companion to the already removed <code>PauseApp</code>, has been removed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1785">#1785</a>)  Breaking (HDK): Links returned from <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.1.0-beta-rc.3/hdk/link/fn.get_links.html"><code>get_links</code></a> now contain the agent key of the author. Note: this means that otherwise identical links (that is, whose base, tag, and target are the same) are not deduplicated, unlike entries. This was the behaviour already; the new <code>author</code> field merely makes that more explicit. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1782">#1782</a>)  Bugfix: When you tried to install a hApp for an existing agent and one of the cells being created already existed in another hApp, it would allow it. Now it returns an error. This error was unlikely to be encountered in daily use, because the usual method of installing a new hApp involves creating a new agent. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1773">#1773</a>)  Bugfix: Disabled clone cells were being reenabled on conductor restart; now they stay disabled. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1775">#1775</a>)  Improvements: The number of warnings in the conductor log has been reduced (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1779">#1779</a>) and failed zome call errors have gotten more informative (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1783">#1783</a>).  <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20230120225800">Read the full changelogs</a> for the last two releases.</p> Known issues   There are still intermittent issues with re-enabled hApps becoming unresponsive when they’re trying to access their DHTs. The current workaround is to disable and re-enable the hApp again.  Disabling cells should now make them unresponsive, but some activity will continue in the background, namely they will continue to gossip. We intend to release a fix for this soon, though it may not go into the beta.  As mentioned above, the new WASM metering might cause CPU-heavy zome functions to terminate early. This is not a bug but a new constraint to test your code against. We’re currently testing it against our own DevHub, which does some CPU-heavy data crunching in its zomes.   Client release notes  Javascript client 0.11.10: Signal handler changes, updated types <p>Release date: 11 Jan 2023<br>Holochain compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.2</p>  New/breaking: App-generated signals now carry the name of the zome they were generated by.  Breaking: A lot of changes have been made to various admin and app API types.  Breaking: The final parameter, a signal-handling callback, has been removed from WebSocket-based connection-establishing functions, leaving only the traditional JavaScript-style <code>.on("signal", cb)</code> event-registering function.  Changed: All Launcher environment properties are now optional.  Bugfix: Signals are now only emitted to the <code>AppAgentClient</code> that is set up to communicate with the cell the signals came from.   JavaScript client 0.11.11: Async crypto imports <p>Release date: 14 Jan 2023<br>Holochain compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.2</p>  New: Utility functions that depend on crypto are now imported asynchronously.   JavaScript client 0.11.14: Zome name in signals, API documentation <p>Release date: 19 Jan 2023<br>Holochain compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.3</p>  New/breaking: App-generated signals now carry the name of the zome they were generated by.  Bugfix: The cell provisioning strategy type for clone cells has been fixed.  New: The API now has auto-generated documentation, available <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/blob/develop/docs/client.md">in the GitHub repo</a>.   JavaScript client 0.11.15: Bundle resource serialisation change <p>Release date: 23 Jan 2023<br>Holochain compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.4</p><p>The changes in this version are all to keep compatibility with the rc.4 release of Holochain.</p>  New/breaking: In-line binary resources in a hApp bundle passed to <code>InstallApp</code> are now encoded in a <code>UInt8Array</code> rather than an array of numbers.  Breaking: <code>CreateCloneCell</code> and <code>EnableCloneCell</code> return a <code>ClonedCell</code> object instead of <code>InstallledCell</code>.  Breaking: The unused admin API endpoint <code>StartApp</code> has been removed.  Breaking: Wherever <code>Cell</code> was previously returned from an API end point, it’s now a union type that can be either a <code>ProvisionedCell</code> or <code>ClonedCell</code>.  Breaking: <code>CellInfo</code> variants are renamed to snake case.  <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/releases">Read the full changelogs</a>.</p> Test framework release notes  Tryorama 0.10.2: <code>AppAgentWebsocket</code> exposed <p>Release date: 15 Jan 2023<br>JavaScript client compatibility: 0.11.11<br>Holochain compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.2</p><p>Along with an update to the JavaScript client, this release brings:</p>  New: The <code>AppAgentWebsocket</code> is available to the local conductor object via a <code>conductor.appAgentWs()</code> getter function. This is now used by default by <code>Scenario.addPlayerWithApp()</code>.  Removed: In line with the JS client update, signals no longer have <code>type</code> and <code>data</code> properties.   Tryorama 0.10.3 and 0.10.4: JS client updates   0.10.3, released on 16 Jan 2023, updates to the unreleased bugfix JS client 0.11.12.  0.10.4, released on 16 Jan 2023, updates to the unreleased bugfix JS client 0.11.13.   Known issues <p>Tryorama hasn’t yet been updated to support the breaking changes in Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.4.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/releases">Read the full changelogs</a>.</p> Holochain Developer Training again — this time it’s online! <p>A lot of people have asked us when there’ll be another dev training course, and specifically when there’ll be an online one. Well, we now have an answer for you: in March! It’ll be a six-day course spread out over two (long) weekends, and will have the same all-day intensive format as the in-person course last July.</p><p>This course won’t cover Rust, so it’ll be the best fit if you’re already familiar with Rust and are ready to jump right into Holochain. If you want to learn Rust so you can attend, the Rust website has three great <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/learn">getting-started resources</a>.</p><p>Having attended the course in July (mostly to take photos and cook soup), I can say that the instructors have created a really effective course. Their goal is to leave nobody behind, and the lead facilitator Marcus has developed a unique course format over the last decade to do exactly that. He co-founded and led the famous <a href="https://www.hackreactor.com/">Hack Reactor</a> boot camp, which enjoys a remarkable amount of success equipping devs to be ready to build real software. Marcus and his co-facilitators are really excited to be adapting this format for teaching Holochain.</p><p>Learn more about the course on <a href="https://www.hackreactor.com/">our website</a> and <a href="https://www.holochain.org/holochain-developer-training-2/">apply here</a>.</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/fr/@spacex?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> SpaceX</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/uj3hvdfQujI?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

  <p>Privacy was a major topic of conversation in 2022 — beyond just keeping personal data out of the hands of cybercriminals. Privacy now ties into many adjacent areas, including Zero Trust security, antitrust concerns, usage of services provided by "Big Tech," and biometric authentication. As the conversation around privacy progresses beyond a focus on security infrastructure and best practices for preventing data breaches, regulations are working to catch up.</p>

<p>In 2023, the larger implications of privacy — including the ethics of using artificial intelligence (AI) and biometrics, the management of consumer-to-business relationships, and public issues such as consumer protection — will become much clearer through regulatory and legal action.</p>

<p>With today marking the start of Data Privacy Week, and <a href="https://staysafeonline.org/programs/2023-data-privacy-week-champions/">ForgeRock proudly championing</a> the cause, it's an ideal time to explore what to expect now and in the future in the evolving world of data privacy.</p>

 A Whole New World of AI, Consent, and Personal Data Management 

<p>What if AI could be used to power user consent, making life easier for individuals and businesses alike by enabling "smart" choices at the right moments? Offering personal data controls through AI could turn the tables on ethical concerns about this technology. A challenge is that privacy regulations typically expect consent to be concrete — explicit and specific to a purpose — and they look askance at automated data processing.</p>

<p>This is where the new UK <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/lawful-basis-for-processing/consent/">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR) offers hope. This bill allows for "automatic consent," which opens the door to more abstract forms of user permission that can smartly bundle up related usage patterns for consent and make it easier to manage consent in IoT environments, such as home automation and connected cars.</p>

<p>As organizations navigate the complex new world of AI, we recommend the following best practices to remain compliant and bolster data privacy measures:</p>

  Make user permissions for initial data sharing necessary and meaningful. That means letting people choose – and change their minds –&nbsp;without constraints or pressure. Allowing people to make consent decisions at times far removed from critical data-sharing moments and offering dashboards for monitoring and revoking consent help to make consent more meaningful. 
	 Enable data permissions that usefully anticipate the user's intentions. It may be impossible for an individual to say "yes" or "no" honestly to each request for data collection in the course of an average day, particularly when interacting with smart devices. Being asked for consent for a new purpose of use while in the middle of navigating one's car, for example, could be an extremely dangerous experience. Therefore, identity and access management (IAM) technologies and other systems must generalize rules for permissions and anticipate the user's intentions. This is where AI-first data management will derive new consents based on previously granted permissions, or by offering users simplified consent options that will justify actions for related permissions. 
	 Design AI-enabled permission experiences that can grow as the data collected about the user grows. Permissions need to scale so that the sheer amounts of data collected and generated by users, services, and devices can be automated and empower users to make more informed choices about the use of their data. 
  What's Next? Data Privacy Takes Center Stage in 2023 and Beyond 

<p>With the new year officially upon us, and with data privacy finding common cause with trends such as Zero Trust security, consumer protection, and even Web3, we're predicting that privacy makes dramatic inroads as a motivator for every organizational stakeholder, enabling solutions that address multiple problems at once. Here are some predictions about these adjacent areas:</p>

  More passwordless authentication: As organizations take advantage of digital wallets for payment, biometric authentication, and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/passwordless-authentication">passwordless authentication</a>, we can expect to see more pressure on technologists to adapt. They must ensure high authentication assurances in every user journey, while keeping the customer experience within and across channels seamless. 
	 Decentralized identity will get a boost: This year, decentralized identity will solidify its role in society as wallet technology becomes more broadly adopted for identity purposes. This will open up opportunities both for strong, passwordless authentication to merge with wallet tech and for better methods for user control of personal information. 
	 AI at the heart of identity: In 2023, we'll see increased adoption of AI to secure identity and access management. AI, when made explainable and when appropriately paired with human oversight, has the potential not only to make identity safer for consumers and employees, but also to improve the lives of the cybersecurity professionals who must make sense of massive amounts of data. 
 <p>Let's make 2023 the year enterprises step up to become leaders in privacy — to compete, not just comply, and take proactive action to better secure and respect the personal information in their custody.</p>

				<p>At Trinsic we believe in a “one tap future” where people can prove statements with a single click of a button and gain access to what they need. Past attempts at this vision have had to compromise on privacy by using things like “sign in with Facebook”, leading to user data centralized on big technology company servers. Emerging technology standards like <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-are-verifiable-credentials/">verifiable credentials</a> and <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-basics-what-are-decentralized-identifiers-dids/">decentralized identifiers</a> present the opportunity to put users at the center of their internet experience, while offering more convenience and ease of use.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Great Product Experiences Are Key to Adoption  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>The standards, protocols, and infrastructure for using verifiable credentials are ready to support millions of people every day, but we haven’t seen adoption take off yet. In short, it’s because it’s been very hard to build great product experiences until recently.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Requiring users to download new applications and scan QR codes was how many decentralized identity platforms, Trinsic included, have shown proofs of concept. The <a href="https://trinsic.id/moving-toward-identity-technology-ready-for-mass-adoption/">user experience that is ready for mass adoption</a>&nbsp;is one that is more seamless for the everyday internet user and offers major convenience benefits without sacrificing privacy.</p><p>When a user accesses an app powered by Trinsic, they don’t have to make an account, create a username, or remember a password. They simple enter an identifier (like an email), verify ownership of that identifier, and now they can utilize any credentials associated with it.</p>

				<p>The need for better digital identity spans industries from education to workforce to social media, healthcare, finance, and more. Because of this, most entrepreneurs and developers won’t always define what they’re building by its implications for identity. Instead, the most successful builders are hyperfocused on solving a specific user problem in a given niche. So here’s our guide on how to get started and help usher in a new wave of IDtech products that put users at the center of their identities and come with privacy and consent built-in.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Step 1: Define the Niche Problem You Want to Tackle  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Every great idea starts with a focused audience. Facebook started on a singular college campus, where it captured significant market and expanded out from there. Here are a few sample problems you could tackle with verifiable credentials, but recognize that even if you choose one of these ideas, you will have to narrow it down to a more specific problem and audience.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sample identity problems in specific sectors:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Education: Students don’t have ownership of their diplomas and must request them from institutions whenever they apply for a new job.  Workforce: Anyone can claim anything on LinkedIn, like saying they went to a certain college or worked at a certain company even if the information is false.  Social media: You can’t prove and reward fans based on how early they followed you and supported your content.  Healthcare: Every time you go to a new doctor’s office you have to fill in lots of repetitive paperwork.  Finance: You have to re-scan your license or passport every time you want to open a different account.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>These are all problems that entrepreneurs could address by building an IDtech product. If you’re serious about starting a company, you’ll want to do customer interviews, talking to dozens of people to more deeply understand the problems they face. But for now, let’s imagine you’re already an expert in one of these fields, you’ve done the user research, and you have a unique insight that you’re going to translate into a product.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Step 2: Formulate Your Value Proposition  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Once you’ve developed a deep understanding of a specific problem, now you have to imagine the kind of solution that would solve this problem. Carrying forward our sample identity problems from before, here are some potential value propositions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sample value propositions in different sectors:<br><br></p>  Education: Giving students ownership of their diplomas will make it easier for them to prove their learning achievements.  Workforce: Utilizing verifiable credentials to prove your work history on a social media site like LinkedIn would make hiring more efficient.  Social media: Allowing fans to prove their loyalty and fanhood will let creators reward their supporters for finding them early.  Healthcare: Giving patients an easy way to hold their medical history and selectively share relevant information will reduce friction in getting quality healthcare.  Finance: Storing a verifiable credential of your proven identity would allow you to more seamlessly access and open new accounts.  <p><br>These are the types of insights that you could start prototyping concepts around using Trinsic’s platform. Since you’ve defined a problem and imagined a potential solution, the next step is to start sketching out how the product interactions would look.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Step 3: Determine the Information You’re Going to Represent as a Verifiable Credential 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>At the core of any IDtech company is giving users ownership of their information in the form of a verifiable credential. For each of the potential scenarios above, there is a foundational credential that would begin to unlock value for the user. In the education example, you might be representing a diploma as a credential. Or in the social media example, you are going to allow users to prove that they followed a creator in their first year of being on YouTube.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In <a href="https://dashboard.trinsic.id/">Trinsic’s dashboard</a>, you can define a verifiable credential schema, specifying the data types and which fields are required and optional in the credential. In the provable fanhood example, your credential schema could be something simple like:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Fan username  Creator username  Date followed  					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Step 4: Determine Your Data Source + Start Issuing 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Once you’ve defined a credential template, you’ll need to figure out how you’re going to populate credentials with the correct information. If you’re in the proof of concept stage, you can issue credentials manually through the Trinsic dashboard. As you develop your use case further, you will likely need to integrate with other APIs or existing databases in order to programmatically populate credential information and issue them to the corresponding users.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once you have this all set, you can start issuing credentials. Right now you can issue credentials to a user’s email, and they’ll receive a notification that they have a new credential. The real value comes from utilizing the credential though, so the critical next step is building out the verification experience.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Step 5: Build Your First Verification Experience  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>The point of putting information in a verifiable credential is so someone can present it, prove a statement, and gain access to something they want. So what will you give your user access to? It depends on the use case, but let’s first think about the social media example. If you’re a creator, maybe you will give your first 100 YouTube followers access to a merchandise store with a 50% discount applied.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this case, you’re going to build a way for an e-commerce store to show a discount based on information shared in a credential. Luckily we already built a demo of how this would work with our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.notion.so/Interactive-demo-idea-gathering-04ef351a5a694ea3b710b4c12c5c2612">OkeyDoke</a>&nbsp;e-commerce store.&nbsp;</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Step 6. Consider Trust and Governance  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Now that you have a rough prototype of how you will issue credentials and how users can verify them to gain access to something they want, you’ve probably realized there is an opportunity for fraud here. Without a list of trusted credential issuers, what is to stop someone else from issuing themselves a credential that “proves” they were one of the first 100 subscribers on YouTube?</p><p><br>Trinsic’s <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-basics-what-is-a-trust-registry/">trust registry</a> service and dashboard governance feature make trust establishment easy. The core function here is to establish a list of which issuers are allowed to issue which credential schemas. Once you’ve put your trust registry in place, credential verifications will fail if the issuer is not trusted to issue the schema that is being checked. While the potential for abuse in a testing environment is relatively low, once your application launches to more users, you will have to carefully consider the implications of how your trust ecosystem is designed.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Step 7. Test and Get Feedback on the Product  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Building out your proof of concept is just the first step toward developing a successful IDtech product. Hopefully with Trinsic’s platform you’ll be able to spin up prototypes in a matter of weeks, rather than months. This gives your team more time to seek feedback from early users and potential customers in order to refine the experience. Being able to show early traction and even beta customers can be the strongest proof point when pitching to investors.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 We Need Great Identity Products 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>It’s time we take identity back from big technology companies and put users at the center of the internet experience. If you’re considering building an identity product, this framework should help you prioritize what’s important to get your ideas to market.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The one tap future is coming. The opportunity of a generation is building products that establish digital trust and bring more safety and privacy online.

There are thousands dotted around the countryside making horse shoes, stirrups, ploughs, pitchforks, shovels and so on. Every manor has&nbsp;one.</p><p>Now fast forward to today, a society and economy dependent on metal working in bridges, skyscrapers, cars, trains, planes and cranes, plus a phantasmagorical array of machines, gadgets, utensils and devices enabling us to do a breathtaking range of&nbsp;things.</p><p>You could say nothing has changed. After all, it’s all just metalworking isn’t it? Or you could say our world has been utterly transformed. The nature, scale and scope of metalworking today makes it qualitatively different to what came&nbsp;before.</p><p>The same is happening today with data. People have gathered, shared and used information ever since there were people to do so. Today, we have data gatherers and users dotted right across our land — a myriad of different organisations and service providers collecting and using personal data to do a wide range of things. Like mediaeval blacksmiths. Yet in many ways, compared to what’s still to come, it’s just a tiny beginning.</p> Just imagine <p>As with that blacksmith, many people find it hard to imagine or countenance the changes that are now unfolding.</p><p>This is the realm of innovation and growth — two words that are bandied about so casually and so often that often they’re little more than meaningless cliches. Yet the innovation and growth that’s now being made possible by the personal data store — new ways of collecting and using personal data — are real and important. Just like today’s metalworking versus that of yesteryear.</p><p>Four critical developments are now coming together to trigger an explosion in personal data-driven innovation. They&nbsp;are:</p>  Radical cost reductions <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-vital-issue-people-avoid-talking-about-ed4c36a7de93">made possible by personal data stores</a> stripping out the FERC (friction, effort, risk and cost) of data use by enabling its safe, efficient sharing and re-use. (Most people don’t think of this as ‘innovation’, but as we explain below, it’s the essential foundation and&nbsp;driver.)  Making individuals the point of integration of data about themselves. Currently with today’s data systems, individuals’ data is dispersed across the hundreds of separate, different organisations that collect data about them, With each organisation jealousy guarding the data it has collected, it can never be brought together to create a rich, rounded picture of that individual (without creating horrendous privacy problems). This is a fundamental design flaw. It makes it structurally impossible to create a complete, holistic data picture of each individual. By enabling individuals to aggregate data about themselves safely and privately, personal data stores create an entirely new-to-the world, incomparably rich source of data about people and their lives — one that has been impossible to create up to now. It has the potential to act as a sort of ‘stem cell’ driving all future service provision, including a dazzling array of new person-centric services.  A proliferation of new sources of data generation. If you had told that blacksmith that one day you could walk around with a metal device in your pocket that automatically counted the number of steps you take, he’d have said you are barking mad. But every smartphone can do that. And this is just a small beginning of the (highly personal) data that smart, internet of things enabled devices can and will soon be generating.  Individuals in control of their data. Such a world of data proliferation could become — indeed risks becoming — a totalitarian, exploitative nightmare where super-powerful predatory corporations hoover up all the data there is, to exercise control over all and sundry, and extract whatever value they can. But if individuals are empowered with their own data, so that any sharing of such data remains under their control, the nightmare scenario can be avoided and benefits achieved, both efficiently and&nbsp;fairly.  <p>It’s always hard to imagine a world that hasn’t come into being yet. That’s precisely the point about innovation — that it hasn’t happened yet. So what sort of innovations, and growth, are we talking&nbsp;about?</p> Innovation as democratisation <p>The first key point — the one most routinely overlooked — is that ‘innovations’ remain irrelevant until they are democratised. Until that is, they scale by becoming affordable and available to ordinary people. It is this that generates social and economic&nbsp;impact.</p><p>Take the motor car. It remained a plaything of the super rich until Henry Ford found a way to slash its costs of production by well over 90% — so that ordinary people could start buying and using cars. The same is true of every life-changing, transformational innovation: access to electricity, air travel, the internet.</p><p>The Internet was a social and economic irrelevance when it was a tool for geeks working in physics laboratories. Email was marginal when it was only for academics in universities. No matter what technology or innovation you are talking about, unless and until it is made safe, easy to use, affordable, and accessible/available its social and economic impact will be&nbsp;limited.</p><p>That is what personal data stores are doing with personal data: making it safe, easy to access and use at very low cost for all those wanting to use it — individuals themselves and services working for them. Personal data stores are turning something that was once reserved for the super-rich organisation — the collection and use of data — into something everyone can do, every day of their lives. That is transformational in&nbsp;itself.</p> Innovation as enrichment <p>Now factor in the individual as the point of integration of their own data. There are countless services today that either only exist in peoples’ imaginations or eke out a survival in the margins because the costs and complexities of amassing the data needed to provide them are currently too&nbsp;great.</p><p>Take something as simple as financial advice. To provide good financial advice, an advisor needs to access data held by many different parties in many different places (e.g. current accounts, savings accounts, loans, investments, pensions, assets owned, legacies and so on). Today, most of the costs of providing advice are absorbed by the costs of acquiring the data needed to inform it, not of arriving at the advice&nbsp;itself.</p><p>Personal data stores will transform the cost (and quality) of such advice, democratising it as they do so. The same is true of all aspects of our lives. For example: joined up, integrated health and care services that take full account of individuals’ particular genetic make up, medical histories, lifestyles, exercise regimes and so on; or integrated, joined up. life-long skills and career planning services that take full account of all the individual’s educational and training attainments, their personal skills, their work and life experience and their personal goals. And so on. And so&nbsp;on.</p><p>Now add in new sources of data. Not just the Fitbit data that may inform health advice. What about electronic receipts that enable you to automatically record every item you purchase, to see trends, to dig deeper into the quality, materials and provenance of particular items, to manage warranties, build personal asset inventories, compare prices, plan future purchases, identify possible substitutes, and so&nbsp;on?</p><p>You could, for example, generate a carbon footprint of every item purchased and every activity undertaken to identify your personal carbon footprint, with carbon concierge services offering ways of reducing this footprint.</p><p>New sources of data, made available safely and cheaply, making completely new services possible.</p> A social and economic transformation <p>Back in the 20th century, western societies and economies were transformed by what came to be known as the consumer goods revolution. Thanks to the advent of electricity national grids which made universal access to electricity possible, plus a productivity revolution in manufacturing made possible by Henry Ford-style mass production, suddenly people had affordable access to a dazzling array of devices, gadgets, machines and services that transformed their lives: washing machines, fridges, vacuum cleaners, kettles, radios, TVs, central heating, microwaves, computers, mobile phones, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>The washing machine saved (mostly) women seven hours of labour a week. Central heating removed six hours a week shovelling coal and dust. Fridges helped people reduce time spent shopping and food waste. We can’t imagine our lives now without computers, the internet and mobile phones. Providing these new gadgets and devices created new industries with millions of new jobs and tax revenues to&nbsp;boot.</p><p>All this was made possible by democratising the machine. By taking the machine out of the factory where it was held exclusively by organisations and turning it into something that individuals and households could use in their own&nbsp;lives.</p><p>Personal data stores are doing the same with personal data. Democratising it. Taking it out of the organisational database, and turning it into a tool in the hands of individuals.</p><p>The 20th century consumer goods revolution was all about using energy to provide more, better products. The 21st century citizen services revolution will be all about using data to help individuals and households make better decisions and manage their lives better; services built around the unique circumstances and wellbeing of each individual, not the industrial logic of the corporation.</p><p>That is a vast transformation: not only the creation of entirely new services but also a transformation of what every existing service provider does and how, just as industry transformed agriculture). It is a transformation as big as the journey from the mediaeval blacksmith to modern industry.</p><p>It will also, by the way, accelerate the trend towards a net zero economy. That’s the subject of our next&nbsp;blog.</p><p>Other blogs in this series&nbsp;are:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-great-data-delusion-744b40795f73">The Great Data Delusion</a> 19th century doctors thought bloodletting would cure most diseases.

<p>Dear community,</p><p>Metadium started five years ago as a blockchain platform focused on Decentralized Identifier (DID) technology, and it has continued expanding in the web3 market. Over the years, Metadium’s technology has been used in multiple services and solutions, ranging from identification and authentication to mobile payment and transportation services. Our ecosystem is constantly growing and has recently reached industries like logistics, automotive, tourism, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>We are happy to share with you Metadium 2.0’s roadmap as well as the plans for our&nbsp;future:</p> Metadium 2.0 <p>Blockchain Identification for&nbsp;All</p><p>Metadium is an open-source public blockchain that provides identification by issuing, authenticating, inquiring, verifying, and managing history through various services based on decentralized identifier (DID) technology.</p> 1. Platform Technology <p>Ethereum equivalence support and EVM compatibility</p>  The Metadium platform is developed with the expansion of META ID and the availability of smart contracts as a top priority.  Provide EVM compatibility for an easy onboarding process and the smooth processing of tasks (deployment, execution, etc).  Reflect Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) to ensure an environment that promotes Metadium ecosystem’s growth and contributes to the blockchain ecosystem with open source library&nbsp;updates.   2. Governance   Enable active governance operations through an autonomous authority configuration to develop and grow the Metadium ecosystem.  Optimize Metadium’s cloud infrastructure and governance contracts for more active participation and platform utilization of node authority.  Create an environment where everyone interested in blockchain and its services (DApps), including Metadium users, can make suggestions and be considered.  Evolve Metadium’s global vision of DAO organizations with a more professional and detailed operational direction.   3. META ID&nbsp;2.0 <p>Scaling up through META&nbsp;ID</p>  Provide a stable and seamless user experience and META ID smart contracts despite a growing ecosystem and the number of&nbsp;users.  Expand Metadium’s ecosystem with Decentralized ID (META ID) and ID Hub infrastructure.  Provide an environment with functions and information about the decentralized ID (META ID), and ID Hub can be applied to each of the DApp’s settings&nbsp;. It also provides model discovery and functionality that combine blockchain information and user authentication information like META ID user labeling and inter-blockchain VC.  Increase scalability by taking a “Hub” role that connects authentication information, such as user KYC and other credentials, through a Metadium-based bridging technology that can interoperate with other blockchains and services.   4. Development Support   Create an open and developer-friendly environment for onboarding various projects into the ecosystem.  Simplify the onboarding process by providing SDK and open source that can be easily deployed and META ID &amp; ID Hub packages in a library format that includes the W3C standard.  Provide data about Metadium, data flow visualization (API) in META ID and ID Hub, and tools that promote a more transparent and reliable development environment.  <p>Please stay tuned for exciting news, including our DEX, CEX, listings, partnerships, and more. The Metadium Team is constantly working hard to bring innovative services and solutions as well as to expand our ecosystem on the global&nbsp;scene.</p><p>- Metadium&nbsp;Team</p><p>안녕하세요. 메타디움&nbsp;팀입니다.</p><p>5년간 Metadium은 탈중앙화 신원인증 DID(Decentralized Identifier) 기술 분야에서 선도적인 블록체인 메인넷으로 출발하여 Web3 마켓과 생태계와 함께 성장해왔습니다. 메타디움의 기술은 인증, 검증부터 모바일 결제 및 대중교통 서비스에 이르기까지 다양한 서비스와 솔루션에서 수년간 사용되고 있습니다. 메타디움의 생태계는 지속적인 성장을 이루고 있으며 최근 물류, 모빌리티, 관광 등의 산업까지 범위를 넓혀가고&nbsp;있습니다.</p> Metadium 2.0 <p>모두를 위한 신원인증&nbsp;블록체인</p><p>Metadium은 블록체인 서비스 이용자의 신원(탈중앙화 ID)를 통해 발급, 인증, 조회, 검증, 이력관리 등을 수행하며, 신원을 필요로 하는 모든 사람들을 위한 오픈 소스 퍼블릭&nbsp;블록체인입니다.</p> 1. 플랫폼 기술&nbsp;2.0 <p>Ethereum equivalence support and EVM compatibility</p>  메타디움 플랫폼은 META ID의 확장과 스마트 컨트랙트의 가용성을 최우선적으로 고려하여&nbsp;개발합니다.  생태계 진입 편의성 및 원활한 작업 처리(배포, 실행)를 위해 EVM의 호환성을&nbsp;제공합니다.  메타디움은 플랫폼 개발자 생태계 확장을 위해 EIP(Ethereum Improvement Proposals)를 지속 반영하며 오픈 소스 라이브러리 업데이트로 블록체인 기술 생태계에&nbsp;기여합니다.   2. Governance 2.0   Metadium 2.0에서는 기존 Metadium 생태계를 개발하고 성장시키는 것을 목표로 자율적인 Authority 구성을 통해 적극적인 거버넌스 운영이&nbsp;실현됩니다.  노드 Authority의 보다 적극적인 참여와 플랫폼 이용을 위해 Metadium 클라우드 인프라와 거버넌스 컨트랙트 최적화 업무들을 올해&nbsp;진행합니다.

 What is Blockchain Verification &amp; Validation? 
<p>Modern network infrastructure is turning towards decentralized models of record keeping. Authentication and identity management are no different.</p>
<p>What is blockchain verification? Blockchain verification uses private blockchain technology to store and verify identity credentials.</p>
 What Is a Blockchain? 
<p>A blockchain is a relatively new ledger and database technology invented to support decentralized information management. Initially conceived by Satoshi Nakamoto in their Bitcoin whitepaper, the blockchain serves as a solution to two specific problems–one, to avoid record duplication in the ledger, and two, to provide a decentralized mechanism for verification modeled on peer-to-peer transactions.</p>
<p>While the internal workings of a blockchain can get quite complex, the simple application of any  blockchain is in contexts where users or organizations want decentralized records management. Users collectively provide resources to verify credentials and other information via built-in cryptographic standards. At the same time, they get to retain their information without relying on monolithic databases. </p>
<p>Several blockchain types serve this purpose, all of which fit into different contexts. These blockchains include:</p>
 
 Public: Public blockchains are (obviously) public ledgers in which any user may participate in transaction verification and (if the blockchain supports it) information exchange. Centralized organizations do not maintain these blockchains, although an organization may participate as users. Common examples of public blockchains include most cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum.
<p>The advantages of public blockchains are that they are open and trustable because no one can alter records independently. Conversely, they tend to be inefficient in terms of energy consumption and performance, and they don’t scale as well as their private counterparts. </p> 
 Private: <a>Private blockchains</a> adopt the decentralized approach of the blockchain on a smaller scale, typically within an organization or application. It still relies on peer-to-peer transactions and decentralized data management, but there are often additional controls in place managed by a central authority.
<p>While not as free or transparent as their public counterparts, private blockchains are typically scalable, secure, and fast.</p> 
 Consortium: Consortium blockchains are a collection of blockchain systems owned by private interests used to streamline information sharing and workflows. 
 Hybrid: A combination of public and private systems where an organization (or group of organizations) may segregate private blockchain data internally while sharing public data on a public blockchain system. 
 
<p>Additionally, two significant access categories may apply across different blockchain types:</p>
 
 Permissionless: Permissionless blockchains allow any and all users to join and participate in the network without centralized control. Almost all public blockchains are permissionless, but it is possible to have permissioned, public systems.  
 Permissioned: These blockchains are those where users must follow specific rules and regulations to participate. This participation is almost always predicated on the authority of a central organization or consortium. 
 
<p>These categories are not exclusive to a blockchain type, but more often than not, a public blockchain will be permissionless while private chains are permissioned.</p>
 How Does the Blockchain Support Identity Verification? 
<p>Traditionally, authentication and identity verification work through a series of applications and databases–a centralized store of user information and credentials. </p>
<p>This presents a few problems: </p>
 
 Honeypots: Singular databases are known as “honeypots,” or attractive targets for hackers. If an identity database is compromised, then every user’s identity is threatened–including any connected information throughout that system. 
 Ownership: Individual users do not own or manage databases… large companies do. As such, it’s increasingly difficult for users to disentangle their personal information from large companies that store it. Blockchain schemes allow users to manage their own information within a blockchain system without relying on a major company. 
 Internet of Things (IoT) and Distributed Devices: The increasing adoption of smart devices and Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) work models makes centralized authentication and verification challenges. A <a>blockchain authentication</a> model can help make these networks more scalable and secure. 
 
<p>A blockchain can address these issues through decentralized management and user-focused participation. </p>
 Benefits of Digital Identity and Blockchain Verification 
<p>Because blockchains address questions of security, distribution, and scalability, they bring significant benefits to organizations that adopt them.</p>
<p>Some of these benefits include:</p>
 
 Self-Sovereignty: A major strength of the blockchain is that users own their own data on their devices. Rather than rely on large databases, the system can authenticate user credentials against those stored locally on a user’s device.
<p>We often lose sight of the importance of data ownership, and blockchain verification can go a long way in foregrounding self-sovereign <a>identity management</a>.</p> 
 Transparency: Blockchains are essentially transparent–that is, anyone participating on the chain has access to information relevant to the chain. Likewise, these records are under the user’s control, which means they know exactly what information is on the network and, if necessary, correct or remove it.  
 Portability: Modern security standards emphasize data portability, or the capacity to move data from one location or system to another. With blockchain verification, it becomes much easier to move information between compliant systems without having to have, for example, multiple accounts or worry about data format and compatibility.  
 Security: Additionally, such portability will strengthen the security around modern authentication approaches like federated identity management and Single Sign-On (SSO) schemes. Rather than having shared databases and complex APIs, blockchains could make moving between participating systems much easier–all while providing more control over what data is and is not exposed.  
 Decentralized Key Management: A major issue in security and cryptography is key management, or the secure sharing of decryption keys so that users can keep their data obfuscated without impacting their usability or compromising overall security. A blockchain can provide a resilient form of key management that doesn’t present singular points of failure.

   Predictions on insider threats, passwordless authentication, artificial intelligence, and more 

<p>Few industries move as quickly as cybersecurity, broadly, and the identity and access management (IAM) segment, specifically. There is a constant barrage of novel threats that can lead to costly breaches — and innovative, new ways to combat them. Seismic changes in the workplace push IAM leaders to create solutions that protect employees and data no matter where they are. And an evolution in the way people consume apps and services — conducting more and more of their personal business online — means we must help our enterprise customers meet new expectations for security, personalization, and seamless digital experiences.</p>

<p>The changing nature of the industry is why it's become something of a tradition to look at emerging trends and predict where they may take us in the coming year.</p>

<p>Recently, ForgeRock executives shared their views on trends related to digital identity and the challenges organizations will face in 2023. Their perspectives are based on their own expertise along with what they're hearing from extensive discussions with customers and what they're observing across the industry at large.</p>

	 Sweeping corporate layoffs will cause insider threats to rise 
	
<p>As we head into 2023, the security risk associated with third parties is not going away. With the threat of an economic downturn, many companies are conducting hiring freezes and, unfortunately, massive layoffs, causing insider threats to rise to crisis levels. To fill in workforce gaps, many companies will turn to consultants to get them through this tumultuous period of economic uncertainty.</p>

<p>However, consultants and contractors can bring the unintended risk of breaches to an organization's doorstep. They often get access to sensitive information and are allowed on company networks, but their security practices and training may differ from full-time employees. If a consultant's device is compromised, it's too easy for malware to make its way into an organization's network and spread to other devices, putting the whole organization at risk.</p>

<p>One solution is a more robust <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">governance</a> solution to give enterprises better visibility into who has access to what information, on what device, and from any location. For large enterprises, the only way to truly manage this governance is with the aid of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning.</p>

	 
		 
		 
		 Peter Barker 
		 Chief Product Officer 
	 

		 Artificial intelligence adoption in identity will accelerate 

<p>The integration of AI has been growing in cybersecurity and we can expect to see further adoption in the identity and access management space in 2023. The massive transformation to digital engagement, paired with the remote nature of our working lives, has opened the door for new and more relentless types of attacks, like account takeovers, inappropriate access, and fraud. Alongside the widening skills gap facing the cybersecurity industry, and the increasing sophistication of threat actors, enterprises need to transform their solutions to stay ahead.</p>

<p>Enterprises should use all the tools at their disposal to stay ahead of cyberattackers and secure their systems, while ensuring a seamless experience for end-users. <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-access">AI-powered cybersecurity</a> defenses are among the strongest tools organizations have in their arsenal against cybercrime and will be front and center in the next big tech wave for preventing cyberattacks.</p>

	 Retailers will blaze the trail in implementing passwordless authentication for consumers 

<p>Passwordless has been in our crystal ball for a very long time – but never has it been closer than now. Retailers, in particular, are facing increased security, fraud, and account takeover threats as they adopt new digital channels and technologies. We see them leading the way in implementing broad consumer adoption of <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/passwordless-authentication">passwordless authentication</a>.</p>

<p>Digital wallets and biometrics have become critically important for unlocking consumer devices and enabling easy next steps such as purchase approval. In self-checkout scenarios, retailers face unique challenges since physical fraud can also be a major concern. Many retailers are feeling the pressure to go fully self-service in a legally compliant way even in the case of selling age-restricted goods such as liquor. Typically, such purchases require intervention by staff to check someone's physical ID, which slows checkout.</p>

<p>In these scenarios, digital wallets are getting a second look as a source of not just payment, but also verified user information presented in a format that the user can't tamper with. As more retailers adopt passwordless and make it more mainstream, we're going to see more and more consumers pulling it into their everyday lives. This is the nail in the coffin for passwords long-term, and in 2023 retailers will make more deliberate efforts toward the integration of the passwordless society we've been working toward for so long.</p>
	
	 
		 
		 
		 David Burden 
		 Chief Information Officer 
	 
	
	 Workplace volatility will shift cybersecurity practices in 2023 
	
<p>Gartner <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-10-18-gartner-unveils-top-predictions-for-it-organizations-and-users-in-2023-and-beyond">predicts</a> that by 2025 "labor volatility" will "cause 40% of organizations to report a material business loss, forcing a shift in talent strategy from acquisition to resilience." I believe we're going to see this truly begin in 2023, and it's going to put an even greater emphasis on the identity perimeter as related to the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/employee-identity-access-management">workplace</a>.</p>

<p>As more cybercriminals target employees to gain unauthorized access to the greater organization, businesses will take measures to reduce vulnerabilities that attackers are slipping through. Overprovisioning, rubber-stamping access requests, and out-of-control shadow IT are putting a strain on enterprises and their ability to manage the volume and velocity of IT requests. Prepare to see more passwordless technology gaining traction in the workplace, plus greater security measures related to things like physical access to buildings, registering for hotdesk using software, digital access to services, and collaboration tools.</p>

<p>By Dr Paul Ashley, co-CEO and CTO, Anonyome Labs</p>



<p>This article was originally published in Michael Bazzell’s Unredacted magazine, September 2022. To learn more, view the&nbsp;<a href="https://unredactedmagazine.com/">latest issue</a>.</p>



<p>My first article, in the&nbsp;<a href="https://unredactedmagazine.com/issues/002.pdf">June 2022</a>&nbsp;issue of&nbsp;Unredacted, introduced some initial concepts around decentralized identity – the new technology that’s giving users greater control over their personal data and identity. Here, I’ll expand on those initial concepts and focus on decentralized identity blockchains—the&nbsp;trust&nbsp;foundation for decentralized identity-based applications and an essential part of the decentralized identity story.&nbsp;</p>



 Blockchain = verifiable data registry 



<p>The technical term for the decentralized identity component that provides the trust foundation for the whole system is a&nbsp;verifiable data registry (VDR). Similar in its application to&nbsp;centralized&nbsp;public key infrastructure (PKI), the VDR allows users and services to verify their authenticity by proving they hold the private key corresponding to the public key written to the VDR. It is often called a decentralized PKI.</p>



<p>Most people don’t use the term VDR, but rather the more widely known terms distributed ledger or blockchain, to describe how the component is implemented in the system. In reality, there are over 100 distinct VDRs available, built using well-known technologies such as Hyperledger Indy, Ethereum, Bitcoin, Interplanetary File System (IPFS), Hyperledger Fabric, Cosmos, and so on.</p>



 Hyperledger Indy&nbsp; 







<p>The most successful VDR is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a>. Created within the Linux Foundation, Indy is a public ledger designed specifically and only for privacy-preserving decentralized identity (also called&nbsp;self-sovereign identity). The Hyperledger Indy ledger is for credential issuers to publish data necessary for issuing verifiable credentials, and for holders to construct presentations based on those verifiable credentials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anonyome Labs supports and maintains validator nodes for both the&nbsp;<a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a>&nbsp;Hyperledger Indy networks. Let’s look at Hyperledger Indy’s characteristics:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



Public ledgerAnyone can read the data on the ledger.Permissioned networkThis statement has two different aspects:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) The Hyperledger Indy network comprises a set of validators that have been approved (permissioned) to run the network. For example, the&nbsp;<a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin</a>&nbsp;Foundation approves validators to run on its three networks (Dev, Staging, and MainNet).&nbsp;&nbsp;2) The ability/permission to write data to the Hyperledger network, which allows for writing decentralized identifiers (DIDs), schemas, credential definitions and other decentralized identity-related items. To write to the ledger, an organization must have endorser permissions (which includes paying the appropriate fee to become an endorser).&nbsp;Consensus algorithmJust like Bitcoin, validator nodes must come to agreement (consensus) before anything is written to the Hyperledger Indy network. Indy uses the&nbsp;<a href="https://lig-membres.imag.fr/aublin/rbft/report.pdf">Redundant Byzantine Fault Tolerance (RBFT)</a>&nbsp;consensus algorithm. Indy networks typically have 24 validator nodes.GovernanceHyperledger Indy uses an offline and centralized governance model. In practice, that means people work together to create the network’s governance policy, write policy documents and have validators and Endorsers sign the agreements. These governance activities happen in the physical world.Economic modelApplication developers pay the organizing company or foundation (e.g. Sovrin) for permission to write to the network.



<p></p>



 Cosmos 







<p>Anonyome Labs runs a Cosmos validator node on the&nbsp;<a href="https://cheqd.io/">cheqd</a>&nbsp;network. For comparison with Hyperledger Indy, here are some characteristics of a Cosmos-based VDR network:</p>



Public ledgerAnyone can read the data on the ledger.Permissionless networkThis statement has two different aspects:&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Any organization can join the network as a validator.2) Any organization can write to the network.Consensus algorithmCosmos uses&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04938">Tendermint&nbsp;Byzantine Consensus Algorithm (BCA)</a>&nbsp;to establish a consensus between validator nodes.GovernanceCosmos uses an online and decentralized governance model. In practice, that means that any validator can submit a governance proposal to the network, which validators will vote on and either approve, decline, abstain, or veto. All this happens online.Economic modelCosmos has a very well-defined crypto-economic model:&nbsp;Validators earn tokens through&nbsp;<a href="https://hub.cosmos.network/main/validators/validator-faq.html#what-is-a-validator-commission">commissions</a>&nbsp;to help run the network.Writers to the network spend tokens.&nbsp;Cosmos also has an&nbsp;<a href="https://cheqd.io/blog/cheqds-tokenomics-for-ssi-explained-part-3-payment-models">economic model for verifiable credentials</a>.

 DID methods 



<p>DID methods define how to interact with decentralized identity networks. Since Hyperledger Indy networks are so popular, I’ll focus on the Indy DID method.</p>



<p>Written as&nbsp;<a href="https://hyperledger.github.io/indy-did-method/">did:Indy</a>&nbsp;this DID method describes how to interact with a Hyperledger Indy network, including creating decentralized identifiers and issuing, verifying, and revoking verifiable credentials. It is proposed that in the future there could be hundreds of separately run Hyperledger Indy networks. The purpose of the did:indy method is to facilitate full interoperability between each of these networks.</p>



<p>The Indy DID method defines methods for writing the following data:</p>



 Decentralized identifier (DID) 



<p>A DID is the fundamental identifier of a decentralized identity in the network. It may be the identifier for a user, a verifiable credential issuer, a service, an IoT device, etc. The DID structure is similar to a web URL.</p>



<p>The DID has four components, which are concatenated:</p>



 
 DID: The hardcoded string&nbsp;did:&nbsp;indicating that the identifier is a DID 



 DID Indy method: The hardcoded string&nbsp;indy:&nbsp;indicating that the identifier uses the Indy DID method specification 



 DID Indy namespace: A string that identifies the name of the primary Indy ledger, followed by a colon. The namespace string may optionally have a secondary ledger name prefixed by another colon following the primary name.&nbsp; 



 Namespace identifier: An identifier unique to the given DID Indy namespace.&nbsp; 
 



<p>The components are assembled as follows:</p>



<p>did:indy:&lt;namespace&gt;:&lt;namespace identifier&gt;</p>



<p>Some examples of did:indy DID method identifiers are:</p>



 
 A DID written to the Sovrin MainNet ledger:
 
 did:indy:sovrin:7Tqg6BwSSWapxgUDm9KKgg 
 
 
 



 
 A DID written to the Sovrin StagingNet ledger:
 
 did:indy:sovrin:staging:6cgbu8ZPoWTnR5Rv5JcSMB 
 
 
 



 
 A DID on the IDUnion Test ledger:
 
 did:indy:idunion:test:2MZYuPv2Km7Q1eD4GCsSb6 
 
 
 



 DID documents (DIDDocs) 



<p>DIDDocs contains two primary data elements:<br></p>



 
 Cryptographic material the DID owner can use to prove control over the associated DID (i.e., public keys and digital signatures) 



 Routing endpoints for locations where one may be able to contact or exchange data with the DID owner. 
 



<p><a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-resolution/#dfn-did">DID resolution</a>&nbsp;is the process of obtaining a DID document for a given DID.</p>



 Verifiable credential schema 



<p>A schema object is a template defining a set of attributes (names). A schema is bound to verifiable credential definitions in a Hyperledger Indy network. The bound schema restricts which claims an issuer can include in the credential. Schemas have a name and version, and an issuer or authoritative organization (e.g. government authorities defining license schemas) normally writes them to the ledger. Any client can read schemas from a Hyperledger Indy node.</p>



 Verifiable credential definition 



<p>A credential definition contains data required for both credential issuance and credential validation. Any Hyperledger Indy client can read it. A credential definition references a schema and the issuer’s DID. The issuer’s public key is included within the credential definition in order to enable validation of the credentials, which are signed by the issuer’s private key. When credentials are issued using the issuer’s credential definition, the attributes (names) of the schema must be used.</p>



 Revocation registry definition 



<p>A revocation registry definition contains information required for verifiers to determine whether the issuer has revoked a (revokable) verifiable credential. Revocation registry definitions are required for revokable verifiable credentials and are written to the ledger during creation of the credential definition. Any client can read them from a Hyperledger Indy node.<a>[1]</a></p>



 Revocation registry entry 



<p>A revocation registry entry marks the current status of one or more revokable verifiable credentials (i.e., “revoked” or “not revoked”) in the ledger in a privacy-preserving manner. The owner of a revocation registry definition writes a revocation registry entry whenever they wish to make a batch (possibly only one) of revocations public and detectable.</p>



<p>Any Hyperledger Indy client can read any revocation registry entry.</p>



 



<p><a>[1]</a>&nbsp;The registry definition isn’t ever updated after creation. It binds immutably the revocation detection mechanism (currently the Tails File) to the credential definition. There is an m to 1 relationship between revocation registry definitions and credential definitions. This is because a new revocation registry definition is created whenever the Tails File number of entries is exhausted and a new one needs to be created; the new one will still point back to the original credential definition. The revocation registry entry is updated when credentials are revoked.</p>

				 <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/trust-registry-service/">Trust Registries</a> are a powerful technology organizations can use to increase trust and streamline business operations in various industries. One of the most innovative uses of this technology can be found in the financial sector, where trust registries are being used to combat the threat of financial fraud.<p></p>
<p><a href="https://bonifii.com/">Bonifii</a>, an innovative financial technology company, has developed <a href="https://www.memberpass.com/">MemberPass®</a>, a solution that proactively protects credit union members from becoming victims of financial fraud. MemberPass®&nbsp;allows member institutions (credit unions and other financial institutions) to issue credentials to their members. When a credit union verifies their members, they use cryptography, self-sovereign identity credentials and communications to prove the following key things:</p>
 
 The connection is the same private connection that was established with their own member (this is two-way – the member knows this too). 
 The member still holds the credential. 
 The contents of the credential haven’t been tampered with.&nbsp; 
 The credit union signed the credential using its Decentralized Identifier – its DID. 
 
<p>Getting cryptographically secure facts like these helps the credit union and their member be sure they aren’t talking to bad actors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But when another institution starts to use a credential, the cryptography can only go so far.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another institution can know that:</p>
 
 The person holds the credential (they aren’t a member of that other institution). 
 The contents haven’t been tampered with. 
 A DID signed the credential. 
 
<p>What we don’t know is whether the DID that signed the credential is really a trusted credit union or not.</p>
<p>To know that the institution checks the MemberPass Digital Trust Registry®. The trust registry is maintained under Bonifii’s governance framework, and Bonifii has a solid process that validates the institutions listed in the MemberPass Digital Trust Registry®.&nbsp;</p>
  Increase Trust and Streamline Operations 
<p>The use of a trust registry allows new institutions to join the MemberPass®&nbsp;network and quickly validate the information from any participating member institutions.&nbsp; Further, it provides for the efficient sharing and verification of information among credit unions and their partners, increasing trust and streamlining business operations.</p>
<p>The operational ecosystem, anchored by the MemberPass Digital Trust Registry®, provides Bonifii with a comprehensive solution for managing its identity verification data and interactions. MemberPass® offers a streamlined and user-friendly interface that allows members to easily manage their digital identity, including adding and removing authorized credentials, viewing transaction history, and monitoring for suspicious activity—allowing members to easily and securely access their financial accounts and complete transactions.</p>
<p>The implementation of Trust Registries in the financial industry, as demonstrated by Bonifii’s MemberPass Digital Trust Registry®, is a powerful example of how this technology can increase trust and streamline business operations. Trust Registries provide a significant step forward in the efficient and secure management of identity verification data and interactions in the credit union industry.</p> 
			        
				
				
				
				
				 <p>About Bonifii: By providing a safe, secure, and convenient identity verification solution, MemberPass®&nbsp;is solving one of the credit union industry’s biggest problems by reducing member friction and injecting trust in digital interactions. The use of a decentralized trust registry in MemberPass®&nbsp;is a real-world example of how organizations can use this technology to increase trust and streamline business operations.</p>
<p>About Continuum Loop: As a leading consulting firm, Continuum Loop played a vital role in the development and launch of MemberPass®&nbsp;and the MemberPass Digital Trust Registry®. Darrell O’Donnell was embedded as the CTO, providing crucial expertise and leadership. Through their partnership, Continuum Loop and Bonifii successfully deployed the first-ever Trust Registry for MemberPass®, significantly enhancing the platform’s security and user convenience.</p>

<p>In the first part of this episode of Voices of the Data Economy, we welcomed Trent McConaghy, Founder of Ocean Protocol, for the second time on our show. During this two-episode series podcast interview, we spoke about the Ocean roadmap for 2023 and the project’s focus on newer use cases, including DeFi. Here are edited excerpts from the&nbsp;episode.</p><p>Focus of the Ocean Protocol core team in&nbsp;2023</p><p>Ocean Protocol as a project was conceived in late 2016. For the first five years, it was steadily building the infrastructure needed to solve a bunch of different tough problems such as sovereign data ownership, solving private data reconciling with crypto, pricing data, and many other related things. The project launched different versions–V1, V2, V3, and V4. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/datatokens-daos-and-nfts-14aedce1bba7">Trent briefly spoke about these versions in another appearance of Voices of the Data Economy as&nbsp;well.</a></p><blockquote>“The focus is now doubling down on traction. How we measure traction is by ‘data consume volume,’ which means how much data is being bought and sold in any given week or month through the Ocean ecosystem, on the Ocean Market, and other markets powered by Ocean contracts. We have more focused projects now like <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/bounties">data challenges</a> (for predicting the price of Ethereum) and <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/announcing-ocean-data-farming-26c036d12f20">Data Farming</a> (an incentive program where the objective function is data consume volume).”</blockquote><p>Trent quickly recaps the different versions of Ocean: Ocean V1 solved data sovereignty; Ocean V2 solved data privacy through privacy-preserving AI, and Ocean V3 solved a few things at once: How do we simplify things? How do we have really crazy interoperability for the custody and management of data? How do we automatically price&nbsp;data?</p><p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-v4-overview-1ccd4a7ce150">Here you can find an overview of Ocean V4</a>. It got shipped in the spring of 2022. The three things that got shipped in V4 are Data NFTs, in addition to datatokens to map, base IP, and licenses against the base IP; solving rug pulls on the pools, and finally, better monetization for the community.</p><p>Users of Ocean Protocol. Who are&nbsp;they?</p><p>The users of Ocean Protocol can be divided into three segments — by verticals, by profession, and then there are individual or higher level groups. By vertical, it applies to multiple streams — like automotive data, could apply to personal social media data, or health data&nbsp;etc.</p><p>There are several projects within the Ocean ecosystem that focus on personal data, typically via DAOs. Most people don’t want to manage their data themselves — so you can have collective bargaining around that- this is handled via projects like the <a href="https://www.dataunion.app/what-is-a-dataunion/">DataUnion app</a>.</p><p>The relatively larger groups are NGOs, small businesses, large enterprises, and then cities, provinces, and countries — any of those slices of civilization can use Ocean in various ways. It goes up and down different levels; for example, <a href="https://port.oceanprotocol.com/t/proposal-deltadao-creating-an-ocean-protocol-use-case-and-pitch-deck-library/618">one collaboration is actually via deltaDAO collaborating with the Berlin Library ecosystem.</a></p><p>Data Scientists as Ocean Protocol users and why&nbsp;DeFi?</p><p>The main user that Ocean serves the best right now is data scientists, because it’s data scientists who work with data and know how to create value from data, typically by building AI models or just simple machine learning models. Then making predictions, choosing actions, selecting actions, and then executing those actions. One example is DeFi, where you can predict the price of ETH in 10 minutes from now. And if you are right more often than you are wrong - you can make a buying or selling&nbsp;action.</p><blockquote>“I believe that Ocean will become ubiquitous, and we are on track with that. How do you get to the ubiquity and its sustained growth over long periods? Facebook has become ubiquitous right now. It started with just college students and Harvard. But then it spread itself one university at a time. And eventually, after years and years of sustained growth, it became ubiquitous. And hopefully, it won’t be ubiquitous forever because it’s centralized. And typically, things fade. Ocean, though, I hope, becomes ubiquitous and has decentralized goals. It is an infrastructure for civilization, just like TCP/IP with web protocols on&nbsp;top.”</blockquote><p>While deciding on vertical focus, one good metric is the time needed for going through the data value creation cycle. For DeFi, it can be as little as 10 minutes, and for areas like drug discovery, it can be as long as ten years for data to get monetized with all FDA approvals etc. In those terms, the lowest-hanging fruit is decentralized finance.</p><p>Build, build, build: V4, veOCEAN and Data&nbsp;Farming</p><p>With the launch of V4, Ocean solved these three problems: base IP NFTs, rug pulls, and much better monetization for the community. But before that, <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-is-launching-f633532d831c">Ocean had already launched Data Farming</a>. In Trent’s words, Data Farming incentivizes for growth of data consume volume in the Ocean ecosystem. It rewards OCEAN to pool liquidity providers (stakers) as a function of consume volume and liquidity. It’s like DeFi liquidity mining, but tuned for data consumption. DF’s aim is to achieve a minimum supply of data for network effects to kick in, and once the network flywheel is spinning, to increase growth&nbsp;rate.</p><p>Questions at that point: How do we solve the problem with free assets for Data Farming, fixed price assets for Data Farming, and the pool draining attack? The solution to this was built and shipped by Ocean in the fall of 2022: veOCEAN. It stopped all the issues from before. Read Trent’s blog here on <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-veocean-c5f416c1f9a0">Introducing </a>veOCEAN and <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/veocean-is-launching-data-farming-is-resuming-abed779211e3">how Data Farming continued with the veOCEAN&nbsp;launch.</a></p><blockquote>“There’s a macro-level problem in crypto. How do you reconcile near-term greed with long-term incentives? You’ve got the people who want to ape into something, make their 2x in a week or a month, and then ape out–take your profits and go. If you would have asked me three years ago, four years ago, five years ago, I would have said just ignore those people. But the fact of the matter is in crypto, they exist, and you should try to make your system somewhat attractive to them, even if they’re not your main target. You still want to be interesting to them, if you can. But for the long term, I still really want to make sure that we serve the builders around data, the data scientists,” concludes Trent in the first part of this interview.</blockquote><p>Here is a list of different topics discussed during the two-episode series interview:</p>  The focus of the core Ocean team in&nbsp;2022  Different user groups of Ocean&nbsp;Protocol  How Data Scientists can use&nbsp;Ocean  Ocean’s focus on constantly building: veOCEAN and Data&nbsp;Farming  Different use cases in DeFi and&nbsp;Ocean  Trent’s view on the future of AI in&nbsp;2022  Trent’s take on 2022 as a year for the crypto industry and what to look forward in&nbsp;2023  <p>We will release the second part of the interview soon.

 DIDs Prove Control with Private&nbsp;Keys <p>Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are a way to identify and authenticate devices. Unlike traditional unique identifiers, DIDs have a private key associated with them that proves control of the identifier. This is especially useful for devices, as they can hold their own private key and make assertions about their authenticity.</p><p>One way to secure devices is to use a hardware-protected private key, such as a TPM (trusted platform module) or TrustZone in an ARM processor. This ensures that the private key is not extractable and can only be used to make signatures in a trusted execution environment. The public key, on the other hand, can be stored on a verifiable data registry and associated with a DID, allowing it to be retrieved upon&nbsp;request.</p> Keys Can Be Generated at the Beginning or Middle of Device Arbitration Process <p>The timing of public/private key generation on a device depends on the specific use-case. For example, if the device needs to be authenticated as a genuine product from a particular brand, the keys may need to be generated at the time of assembly. On the other hand, if the device is being provisioned for a specific use-case, key generation may take place during the provisioning stage.</p> Using Key Generation to Protect User&nbsp;Privacy <p>It’s important to consider privacy when using DIDs and hardware-protected keys to authenticate devices. In cases where devices are being sold to the general public, it’s best practice to generate new keys to preserve the privacy of the&nbsp;user.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@benjamincoll875">Benjamin Collins</a>, Transmute’s Technical Product Owner, spent 10 years working with Linux and Open Source as the creator of DashGL.com, a site which provides tutorials for writing simple games for Linux in C using OpenGL and the GTK&nbsp;toolkit.</p><p>Connect with Ben on <a href="https://twitter.com/kion_dgl">Twitter</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/BenjaminMoe">GitHub</a></p><p>About<a href="https://transmute.industries/"> Transmute</a>: Building on the security and freedom that Web3 promised, Transmute provides all the benefits of decentralization to enterprise teams seeking a cost effective, interoperable, planet-forward experience provided by experts in technology and industry.</p><p>Transmute was founded in 2017, graduated from TechStars Austin in 2018, and is based in sunny Austin, Texas.

I joined Ontology’s community in April&nbsp;2019.</p> Tell us a bit about yourself. What are your hobbies? Do you have any&nbsp;pets? <p>I am a passionate sales and marketing professional with over 11 years of experience in the field and I have completed some professional certifications related to the subject. I am also married and have a child. I love animals and have a cat, but other than that, my hobbies include music and playing football.</p> What kind of work do you do on a day-to-day basis? <p>I work mainly on an online basis, working freelance with the crypto and blockchain communities, outside of my professional role in marketing and sales. I was part of the Ontology member base in 2020, and I attended as many events as I could. This is really how I got so closely involved with Ontology. Because of this, Ontology named me as its first Loyal Member of the team. Now I deal each week with Loyal Member discussions, join Twitter Spaces, and continue to play a role in the wider Ontology community.</p> In your opinion, what makes Ontology stand out from other blockchains? <p>I believe that Ontology’s node staking performance is the highlight of its offerings, as well as its trusted decentralised solution, easy to manage platforms, and 24/7 online&nbsp;support.</p> What is the most exciting part of the project you’re working on for Ontology? <p>The weekly Loyal Member discussion is the most exciting part of Ontology for me. Seeking out new ideas, topics, and opinions to discuss each week and share with the community increases my personal knowledge. Additionally, engaging in discussions with the community allows me to develop ideas with them and contribute to Ontology’s innovations.</p> What has been the most important moment in your career so&nbsp;far? <p>That is quite an interesting question. I got a huge amount of value for my work in sales and marketing when I worked at a private university. Career-wise, this was probably my best personal accomplishment to&nbsp;date.</p> What are you most excited for in your future at Ontology? <p>I am excited to be an Ontology Harbinger and have the opportunity to share my enthusiasm for the project with&nbsp;others.</p> As we mark Ontology’s five-year anniversary, where do you see Ontology and Web3 going in the next five&nbsp;years? <p>We can expect to see more creative uses for digital currency over the coming years, which could have a meaningful impact on many people’s everyday lives. Web3 will be the main cause of this so Ontology will naturally play a large part. Furthermore, decentralized identities are the future. This is something that may be a core part of Ontology’s strategy over the next five&nbsp;years.</p> Follow us on social&nbsp;media! <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/meet-the-team-loyal-ontology-community-member-sasen-71ea2e9c79da">Meet the Team: Loyal Ontology Community Member, Sasen</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p>In recent years, investment into cybersecurity has soared but, in most cases, these efforts have not fully addressed the reliance on passwords and the challenges they introduce. Without secure access to resources, businesses and organizations are at risk of suffering from phishing and social engineering attacks. However, as the passwordless authentication market continues to grow, different vendors are offering innovative ways to delivering secure authentication for enterprise and consumer use cases. HID Global’s Authentication and Credential Management Platform provides a holistic approach to passwordless authentication that protects users against credential-based attacks and account takeover fraud cases by removing passwords and improving user experience at the same time.

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Come and meet the Ubisecure team at the Gartner Identity and Access Management Summit, in London, on the 6th and 7th of March. To find out more, take a look at the Ubisecure events page, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/events/" title="www.ubisecure.com/events/">www.ubisecure.com/events/</a>.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thank you for joining us to this first episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity in this New Year, 2023. And we want to start hearing very futuristic things about a future, very futuristic. We have a really amazing guest to start this year. Let me introduce you, Dr Mark van Rijmenam. He is the digital speaker, he is a leading strategic futurist who thinks about how emerging technologies change organisations, society and the metaverse.</p>
<p>He is the founder of the Digital Futures Institute with a mission to ensure a thriving digital future for businesses and society. Van Rijmenam is an international keynote speaker. He is five times author, and his latest book is Future Visions, which was written in five days in collaboration with artificial intelligence. I definitely want to hear more about that. Hey, Mark, welcome.</p>
<p>Dr Mark van Rijmenam: Thank you very much Oscar for having me on the show. It’s great to be here.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, definitely our pleasure. Well, happy New Year.</p>
<p>Mark: Happy New Year to you, too.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, we are still in the beginning of 2023.</p>
<p>Please tell us about yourself and how – what was your journey to this world of identity, metaverse and everything that you are doing today.</p>
<p>Mark: I’m sure it sounds good. Well, obviously you already gave a very nice introduction, but I’ll add some things to it. So, I’ve been a keynote speaker for over a decade. I am a strategic futurist, so it means I really think about emerging technologies, and I try to understand what these technologies, these emerging cutting-edge technologies mean for you and me, for organisations, for society, and how we can benefit from them.</p>
<p>Because these technologies are constantly evolving. So, I’ve been doing this for over a decade. I’ve been speaking all around the world about that. I’ve been, as you said, five books. And I really try to always practise what I preach. And so that means that I – when the pandemic hit, I created myself an avatar, created myself as a hologram to deliver keynotes as such.</p>
<p>I’m currently working on building a digital twin of myself to understand – what are the consequences of creating a digital twin of yourself? A synthetic human, so to say. And how does it influence whatever we do? And I am very much involved in, you know, big data blockchain, artificial intelligence and the convergence of these technologies, which we are all coming together in the metaverse of, which was my fourth book, <a href="https://www.thedigitalspeaker.com/book-step-into-the-metaverse/">Step into the Metaverse</a>, where a big part of that is also focused on identity. Because I believe that the metaverse will unleash a sort of a Cambrian explosion of identity, and it’s very important how to deal with that.</p>
<p>I’ve also been involved in a start-up, which unfortunately failed, but that’s the start-up life. Focused on identity, focused on fighting misinformation with reputation-based system. It’s very challenging to do anything in this space because we are very much used to a certain identity system that we have in our society. And shifting that is quite challenging, but I’m sure we’ll get to that during this episode.</p>
<p>So yes, that’s basically what I do. And yeah, indeed, my latest book, <a href="https://www.thedigitalspeaker.com/book-future-visions/">Future Visions</a>, written, edited and designed by AI, I’m sure some of you have heard of ChatGPT, which is taking internet by storm. And the moment it arrived, I thought, I’m going to grasp this opportunity to write a book with it.</p>
<p>So, I literally wrote it in five days, and I didn’t change a word. I didn’t – I maybe like five or ten words that I changed myself, but the rest is exactly written by AI. And it was an experiment for me to understand what is possible with off the shelf technology, and it’s quite surprising how good it is, but also how not good it is. It’s not the Holy Grail. It’s fantastic technology, but there are definitely some caveats. And it was a fantastic experience to do.</p>
<p>Oscar: That, that sounds very interesting. So, you wrote a full book just using the ChatGPT that many people are talking about these days for the last, at least, last two months, I would say – quite a lot about that. And yes, super interesting journey you have had.</p>
<p>One of the last things you said is about the misinformation that – every time I hear that word like, we really have to do more about that – and it’s not easy, right? It’s definitely not easy.</p>
<p>That will come also on the metaverse, which is actually the main thing we’d like to discuss with you. So, it’s skimming through the pages of your last, second book, Step into the Metaverse, How the Immersive Internet Will Unlock a Trillion Dollar Social Economy. So, I read part of your book it is very interesting, so let’s go into that – to start with a common idea – please, could you give me your definition of metaverse?</p>
<p>Mark: Yes. That’s a very good point to start because the metaverse is a very, very abstract concept which many people have different perspective of what it actually is. And for the book I did about 100 in-depth interviews with the stakeholders who are building the metaverse. I did about 150 surveys, and interestingly enough, I got like almost 250 different definitions of what the metaverse is, which sort of shows you how difficult of a concept it is.</p>
<p>I sort of derive my own definition from this, and to me, the metaverse is the next iteration of the internet, it’s where the physical and the digital world are converging. And where the physical moving to the digital the digital moves into the physical. Now, that’s a lot of information there. And so, we can briefly unpack it a little bit.</p>
<p>So, if we start with the first one, you had a physical move into the digital. Basically, this conversation that we have, you could argue, is part of a very, very early phase of the metaverse because you are physically in Finland. I’m physically in Australia and we are digitally connected through our computers, and we have this conversation. It’s a 2D connection. So yes, our screens are 2D. These are not immersive.</p>
<p>But you could argue this is part of the metaverse. Other parts of the metaverse are, which I think are very, very important, is, for example, digital twins now. Where we create a digital replica of a physical asset that we can interact with in the digital world and we can just monitor it, or we can actually interact with it and then any changes that we make in the digital world, we will have an effect in the physical world. And that’s also part of the metaverse. And often people think that virtual reality is the most important part of the metaverse, but to me it’s only one channel to access the metaverse in an immersive way.</p>
<p>The other part, the other channel so to say, is augmented reality, where basically which means that we bring the digital into the physical world. I think that part is going to be much more important and much bigger because it allows us basically to create like infinite layers on top of reality. And this layer can be for entertainment, so you can have a flying purple dragon above the Opera House here in Australia, or you can use it to understand when you’re driving to have, augmented reality where there’s a parking space available or whatever you can come up with. And I think that’s also a very, very important part of the metaverse.</p>
<p>I think in the next decade or so we will see that computers will disappear, smartphones will disappear, tablets will disappear. They will all be replaced by headsets at first, augmented reality headsets I think, they will become a miniaturised, very sleek glasses that you can wear. And you don’t need a laptop anymore, you don’t need a smartphone anymore because you have it all in front of your eyes.</p>
<p>So, the metaverse is the immersive internet, and this internet will become as pervasive as the air we breathe. And it will mean it will move from making a conscious decision to go on the internet – so, if you want to go on the internet today, you have to grab your phone and start doing something. And it will switch to being “in” the internet. So being fully immersed and being part of the internet. By the internet being as pervasive to the air we breathe or energy that we use. This internet will be 3D, and that’s much more in line with what we humans are used to because we are 3D humans.</p>
<p>So, we thrive in a 3D environment much more so than a 2D environment. So that’s sort of what’s going to happen. There’s a lot of information, but in short, it’s where the physical and the digital world are converging, creating this immersive 3D internet that we can connect with and can be part of.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, you said that for writing this book on the metaverse. You have interview at least 100 of entrepreneurs who are building some their metaverse versions or some product related to the metaverse. So, I like to know from those conversations that you have had – so what has been their main motivation, why they are spending their time building those and not something else. So, what are, let’s say, the main motivation did you find in common amongst these entrepreneurs?</p>
<p>Mark: Well, I think it’s a very good question. And I think what I noticed is that everyone that I spoke to, understands that the metaverse is the next iteration of the internet. It is the future. Whether we want it or not, whether we believe in it or not, it will define the next ten, 20, 30 years, if not more.</p>
<p>And so, any smart entrepreneur should dive headfirst into that because if you would have done that in the 1990’s, you would have been, you know, had a good chance to be the next Amazon. And that’s what I think is happening here because first we had one, then we had like sort of the mobile app with the launch of the iPhone. We had the social web, with the launch of all the social media platforms and now we move to the immersion web.</p>
<p>So, there’s a ton of work to be done. There’s a ton of money to be made because, you know, several banks and a major strategy consultants say that by 2030, the metaverse will drive between 5 and 13 trillion dollars for the global economy.</p>
<p>Personally, I think it’s going to be a lot more, simply by looking at the impact that the internet had already on our society. So, it makes just good business sense to dive into the metaverse to see what you can contribute to this next iteration of the internet.</p>
<p>Besides, firstly, I think that the metaverse is a fascinating environment to work in, because it’s all novel, it’s all magical, it’s all – all the things that can become true in the metaverse. There are no laws of physics in the metaverse, so you’re not – we don’t have any restrictions on what we can build in the metaverse. And I think we can create this magical world, this magical virtual world, with these magical augmented digital experiences that are not possible in the physical world. And I personally find it fascinating.</p>
<p>So, I really enjoy being part of that. And I think over time when – the more we step into the metaverse, because mind you, the metaverse is still a few years out. The more a society steps into the metaverse, the more people will experience this magic as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: So different motivation. It sounds to me – it’s most like, I know there will be this new paradigm so that the technology is coming anyway. It sounds like that, and the entrepreneurs have to be there. Sounds like those are the main motivations.</p>
<p>Mark: Yeah, I want to add one to that because it’s – so my book has been, I’ve meant it as a blueprint for an open metaverse. And an open metaverse is really focused on – how can we create a metaverse that’s there for us, for you and me, consumers. And that’s owned and controlled by us and not necessarily controlled by big tech or very, very tiny elite who controls whatever we do online, which currently the current internet is like that.</p>
<p>We don’t control our own data; we don’t control our own digital identity. The internet is basically controlled by a handful of very, very powerful, very big technology companies. Now, with the metaverse, with the amount of data that you create in this immersive internet, which will be 100 times more than we do today, if not even more. I think it’s crucial that we own and control our own data, that we control our own digital assets, and that we control our own identity and reputation. Because we don’t want to live in a world where the Zuckerberg’s of this world can decide whether or not you have access to this immersive internet or not. And I think that’s something really, really important.</p>
<p>Of course, we have to build it in the correct way, because you know, with building something decentralised also come a lot of challenges. But that’s what I did for the book and most people that I spoke to, they tried to do that as well. So, for a lot of people that I spoke to, they’re driven by this quest of building an open metaverse that’s there for us. And to change the paradigm from a centralised internet to a decentralised.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, that’s something I read in your book, the concept of the Open Metaverse. So, it’s great that many of these entrepreneurs have that in mind. So, something else that you just mentioned is – it’s about, of course, identity. Again, thinking of the companies who are now building the metaverse. How in top of the mind is digital identity? So, it’s a component that they are thinking every day, like yes, this is part of metaverse or something that is neglected? So, what would you say?</p>
<p>Mark: Well, I think that the digital identity is a very, very important part of the metaverse. And it was also confirmed, to the very people that I talk to. Simply because, as I mentioned in the start in the metaverse, we can be whomever we want to be, whether that is, I don’t know, a flying dragon, whether that is a walking piano, whether that’s a talking mushroom, it really doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>You can literally be whoever you want to be. And identity in the metaverse is really, really important, much more important than we think today. And if we ask Generation Z, those born after 95 or Generation Alpha, those born after 2010 to them, and this has been done to them, their digital identity is as or even more important than their physical identity.</p>
<p>Let that sink in a bit because that’s the paradigm shift. Your digital identity being more important than your physical identity, completely shift of mind and mindset. And therefore, we see that in the metaverse, digital fashion is really important because just like in a physical world, you want to dress a certain way to showcase who you are, to display your identity. You also want to do that in the metaverse. So digital fashion is a multibillion industry of for people to do that.</p>
<p>Now, what research also has shown is that the moment people can be whoever they want to be in the metaverse, they start experimenting with their identity. And there’s research that people switch gender just to understand what that means. There’s also research which showed that if you are an introvert person in the physical world and you use an extrovert character in the metaverse or in virtual reality, and you play with that character for a couple of hours. Then you will continue to display those extrovert characteristics in the physical world afterwards. Fascinating I think, how that works the digital, our digital identity can affect our physical identity.</p>
<p>So now, of course I think when we talk about identity in the metaverse, we also have to think about the challenges that come with it. Because if you can be walking a piano for that matter, how do I know that that walking piano is Oscar, you know, how do I know that? How can I be certain that I’m not dealing with this with someone else who has stolen your identity?</p>
<p>So digital identity or in this case I would argue Self-Sovereign Identity is very, very crucial for a metaverse, especially in open metaverse. Less so a closed metaverse, which is controlled by companies because they can do your identity check and they can verify that you are a real person. Your identity can still be hacked and be stolen, but that it’s more easy to control it.</p>
<p>That’s also has problems to it. In an open metaverse self-sovereign identity is really, really important because it allows us to control who has access to our data, for how long, to which data, and have full control over assets and our identity. So, I think if we think that identity is important on the current web, we have to think twice because it will be a lot more important in the metaverse. And for many millions of kids and teenagers that digital identity is already more important than the physical identity.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, that thing that you just said for a second time. It’s very, very important to think about because we need to protect those identities. Because the big bunch of the people who are going to be in when metaverse is more ubiquitous, as we call it, in the next 10/ 20 years. Will be using heavily, and we have to protect those, those identities.</p>
<p>Another thing you mentioned is if you have some of these, what example? Like a flying dragon, for instance, Oscar is a Flying Dragon in some metaverse. Right? So, people who are inside a metaverse will see the Flying Dragon, my name, maybe. But how do I enter to this metaverse? So that’s a point that many people don’t think right? I should have been, call it, logged in or authenticated properly in order to enter to that that metaverse.</p>
<p>Mark: Well, that’s a major technical and cultural challenge that you just mentioned, because what we don’t want is that if I go to Fortnite and into Roblox, into Decentraland and into the sandbox and to whatever other virtual world. That I every time I have to recreate my flying dragon, every time I have to create a new account, just like we do in the real world, actually.</p>
<p>So that’s not what we want to happen. Now in order to achieve that, we need interoperability. So, you need to be able to have an identity that you can take to a place just like you take your identity to a pub or a restaurant or club or whatever, in the physical world. So, we need to have that same approach.</p>
<p>But there are some companies are working on this. Ready Player Me is a company that’s building an avatar tool so that you can create your avatar ones and then you can use that avatar in over a few thousand platforms already. So that’s a start. It’s a centralised company’s nothing self-sovereign identity with it, is nothing blockchain, nothing decentralised. So, you actually don’t control your identity, but at least it’s the first step that you create one account to do this.</p>
<p>But we already have that in the 2D world, which is called a Facebook login in or a Google login, you know. Login with Google account, login with your Facebook account, which by the way, I would recommend not to do. Because yes, it is easy, but it also means that your data goes to Facebook, goes to Google, and they have even more access into what you are doing. So please don’t do that. I know it’s easy, but just don’t do it.</p>
<p>And so from that perspective, your identity is really important and we need to be able to build this interoperability so that you can take your avatar, your identity, that you create – yours, your flying purple dragon that you’ve created to all these different platforms and all these different platforms have different graphical requirements, different computational requirements, which makes it really, really challenging to do that.</p>
<p>You know, if you go to platform A, it might be hyper realistic and your dragon looks really, really hyper realistic, but then you go to a platform like Minecraft or Roblox is very, very blocky, and how do you adapt that? How do you have that one identity work in both worlds? That’s a massive technical challenge, that’s definitely not solved yet and that does require probably quite a bit of work to achieve that. But yes, what we need to have is interoperability, that you can take your avatar, you can take your flying dragon, and you can fly from one world to the other.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, exactly. Now mentioned flying from one world to the other. How open these companies, like Fortnight, say Disney or whichever is the other, Minecraft, no? Are they open to that interoperability? What do you feel that they’re open, to have that? Would they prefer to have it closed?</p>
<p>Mark: Well, most likely they will prefer to have it closed, which I think is a very short-sighted approach. Yes, having a closed network offers you a lot of value. We can only have to look at a mobile, a mobile messaging. WhatsApp was sold for $19 billion in 2014 for a reason because it’s a closed network and you can’t send a WhatsApp message to your signal or to your telegram.</p>
<p>In Europe, that’s going to change with the new laws. Investor rule probably not. So, we are very much used to not having this interoperability because for such large companies it offers a lot of value. If we do have that interoperability for society, it brings a lot of value.</p>
<p>We only have to look at email, we are able to send an email from a Gmail account to a Hotmail account. Imagine that would not be possible or imagine that we, we don’t have interoperability for websites that you can only build a website for, I don’t know, Chrome and then you have to build a completely new website for Internet Explorer, and you can’t just switch between. Imagine what that would mean for the world, it would just ruin the internet.</p>
<p>And email is so successful because I can use Gmail, you can use Hotmail and we can communicate. So, I think it’s very short-sighted for these companies – I understand why they think like that, but I think it’s very short sighted and very selfish almost, to work on value extraction instead of value creation for society.</p>
<p>So, interoperability will add a lot more value to all these platforms. If you really make it easy and make it nice and easy for people to come and also leave, you will see that if you offer the best product, the best service then people will still come, and you will still make money. It’s a different approach, it’s approach from a short-term share approach to a long-term societal stakeholder approach.</p>
<p>And I think as a society, we need to make that shift from a short term to long term. And I argue and I call every organisation to, to make that shift. However, I’m also a realist and I know that that’s not very likely and that most likely regulation will have to step in to force these people because they probably will not do it by themselves.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. I couldn’t agree more with this point about that, and I hope they are listening to. They are listening to Mark and everyone else who is.</p>
<p>Mark: I hope so too.</p>
<p>Oscar: You already mentioned self-sovereign identity. Would you say that this is going to be the dominant paradigm in the metaverse?</p>
<p>Mark: Well, I hope so and I think it should be, because it’s a way that we control who has access to our data. And the best example here is, of course, if I go to pub and I need to show that I’m over 18 currently in the world, I have to show my driver’s licence. On my driver’s licence there’s a ton of information that’s not relevant for the question. Are you over 18, yes, or no? Which is a, just a very simple question and a self-sovereign identity allows, would allow us to answer that question, that we can trust, without providing all that information. And I think as a society, I think we should want it.</p>
<p>We should be able to live in a world where we are not controlled by a centralised entity because generally centralised entities, they corrupt or they get if they become too powerful – in terms of countries, democracies change to non-democracies. So, I don’t think that’s the right direction. So, for me, for a humanity perspective, I think a self-sovereign identity is the best approach.</p>
<p>Now obviously there’s also a lot of challenges to it because if you own and control your own digital identity and it works with the private key and public key, and your private key is 128 bits, whatever, or even ideally more whatever. And you’re going to lose this long string of numbers because people lose passports and smartphones all the time. How are we going to deal with that?</p>
<p>That question hasn’t been answered yet and people will lose their private key. And if your self-sovereign identity is everything that you do and you lose it, then you are in really, really deep trouble. So, we need to solve that.</p>
<p>It hasn’t been solved and we need to – because it’s almost an oxymoron. You know, I am I going to store my private key with a centralised entity. So, then your private key is, you know, your self-sovereign identity is no longer self-sovereign.</p>
<p>And we saw that with that with the collapse of the various crypto exchanges, if you don’t own your private keys, the money is not really yours. Because it can just disappear. And so, this is self-sovereign identity, very, very important. It hasn’t been cracked yet and there’s still quite some technical challenges that we need to resolve here.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I believe so. It’s super important to solve that problem. Absolutely. We’ve been talking about – you illustrate very nicely all these scenarios mostly for individuals, I would say. But if we now focus our attention a bit more into businesses, even government, for instance, organisations just in general. So, what are the opportunities or some scenario you can see the metaverse for, yes, for organisations and businesses?</p>
<p>Mark: Well as I mentioned earlier, you know, the metaverse will contribute trillions and trillions of dollars to the global economy. So, there are enormous amount of possibilities.</p>
<p>There are possibilities for consumer B2C, digital fashion, multibillion dollar industry, entertainment, immersive sports, watching sports or using augmented reality to bring a TV show into your living room. Well, Disney recently released a sample of that, which looks amazing. Education, you know, if you can learn something, immersive world, if you can walk around Rome for your history classes and pause whatever is happening to have a discussion with your teacher, that, of course, is a lot more powerful, but also from an enterprise perspective, you know, if I am able to collaborate in a virtual world, in a world that works, in a 3D world that’s a lot more intuitive and much, much more logical for us humans to operate in.</p>
<p>And that will have a big, big impact. Early last year in 2022, I was part of a training done by almost a dozen police forces around the world. And they were doing an exercise in the metaverse, in virtual reality and working with, you know, physical evidence and digital evidence. Everyone was in their own location in Singapore, in UAE, Bahrain, Senegal, France and several other countries.</p>
<p>And they were able to, to solve this scenario, which was a terrorist attack in a hypothetical country. And they all said afterwards that being able to collaborate in a virtual world is really nice and it’s really easy to get along with and also because there was no hierarchy, because all the avatars look the same that help the police forces are very hierarchical that, of course, and that really helped as well.</p>
<p>So, there are a lot of benefits to this. You also see it, for example, in design companies, car companies Volvo is doing a lot by using virtual reality or even mixed reality to design cars with remote teams. So, sort of building a claim model in a physical location, you build a digital model with your design team just living or working anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter where they are. All these things will have a big impact. And that will also have a big impact on society because, you know, if we think that the pandemic changed working from home, the metaverse will enable working from anywhere and where you can be literally anywhere you want in the world and eventually in early next decade, I have the feeling as if you are physically present in the office by but you are on a tropical paradise in the Pacific.</p>
<p>And that that’s something where we are going to still far, far away.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, from sounds nice. Final question, Mark, for all business leaders that are listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Mark: Educate yourself and because the world is changing so fast at the moment, if you blink your eyes, you’ve missed a train. And we could have seen that. We did that with the AI, all the generative AI stuff that is happening at the moment, even for me. And it’s my job to be in to know what’s going on.</p>
<p>Even for me, it’s sometimes difficult to understand and to follow and to be up to date of what’s going on because the developments are going so fast. Now, if this is not your core job which for 99.99% of people, it isn’t. And it often ends up on a very long to do list at the bottom.</p>
<p>But you need to understand what’s happening and you need to understand ideally as an organisation, I would also start experimenting with this stuff, small experiments, just to understand what’s happening. And then you can, you can take it from there.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. Excellent. And as you say, your, um, you do what you preach. So, like your last book, just in doing your due diligence, doing this kind of stuff. Yeah, I think I have to do some experiments like that myself.</p>
<p>Mark: Well 100%, and for me doing these experiments, they help me to understand, to better understand these technologies. And so, if you want to understand what technology, X, Y, Z means for your business, start experimenting with it.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Well, thanks a lot Mark. What’s been really fascinating conversation, going for moments very deep into the digital identity, which is something that we are very passionate about, that. And you gave us really good ideas and updates what’s going on. But let us know if someone would like to follow the conversation with you or get more about what you’re doing. What are the best ways?</p>
<p>Mark: So, I’m pretty visible online, so the easiest ways to go to find me on my website, which is <a href="https://www.thedigitalspeaker.com/">thedigitalspeaker.com</a>, you’ll find my books there, my academic papers, my videos, my articles. I have almost a thousand articles about these topics all available to consume, feel free to email me, connect with me on LinkedIn, on Twitter. I’m happy to connect with anyone.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic and&nbsp;again, it was a pleasure talking with you, Mark, and all the best.</p>
<p>Mark: Thank you very much for having me, Oscar. It’s been a great conversation.</p>

<p>Modern identity management relies on multi-factor authentication to maintain account security above and beyond simple passwords. One-Time Passwords (OTPs) are a vital part of this effort.</p>
<p>What are Time-Based OTPs? TOPTs are one-time passwords that use synced clocks to generate and cycle through authentication tokens for added system security.</p>
 What Is a One-Time Password? 
<p>A <a>One-Time Password (OTP)</a> is a form of authentication in which the authentication system generates pseudo-randomized tokens, or strings of alphanumeric characters, to verify user identity. A common form of <a>multi-factor authentication</a> (MFA), one-time passwords fill the role of “ownership,” or proof that the user has access to a particular device or delivery method.</p>
<p>In an OTP scheme, the authentication system generates a secure one-time authentication token, often in the form of a string of numbers, to which the user has access. This token is unique to the transaction at hand and will only be known through the ownership of the delivery mechanism of the password (which can be both hardware- and software-based). </p>
<p>OTPs provide users with a secure form of MFA because they are generally easy to disseminate and use as a second authentication factor. Currently, several common forms of OTP delivery exist in enterprise and consumer markets.</p>
<p>These forms of token delivery include:</p>
 
 Email/SMS: By far, the most common OTP method is the delivery of a token via SMS text or email. The authentication system uses the user’s credentials to send an OTP to one of these services, requiring the user to input the OTP once received. This approach is generally more secure than single-factor authentication, with the caveat that it is useless should users have access to their devices or email stolen. 
 Hardware Tokens: Some strict security schemes require users to have physical tokens. These devices may resemble a badge, keychain fob, or USB key and generate keys synced to the conditions of the authentication server. However, they do not require Internet access and can only be compromised if the device is lost or stolen. 
 Software Authenticators: A common alternative to hardware keys are software authenticators that generate tokens. Common mobile apps like Microsoft Authenticator or Google Authenticator provide added security by eliminating the need to send OTPs across SMS or email.  
 <a>Push Authentication</a>: Modern OTP systems can use push notifications on a mobile phone to send a one-time password or even bypass the need for an OTP entirely. 
 
<p>With all the possible ways to send an OTP, it’s still critical that these passwords are random and secure–if a hacker could guess an OTP, they are next to worthless. To avoid that issue, there are several ways that OTPs are generated:</p>
 
 Hash-Based: Hash-Based OTPs (HTOPs) are generated using a hashing function that often includes a secret key and a “moving factor” to create pseudo random tokens. This moving factor is pulled from the environment to make guessing OTPs or their generation mechanisms impossible.
<p>Generally, general HTOPs can draw from information gathered during an initial transaction (i.e., the initial password-based authentication in an MFA verification request). Additionally, some hash-based systems will utilize “hash chains,” or sequences of OTPs based on the values of previous one-time passwords.</p> 
 Challenge-Response: Challenge-response systems will use user input as a moving factor in OTP generation. This moving factor could be the password the user provides or the answer to a specific security question. 
 Time-Based: Time-Based OTPs (TOTPs) use system time and other factors to create and cycle through one-time passwords for additional security. 
 
 How Do Time-Based One-Time Passwords Work? 
<p>Time-Based OTPs are those created using a synchronized timestamp as a moving step to seed a random key. This moving step is used to regenerate a new OTP once per interval, so the actual OTP required for multi-factor authentication changes each interval.</p>
<p>The result is a continuing cycle of OTPs that don’t rely on a specific input to generate. This generation cycle can continue unimpeded such that, at any given time, a user may access a pseudorandom OTP for MFA purposes. </p>
<p>The fluid nature of TOTPs provides several significant security benefits to enterprises and users by protecting against specific attacks, namely:</p>
 
 Brute-Force Password Attacks: Brute-force attacks are those that involve, as the name suggests, hammering authentication systems with password lists (usually dictionaries or lists of common or default passwords).
<p>This is a general feature of most MFA systems, but OTPs circumvent even the possibility of password guessing by requiring access to a service account or device.</p> 
 <a>Phishing</a>: Phishing attacks count on users giving up passwords via email or SMS so that hackers can gain access to important accounts. OTPs mitigate this possibility by requiring that hackers also have access to an OTP to authenticate.<br>
In the case of TOTPs, this challenge is amplified by the fact that the hacker would need to own either the token-generation device or an end-user’s token authenticator (such as a software app) at the exact moment of verification to get the right token. 
 Replay Attacks: Replay attacks are when a third party intercepts credentials and attempts to insert them into an authentication process to spoof their identity, usually soon after the original transaction. Because TOTPs require time-sensitive tokens, there’s no way to spoof credentials in a time-sensitive way accurately. 
 
<p>While TOTPs prevent several attacks, they are still vulnerable if a token generator (hardware or software) is stolen. For example, if the user has an OTP application on their phone and the phone is stolen, then the benefits of TOTPs are largely irrelevant.</p>
 What Are the Benefits of TOTP? 
<p>TOTP, and MFA writ large, provide significant business and security advantages over single-factor authentication. Additionally, a TOTP system can address significant issues with authentication security–namely, implementation, onboarding, and adoption.</p>
<p>These benefits include:</p>
 
 Cost Reduction: OTP systems generally are common and relatively easy to implement. Using TOTPs involves very little investment above and beyond typical MFA systems. Finally, even third-party authentication and identity providers can offer robust MFA and OTP support for a straightforward monthly fee. All of these factors combine to reduce costs (in terms of both time and money) for advanced security.  
 User Friendly: OTP systems integrate well with mobile and networked technologies. Software TOTPs are readily available for tablets and smartphones, so your employees can easily install and use the technology without changing their normal computing habits. This reduces the complexity of onboarding or adoption–often serious issues in adopting proper security methods. 
 Scalable: OTPs, and TOTPs, are easy to scale. You only need an authentication server and delivery methods (apps, hardware tokens, etc.) to distribute. That’s it. 
 Secure: TOTPs provide a critical layer of time-sensitive security that can thwart some of the most common and challenging threats facing enterprises today, specifically phishing and other social engineering attacks.

 A new paper describes harms rising from digital identity, and accountable responses for 2023.&nbsp; 



 

 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfNotjE_Vk">Video of Nicky Hickman and Phil Wolff introducing the paper</a> at the Trust Over IP All Hands meeting on 25 January 2023. 20 minutes of presentation and 20 minutes of Q&amp;A. 



<p><a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP</a> <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2023/01/17/why-the-digital-identity-juggernaut-needs-safety-belts/">announced today</a> their “<a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/Overcoming-Human-Harm-Challenges-in-Digital-Identity-Ecosystems-V1.0-2022-11-16.pdf">Overcoming Human Harm Challenges in Digital Identity Ecosystems</a>” paper for review. <a href="http://linkedin.com/company/widerteam">Wider Team</a>’s <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/philwolff">Phil Wolff</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/come-to-the-edge/about/">Come To The Edge</a>’s <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/nickyhickman">Nicky Hickman</a> wrote it with a large team of contributors including <a href="https://th.linkedin.com/in/pyrou-chung-4558b59b">Pyrou Chung</a> of the <a href="https://ewmi.org/">East-West Management Institute</a>.</p>



<p>Six cases track ways people have been hurt when digital identity ecosystems were abused, done poorly, or attacked. </p>



 
 People went hungry, broke, and even died because of digital identity failures.&nbsp; 



 Organizations wrote to the World Bank last year with ‘grave concerns’ about the Bank’s ID4D program and its “<a href="https://www.privacyinternational.org/advocacy/4945/letter-global-csos-world-bank">potential for abuse and exploitation</a>.”&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://internetsafetylabs.org/">Internet Safety Labs</a> lists more than <a href="https://internetsafetylabs.org/resources/references/digital-harms-dictionary-2-0/">seventy specific ways harms happen in their Digital Harms Dictionary</a>. The sheer diversity of harms makes them harder to identify.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Many of these harms are preventable by standards&nbsp;bodies, developers, and makers of identity systems. Preventable by customers, the enterprises who configure, deploy, and use identity ecosystems. Preventable by public policy makers and the regulators who enforce them. </p>



<p>Despite human harms being preventable, few are doing anything about it.&nbsp;</p>



 So what?&nbsp; 



 
 The coming backlash may devastate open standards efforts. The identity community risks fallout as public cases of outrageous harm pile up. We all rely on vigorous open standards bodies.  



 Backlash hurts identity businesses. When biometrics and AI hit their trust and ethics crises a few years’ ago, they faced regulatory interventions, stalled sales, and investor skepticism.  



 Blamestorms hurt identity ecosystem cohesion. Media outrage blames the closest business or agency. A hospital gets blamed for a vendor’s patient data breach, for example. So shaming and blaming of any ecosystem member will tarnish the rest, and drive abandonment and defection from that ecosystem.  
 



<p> However…</p>



 
 Accountability mitigates backlash. The more we build accountability into ecosystem governance and technology, the smaller the backlash, hopefully.&nbsp;Accountability By Design could be our watchword.  



 Identity can use proven accountability tools and practices. Other technologies and industries dealt with their negative externalities. Drug tampering led to safety caps. Toxic food led to traceability through food supply chains. Racist AI led to ethical AI standards for training ML systems. Environmental pollution led to… well we’re still working on that. So, let’s adapt effective ideas and practices.&nbsp; 



 Next? What can identity technologists, industry, regulators, and standards groups do now? The paper lists low-hanging fruit and suggests first steps.&nbsp; 
 



 Preventable side effects offend me.&nbsp; 



<p>My head hurts over these six identity harms case studies, and the many we didn’t include in the paper. I can’t count the number of aspirational manifestos and value statements by folks who work on self-sovereign identity. We frame identity as a human right, a civil right, a duty of good government, a way to empower the excluded, the poor, and the dispossessed. We champion our digital identity technologies and governance in the name of serving humanity, and business progress, and enabling society, and healing our planet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite our pure motives and hard work…&nbsp;</p>



<p>These new, richer identity tools can be abused just as much as old ones. It is human nature that every identification technology will be abused. My cynical take on human nature is grounded in history. </p>



<p>Today’s widely used digital identity tools suffer from cultural blindness and dissonance. <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/ToIP+Asia-Pacific">ToIP’s Asia Pacific Human Experience working group</a> shared stories where Western models of personhood, encoded in nearly all digital identity systems, exclude and distort how identity works for millions of people. The paper tells more about this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We looked at identity systems that enabled predators to hound a child to suicide. To facilitate gambling addiction. To leave a refugee in limbo. All without a responsible person to blame. Without even a single company or policy or technical artifact to blame.&nbsp;</p>



 These harms don’t arrive with accountability.&nbsp; 



<p>Digital identity systems are fundamentally “ecosystems.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>They are made from many parties, in a complex, diverse, fluid, multijurisdictional web.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Like cities, identity ecosystems are built up over time, with legacies of cultural assumption and prejudices, of old choices and narrow contexts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And those of us who have worked with trust frameworks, who bring identity ecosystems into being or refine them, we have not held ourselves morally at fault when they do harm. No more than those who make cars or airplanes or firearms are responsible when those goods result in injury and death.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You won’t trace those harms back to an open standard committee meeting or to an identity ecosystem rollout any more than you’d trace a spent bullet back to the factory operator that machined it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When chains of causality are hard to map, or are untraceable, the root causes of these harms are unaccountable.&nbsp;</p>



 Inciting action, building in accountability, will be difficult.&nbsp; 



 
 The identity technology community is in denial about downstream risks. Few in the identity professions and industries believe these human problems exist.&nbsp; 



 Untested business cases. Nobody believes this matters enough or matters to them personally or matters urgently.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Anecdotes, not statistics. These threats are mostly uncounted and unmeasured; a weakness in quantified policy and management circles.&nbsp; 



 No ownership. Nobody owns these problems outright. Neither the toolmakers nor any of an ecosystem’s parties own the side effects of a system’s broken trust.&nbsp; 



 Scopes of responsibility are too narrow. Our definitions of “ecosystem” leave out many kinds of people affected by the ecosystem, and harms inflicted on them. Although governance practices include responsibility to other members of an ecosystem, they rarely name negative externalities or speak to accountability for them.&nbsp; 



 Ethics are unevenly distributed. The abilities to discover harms swiftly, make sense of them, and respond well are unequal within an identity ecosystem. They will continue to be. Those who are most ready and able to respond are unlikely to be the only parties generating those harms. And some ecosystem parties will trigger harms emitted by others.&nbsp;“Ethics are unevenly distributed” seems like a universal law that begs for corollaries.  



 IAM industry consolidation reduces individual companies’ fear of side effects. <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/monopolies-and-cybersecurity-disasters">Thoma Bravo buying Forgerock, Ping,and Sailpoint</a> cuts the odds these issues make it to any of their executive OKRs.&nbsp; 
 



<p>This is blue ocean territory: I haven’t found anyone in our space investing to manage these business risks. No companies, government agencies, or NGOs are actively working on human harm reduction, response, or regulation. After my year on the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnYTXKD6yFkhcyE7JO6UawK9doE5AS3Xi">Human Experience Working Group</a>’s <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/SSI+Harms+%28BGBU%29+Task+Force">Harms Task Force</a>, I hope this paper helps folks understand the range of risks digital identity brings. And that we act now, in concert.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We're kicking the New Year off with the release of Webnative SDK version 0.35!</p> An Introduction to Webnative <p>Here at Fission, we build identity, data, and compute protocols that empower developers to build decentralized edge apps without a complex back-end. We're actively working on a <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/on-building-a-decentralized-database/">decentralized database</a> and <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/ipfs-thing-breaking-down-ipvm/">virtual machine</a>, and our solutions for decentralized identity and storage are available today in Webnative SDK. Our SDKs and protocols have been integrated into many edge apps, including <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/capyloon/">Capyloon</a>, <a href="https://web3.storage/">web3.storage</a>, and <a href="https://subconscious.substack.com/p/noosphere-a-protocol-for-thought">Noosphere</a>. </p><p>The Webnative library provides:</p>
 
 User accounts using the browser's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API">Web Crypto API</a> or a blockchain wallet using the Webnative <a href="https://github.com/fission-codes/webnative-walletauth">WalletAuth</a> plugin 
 Authorization using <a href="https://ucan.xyz/">UCAN</a> 
 Encrypted file storage using the <a href="https://runfission.gitbook.io/latest/developers/webnative/file-system-wnfs">Webnative File System</a> backed by <a href="https://ipld.io/">IPLD</a> 
 Key management using the <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg/awake">AWAKE</a> protocol to link devices 
 Platform APIs for publishing apps from the browser 
 
<p>Let's break each of these down.</p> User Accounts <p>Developers can choose whether they would like the browser or a blockchain wallet to store a user's encrypt and decrypt keys. The best choice depends on what kind of user experience the developer would like their users to have. For example, if they are building an app for a blockchain audience, using the blockchain wallet user account is likely the best option. </p><p>Our team is also currently working on a third user accounts option - passkey support. Passkeys are secured by the device's OS.</p> Authorization <p><a href="https://ucan.xyz/">UCAN</a> stands for User Controlled Authorization Network. UCANs are a way of doing authorization (“what you can do”) where users are fully in control.<br>There’s no all-powerful authorization server, or server of any kind required! Everything that a user is allowed to do is captured directly in a key or token, and can be sent to anyone that knows how to interpret this format.</p>The UCAN mascot Encrypted File Storage <p>The Webnative library provides developers the tools to make their edge apps work seamlessly offline while being encrypted at rest. We created an encrypted file storage system called <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/diving-deeper-webnative-file-system/">WNFS</a>, which is built on top of the <a href="https://ipfs.tech/">IPFS</a> protocol and backed by <a href="https://ipld.io/">IPLD</a>, making it interoperable across the Web.</p>Winnie the WNFS mascot Key Management <p>Device-linking is a breeze with the <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg/awake">AWAKE</a> protocol. AWAKE is an authenticated key exchange that provides a way to know something provable about what the other party can do, even if they have no sure way of knowing who the party is. To do this, the protocol leverages UCAN capabilities that don't require a root source of truth. </p>The AWAKE mascot Platform APIs  <p>As well as using the <a href="https://ghost.fission.codes/developers/cli">Fission CLI</a> to register and publish apps, developers can create web apps that publish an app directly from the browser.</p> What's New <p>Webnative version 0.35 is a major rewrite to improve the reliability and extensibility of Webnative. Here are a few of the big changes:</p> Namespaced Apps <p>Webnative can now have many apps run on the same domain without any conflicts. Each app is namespaced by default and has its own accounts and WNFS. This should help developers when building apps on the same localhost port. </p> Customizable + Extensible <p>A new component system makes it possible for Webnative to run independent of Fission infrastructure. For example, you can use the web3.storage IPFS platform to host your encrypted data. This system also enables the webnative-walletauth plugin.</p> Increased Reliability <p>We've made improvements to the device-linking feature so it works smoothly across multiple browsers.</p> Temporary Filesystems <p>Multiple filesystems can be loaded at the same time now that conflicts with identifiers have been resolved in the latest version. This allows users to access a temporary filesystem until they are ready to create their own account. When the user ends their session, the developer can give them the option to either store their files locally or create a new account.</p> Next Steps <p>Learn all about the latest version of Webnative SDK by reviewing the <a href="https://github.com/fission-codes/webnative/blob/182a8157d1c0d3c30df7c349fe3c87a348057853/CHANGELOG.md#v0350">changelog</a> and <a href="https://runfission.gitbook.io/latest/developers/webnative">guide</a>.</p><p>Developers with existing Webnative apps will need to make some changes in order for their apps to be compatible with the latest version. Details on what needs to be updated are available on the <a href="https://guide.fission.codes/developers/webnative/migration#version-0.35.0">migration page</a>.</p><p><a href="https://fission.codes/blog/webnative-app-template/">Webnative App Template</a> is up to date and ready to use with version 0.35, so now is a great time to take Webnative SDK out for a test drive.<br></p>

<p>Coin Trust: This Chinese media article covers all the amazing features of Mythical Beings, which is beyond an NFT card collection in the Ardor ecosystem. You can collect more than 50 mythical creatures from all over the world, and new ones are released each season. While collecting, you get access to the painting, the myth and the culture behind each creature. Mythical Beings cards can be used for crafting, morphing, or exchanging them with other players based on their level: common, rare, epic, and special. Last but not least, it is a Play-To-Earn game. Therefore, when you complete the collection you can claim the jackpot – a GEM reward (the in-game currency) of 60% of all sales income distributed among the users with all cards, and the chance to get a special card.</p>
