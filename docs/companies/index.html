 In today’s data-driven world, enterprises are seeking: 



<p></p>



  Ways to meet the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">demands of their users</a>&nbsp;for safer and more private interactions with their services and the digital world around them.  New methods for simplifying their government regulation compliance efforts for their handling of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personally identifiable information</a>.&nbsp;  



<p><br>As we’ve been discussing in this article series in recent weeks, the Sudo Platform lets enterprise developers integrate digital identities into their applications and build a deeper level of trust with their users by providing them with various digital identity-based capabilities. The platform offers extensive privacy capabilities, from communications to secure browsing to payments, all centered around digital identities. Indeed, the Sudo Platform delivers enterprises the solution they’re looking for through a range of identity, privacy, and cyber safety offerings.</p>



The Sudo Platform.



<p>The diagram above shows the Sudo Platform. At the foundation is a set of scalable hosted services that provide the capabilities to an enterprise developer. An enterprise can integrate these hosted services with its own systems to provide entitlement, federated single sign-on, and other integrations. The hosted services are also integrated into various third-party systems such as cloud providers, telephony carriers, banks, payment processors, blockchains and more. The hosted services are deployed individually for each of Anonyome’s enterprise customers, completely separating them from other enterprise customers’ data and services, and providing the ability to customize that environment for the enterprise.</p>



<p>Above the hosted services are a set of SDKs, documentation and sample apps distributed through GitHub that allow enterprises to quickly develop applications using the Sudo Platform services. All SDKs and sample app source code are open source so enterprise developers can quickly become productive using the Sudo Platform services.Some enterprises require a faster route to market or may lack the internal expertise to create and deploy applications to end users. For those companies, we also publish UI kits that enable easy setup, configuration, and consumption of platform SDKs into unbranded applications that can be quickly branded and delivered to market on mobile, web, and desktop platforms. This allows us to provide a rapid white-label offering that is very attractive to enterprises who want the fastest time to market.</p>



Sudo Platform capabilities.



 The diagram above shows the current capabilities of the Sudo Platform. The digital identity underpins these capabilities, and they can be grouped like this: 



<p></p>



  Open Communication&nbsp;– Allows a user to interact with any third-party service or user they don’t know. Users can provision phone numbers and email addresses and use SMS/MMS, voice calling and email for communication.  Secure Communication&nbsp;– Delivers end-to-end encrypted messaging, voice calling, video and email. Used when both users in the communication have the same app.  Safe Browsing&nbsp;– A compartmentalized browser experience with ad/tracker blocker and site reputation. Supplemented with VPN capabilities.  Cyber Safety&nbsp;– Safe payments, password management, secure id verification and dark web monitoring.  



<p><br>Next week, in part 3, we’ll explore how we’re enhancing Sudo digital identities with decentralized identity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Venerdì 6 maggio 2022 presso la Residenza d’Epoca Villa Miani, a partire dalle ore 18:00 si terrà l’evento organizzato da A.I.O.P Lazio, al quale InfoCert sarà presente come Main Sponsor.</p>



<p>Il Convegno dal titolo “Nuove frontiere in sanità. Finita la pandemia, l’inizio della gestione del PNRR”, sarà strutturato come tavola rotonda, alla quale parteciperanno numerose personalità di spicco provenienti sia dal mondo della Pubblica Amministrazione che della Sanità.</p>



<p>L’evento inizierà con il saluto del Sindaco di Roma Capitale Roberto Gualtieri, seguito poi dal Presidente di HIMSS (Health Information and Management Systems Society) e Advisor dell’organizzazione mondiale della sanità sui temi di sanità digitale Harold (Hal) Wolf; a seguito di ciò avrà inizio la tavola rotonda moderata da Roberta Serdoz, caporedattrice del TgR Lazio.</p>



<p>Prenderanno parte alla round table il Presidente della Regione Calabria Roberto Occhiuto, l’Assessore alla Salute e integrazione Socio-Sanitaria Alessio D’Amato, l’Assessore alle Politiche per la Salute della Regione Emilia Romagna e Coordinatore della Commissione Salute Conferenza delle Regioni Raffaele Donini, il Rettore dell’Università UniCamillus Gianni Profita e il Direttore Generale di AGE.NA.S. Domenico Mantoan. Nell’occasione verrà presentata una ricerca curata da Fidelia Cascini, docente presso l’Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore di Roma. Interverrà alla Cena di Gala il Presidente della Giunta regionale Lazio Nicola Zingaretti.</p>



<p>L’A.I.O.P., è una importante associazione italiana che rappresenta IRCSS e case di cura private, accreditate e non, presenti in tutto il territorio italiano, con l’obiettivo di sviluppare la qualificazione delle strutture associate e di sostenerne la collocazione e l’attività nell’ambito dell’organizzazione sanitaria nazionale.</p>



 Le soluzioni Digital Trust di InfoCert per il mondo Healthcare 



<p>InfoCert contribuisce da anni alla trasformazione digitale del mondo Healthcare realizzando la digitalizzazione dei processi amministrativi e clinici tramite l’uso di firme digitali. Per InfoCert un progetto d’innovazione coinvolge la transazione digitale nel suo complesso. Ecco perché siamo in grado di creare una catena del trust nel pieno rispetto della normativa vigente.</p>



<p>L‘emergenza sanitaria ha prodotto un’enorme spinta verso l’efficientamento della Sanità italiana. InfoCert ha operato al fianco delle strutture Healthcare mediante, ad esempio, la raccolta del Consenso Sanitario per la campagna Vaccinale COVID19 di ASL Roma 1 e la notifica digitale della Comunicazione di Quarantena, sviluppando inoltre nuovi innovativi processi come la raccolta del video consenso informato.</p>

<p>Businesses and organizations use physical credentials like employee badges, driver’s licenses, passports, social security cards, and more to identify people.</p><p>These physical documents act as proof that authenticates who we are and our authority to do what we do — we’re old enough to go to a nightclub; be identified during international travel; apply for a new job after earning a degree.</p><p>However, with increasing digitization, people are required to interact with thousands of businesses online. </p><p>Providing proof of identity in a digital setting involves a slow and difficult verification process and increases the risk associated with data breaches and fraudulent credentials.</p> What Is the Problem? <p>The current system of recreating documents electronically involves creating a digital version of the credential (like a PDF or an XML document).</p><p>The process is pretty simple and can be implemented quite easily — at least in principle.</p><p>But verifying the origin and authenticity of documents presented in these formats is complex.

And leave users without control over who has access to their personal information, where their documents are stored, and how they are being used.</p><p>This is where verifiable credentials come into the picture, along with data protection systems that help individuals create and share their identities reliably.</p> What Exactly Are Verifiable Credentials, and How Do They Help? <p>In simple terms, verifiable credentials are a digital version of paper-based credentials that people can present to third parties who need them for verification. However, unlike physical credentials or pdfs, verifiable credentials are tamper-proof and instantly verifiable.</p><p>Organizations can issue their degrees, IDs, licenses, etc., as verifiable digital credentials. </p><p>Just like physical documents, people have the ability to store their verifiable credentials within a digital wallet. </p><p>A digital wallet is a digital version of a traditional or physical wallet that people can carry around as a mobile application on their phone, computer, or even a cloud-based server.</p><p>Using verifiable credentials and digital wallets is a safe and convenient alternative to other identity management solutions in the market today. </p><p>The primary reason why verifiable credentials are becoming increasingly popular among people and businesses all over the world is that it checks a lot of boxes when it comes to user requirements and addresses several issues associated with the current identity management system. </p><p>Verifiable Credentials create immediate trust between parties. </p><p>Using Verifiable Credentials, an organization can immediately ascertain if a document is authentic and who issued it. And do so in seconds without contacting the issuer!</p><p>In addition to being inherently digital (something that has become more of a prerequisite today), verifiable credentials are a big step towards supporting data protection.</p><p>Here’s the thing. </p><p>When you share a physical credential or a pdf, you may be disclosing a lot more personal information than is strictly necessary. </p><p>Verifiable credentials enable people to verify their identity and only divulge information that is relevant to the context. </p><p>Physical credentials don’t offer this kind of flexibility.</p><p>Furthermore, it’s easy to forge paper-based credentials.</p> Why Is a Centralized Identity Management System Problematic? <p>Let’s explore this topic with an example — the recent COVID19 vaccination certificate. </p><p>Verifying a paper-based or pdf-based vaccination certificate in a fast-paced environment like at a cricket match or during flight travel is often time-consuming and prone to errors.</p><p>In a digital ecosystem, these vaccination certificates are stored in a centralized database, making them quicker and more convenient when they have to be verified in such scenarios. </p><p>However, a centralized database that stores personal information about millions of people is a <a href="https://cisomag.eccouncil.org/hackers-attack-database-of-indias-covid-19-patients-and-potential-suspects/">goldmine for hackers</a>.</p><p>Leveraging verifiable credentials and blockchain-based decentralized identity management allows people to store and manage their own data. </p><p>They reserve the right to decide how, when, and with whom they want to share their data. </p><p>To address these challenges, the <a href="https://www.iata.org/en/programs/passenger/travel-pass/">IATA Travel Pass Initiative</a> adopted Verifiable Credentials</p> How Do Verifiable Credentials Work? <p>To understand how verifiable credentials work, you need to know about the key entities involved in the verifiable credentials ecosystem — issuer, holder, and verifier. </p><p>As the name suggests, the issuer is an entity that has the authority to issue verifiable credentials. This could be your college university issuing you a diploma after you finish the course, governmental organizations issuing you a national ID, etc. &nbsp;</p><p>The holder is someone who owns the credential. They store and share the verifiable credential from their digital wallet. </p><p>Lastly, the verifier is the one who validates or authenticates the credential. This could be a hiring company you’ve shared your diploma with. </p><p>But how is the identity verified?</p><p>The issuer issues the verifiable credential and digitally signs it with a cryptographic key that only the issuer can use. </p><p>When the verifier receives a credential, they will verify its authenticity through a blockchain, an immutable and decentralized database.</p><p>One thing to note is that the blockchain doesn’t actually store the users' verifiable credentials. It only stores information that the verifier would need to validate the authenticity of the credential — like the issuer's public cryptographic key that matches the one that signed the credential. </p><p>Using this information, the verifier will determine:</p>  If the issuer has the authority to issue that credential.  If the verifiable credential is still valid (not revoked or expired).  If the credential has been tampered with.   <p>This system is trustless. The verifier no longer has to contact the issuer to confirm the validity of the credential. And the best part is that everything happens in a matter of seconds!</p><p>Let’s understand this entire process with a simple example.</p><p>When you get your driver’s license, the DMV (the issuer) will share their public decentralized identifier (DID) — a globally unique identifier that only the DMV can use — on the blockchain along with a schema that shows what type of information is included in the verifiable credential. </p><p>In this case, the schema outline would look like — name, DL number, DOB, address, etc.</p><p>You will be able to store your driver’s license within your digital wallet and control precisely what you want the verifiers to see. </p><p>If you’re pulled over by a police officer who asks for your driver’s license, you can simply show them the digital signature of the DMV that verifies that you have the authority to drive.</p><p>You don’t have to share additional information like your name or address, a freedom you can’t enjoy with physical credentials. </p><p>Should your license expire, the DMV can either revoke the credential or include an expiration date in the verifiable credential, which will be visible to the policeman since it’s relevant to your right to drive (and that’s exactly what the policeman needs to verify).</p> Reasons to Use Verifiable Credentials.<br>  Verifiable Credentials are Interoperable Across Different Systems. <p>Interoperability is one of the most significant benefits of using verifiable credentials. Businesses can interop verifiable credentials across several different systems. </p><p>You have your vaccination certificate, date of birth proof, and passport as verifiable credentials in your digital wallet. Now, if the airport authority asks you for your credentials, you can collect these digital credentials, create a verifiable presentation with attributes from all of them, and share it.</p><p>The reason for interoperability is because Verifiable Credentials are an open standard by the W3C (the same organization that defined the URL as an open standard). Any system based on the same standard will be able to verify these credentials.</p> Privacy. <p>Lack of privacy is one of the major challenges with the current digital identity management systems. It’s not just hackers you have to worry about; even big tech corporations can monitor your activities online.</p><p>However, this isn’t an issue when you use Verifiable Credentials. The data is encrypted and is only entirely accessible to the holder because of the public-private key encryption system. </p><p>Furthermore, Verifiable Credentials use Selective Disclosure and Zero-Knowledge Proofs. Using the first one, a user can decide only to share parts of a credential. With the second one, users can prove something about themselves without disclosing the data that supports the proof.</p> Meets compliance requirements. <p>Governments worldwide have started to realize the importance of digital security and privacy. Many have been encouraging the use of decentralized identity technologies.</p><p>One major example is the <a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/suche/germany-and-spain-and-join-forces-on-the-development-of-a-cross-border-decentralised-digital-identity-ecosystem-1947302">decentralized digital identity ecosystem by Germany and Spain</a>.</p><p>As governments progress in this direction, it’s obvious that they need a system to meet these compliance requirements. </p><p>Verifiable Credentials perfectly fit the bill.</p> Standardization. <p>Verifiable Credentials have a standard that all issuers and verifiers adhere to, called the W3C Verifiable Credentials standard. </p><p>Let’s take an example. </p><p>You have your passport. All countries have agreed to a standard format to their passports.</p><p>It doesn’t matter who issues it; this credential is read and accepted internationally.</p><p>Furthermore, standardization also simplifies building applications and automations to support the credentials.</p> Easy to implement and use. <p>It’s easy for businesses to issue verifiable credentials without writing a single line of code by <a href="https://certs.dock.io/">leveraging platforms like Dock Certs</a>. </p><p>As for the end-user, it has never been easier to access and share their credentials. A friendly UX masks the complications that go on behind the curtain and makes it effortless for them to securely share their credentials with entities all over the world.</p> Final Thoughts <p>Verifiable credentials have a considerable potential to be an integral part of our future and are already being adopted by Govs, Universities, Healthcare, etc. </p><p>People don’t have to depend on centralized and federated identity systems like Facebook and Google that pose such a massive threat to their privacy. </p><p>Instead, they now have the ability to own and control their digital identity with Verifiable Credentials making it a much more secure experience. </p><p>When Verifiable Credentials are paired with tech like blockchain-based decentralized identity, its momentum has been explosive.</p><p>You can <a href="https://certs.dock.io/">sign up to Dock Certs today</a> and leverage the benefits of verifiable credentials and decentralized identities for your business.</p>

<p>Viel wurde geschrieben und berichtet über Self-Sovereign Identity. Kurz SSI, handelt es sich dabei um einen Ansatz, Individuen die Kontrolle über ihre digitalen Identitäten zurückzugeben. Doch so übersichtlich diese Erklärung auch klingen mag, eine Vielzahl von Methoden und Ansätzen im Netz kann auch zu Unübersichtlichkeiten und gar Falschaussagen führen. In diesem Artikel beleuchten wir Themen und einzelne Aussagen im Detail, die in der letzten Zeit in den Medien diskutiert wurden. Dabei untersuchen wir genauer, ob Self-sovereign Identity in bestimmten Fällen Risiken für Datenmissbrauch erhöhen oder reduzieren kann. Wir schließen mit der Kernthese, dass der Missbrauch von persönlichen Daten leider ganz unabhängig von der genutzten digitalen Identität möglich ist – und wie man sich dennoch durch SSI davor schützen kann.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Datenmissbrauch&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jolocom steht hinter besseren Lösungen für digitale Identität.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Das Wichtigste zuerst: Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) allein erhöht nicht das Risiko, dass Daten missbraucht werden. Aufgrund der Architektur eröffnet es Möglichkeiten, die Datensicherheit und Privacy zu erhöhen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Das größte Risiko liegt darin, dass die Daten der User an einen Onlinedienst weitergegeben werden und diese dann dort gespeichert werden. Heute kennen wir das alle nur zu gut als Nutzerprofil oder Account. Ab dem Moment, in dem ich meine Daten eingegeben habe, muss ich darauf vertrauen, dass der Dienst seine Datenbank gut schützt und meine Daten sicher vor Angriffen durch Hacker und Identitätsdiebe schützt.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Die Erfahrung zeigt uns leider, dass am Ende oft vor allem die Hacker Erfolg haben und täglich tausende Profile und Accounts in die Hände von Datendieben fallen. Dies kann für die Betroffene ein absoluter Albtraum werden und motiviert uns bei Jolocom, an besseren Lösungen für digitale Identität zu arbeiten.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wir haben also zwei Möglichkeiten, entweder wir geben den Diensten keine Daten mehr oder wir zwingen sie dazu die Daten besser abzusichern. Am besten wäre es aber natürlich beides zu schaffen, sowohl weniger Daten zu übertragen, und gleichzeitig eine bessere Sicherung der Daten zu schaffen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Login – Kontinuierliches Onboarding&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Um weniger Daten bei den Diensten zu speichern und trotzdem deren Angebot voll und ganz nutzen zu können gibt es im SSI Bereich eine großartige Möglichkeit, die dafür sorgt, dass ich meine Daten voll und ganz im Griff habe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Das Konzept nennt sich kontinuierliches Onboarding und bedeutet, dass bei jedem Login die Profildaten neu übertragen werden (im Fall von Car Sharing also z.B. meinen relevanten Führerscheindaten, meine IBAN und Rechnungsadresse). Sobald sich der Benutzer abmeldet (und das Auto wieder abgestellt habe) kann der Dienst dessen Daten löschen und behält für sich nur einen individuellen Code, mit dem er den Nutzer oder die Nutzerin beim nächsten Besuch wiedererkennt. Zugegebenermaßen ist man davon abhängig, dass der Dienst dies Daten wirklich löscht, dafür gibt es aber viele Anreize, denn das Risiko eines Hacking Angriffs mit sdchweren Folgen sinkt enorm. Und nicht zu vergessen, wenn sich bei meinem User etwas ändert (z.B. die Telefonnummer) bekomme ich es durch das Continuous Onboaridng in dem Moment mit in dem er das nächste Mal meinen Service nutzt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mit SSI können Daten mit einem Klick geteilt werden, ohne zusätzlichen Aufwand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Heute wäre der oben beschriebene Prozess des kontinuierlichen Onboarding praktisch unmöglich, da die Daten bei jedem Besuch von Hand eintragen werden müssten oder sogar noch per Video der Führerschein oder Ausweis bestätigt werden müsste. Undenkbar aufwändig und für beide Seiten unattraktiv. Mit SSI können Daten mit einem Klick geteilt werden, ohne zusätzlichen Aufwand. Der Dienst spart durch dieses reduzierte Risiko zudem viel Geld, was noch ein weiterer Grund ist, mit SSI zu arbeiten.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>Ganz ohne Regulierung wird es nicht gehen&nbsp;</p>



<p>So gut wir mit SSI dazu beitragen können, dass Dienste keine Daten mehr über uns speichern müssen, ist es keine Garantie, dass sie das nicht tun. Um sicher zu gehen, dass sie nicht mehr Daten als notwendig von uns abfragen, hilft nur Regulierung.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Denn in der Situation in der wir als einzelner User mit den Diensten verhandeln, sitzen wir oft am kürzeren Hebel. Wir wollen den Dienst nutzen und der einzige Weg führt über die Akzeptanz ihrer Bedingungen, ob gerechtfertigt oder nicht. In einer digitalen Welt, in der wir auf viele Dienste praktisch nicht verzichten können, gleicht das einer Erpressung. So sind wir dem Datenmissbrauch oft ausgeliefert und müssen mit ansehen, wie wir entweder aus der Gesellschaft ausgeschlossen werden oder unsere Daten für eine Teilhabe am digitalen Leben in die Waagschale geworfen werden.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jolocom positioniert sich ausdrücklich gegen Datenhandel und Tracking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zum Glück gibt es in Europa schon eine sehr vielversprechende Gesetzeslage. Denn die DSGVO (Datenschutzgrundverordnung) setzt klare Grenzen, was ohne gewichtigen Grund von den Usern verlangt werden darf. Zuletzt wurde der Digital Markets Act verabschiedet, der die Rechte gegenüber Diensten nochmals gestärkt hat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Es stimmt zwar, dass SSI aus einem liberalen Denken kommt, das heißt aber nicht, dass unsere europäische Version SSI komplett unreguliert sein soll.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Muss nur auf die Regulierung gewartet werden?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ganz konkret umsetzen lässt sich eine solche Regulierung für SSI aber auch schon bevor der Gesetzgeber handelt, indem sich die an einem SSI Ökosystem beteiligten Akteure gemeinsame Regeln geben und Mittel festlegen, um sie durchzusetzen. Das ganze nennt sich Trust Framework. In einem SSI Ökosystem kann so beschränkt werden, welche Daten beim User abgefragt werden dürfen und von wem. Der Verifier muss dann klar begründen, was mit diesen Daten geschieht, und ist an das Trust Framework gebunden.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Auch wir bei Jolocom arbeiten an diesen Trust Frameworks im Rahmen der Schaufensterprojekte des BMWK und begleiten in Brüssel die Entwicklung von eIDAS 2.0, einer neuen Regulierung, in der ähnliche Fragen aufgegriffen werden. Tatsächlich kann man eIDAS als eine Art europäisches Trust Framework verstehen. Schon heute fällt der elektronische Personalausweis darunter. In Zukunft dann sehr wahrscheinlich auch Self-sovereign Identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Böse gesprochen könnte man sagen, dass man bei SSI nur entscheiden kann, wem man seine Daten auf welchem Wege gibt, nicht aber was mit ihnen passiert. Das ist allerdings schon sehr, sehr viel im Vergleich zum Status Quo. Was mit den Daten passiert, ist dann nochmal eine neue Frage und keine technische. Da geht es dann um den Trust Frameworks und die Umsetzung von Policies. Das Ganze muss letztendlich über Zertifizierung und Zulassung geregelt werden. Es stimmt zwar, dass SSI aus einem liberalen Denken kommt, das heißt aber nicht, dass unsere europäische Version SSI komplett unreguliert sein soll.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mittelfristig ist jedenfalls davon auszugehen, dass sich nur solche Wallets am Markt behaupten können, die auch in einem Trust Framework zugelassen/zertifiziert sind und entsprechend nur mit solchen Issuern und Verifiern sprechen, die ebenfalls entsprechend zugelassen sind. Das SSI System ist nicht für schlecht gesicherte Datenbanken verantwortlich.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bedeutet Self-sovereign Identity, dass ich alles selbst entscheiden kann?&nbsp; (-&gt; evt auch für den Q&amp;A Artikel geeignet)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Die Idee, dass ich als User bei SSI die komplette Hoheit über meine digitale Identität habe wird oft missverstanden. Bei SSI geht es im Kern darum, dass meine Digitalen Identität in meiner Kontrolle liegt, ich also entscheiden kann wem ich meine Daten wann zeige und wofür. Dieser wichtige Grundsatz ist schon im ersten Artikel zu SSI von Christopher Allen von 2016 enthalten. Zwar kann ich mit SSI auch Identitätsdaten über mich selbst anlegen und z.B. behaupten Astronaut zu sein. Spätestens in dem Moment, indem ich mit dieser Identität dann eine Raumfähre besteigen will, würde ich aber auffliegen. In der Realität ist es nämlich so, dass wir unsere Identität vor allem aus dem zusammenstellen, was andere über uns sagen. So ist unser Personalausweis nur deswegen so geschätzt, weil er vom Staat ausgestellt wurde und damit eine hoheitliche Autorität meine Identität bestätigt. Ähnlich ist es bei einem Studierendenausweis, der nur dann glaubwürdig ist, wenn er von der Universität ausgestellt wurde.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Alejandro Leal</a></p>If a password is like a house key, the security foundation of an organization's IT systems should have a securely locked front door. Make the front door as secure as possible, and you may as well never need a house key again. By implementing more complex passwords, organizations end up wasting time, money, and resources on password resets while reducing workforce productivity. Secure application login is important, however the initial authentication point for most of the workforce is the laptop, desktop or workstation itself. HYPR provides a simple yet secure login with its passwordless and phishing-resistant MFA solution, which identifies the user at the desktop and makes the front door as secure as possible. As a result, your desktop MFA can be used to seamlessly and safely log into your device, enabling access to applications in real time.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>Machine Learning, Edge, and Decentralization to Drive Your Investment Decisions<br>Challenges to the business operating environment are mounting – a <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/coronavirus-leading-through-the-crisis/charting-the-path-to-the-next-normal/risk-abounds-how-ready-are-companies">survey of over 200 executives</a> conducted in 2021 revealed the resilience dimensions most important to their strategy and operations. Digital and technological resilience is rising to the top, just behind financial resilience and operational resilience as being most important to the business across a variety of sectors. Unfortunately, it is not just a matter of threats and vulnerabilities to enterprise systems – although these are many and in constant flux. The competitive and customer demands for flexible digital services contribute to the shifting corporate attention to achieving digital and technological resilience, and the innovation it requires to maintain it. <br><br>There are many paths forward when taking action to stay ahead in this digital and technological innovation race. Some find it helpful to orient their action around concepts like the Composable Enterprise, Privacy-by-Design, Zero Trust, and so on. Whatever your organization chooses to orient its future strategy and direction with, it must be accompanied by action – in other words, the direction your organization chooses to innovate in will have an influence on its investment decisions. <br><br>This post is not a guide, but a place to find inspiration. The technologies and concepts you find here may not directly fit your organization’s targets, but it may trigger the right conversation with your team on how to stay ahead of the curve in your industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Machine Learning <br>Machine Learning should be thought of as a concept rather than by use case – there are simply too many methods and inputs that could be utilized – classification tasks, regression tasks, focusing on images, words, speech, video, and so on. Therefore, take inspiration from the challenges that organizations are facing – the multiplying volume of data being generated and collected by organizations, the massive amounts of sensitive data that are spread across multiple clouds, the many points of interaction between employees and systems, employees and customers, and customers and systems. &nbsp;<br><br>Cybersecurity will be an important area that is influenced by machine learning. Read this <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lb70278/artificial-intelligence-in-cybersecurity">Leadership Brief</a> for an analysis on the scope and challenges of machine learning in cybersecurity, or the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5032">CISO Panel on Securing the Composable Enterprise</a> in May at the EIC. <br><br>Data management and governance is a foundational element of machine learning, but also serves many other purposes in the organization. Data governance supports privacy programs, secures sensitive information and intellectual property during collaboration, and of course is the motor behind preparing and maintaining datasets of corporate data for business intelligence and machine learning projects. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/bc80772/ai-service-clouds">AI Service Clouds</a> can play a role in facilitating good data governance and management throughout the development lifecycle, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/mc80529/next-generation-business-intelligence-platforms">next-generation BI platforms</a> often contain elements of machine learning to deliver recommendations, and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5097/1">this session at the EIC</a> considers how to secure the hyper-connected, data-driven world <br><br>Edge <br>The edge expands the horizon of opportunities. This can be device-driven, linked tightly with machine learning that delivers insights from streamed data from and at the edge, or emerge as a defining aspect of cybersecurity architectures. <br><br>IoT usage creates a need for, perhaps even a dependency on edge computing.&nbsp; For more ideas on how to manage this changing reality, check out the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/tracks/897">IoT and Hyperconnected Enterprise track at the EIC</a>. Moving servers and services to the edge corresponds with the rise of hybrid cloud infrastructure, as described in the context of<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/bc80773/hybrid-cloud-backup-and-disaster-recovery"> hybrid cloud backup and disaster relief. </a><br><br>The secure access service edge (SASE) stands for a concept that integrates a range of cloud-native security services including cloud access security brokers (CASB), firewall as a service (FWaaS), secure web gateways (SWG), and zero-trust network access (ZTNA), with wide-area network (WAN) capabilities for delivering both directly to any edge computing location. SASE is an enabling concept, that can invite more usage of edge devices and locations while maintaining a secure environment. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an81203/implementing-sase">This Advisory Note</a> gives more context to implementing SASE in the organization. <br><br>Decentralized <br>Relax. Decentralized doesn’t always mean blockchain. The work that is being done on enterprise use of the blockchain is just the initial steps in building interoperability between distributed, independent services while still maintaining security and trust. It is a foundational concept in composable enterprises, the topic of the EIC’s opening keynote. Concepts like the<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5031"> Global Assured Identity Network</a> work on a decentralized concept – supporting assured identity providers utilizing the blockchain, but more importantly supporting many different methods of providing an assured identity for cross-border trust. <br><br>This collection of ideas just barely scratches the surface of innovative technologies being used in the enterprise. Whether your organization’s investment strategy focuses on digitalization, boosting cybersecurity, streamlining processes, or getting involved in industry networks, consider what’s happening on the cutting edge. Join us at the<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2022"> EIC in Berlin</a> this May for thought leadership on identity, cloud, and beyond.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to deploy a JHipster-based reactive microservice to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). You’ll use Azure’s Cosmos DB as a persistent store for one of the services. For security, you’ll use Okta as an OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider. You’ll also securely encrypt all secrets in the project configuration files using Kubernetes secrets and <code>kubeseal</code>. This tutorial focuses on deploying an already generated project to Azure AKS. It does not go into great detail about generating the project. To see how the project was generated using JHipster, take a look at <a>Reactive Java Microservices with Spring Boot and JHipster</a>.</p>

<p>The project has a few different pieces:</p>

 
   JHipster Registry: a Eureka server for service discovery and a Spring Cloud Config server for centralized configuration management 
   Gateway: public Spring Cloud Gateway application using Vue 
   Store: Spring Boot microservice using Azure’s Cosmo DB API for MongoDB 
   Blog: Spring Boot microservice using a Neo4J database 
 

<p></p>

<p>This tutorial has a lot of different technologies in it. I’ve tried to make it as simple and as explicit as possible, but it’s probably helpful to have some basic knowledge of Docker and Kubernetes before you start.</p>

<p>If you’re already familiar with all the tech in this tutorial, you can skip ahead to the prerequisites section. If not, I’m going to explain them a little before we move on.</p>

 JHipster microservices architecture overview 

<p><a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/">JHipster</a> is a development platform that streamlines the generation, development, and deployment of both monolithic and microservice applications. It supports a dizzying array of frontend (Angular, React, and Vue) and backend (Spring Boot, Micronaut, Quarkus, Node.js, and .NET) technologies. It’s designed to be deployed using Docker and Kubernetes, and can easily deploy to all the major cloud platforms, such as AWS, Azure, Heroku, Cloud Foundry, Google Cloud Platform, and OpenShift.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The project in this tutorial uses Spring Boot with Java resource servers and a Vue frontend. It was built with the JHipster generator that quickly scaffolds a new application based on either an interactive shell or a DSL file. You can read more about generating microservices with JHipster <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/creating-microservices/">in their docs</a>. One of the slick features of the JHipster generator is that you can generate data entities along with applications.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/jhipster-registry/">JHipster Registry</a> that is generated with the microservice includes two important functions: a Eureka server and a Spring Cloud Config server. The Eureka server allows the microservices to dynamically find each other without having to use hard-coded URIs. This means that the microservice can scale and services can be replaced without causing problems. It’s a bit like a phonebook or a DNS service for the microservice. The <a href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/reference/html/">Spring Cloud Config</a> server allows project configuration to be centralized and distributed to all of the different services. In this tutorial you’ll use this feature to configure all of the services for Okta OAuth in one place.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/api-gateway/">JHipster API Gateway</a> is the public face of your microservice. All public traffic comes through this service, which also includes the Vue frontend. The gateway is one of three application types that can be created by the JHipster generator DSL. The other two are monolith and microservice. A monolith is a non-microservice application with a single service.</p>

<p>The store service and blog service are both examples of the microservice application type. This means that each service is a Spring Boot resources server with some type of SQL or NoSQL backend.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The generator creates four applications. They are designed to be built and run as docker containers, which makes it easy for them to be packaged in <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/">Kubernetes</a> pods. Kubernetes is a container orchestrator specifically designed for managing microservice networks. It’s something like Docker Compose but designed for microservices with a lot of great features like service discovery, load balancing, automatic rollouts and restarts, resource management, and storage mounting.</p>

<p>Prerequisites</p>

<p>This tutorial has a lot of pieces. Install the required software below and sign up for an Azure Cloud account. You’ll need a free Okta account, but you can use the Okta CLI to sign up for it later in the tutorial.</p>

 
   <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">Docker</a>: you’ll need to have both Docker Engine and Docker Compose installed (If you install the Docker desktop, this will automatically install both. On Linux, if you install Docker Engine individually, you will have to also <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">install Docker Compose</a>) separately. 
   <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a>: you’ll need a Docker Hub to host the docker images so that Azure can pull them. 
   <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/">Java 11</a>: this tutorial requires Java 11. If you need to manage multiple Java versions, SDKMAN! is a good solution. Check out <a href="https://sdkman.io/installit">their docs to install it</a>. 
   <a href="https://cli.okta.com/manual/#installation">Okta CLI</a>: you’ll use Okta to add security to the microservice network. You can register for a free account from the CLI. 
   <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/">Azure Cloud account</a>: they offer a free-tier account with a $200 credit to start. 
   <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli">Azure CLI</a>: you’ll use the Azure CLI to manage the Kubernetes cluster. 
   <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/">kubectl</a>: CLI to manage Kubernetes clusters. 
 

<p>If you have never had an Azure account before, you can create a new one that will allow free-tier access and has $200 credit allocated to it. This is more than enough to finish this tutorial. However, the credit does expire after 30 days. If you do not have credit left or your credit has expired, this tutorial should only cost a few dollars if you stop and start the AKS cluster when you are not working on it. You can keep an eye on your costs using the cost explorer in the Azure portal and set alerts if you are concerned about it. Upgrading to pay-as-you-go may also alleviate some resource throttling issues around testing the AKS clusters.</p>

 Spring Boot microservices for Azure and Cosmos DB 

<p>This project is based on two of Matt Raible’s tutorials: <a>Reactive Java Microservices with Spring Boot and JHipster</a> and <a>Kubernetes to the Cloud with Spring Boot and JHipster</a>. In these tutorials, he builds a reactive Java microservice architecture and shows how to deploy it to Google Cloud (GCP). I have modified the project to work with Azure and Cosmos DB.</p>

<p>You will first run the project using Docker Compose. Once you have this working, you will run the project as a Kubernetes cluster on Azure. My modifications were relatively minor and involved removing the unnecessary MongoDB instances (from both the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file and from the Kubernetes descriptors) as well as updating environment values to point the <code>store</code> service to the Cosmos DB instance instead of a MongoDB instance.</p>

<p>Listed briefly, the changes I made from Matt Raible’s posts to make this work with Azure and Cosmos DB are as follows. You can skip this list (and the next section) and go right to cloning the Git repository if you want, but since this documents how to update a JHipster-generated project to use Cosmos DB, I thought it was worth including.</p>

<p>In the <code>docker-compose/docker-compose.yml</code> file:</p>

 
   removed the MongoDB service 
   updated the <code>store</code> service property <code>SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI</code> to point to the Cosmos DB instance via a <code>.env</code> file 
   removed the Keycloak service and the environment variables that configured auth to use Keycloak from the remaining services (not strictly necessary but cleaned things up) 
 

<p>In the <code>k8s/store-k8s</code> directory:</p>

 
   removed the <code>store-mongodb.yml</code> file (This creates the MongoDB Kubernetes service that our project does not need.) 
   in <code>store-deployment.yml</code>:
     
       removed the <code>initContainers</code> (The init container waits for the MongoDB instance, which is removed.) 
       updated <code>SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI</code> env value of the <code>store-app</code> container to the Cosmos DB URI (This points the store to the Cosmos DB instance.) 
       properly secured the Cosmos DB connection string using Kubernetes secrets and <code>kubeseal</code> 
     
   
 

 Setting the store app’s initial status for Eureka 

<p>Creating this tutorial, I ran into a problem with the store app getting stuck as <code>OUT_OF_SERVICE</code>. When I inspected the logs, I found that the service started as <code>UP</code>, quickly went to <code>DOWN</code>, and then <code>OUT_OF_SERVICE</code>. Later, it would go back to <code>UP</code> but the Eureka server never registered this change.</p>

<p>There’s an open issue documenting this problem on <a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix/issues/3941">Spring Cloud Netflix</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/issues/1398">Netflix Eureka</a>.</p>

<p>A temporary fix taken from the issue on GitHub is to override the health reporting implementation so that it returns <code>DOWN</code> instead of <code>OUT_OF_SERVICE</code> while the program is still starting. This blocks it from ever reporting <code>OUT_OF_SERVICE</code>. You can see the fix in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-azure-kubernetes-cosmosdb-example/blob/main/store/src/main/java/com/okta/developer/store/EurekaFix.java"><code>EurekaFix.java</code></a> file in the store app.</p>

 Clone the microservices project from GitHub 

<p>Clone the modified JHipster reactive microservice project from GitHub and checkout the <code>start</code> tag.</p>

   <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/okta-azure-kubernetes-cosmosdb-example.git \
  azure-k8s-cosmosdb
cd azure-k8s-cosmosdb
git fetch --all --tags
git checkout tags/start -b working
</code>   

 Create the Azure Cosmos DB with API for MongoDB 

<p>You need to create an Azure Cosmos DB instance. You can either use the <a href="https://portal.azure.com">Azure Portal</a> or the CLI to create a new Cosmos DB instance. Make sure you create a one that is Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB (Cosmos DB supports various database types). If you use the portal, it’s pretty self-explanatory but don’t forget to enable the free tier and enable a public network.</p>

<p>Here are the instructions for using the CLI.</p>

<p>Log into the Azure CLI using a Bash shell. This will redirect you to a browser to log into the Azure portal.</p>

   <code>az login
</code>   

<p>This should show you the subscriptions for your account.</p>

   <code>[
  {
    "cloudName": "AzureCloud",
    "homeTenantId": "21c44b6d-a007-4d48-80cb-c45966ca1af9",
    "id": "90eb9f51-b4be-4a9f-a69f-11b7668a874d",
    "isDefault": true,
    "managedByTenants": [],
    "name": "Azure subscription 1",
    "state": "Enabled",
    "tenantId": "21c44b6d-a007-4d48-80cb-c45966ca1af9",
    "user": {
      "name": "andrewcarterhughes@outlook.com",
      "type": "user"
    }
  }
]
</code>   

<p>Set the subscription in the shell. Your subscription is probably <code>Azure subscription 1</code>, as that is the default. Make sure you use the subscription that was created when you registered for a free account (or whatever subscription you want if you already have an account).</p>

   <code>az account set --subscription &lt;you-subscription-name&gt;
</code>   

<p>Open a Bash shell. Create a resource group with the following command.</p>

   <code>az group create --name australia-east --location australiaeast
</code>   

<p>Create the Cosmos DB account in the resource group. Substitute your Azure subscription name in the command below (it’s probably <code>Azure subscription 1</code>, which is what mine defaulted to).</p>

   <code>az cosmosdb create --name jhipster-cosmosdb --resource-group australia-east \
  --kind MongoDB --subscription &lt;you-subscription-name&gt; --enable-free-tier true \
  --enable-public-network true
</code>   

<p>Once that command returns (it may take a few minutes), it should list a lot of JSON showing properties of the created Cosmos DB account.</p>

<p>If you get an error that says:</p>

   <code>(BadRequest) DNS record for cosmosdb under zone Document is already taken.
</code>   

<p>Then you need to change the <code>--name</code> parameter to something else. Since this is used to generate the public URI for the database it needs to be unique across Azure. Try adding your name or a few random numbers.</p>

<p>I’m using the Australia East location because that was the location that had free tier AKS nodes available when I wrote this tutorial. You can use any resource group you want as long as it allows you to create the AKS cluster later in the tutorial. Even if you can’t use the free tier or the free credits, if you stop and start the AKS cluster between working on the tutorial, the cost should be very small (mine was less than a few dollars). The application should still work if the Cosmos DB database is in a different resource group and region since the database URI is configured to be publicly accessible.</p>

<p>List the connection string for the Cosmos DB API for MongoDB endpoint using the following command. If you changed the database name above, you will need to update it in the command below.</p>

   <code>az cosmosdb keys list --type connection-strings --name jhipster-cosmosdb \
  --resource-group australia-east
</code>   

<p>This will list four connection strings. You need to save (copy and paste somewhere) the first, the primary connection string. (Ellipses have been used for brevity below.)</p>

   <code>{
  "connectionStrings": [
    {
      "connectionString": "mongodb://jhipster-cosmosdb:XBq5KZ81V8hM63KjCOezi1arq...",
      "description": "Primary MongoDB Connection String"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
</code>   

<p>Edit the <code>.env</code> file in the <code>docker-compose</code> subdirectory. Add the following variables to it, substituting your connection string for the placeholder. Make sure the connection string is enclosed in quotes. This value is referenced by the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file and passed to the <code>store</code> service, pointing it to the Cosmos DB MongoDB database.</p>

<p>The <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code> will be used as the key for encrypting sensitive values stored in the Spring Cloud Config and used by the JHipster registry. You can put whatever value you want in there. A UUID works well, but any string value will work. The longer, the better.</p>

<p><code>docker-compose/.env</code></p>

 <code>SPRING_DATA_MONGO_URI=&lt;your-connection-string&gt;
ENCRYPT_KEY=&lt;your-encryption-key&gt;
</code> 

 Configure identity with Okta 

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create jhipster</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
  Accept the default Redirect URI values provided for you.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI streamlines configuring a JHipster app and does several things for you:</p>

 
   Creates an OIDC app with the correct redirect URIs:
     
       login: <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> 
       logout: <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761</code> 
     
   
   Creates <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups that JHipster expects 
   Adds your current user to the <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups 
   Creates a <code>groups</code> claim in your default authorization server and adds the user’s groups to it 
 

<p>NOTE: The <code>http://localhost:8761*</code> redirect URIs are for the JHipster Registry, which is often used when creating microservices with JHipster. The Okta CLI adds these by default.</p>

<p>You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app. It will look like this (except the placeholder values will be populated):</p>

   <code>export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI="/oauth2/default"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID="{clientId}"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET="{clientSecret}"
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#okta">Create a JHipster App on Okta</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Take note of the name because you will need to find the app in the Okta Admin Console and update the redirect URIs a little later. The <code>okta apps</code> command creates a config file named <code>.okta.env</code>. It will look something like the following. It helpfully lists the values you will need in the next step.</p>

   <code>export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI="https://dev-13337.okta.com/oauth2/default"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID="2989u928u383..."
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET="09328uu098u4..."
</code>   

<p>Both the Docker Compose project and the Kubernetes project use Spring Cloud Config to centralize configuration. The JHipster registry service makes these config values available to all of the other services in the cluster.</p>

<p>Open <code>docker-compose/central-server-config/application.yml</code> and add the following to the end, filling in the <code>issuer-uri</code>, <code>client-id</code>, and <code>client-secret</code> taken from the <code>.okta.env</code> file. This is the Spring Cloud Config file for the Docker Compose project.</p>

<p><code>docker-compose/central-server-config/application.yml</code></p>

   <code>spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        provider:
          oidc:
            issuer-uri: https://&lt;your-okta-domain&gt;/oauth2/default
        registration:
          oidc:
            client-id: &lt;client-id&gt;
            client-secret: &lt;client-secret&gt;
</code>   

 Build the Docker images and run the app with Docker Compose 

<p>You’re all set to run the app locally using Docker and Docker Compose. You need to build the docker image for each of the projects: <code>gateway</code>, <code>store</code>, and <code>blog</code> (you don’t have to build the <code>registry</code> because it uses an image).</p>

<p>In the three different app directories, run the following Gradle command.</p>

   <code>./gradlew -Pprod bootJar jibDockerBuild
</code>   

<p>The default Docker resource settings may not be enough to run this project. You may need to bump them. These settings worked for me.</p>
 
   CPUs: 8 
   Memory: 25 GB 
   Swap: 2 GB 
   Disk image size: 120 GB 
 

<p>Navigate to the <code>docker-compose</code> directory and run the app. You can use the <code>-d</code> param to run it as a daemon but for the moment I like seeing the logs. You’re just running this in Docker Compose as a warm-up for the Azure deployment anyway.</p>

   <code>docker-compose up
</code>   

<p>Give that a minute or two to finish running all the services.</p>

<p>Open the gateway service at <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>

<p>Go to Account and Sign in. You should be directed to the Okta sign-in form.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You should be able to authenticate with your Okta credentials.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Make sure all parts of the application are working. First, test the store (which is using the Cosmos DB Mongo database) by going to Entities and Product. Make sure you can add a new product and see it in the list of products. Next, create a blog (Entities and Blog).</p>

<p>If that works, you can take a look at the Administration menu. There’s a lot of helpful info there.</p>

<p>You can also check the JHipster Registry at <code>http://localhost:8761</code>.</p>

<p></p>

 Encrypt the client secret 

<p>Leaving secrets in plain text in repositories is a security risk. There are two values in this app that are sensitive: the Cosmos DB connection string that includes the username and password and the Okta OIDC app client secret. You were able to avoid exposing the database credentials by using a <code>.env</code> file. However, the Okta client secret is exposed as plain text in the Spring Cloud Config file (<code>docker-compose/central-server-config/application.yml</code>). This can be encrypted using the JHipster registry.</p>

<p>Open the registry (<code>http://localhost:8761</code>) and click on Configuration and Encryption.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Paste your client secret in the text box. Click Encrypt.</p>

<p>This, incidentally, is why you needed the <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code> property in the <code>.env</code> file.  That’s the key that JHipster registry uses to encrypt these values (so keep it secret!).</p>

<p>You can now copy the encrypted value and paste it back into the <code>application.yml</code> file. Make sure you include the <code>{cipher}</code> part. It should look similar to below. Don’t forget the quotes!</p>

<p><code>docker-compose/central-server-config/application.yml</code></p>

   <code>...
spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        provider:
          oidc:
            issuer-uri: https://dev-123456.okta.com/oauth2/default
        registration:
          oidc:
            client-id: 0oa6ycm987987uy98
            client-secret: "{cipher}88acb434dd088acb434dd088acb434dd0..."
</code>   

<p>Stop the app if you have not already using <code>control-c</code>. Restart it.</p>

   <code>docker-compose up
</code>   

<p>Make sure you can still sign into the gateway at <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>

<p>You may be wondering (like I did initially), why can’t I just put the client secret in the <code>.env</code> file? This doesn’t work because the <code>.env</code> file is processed by Spring Cloud Config and JHipster registry after the container is composed, not by Docker Compose during the container creation, which is when the <code>.env</code> file is processed.</p>

<p>You’re done with the Docker Compose implementation. To clean up, you can run the following command. This will stop and remove the containers, networks, volumes, and images created by <code>docker-compose up</code>.</p>

   <code>docker-compose down --remove-orphans
</code>   

 Create the Azure Kubernetes cluster 

<p>The app works locally. Now it’s time to deploy it to an Azure Kubernetes Cluster (AKS). The first step is to create an AKS cluster.</p>

<p>It’s super easy to use the CLI to create a cluster. I’ll show you the command below. However, there’s a wrinkle. The free tier cannot create a cluster in many of the regions because of resource quotas. At least, this was the case when I was working on this tutorial. Nor is there an easy way to quickly see what regions will allow you to create a free-tier cluster. This is why I used Australia East as the region–it allowed me to create a free cluster.</p>

<p>If the command below does not work, I suggest going to the Azure portal and creating a Kubernetes cluster there. Select Create a service and Kubernetes Service. You’ll have to select different regions and see what sizes are available (under Node size and Change size) until you find a region that will allow you to create something in the free tier. But hopefully the command will work and you won’t have to worry about it.</p>

<p>The size I’m using for this tutorial is <code>Standard B4ms</code> with two nodes. I found that I needed two nodes for the cluster to start properly.</p>

<p>Run the following command to create the AKS cluster.</p>

   <code>az aks create --resource-group australia-east --name jhipster-demo \
  --node-count 2 --enable-addons monitoring --generate-ssh-keys --node-vm-size standard_b4ms
</code>   

<p>This will probably take a few minutes.</p>

<p>As a side note, you can stop the cluster at any point. This will pause billing on the cluster.</p>

   <code>az aks stop --resource-group australia-east --name jhipster-demo 
</code>   

<p>And you can start it again.</p>

   <code>az aks start --resource-group australia-east --name jhipster-demo 
</code>   

<p>You can stop and start the cluster from the Azure portal as well.</p>

<p>The next step is to get the credentials for the cluster and merge them into <code>.kube/config</code> so that <code>kubectl</code> can use them. Use the following command.</p>

   <code>az aks get-credentials --resource-group australia-east --name jhipster-demo
</code>   

<p>You should see output that ends like the following.</p>

   <code>Merged "jhipster-demo" as current context in /home/andrewcarterhughes/.kube/config
</code>   

<p>You should be able to use <code>kubectl</code> to get the node on Azure.</p>

   <code>kubectl get nodes
</code>   

   <code>NAME                                STATUS   ROLES   AGE    VERSION
aks-nodepool1-21657131-vmss000000   Ready    agent   105s   v1.22.6
aks-nodepool1-21657131-vmss000001   Ready    agent   108s   v1.22.6
</code>   

<p>You can also list a lot of information about the cluster in JSON format using:</p>

   <code>az aks list --resource-group australia-east
</code>   

 Configure Kubernetes for Okta and Cosmos DB 

<p>The Kubernetes files in the <code>k8s</code> directory were created with the JHipster Kubernetes sub-generator (<a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/kubernetes/">see the docs for info</a>). To see how the original project was generated, take a look at <a>Matt Raible’s JHipster and Kubernetes tutorial</a>. As outlined above, these files were modified to work with Azure Cosmos DB instead of MongoDB in a Kubernetes pod (which is what the sub-generator assumes).</p>

<p>Configure Spring OAuth in the Kubernetes pod by updating <code>k8s/registry-k8s/application-configmap.yml</code>. You can use the same values you used above in the Docker Compose section, in <code>docker-compose/central-server-config/application.yml</code>.</p>

<p>Make sure you use the encrypted client secret enclosed in quotes with the <code>{cipher}</code> prefix. You’re going to copy both the encryption key and the encrypted client secret from the Docker Compose configuration to avoid having to re-encrypt the client secret with a new key.</p>

   <code>data:
  application.yml: |-
    ...
    spring:
      security:
        oauth2:
          client:
            provider:
              oidc:
                issuer-uri: https://&lt;your-okta-domain&gt;/oauth2/default
            registration:
              oidc:
                client-id: &lt;client-id&gt;
                client-secret: "{cipher}&lt;encrypted-client-secret&gt;"
</code>   

<p>To configure the JHipster Registry to use OIDC for authentication, you have to modify <code>k8s/registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml</code> to enable the <code>oauth2</code> profile. This has already been done for you in the example app in the project Git repository.</p>

   <code>- name: SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE
  value: prod,k8s,oauth2
</code>   

<p>Also in <code>k8s/registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml</code>, update the <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code> value to use the same encryption key you used above in the Docker Compose section in the <code>.env</code> file.</p>

   <code>- name: ENCRYPT_KEY
  value: &lt;your-encryption-key&gt;
</code>   

<p>To configure the <code>store</code> service to use the Cosmo database, you need to put your connection string in <code>k8s/store-k8s/store-deployment.yml</code>.</p>

   <code>- name: SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI
  value: "&lt;your-connection-string&gt;"
</code>   

<p>Both the encryption key and the database connection string are sensitive values that need to be encrypted. You’ll see how to do that just a little later in this tutorial.</p>

 Build Docker images and push to Docker Hub 

<p>Previously you built the docker images, but you left them in the local repository. Now you need to upload them to Docker Hub so that Azure AKS can find them. If you haven’t already <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">signed up for a Docker Hub account</a>, please do so now.</p>

<p>In each of the three directories (<code>blog</code>, <code>store</code>, and <code>gateway</code>), run the following command. Save your Docker Hub username in a Bash variable as shown below and you can copy and paste the commands and run them in each service directory.</p>

   <code>DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME=&lt;docker-hub-username&gt;
# in blog
./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image=$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/blog
# in store
./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image=$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/store
# in gateway
./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image=$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/gateway
</code>   

<p>To briefly explain what’s happening here, take a look at the blog service’s Kubernetes descriptor file. It defines a container named <code>blog-app</code> that uses the docker image <code>andrewcarterhughes/blog</code>, which is my Docker Hub username and the blog image.</p>

<p><code>k8s/blog-k8s/blog-deployment.yml</code></p>

   <code>containers:
  - name: blog-app
    image: andrewcarterhughes/blog
</code>   

<p>Thus in the <code>k8s</code> directory, each service (store, blog, gateway, and registry) defines a container and a docker image to be run in that container, along with a whole lot of configuration (which is really a lot of what JHipster is bootstrapping for you). The registry does not have a project folder because it uses a stock image that can be pulled directly from the JHipster Docker repository.</p>

<p>To use the images you just created with Kubernetes, do a find and replace in the <code>k8s</code> directory. Replace all instances of <code>andrewcarterhughes</code> with your Docker Hub username (<code>&lt;docker-hub-username&gt;</code>).</p>

<p>One nice feature of Kubernetes is the ability to define <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/">init containers</a>. These are containers that run before the main container and can be used to create or wait for necessary resources like databases. I noticed while I was debugging things in this app that a lot of the errors happened in the init containers. It’s helpful to know this because if you try and inspect the main container log nothing will be there because the container hasn’t even started yet. You have to check the log for the init container that failed. The Kubernetes management tools that I mention below really come in handy for this.</p>

 Deploy your microservices to Azure AKS 

<p>You can manage a Kubernetes service purely with <code>kubectl</code>. However, there are some pretty helpful tools for monitoring and logging. Both <a href="https://github.com/derailed/k9s">k9s</a> and <a href="https://k8slens.dev/">Kubernetes Lens</a> are great. I recommend installing one or both of these and using them to inspect and monitor your Kubernetes services. They are especially helpful when things go wrong (not that things ever go wrong, I wouldn’t know anything about that, I just heard about it from friends, I swear). Kubernetes Lens is a full-on desktop app that describes itself as a Kubernetes IDE. In comparison, k9s is a lighter-weight, text-based tool.</p>

<p>Open a Bash shell and navigate to the <code>k8s</code> subdirectory of the project.</p>

<p>Deploy your microservice architecture to Azure with:</p>

   <code>./kubectl-apply.sh -f
</code>   

<p>If you open this file, you’ll see that it creates the namespace and applies the project files. If you do this manually, it’s important that the namespace is created first and that the registry is run before the other services.</p>

   <code>...
suffix=k8s
kubectl apply -f namespace.yml
kubectl apply -f registry-${suffix}/
kubectl apply -f blog-${suffix}/
kubectl apply -f gateway-${suffix}/
kubectl apply -f store-${suffix}/
...
</code>   

<p>You can check on your pods with the following command. If you’re on the free tier, this may take a few minutes. Using the pay-as-you-go plan, everything was up and running almost immediately for me.</p>

   <code>kubectl get pods -n demo
</code>   

   <code>NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
blog-6896f6dd58-mbjkn                 1/1     Running   0          3m51s
blog-neo4j-0                          1/1     Running   0          3m48s
gateway-7f6d57765f-2fhfb              1/1     Running   0          3m46s
gateway-postgresql-647476b4d5-jdp5c   1/1     Running   0          3m44s
jhipster-registry-0                   1/1     Running   0          3m52s
store-7889695569-k4wkv                1/1     Running   0          3m41s
</code>   

<p>Here’s an example of what this looks like with Kubernetes Lens (the containers were still booting).</p>

<p></p>

<p>Another useful command is <code>describe</code>. I won’t replicate the output here, but if you want more detailed information for debugging, you can also run the following.</p>

   <code>kubectl describe pods -n demo
</code>   

<p>To tail logs, you can use the name of the pod.</p>

   <code>kubectl logs &lt;pod-name&gt; --tail=-1 -n demo
</code>   

<p>Although, like I said, k9s and Lens are really the way to go for more detailed inspection.</p>

<p>Here’s a screenshot from k9s. You can dig down into the different pods to get more detailed information and inspect logs.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You can use port-forwarding to see the JHipster Registry.</p>

   <code>kubectl port-forward svc/jhipster-registry -n demo 8761
</code>   

<p>Open a browser and navigate to <code>http://localhost:8761</code>. You will be redirected to the Okta login screen, after which you will be taken to the registry.</p>

<p>Make sure everything is green. If you have an error, check the logs for the pod that caused the error. You can restart a specific deployment by deleting it and re-applying it. For example, to restart the store, you can use the commands below from the <code>k8s</code> directory.</p>

   <code>kubectl delete -f store-k8s/
kubectl apply -f store-k8s/
</code>   

<p>Once all is good, <code>control-c</code> to stop forwarding the registry. Expose the gateway and open it.</p>

   <code>kubectl port-forward svc/gateway -n demo 8080
</code>   

<p>Go to <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>

<p>Authenticate with Okta. Make sure you can add blogs, posts, tags, and products. Because the store service uses the same Cosmos DB instance that you were using with Docker Compose locally, any test products you created earlier will still be there.</p>

<p>In preparation for the next step, delete everything you just deployed to AKS in the <code>demo</code> namespace.</p>

   <code>kubectl delete all --all -n demo
</code>   

<p>The first <code>all</code> refers to all resource types. The second <code>--all</code> refers to every object in the resource types (as opposed to specifying an object name or ID). Thus by specifying the namespace you are deleting every object of every resource type in that namespace.</p>

<p>This is one of the benefits of using a namespace. You can do a delete like this. If you do this from the default namespace, you’ll risk deleting things you didn’t mean to delete or pods added by Kubernetes and Azure for infrastructure administration.</p>

<p>You can also just delete the entire namespace. It will be recreated if you use the Bash script to apply the deployments. This deletes absolutely everything from the namespace but is a little slower. If you do this, you need to make sure that you recreate the namespace later (I’ll remind you).</p>

   <code>kubectl delete namespace demo
</code>   

 Encrypt the sensitive configuration parameters 

<p>There are two really important config values that need to be encrypted: (1) the Cosmos DB connection string (which contains the database credentials) and (2) the OIDC client secret. Because these two values are processed differently, you’re going to use two slightly different methods for encrypting them.</p>

<p>There are three different layers of encryption happening here. I found this a little confusing so I’m going to explain it briefy.</p>

 
   JHipster registry encryption for Spring Cloud Config values (values in <code>k8s/registry-k8s/application-configmap.yml</code>) 
   Kubernetes “encryption” (obfuscation, really) that moves secrets found in Kubernetes deployment files to base64-encoded secrets files 
   <code>kubeseal</code> which hardens Kubernetes secrets to properly encrypted values 
 

<p>The first above is only for Spring Cloud Config values. The latter two are used to encrypt values in the Kubernetes descriptor files (the other <code>yml</code> files in the <code>k8s</code> directory).</p>

<p>When you use JHipster registry encryption, you have to define an <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code> value that is used by JHipster to encrypt the secrets. However, because this value is stored in <code>yml</code> files that are going to be committed to a repository, this value must be properly encrypted to ensure the security of the Spring Cloud Config values.</p>

<p>The Cosmos DB connection string (the <code>SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI</code> env var) is a Kubernetes deployment value, same as the <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code>, not a Spring Cloud Config value.</p>

<p>Thus, to harden the OIDC client secret, you must (1) define an <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code> to enable JHipster registry encryption, (2) use JHipster registry to encrypt the client ID and place the encrypted value in the <code>application-configmap.yml</code>, and (3) use Kubernetes secrets and <code>kubeseal</code> to properly encrypt the <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code>.</p>

<p>Securing the Cosmos DB connection string is the same as the <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code>: use Kubernetes secrets and <code>kubeseal</code> to properly encrypt it.</p>

<p>Matt Raible did a great job of explaining secrets management in Kubernetes in his post, <a>Kubernetes to the Cloud with Spring Boot and JHipster</a>. He also linked to a lot of great resources. I’m not going to go into much more detail explaining it here. Check his post out for more info.</p>

<p>The first thing you need to do is install <code>kubeseal</code> into the AKS cluster. You can take a look at <a href="https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets">the <code>kubeseal</code> GitHub page</a> for more info.</p>

   <code>kubectl apply -f https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets/releases/download/v0.17.5/controller.yaml
</code>   

<p>Retrieve the certificate keypair that this controller generates.</p>

   <code>kubectl get secret -n kube-system -l sealedsecrets.bitnami.com/sealed-secrets-key -o yaml
</code>   

<p>Copy the raw value of <code>tls.crt</code> and decode it. You can use the command line, or learn more about <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/clientcreds/main/#base64-encode-the-client-id-and-client-secret">base64 encoding/decoding</a> in our documentation.</p>

   <code>echo -n &lt;paste-value-here&gt; | base64 --decode
</code>   

<p>Put the raw value in a <code>tls.crt</code> file.</p>

<p>Next, install Kubeseal. On macOS, you can use Homebrew. For other platforms, see <a href="https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets/releases/tag/v0.17.5">the release notes</a>.</p>

   <code>brew install kubeseal
</code>   

<p>Encrypt <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code> and <code>SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI</code> (the Cosmos DB connect string). Run the following command to do this, replacing the two values with your encryption key and your connection string.</p>

   <code>kubectl create secret generic project-secrets \
  --from-literal=ENCRYPT_KEY='&lt;your-encryption-key&gt;' \
  --from-literal=SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI='&lt;your-connection-string&gt;' \
  --dry-run=client -o yaml &gt; secrets.yml
</code>   

<p>If you deleted the namespace earlier, you need to create it again (it won’t hurt to run this if you didn’t delete the namespace).</p>

   <code>kubectl apply -f namespace.yml
</code>   

<p>Now, use <code>kubeseal</code> to convert the secrets to encrypted secrets.</p>

   <code>kubeseal --cert tls.crt --format=yaml -n demo &lt; secrets.yml &gt; sealed-secrets.yml
</code>   

<p>Remove the original secrets file and deploy your sealed secrets.</p>

   <code>rm secrets.yml
kubectl apply -n demo -f sealed-secrets.yml &amp;&amp; kubectl get -n demo sealedsecret project-secrets
</code>   

<p>You need to update the <code>yml</code> files to refer to the encrypted values. Add the following env variable to the <code>jhister-registry</code> container in <code>k8s/registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml</code> (if an <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code> already exists, replace it).</p>

   <code>env:
  ...
  - name: ENCRYPT_KEY
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: project-secrets
        key: ENCRYPT_KEY
</code>   

<p>In <code>k8s/store-k8s/store-deployment.yml</code>, change the <code>SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI</code> env variable to use the sealed secret.</p>

   <code>env:
  ...
  - name: SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: project-secrets
        key: SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI
</code>   

<p>Deploy the cluster.</p>

   <code>./kubectl-apply.sh -f
</code>   

<p>Give the cluster a bit to start. Check it with one of the tools I mentioned or the following:</p>

   <code>kubectl get pods -n demo
</code>   

<p>Once everything is ready, port forward the registry to check the services.</p>

   <code>kubectl port-forward svc/jhipster-registry -n demo 8761
</code>   

<p>Make sure you can log in and that all the services are green. You should either be automatically logged in and redirected back to the home page or directed to log in with the Okta login screen.</p>

<p>This is the happy dance.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Forward the gateway and test the app.</p>

   <code>kubectl port-forward svc/gateway -n demo 8080
</code>   

<p>Log in. Make sure everything works. Kick the tires. Start a blog. Create some products. Influence some people. Restore democracy. Take over the world. Whatever you want.</p>

<p>Once you’re done with everything, you can delete the resource group. This will also delete all of the resources in the resource group, including the Cosmos database and the AKS cluster.</p>

   <code>az group delete --name australia-east --no-wait --yes
</code>   

 Azure AKS, Kubernetes, and Spring Boot microservices deployed! 

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/juliendubois">Julien Dubois</a> for help getting this tutorial finished!</p>

<p>In this project you saw how to deploy a JHipster microservice to Azure AKS. You saw how you can use a managed Cosmos DB instance in place of a MongoDB pod in Kubernetes. You saw how to deploy the app first with Docker Compose and then later with <code>kubectl</code> and the Azure CLI. Finally, you properly encrypted all of the sensitive configuration values using a combination of JHipster registry encryption, Kubernetes secrets, and <code>kubeseal</code>.</p>

<p>As I mentioned at the top, this project is based on two of Matt Raible’s tutorials:</p>

 
   <a>Reactive Java Microservices with Spring Boot and JHipster</a> 
   <a>Kubernetes to the Cloud with Spring Boot and JHipster</a> 
 

<p>Deepu Sasidharan wrote a tutorial, <a href="https://deepu.tech/deploying-jhipster-microservices-on-azure-kubernetes-service-aks/">Deploying JHipster Microservices on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)</a>, that was also a big help.</p>

				 <p>I’ve been reminded via my Facebook feed just how heavily influenced we are by our data. Facebook is exceptionally good at showing me what it thinks I want to see. I’m not going to lie, they get it right probably 70% of the time, but I don’t think that’s always a good thing; it brings a lot of negativity to my feed due to the nature of my online activity. Lately, it’s the conspiracy theories surrounding the <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/digital-id-ontario">implementation of digital ID</a> here in my home province of Ontario. Recently, a <a href="https://www.itworldcanada.com/article/governments-must-fight-misinformation-on-digital-id-say-provincial-experts/479608">petition submitted</a> to the Ontario legislature calling for the ban of digital id garnered 21,000 signatures. I find this so bizarre because digital ID is already here. I’m left wondering if any of those 21,000 folks use Google or Apple pay?&nbsp;</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			 
			 
				 
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				
				
				 
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>I decided it would be an excellent time to address some of the misinformation head-on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The claims regarding digital id are:&nbsp;</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				  
 The government will have access to our personal information without our consent and centralize every citizen’s personal, financial, business, medical and social data and assign them an identification under this system. 
  Digital ID will expose your demons, no matter how small, everywhere you go, and abuse by governmental authority in terms of surveillance and compelled behaviour, using access to basic resources as a tool of coercion.&nbsp; 
  Lead to Identity theft. 
  
			  
				
				
				
				
				  Digital Identity Conspiracies: Myth 1&nbsp; 
<p>The government will have access to our personal information without our consent and centralize every citizen’s personal, financial, business, medical and social data and assign them an identification under this system.</p>
<p>This is not true. The government will only be able to access our information if we provide it to them directly, for example, if we use our digital id to access government services. Every citizen’s personal, financial, business, medical and social information is already centralized. Your Driver’s License and Passport are not your property, and your unique identifier is your social insurance number. The government issues those credentials, and they remain their property.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations like Google and Facebook hold your information in a centralized manner and make money off of it. We allow them to claim our data as their asset and make money off of it. When we decentralize, we take back ownership of our credentials and identity. We will be able to choose what we share and with whom, and we will have the ability to monetize our identity, just like Facebook and Google currently do.</p>
<p>Canadians in the private sector, not the government, were instrumental in the early days of SSI development. At this point, the Canadian government has no choice but to jump in and build our governance framework and align us with other countries leading to protect their citizens’ rights. For example, they are working with the European Union Framework, <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation">eIDAS</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Digital Identity Conspiracies: Myth 2 
<p>Digital ID will expose your demons, no matter how small, everywhere you go. You name it; the ID will show it. Opens up abuse of governmental authority in terms of surveillance and compelled behaviour, using access to basic resources as a tool of coercion.</p>
<p>Again, this is not true. Digital ID will only expose your demons if you share them…</p>
<p>We are being abused by organizations like Google and Facebook, <a href="https://www.toronto.com/news/how-do-tech-giants-like-google-and-facebook-get-and-use-your-personal-data/article_73b7cfe5-4360-5123-8769-471460c9dc85.html">monetizing our identities</a>. Instagram, TikTok etc. it’s all there for everyone to see. When you pay with your phone’s wallet app, data is stored and collected on your spending habits. Police officers can look up your info with your driver’s license, and Google tracks your internet and location history, regardless of your settings. The list goes on and on. With a self-sovereign identity, you can control your data and what information you share with appropriate entities. SSI allows for seamless authentication and reduces the need for repeated submission of individual verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>The government will only be able to track our movements and activities if we provide them with this information ourselves, for example, by using our digital id to access transportation services. Your verifiable credentials will not “talk” to each other. Only someone with the appropriate verifiable credential of their own can access your data (credentials) unless you choose to share your credentials with someone else.</p>
<p>So yes, your digital id (wallet) can undoubtedly hold all of these credentials, but that’s all they are: individual verifiable credentials. They don’t “talk” to each other per se, and only someone with the authority credential, like a police officer, can see your driving infractions or criminal record.</p>
<p>If you are behind on child support, the Family Responsibility Office can get Canada Revenue Agency to garnish your tax account or the Ministry of Transportation to suspend your driver’s license. You’re already “punished” for lousy behaviour that likely won’t change. What will stay the same is only the person with the proper credentials can access your data. So while your “bad” behaviours will ultimately merge with your digital identity, a prospective employer or bank employee would not have the proper credentials to access those specific credentials within your digital wallet. SSI is our best defence against the possibility of a surveillance state as the credentials are shared without the Issuer knowing – and they can’t know.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Digital Identity Conspiracies: Myth 3 
<p>Digital ID will lead to identity theft.</p>
<p>Once again, this is a baseless claim that has no basis in reality. Digital ID will make identity theft far more complex as it provides a more secure and confidential identification method. The very nature of <a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/156591609?dnt=1&amp;html5=1&amp;title=1&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;autoplay=0">Blockchain technology</a> makes them immune to cyber-crimes since all the copies stored across the network would need to be attacked simultaneously for the attack to be successful. This system will be much more secure than traditional authentication methods, such as username and password. Your personal information will be encrypted and only accessible to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Taking Back Your Rights 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are so many ways that adopting a self-sovereign identity can reduce costs, cut out waste and provide better security and control. Here are a few simple ways it could help you out:</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				  
 If you’re a small business, you can use the verifiable credentials to get validated and listed on directories like Google Maps or Yelp. People find your business more quickly, and it can also help you rank higher in search results. 
 If you’re looking for a job, you can use the verifiable credential to prove your identity and qualifications to potential employers. You make the hiring process easier and faster since the employer can verify your information without contacting third parties. 
 If you want to apply for a loan, you can share your credit history with the lender. They will be able to verify that the information is correct without having access to anything more personal information than they require. 
 If you’re a student, you can use verifiable credentials to prove that you’ve completed your education or training, helping you make it easier to get into college or find a job in your field. 
  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>Self-sovereign identity is vital because it gives individuals control over their data; it is essential in an era where data breaches are becoming more common. Adopting a self-sovereign identity will allow users to take ownership and ensure that their data is safe and secure.</p>
<p>The only ones who will benefit from your digital ID are the Issuer (who gave you the credential), holder (you) and verifier (who you’re sharing it with). As the holder, you’ll have an opportunity to control, and perhaps even monetize your data with the verifier, say Facebook. You can choose to share as much or as little information as you want with the verifier, and you can also revoke access to your credentials at any time.</p>
<p>It’s hard to say what the future of SSI holds, but it’s important to remember that digital ID is all about taking back your rights, not surrendering them. It is about authentication, authorization and privacy. The trust economy of SSI is based on these foundations. As more and more people understand the value of SSI, its use will continue to grow. It’s imperative that people from diverse backgrounds and women, in particular, get involved.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a project that can help ensure the future of digital ID, consider supporting the development of SSI. You can help by joining groups like Women in Identity, spreading the word about this critical technology and advocating for its adoption. Visit our<a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/blog/"> blog</a>, follow us on social media, and subscribe to our<a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/continuum-loop-newsletter/"> newsletter</a> to stay up to date and learn more about decentralized identity.</p>

We recently posted a Sign-In with Ethereum-specific April recap that can be found here:</p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/sign-in-with-ethereum-digest-april/">  Sign-In with Ethereum Digest - April  Sign-In with Ethereum offers a new self-custodial option for users who wish to assume more control and responsibility over their own digital identity.  SpruceSpruce    </a> Kepler <p>Kepler is a decentralized storage network organized around data overlays called Orbits. Kepler allows users to Securely share their digital credentials, private files, and sensitive media to blockchain accounts, all using a Web3 wallet.</p>  Cryptoscript: added support for JSON templated REST queries as script input, including documentation, test methods, and verbose errors (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/cryptoscript/pull/2">cryptoscript#2</a>)  The capability subsystem is implemented, providing a registry of delegations, invocations, and revocations (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler/pull/99">kepler#99</a>).  Simplified Kepler SDK PR merged (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler-sdk/pull/35">kepler-sdk#35</a>), and added an example dapp to show how to use it (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler-sdk/pull/37">kepler-sdk#37</a>).

				  Maturity and universality are now the goals  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By <a href="mailto:ken@indicio.tech">Ken Ebert</a></p>
<p>Since the launch of Indicio two years ago, we have focused on identifying and filling in the gaps in decentralized identity technology that limited its functionality. Launching an open-source <a href="https://indicio.tech/hyperledger-aries-sees-new-coordinated-effort-to-produce-complete-mobile-agent/">mobile agent</a> and developing <a href="https://indicio.tech/trust-registry-or-machine-readable-governance/">machine-readable governance</a> were critical to delivering real-world solutions. As we saw how these solutions worked to solve problems, we came to understand how these components worked in concert to deliver what we now call a Trusted Digital Ecosystem. A Trusted Digital Ecosystem is our shorthand for the simultaneous impact of decentralized identity technology on authentication, communication, governance, privacy, and security.</p>
<p>A Trusted Digital Ecosystem can be simple—indeed, as we advise our customers, it’s always better to start by solving the simplest use case first, see how the technology works, and then expand. Therefore, having a core set of interoperable components is essential. They can be arranged to manage increasingly complex interactions in any kind of informational ecosystem, and to facilitate interaction across ecosystems.</p>
<p>Technology stack: From basic to universal<br>Our <a href="https://apnews.com/press-release/accesswire/technology-business-4dbf651613d76693bc479321f7b041f5">new</a><a href="https://apnews.com/press-release/accesswire/technology-business-4dbf651613d76693bc479321f7b041f5"> funding</a> will be used to refine the open-source, decentralized-identity technology stack. We have the basic technology for a functional ecosystem, now we improve that functionality by adding all the features, user interfaces, and management tools that make it easier to deploy, use, and monitor. We will add new <a href="https://indicio.tech/careers/">engineering team</a> members to help design, implement, and test this new software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These engineering efforts will synergize with Indicio’s future technology roadmap which will focus on expanding the adoption of Trusted Digital Ecosystems in the marketplace. Our goal is for Trusted Digital Ecosystems to serve as complete solutions in many vertical markets and to be as easy to deploy as they are easy to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Continuing our open-source community support<br>The new funding will also enable us to continue and extend our work with the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-wins-british-columbia-code-with-us-challenge-to-upgrade-hyperledger-indy/">open-source community</a> by providing leadership to working groups, code maintenance and review, and our own direct code contributions. We see open source as the key to both expanding decentralized identity and to continued innovation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time, and following on our successful training workshops for the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-leads-hyperledger-foundation-community-training/">Hyperledger Foundation</a>, we believe that ongoing education is critical. We have created the most comprehensive, hands-on training available in decentralized identity, whether in the basics or in the more technical aspects of the stack, and we will continue to refine these offerings—as well as develop new courses focused on how to implement complete solutions.</p>
<p>Indicio has also pioneered <a href="https://indicio.tech/cardeas-second-interop-a-thon/">“interop-a-thon”</a> events, where companies and organizations come together to test their products and solutions for interoperability. With two interop-a-thons under our belt (hosted through the <a href="https://cardea.app/">Cardea Project </a>at Linux Foundation Public Health), we are more certain than ever of their importance to finding glitches, spurring adoption of standardized protocols, and fostering confidence in the technology.</p>
<p>Interop-a-thons also provide a chance to see the future potential of verifiable credential systems that are <a href="https://indicio.tech/when-it-comes-to-decentralized-identity-sell-solutions-not-rules/">interoperable</a>, where, for example, a credential issued by a government can be used in a wide variety of contexts and thereby gain in value to issuers, users, and verifiers alike. It’s one thing to claim this as a possibility; it’s another to see it happen.</p>
<p>We will devote more resources in the coming year to interop-a-thons because they are one of the clearest ways of visualizing the value of decentralized identity as a network of networks—and the clearest way to accelerate this happening.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Nitish Deshpande</a></p><p>The Log4j vulnerability, was first detected in December 2021. Log4j is an open-source Java library that is widely used by developers to monitor apps and captures logs. Cybersecurity experts classified it as a <a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html">critical severity</a> due to its vulnerability to remote code execution (RCE) attacks, local code execution (LCE) attacks, and information leakage. Millions of attack attempts exploiting this vulnerability were <a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/2021/12/13/the-numbers-behind-a-cyber-pandemic-detailed-dive/">reported</a>. <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/12/11/guidance-for-preventing-detecting-and-hunting-for-cve-2021-44228-log4j-2-exploitation/">Microsoft</a> identified a group of attackers from China that used this weakness as a back door to inflict organizations with Nightsky ransomware. Due to being open-source and easy to use, Log4j is used in a wide range of software, and some organizations were initially unaware of its presence within their software infrastructure. This vulnerability usually comes in via third party software. Organizations commonly don’t monitor the libraries and external components (such as Log4j) used by third party software and thus were uncertain about the extent of cyber risk exposure for their organizations.<br><br>Patch releases<br>In the past 4 months, Apache has released a series of patches to counter this issue. Upgrading to the latest patch 2.17 is the straightforward measure to protect against this software vulnerability. Users without the latest patches are still exposed to getting attacked by cyber criminals. However, even after patching, an organization could have already been compromised by this attack. The good news is that, with Log4j being a logging library, there is a good chance of the attacker having left traces behind in the log. There are other measures that could be taken, such as restricting outgoing internet traffic, but this is rarely a viable and surely not a long-term solution.<br><br>Additional measures<br>Aside of installing patches, an important step is to monitor the activities of your software. Log4j is used only to log activity and events. There should be no further activities such as the Log4j process trying to access other systems. Monitoring changes in behavior of the software using the Log4j library is an option for identifying malicious behavior. For instance, Amazon Web Services (AWS) released patches to track and patch the vulnerable applications. These patches were found vulnerable to be manipulated by existing malicious containers on the system to elevate their privileges and take over the host or execute code remotely. This further emphasizes the need for monitoring after installing patches.<br><br>Additionally, Log4j scanners can be implemented to identify systems that are still vulnerable by the Log4j threat. However, it must not be the only solution, as some of these scanners have <a href="https://www.msspalert.com/cybersecurity-news/log4j-vulnerability-scanners-and-detection-tools-list-for-mssps-and-threat-hunters/">reported</a> false positive results.<br><br>Conclusion<br>If there are systems which are unpatched, this threat will continue to exist. The solution is to patch and stay alert, but to also have a solid cyber security and cyber resilience plan in place which can identify and stop attacks ideally even before these occur.<br><br>European Identity and Cloud (EIC) conference 2022<br>For a deeper dive into cybersecurity topics and to help your organizations to develop more resilient cybersecurity and identity management architectures, KuppingerCole offers content in a variety of formats, including live events such as the 2022 KuppingerCole <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2022">European Identity and Cloud (EIC) conference</a> taking place in Berlin and online in May.<br> The agenda for the conference includes keynote presentations on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5036">dynamic authorization on zero trust architecture, promoting cyber resilience through identity and zero trust</a> and many panel discussions and presentations from experts on latest cyber security, identity management and digital transformation topics.<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2022/blog/prepare-prevent-and-protect">Related research Blog Post: Prepare, Prevent and Protect</a><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lb80801/responding-to-critical-software-vulnerabilities">Leadership Brief: Responding to Critical Software Vulnerabilities </a><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lb80802/prepare-and-protect-against-software-vulnerabilities">Leadership Brief: Prepare and Protect against Software Vulnerabilities </a></p>

			  Radka Tocikova is Human Resource Manager at Tokeny Solutions.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p>My name is Radka, I’m from Slovakia where I studied International Relations at the Economic University of Bratislava. After my Erasmus studies in Paris, I lived abroad in Belgium, Luxembourg, and Monaco where I am now. At Tokeny I do what I love and I’m aware it’s a big chance. Taking care of people, challenging&nbsp;them, finding ways to push some of them out of their comfort zone, listening to them, trying to improve the collaboration &amp; the use of the collective intelligence (to name a few of my responsibilities). Interviewing new candidates and assessing who would be the best fit is another very challenging part of the job and a huge responsibility. A CV and a 30 min chat is never enough to really appreciate someone’s potential. I met some amazing talents and I would like to thank everyone who applied.</p>
 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>I knew the project from its very beginning, I was a close follower and a fan. However, I must admit that when I spoke with Luc, our CEO, about help with administration, partnership agreements and recruitments, I thought it was for a few months. It’s been almost 4 years now, I fell in love with the team, I have great colleagues, my work matters, our project is so innovative and disruptive, and we still have so much to achieve and build together. I am delighted with all these challenges ahead of us.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>We learn, we try, we fail, we argue, we discuss, we laugh, we adapt, we do, we celebrate, and then repeat. I really enjoy working in such an international environment. The remote and the hybrid are here to stay, something we’ve embraced since the very beginning. Being flexible and being able to adapt to the needs of our team members is also a plus. What’s really common about Tokeny is that everyone is friendly and open-minded. And you can say what you have to say. We’ve weathered the storms, the sea isn’t always flat, but everyone on board knows we’re heading in the right direction and I hope we continue to have fun on our way!</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>I am passionate about life itself, its purpose, its meaning, even its futility. I love Contemporary Art because it not only reflects but also questions life. I’m an epicurean, with a slight preference for fusion cuisine with umami in it. I’ve traveled a lot, which has helped me understand myself better. And books..I like to read books. Music, cultural events, exhibitions, theater, innovation technologies, blockchain potential, AI, neuroscience, personal development are all topics that trigger my interest. My passion peaks especially when I have a mix of the above, like immersive art or a VR team building escape room.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>Hakuna Matata! And never stop dreaming…</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>War, global warming, poverty, abuse, discrimination, disease. There are too many injustices in this world I would like to change, not easy to pick one of them. If I could, I would erase the suffering of children.</p>
<p>For me, changing the world means changing myself at first. Therefore, that is my main objective, and at the same time that is what I can do. Being the best possible version of myself and having a positive impact around me. (Ok, ok, work in progress ;-))</p>

				 <p>Christine and Darrell would like to thank everyone who participated in the Exploring Digital ID webinar on April 27th, 2022. This was an excellent opportunity to learn more about how Self-sovereign identity (digital id) will affect our lives. Here is a breakdown of what happened and some key takeaways for attendees and those who couldn’t make it.</p>

<p>Christine started the webinar by talking about a real-world travel scenario where we can easily envision moving from a physical to a digital wallet with a digital id. In her scenario, Christine walked us through each step of the trip. From booking and boarding to networking, she explains how a widely adopted digital id system can make the travel process more secure, saving time and hassle, making the entire experience more seamless. Darrell finished it off by sharing his hopes to one day see a wallet agent that will be able to assemble and organize records/receipts for you based on your activity.</p>

<p>For our second part of the webinar [8:45], we wanted to debunk some of the myths about digital id. There has been a lot of misinformation, and we wanted to clear up a few things that we thought were important. We talked about centralization vs. decentralization, SSI exposing your demons, surveillance, and compelled behaviour.</p>

In the meantime, new testnet features are on the horizon that will enable more powerful decentralized usecases.</p>  Simplified and improved ID privacy by adding “source of funds” address to registration, enabling a specific ID or z-address to be used for the funds to prepare and register an identity.  Advanced sub-ID registration for decentralized identities with new business models, semi-centralized identities for voting and other purposes, and centralized identities that can be issued and sold via centralized currencies.  Decentralized fractional currencies can issue identities, depending on their parameters, and the person getting such an ID pays the blockchain identity import fee in native currency as well as the specified fee in the currency issuing the ID. The issuing currency fee is burned, benefitting all holders of the issuing currency by reducing supply by the fee amount and leaving the same reserves, raising conversion rates. Centralized currencies, whether fractional, token, or even native, issue identities and the fees are paid to the controlling ID of the currency, not&nbsp;burned.  New “requires permission” and “referral required” issuance is supported. If this is specified as an option in an ID issuing currency definition, which may still be a decentralized issuer, the identity registration transaction must be counter-signed by either the ID of the issuing currency (“requires permission”) or a valid referrer (“referral required”) which either is the issuing currency ID or an unrevoked ID with the same parent as the new identity. The identity registration command and API will enforce this and create transactions that must be signed in this&nbsp;manner.  Separate pricing, referral namespaces, and referral levels for all identity namespaces are supported (ie. only *.fanclub@ can refer for name.fanclub@).  Pricing of sub-IDs for a fractional currency can be either in the currency itself or denominated in any of its reserves (eg. USD, VRSC, EUR, etc.) to enable compatibility with ID-based rights licensing or royalty streams priced in any currency.

<p>The advancement of technology in the digital space has had a significant impact on the way people interact with businesses. Several aspects of people’s everyday lives are now conducted digitally, from shopping to managing finances.</p><p>Therefore, it’s no surprise that digital identity has become a critical topic of discussion.</p><p>Identity management has been a major concern since the internet was invented. Billions of dollars have been spent on providing a private and secure space for digital transactions. </p><p>According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/417602/global-market-forecast-identity-and-access-management/">Statista</a>, the global identity and access management market had risen to nearly $13.92 billion by 2021. </p><p>However, even with this level of investment, managing digital identities has been complicated, challenging, and expensive. </p><p>But what is digital identity, and how can organizations leverage it to scale their business? And where does blockchain come into the picture?</p><p>In this blog, our team of decentralized identity experts will answer all these questions (and some more). So let’s get started!</p> What Is Digital Identity? <p>The concept of digital identity might sound complicated, but it’s pretty easy to understand. </p><p>In a broad aspect, your digital identity is a combination of any personal information online that can be traced back to you — from the pictures on your social media to your online bank account.</p><p>By definition, a digital identity is an identity that is claimed or adopted by individuals, organizations, or electric devices in the digital space. </p><p>Digital identity can be regarded as an extension of physical identity documents like passports and driver’s license. </p><p>Digital identity is a powerful solution to overcome several obstacles related to remote onboarding. </p><p>Creating an account to access a service, entering personal information, and waiting for someone to manually authenticate our identity is taxing, especially if it’s to be done on a global level.</p><p>Deploying digital identity solutions effectively eradicated a lot of these time-consuming processes for individuals and businesses.</p><p>Let’s understand the importance of digital identity in a bit more detail.</p> Why Is Digital Identity Important?  Global Operation <p>MSMEs can tap into a global client base, and businesses in rural regions can take up distant business opportunities. </p><p>In the past, businesses simply hired employees who stayed within 10 miles of their office. The recruitment process of MSMEs heavily relied on reference checks and interviews. Companies built the association with clients and vendors via personal relationships. </p><p>Digital transformation has flipped this system on its head. </p><p>MSMEs now have access to a global pool of talent, and they can build professional relationships with clients and vendors based in international regions. </p><p>Digital identity verification is vital for businesses to function in this era of technology.</p><p>Operating globally meant companies had to have elaborate systems in place to ensure that no fraudulent activities were conducted.</p><p>Digital identity has made this system simpler and increased the security associated with onboarding international partners, employees, and even customers. </p><p>Companies can swiftly expand into new markets, improve the strength of their internal operations by hiring employees solely based on their skill, reducing the production cost, and gaining new customers.</p> Enhance User Experience <p>Digital identity and management is critical for growing and scaling micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). <br><br>Here’s the thing. </p><p>Identity management was primarily focused on internal business users like employees, partners, vendors, contractors, and others associated with the supply chain. </p><p>It was about ensuring that the right people had the right level of access to the information needed to get their job done. </p><p>That’s not the case anymore.</p><p>The power of leveraging digital identity is crucial for success in the digital era. </p><p>The primary purpose is to boost engagement rate, offer easy and secure sign-up and log-in services, provide personalized content, increase revenue, and enhance user experience. </p><p>Digital identity provides MSMEs with the ability to develop accurate customer personas and make better-informed decisions.</p><p>On the flip side, a strong digital identity system also allows customers to receive improved and more personalized services from their service providers.</p> Financial Inclusion <p>Digital identity empowers MSMEs to gain easier access to credit and effectively undertake digital transactions. </p><p>A <a href="https://www.smefinanceforum.org/post/msme-finance-gap-report">study conducted by International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the SME Finance Forum</a> has estimated that nearly 65 million firms, or 40% of formal MSMEs, in developing economies don’t have access to full credit. These MSMEs have an unmet financial need of about $5.6 trillion each year. </p><p>A robust digital identity management system can enhance financial inclusion and allow MSMEs to access cheaper credit to function more efficiently.</p><p>Third, MSMEs can tap into the global client base and businesses in rural regions can take up distant business opportunities. </p><p>Now that we have an understanding of digital identity and why it is important, let’s take a look at how digital identities can be verified to ensure they’re legit.</p> Verifiable Credentials <p>Verifiable credentials may sound like an overwhelming technical concept at first glance. However, it’s easier to understand than you think. </p><p>Let’s break it down.</p><p>The word credential typically refers to documents, certificates, cards, etc., that contain data about something. Driver’s licenses, insurance cards, passports, medical test results, college degrees, and employee badges are some examples of credentials we use every day. </p><p>One thing they have in common is that these credentials have a physical form.</p><p>There are several problems associated with paper-based credentials.</p>  They can easily be lost or damaged.  Sharing them is a slow, complicated, and inefficient process.  They can be easily faked.  There is no concept of automation.  They’re not easy to update.  They’re not future-proof.  <p>On the other hand, when you attach the term verifiable, it refers to credentials that can be authenticated in a digital setting. </p><p>Here’s the thing. </p><p>Businesses all over the world are ready to go global and shift their focus towards digital operations and services. </p><p>However, this shift comes with a fundamental need for individuals or organizations — like customers, vendors, employers, citizens, partners, and more — to be identified to interact digitally. &nbsp;</p><p>Several attempts have been made to deliver digital identity solutions — creating centralized accounts, federated systems, CIAM solutions, etc. </p><p>However, these solutions make verification a very slow and tedious process. </p><p>Verification helps establish trust that the individual claiming the digital identity or credential is the same person.</p><p>It prevents people from carrying out transactions on someone’s behalf without their permission, creating false identities, buying fake diplomas/degrees, or committing fraudulent activities. </p><p>The digital solutions mentioned above are siloed. </p><p>In most cases a verifier needs to contact the issuer to request a verification and make sure the credential is authentic. This involves manual processes. </p><p>It involves calling previous employers, calling academic institutions, accrediting bodies, etc.</p><p>This is where verifiable credentials come into the picture. </p><p>To define the term, Verifiable Credential is a solution that allows people to issue digital credentials and sign them cryptographically. This digital signature can be verified with blockchain. </p><p>Using a digital ledger like blockchain makes the credential instantly verifiable.</p><p>No matter where the person stores it, no matter if the issuer keeps a copy of it, these credentials will be verifiable. A verifier will be able to know that the credential is authentic in seconds without the need to contact the issuer.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials are not limited to representing physical documents; they also reflect aspects that don’t have a physical equivalent, like NFT ownership. </p><p>There are three primary roles associated with verifiable credentials.</p>  Issuer. The issuer refers to an individual or an organization that creates or issues the verifiable credential.  Holder. The holder is the individual or organization to whom the credential is issued to. The verifiable credential can be stored on a digital wallet - a mobile app on the holder's phone - or anywhere the holder wants to. A cloud drive, their computer, etc.  Verifier. The verifier is the entity that verifies the claim about the specific subject. The information is shared with them and they check the authenticity of the data they’ve received.  <p>Let’s understand these roles with a simple example.</p><p>Let’s say there is a hospital looking to verify the authenticity of a doctor’s degree. </p><p>Here, the institution that certifies that the doctor has completed his medical degree is the Issuer, the doctor is the Holder, and the hospital that checks the authenticity is the Verifier. </p><p>Verifiable Credentials make it easy to share information online in a secure and instantly verifiable way.</p><p>Here is how it works.</p><p>When the issuer creates a document, they digitally sign it and share it with the holder. The holder prepares a verifiable presentation and sends it to the verifier to be authenticated. </p><p>Note: A verifiable presentation is a collection of credentials or attributes that the holder wants to share with the verifier. </p><p>For example — if an employer requests information like university degree, date of birth, and drug test results, there are different entities who have issued these credentials. The owner can collect all these in his digital wallet and put them together to create a verifiable presentation and share it with the verifier (employer).</p><p>Now, back to the topic at hand.</p><p>After the holder shares the verifiable presentation, the verifier checks the cryptographic signature and the blockchain and assesses the credential against three factors.</p>  Competent authority: &nbsp;Do I trust the organization who issued this credential?  Validity: Is the credential valid?  Tamper-proofing: Was the credential tampered with?   <p>If these conditions are met, the credentials are declared verified.</p><p>For businesses, Verifiable Credentials have the potential to drastically improve and boost the customer and employee onboarding process, thereby reducing the cost and turnaround time associated with it.</p> Decentralized Identity <p>Verifiable Credentials and blockchain are two of the most important elements of decentralized identity technology.<br><br>Before we understand decentralized identities, we need to talk about centralized identity and access management systems (IAMs) and the issues that arise with centralized identities. </p><p>In a centralized identity management system, users' data/credentials are stored in centralized and siloed databases. A lot of users' data. A hacker can get to millions of people's credentials at the same time.</p><p>Platforms like Facebook come under centralized and federated identity systems. A federated system allows other networks to use their ID system (eg: Facebook login).</p><p>In centralized IAMs, a single entity (like Facebook) owns and controls the users’ digital identities and personal data.</p><p>How many times have we heard of Facebook data breaches where the privacy of millions of users was compromised? </p><p>Now you understand the risk associated with centralized, federated, and digital identity management systems. </p><p>But what is decentralized identity management and how does it help mitigate the issues raised by centralized digital management systems?</p><p>Decentralized identity systems allow users to gain control, store and manage their own identities and data. </p><p>This form of identity management lets users store and manage their own data. Users decide how and when they share their data and with whom. Instead of siloed in one place, data is decentralized to each user. </p><p>A well-implemented and verifiable decentralized identity eliminates a lot of threats that come with physical and digital documents. They offer entities more privacy and control over the data that is used and shared.</p><p>Let’s understand how decentralized identity allows users to store their data, how verifiable credentials are always available for authentication, and the role blockchain plays in it.</p> What Can Blockchain Do for Digital Identity? <p>In simple terms, a blockchain is a digital and immutable database of information. Everyone can see what is written on a public blockchain</p><p>It can act as a backbone for a decentralized identity system.</p><p>But how does it work?</p><p>Every issuer has a Public Decentralized Identifier (DID) stored on a blockchain. This Public DID is a globally unique identifier — example: did:dock:da8dasd...12 — containing a cryptographic key. </p><p>When the issuer creates a Verifiable Credential, they use their DID to put a cryptographic signature on the credential. This signature makes the credential become tamper-proof.</p><p>Whenever a verifier needs to check the authenticity of a credential, they just need to check the blockchain to confirm what was the Public DID that signed that credential and if they trust that organization.</p><p>The blockchain is like a phone book where everyone can check the Public DID of the issuer for different credentials. </p><p>Before this tech came along, the verifier had to get in touch with the issuer to verify the authenticity of a document. </p><p>Now, once an issuer signs a credential, they are always available for authentication without the verifier pinging the issuer each time. They can simply check the blockchain to see who has signed the credential. The decentralized and immutable nature of the blockchain ensures that Verifiable Credentials are always available for authentication.</p><p>Even if the issuer is offline or doesn’t exist anymore, the system isn’t affected.</p> How Blockchain Impacts Digital Identity Management <p>There are generally five pillars of Blockchain-based digital identity management solutions.</p> Trust. <p>The blockchain and cryptography enable trust between parties that are not connected between them and have never met.</p><p>The blockchain is immutable, so each party knows that the Public DID stored on the blockchain can never be deleted.</p><p>Each Verifiable Credential has a cryptographic signature that guarantees that the credential wasn't tampered with.</p><p>When a verifier needs to confirm that a credential is valid, they don't need to contact the issuing party. They just need to check the blockchain to see what was the DID that signed the credential and who that DID belongs to.</p> Security. <p>Another notable benefit of using blockchain for digital identity management is security. Since users can now store and manage their data, their sensitive personal information is not stored in "honey pots" with millions of other users' credentials. Making it harder for hackers to acquire large quantities of credentials at once.</p><p>This decentralized mechanism where multiple users store their own credentials effectively reduces the risk of data breaches.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials also use cryptographic digital signatures to ensure they are tamper-proof.</p> Simplicity. <p>Using a blockchain framework for digital identity management simplifies the process for everyone involved.</p>  Digital identity issuers. The issuer simply has to sign the Verifiable Credential and send it to the user. They don’t need to store them or be involved in the verification process when the user shares the credential.  Digital identity verifiers. Blockchain identity management makes it simple and cost-effective to onboard and verify customer and user data.  Digital identity holders. Blockchain offers users an alternative to centralized data management and gives them complete control of their digital identity. This concept of identity is called Self-Sovereign Identity.   Integrity. <p>One key benefit of using blockchain-based identity systems is the ability to maintain the integrity of the issuer’s identity across different nodes within a network. </p><p>Since the issuer’s public DID is on the blockchain, it enables the user’s credentials to always be verifiable without the need to contact the issuer. </p><p>Furthermore, unlike a centralized system, blockchain technology lacks a single point of failure. </p><p>Therefore, it makes it extremely difficult for hackers to disrupt the integrity of a particular data set.</p> Privacy. <p>The final pillar of Blockchain-based digital identity management solutions is privacy. Regulators all over the world are demanding privacy for people’s sensitive and personal information. </p><p>Verifiable Credentials use Selective Disclosure and Zero-Knowledge Proofs. The first method allows a user to only share a specific part of a credential without disclosing the entire credential. </p><p>The second method enables users to prove something about themselves without even revealing the data that supports that proof. For example, a user can prove that they live in a specific city without showing their address.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials ensure privacy by design.</p> Final Thoughts <p>Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identity empowers businesses to swiftly and efficiently onboard global customers and employees with secure data exchange and digital transactions.</p><p>It breaks down the barriers associated with sharing information across company boundaries. It builds customer trust and aids businesses with adhering to data protection regulations and avoiding financial losses.</p><p>You can leverage Dock Certs today to create, issue, and share verifiable credentials and decentralized identities for your business without writing a single line of code!</p><p><a href="https://certs.dock.io/">Sign up to Dock Certs today</a>.</p>

 ONT ID Framework Upgraded: Ontology’s Verifiable Credentials SDKs Now Open Source for All Go and Java Developers  In making the code widely accessible, Ontology is accelerating the adoption of decentralized identity (DID) in the blockchain sphere <p>As the project that has focused on the Decentralized Identity (DID) field for over 4 years, Ontology’s goal is to build the infrastructure to provide trusted access to Web3, allowing individuals and enterprises to rest assured that through robust digital identity solutions, users and their privacy come first, industry wide. To achieve this mission, the full set of ONT ID frameworks have been comprehensively upgraded.</p><p>The integration of digital identity solutions is core to the creation of a Web3 that is secure and trusted. That’s why today, we are announcing that our bespoke <a href="https://github.com/ont-id">Verifiable Credentials Software Development Kits</a> (VC SDKs) are now open source and accessible to all Go and Java developers on GitHub. This includes the VC-SDKs as well as the VC-With-ONTID-SDKs, of which you can find more information below.</p><p>We are proud to invite developers to join the Ontology community and create new use cases for digital identity solutions. This news comes alongside the extension of our Dorahacks hackathon to the end of May, which aims to promote privacy and digital identity, offering a prize pool of up to $100K&nbsp;USD.</p> Applicable in both Web2 and Web3 ecosystems <p>Most importantly, developers do not have to be building on Ontology; the SDKs are available for use in all circumstances, and we encourage the developer community to glean the benefits of doing&nbsp;so.</p><p>VC-SDKs should be applied in any blockchain ecosystem, making it easy for dApp developers to implement verifiable-credential-related Web3 applications or embed verifiable credential functionalities into existing Web2 applications. Via GitHub, developers can edit content and code inline, make pull requests, file issues and send content suggestions to the documentation and SDK teams in question.</p> Understanding VC-Go and VC-Java&nbsp;SDKs <p>The SDKs are for verifiable credentials written in the Golang and Java languages. It conforms to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C recommendation for Verifiable Credentials Data Model</a>, a specification endorsed by W3C and its&nbsp;members.</p><p>This SDK is identifier-agnostic. It supports a variety of identifiers, such as the decentralized identifier (DID) methods defined in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/">W3C DID Specification Registries</a>, as well as identifiers from the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) or other domain naming systems. In terms of proof methods, this SDK supports common cryptographic signature algorithms and will support zero-knowledge proofs in the future. It will also support range proofs and existence proofs that will allow for selective disclosure in a sequence.</p><p>This SDK does not deal with the revocation of verifiable credentials. Because the information in a VC needs to be adjustable for security reasons, the statuses of a verifiable credential include, as a minimum, “normal” and “revoked”. This presents a use case opportunity for application developers.</p><p>VCs can be used in many business scenarios. When applying for a job, job-seekers can provide a verifiable presentation, which has necessary information and the signature generated by the job-seekers, derived from their VCs issued by a university, for example. The employer can cryptographically verify that the individual’s presentation is not fraudulent by checking both the verifiable presentation itself (such as checking the signature and the period of validity), as well as the university’s revocation services.</p> Understanding VC-With-ONTID-SDKs for Go and&nbsp;Java <p>Using the VC-With-ONTID-SDKS over VC-SDKs has the added advantage of allowing anyone that does not have access to their own DID protocols to apply the SDK and access the ONT ID protocols, opening up a realm of new possibilities.</p><p>This is an SDK for using ONT ID in a VC system. ONT ID is decentralized, self-sovereign, privacy-preserving, and easy to use, enabling users to fully control their own data and identities.</p><p>These SDKs should be used with the VC-SDKs which implement the main functionalities of a verifiable credential system. Besides using ONT ID to identify the various parties in a VC system, this SDK also supports rerecording the VC status in the Ontology blockchain.</p><p>With the help of these SDKs, issuers can change the verifiable credentials from “normal” to “revoked” if the issued credentials need to be revoked. It is worth noting that trying the opposite direction will not work due to security concerns. Holders can also revoke their credentials on their&nbsp;own.</p><p>For example, ABC is a vocational training institution that issues VCs, which can be used as vocational training certificates, to trainees. ABC records the status of these VCs on the Ontology blockchain using this SDK. Let’s say a trainee at ABC obtains a VC from ABC and its status is “normal”. However, following this, the trainee suspects their private key has been compromised. At this point, the individual can then update the status of their VC and label it as “revoked”. As a result, verifiers that received verifiable presentations derived from the compromised VCs will be notified that the verifiable presentations are&nbsp;invalid.</p><p>Developers can download the SDKs directly <a href="https://github.com/ont-id">here</a>. We are proud to be sharing our code with developers all over the world and we look forward to seeing greater integration of digital identity globally across all business cases, be it with end users or within enterprise use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

			 Are regulated stablecoins the future of payments? 
<p>Global regulators have been busy over the past few months announcing new or draft regulations around digital assets. Stablecoins seem to be one of the priorities for lawmakers. Since October 2021, stablecoins have grown approximately 500%, according to the Biden Administration.</p>
<p>US’s Senate Banking Committee member Sen. Patrick Toomey said: “Stablecoins have the potential, among other things, to speed up payments and automate transactions.”, however, it comes with risks and uncertainty (e.g., unclear pegged assets, money laundering, terrorist financing or circumvention of sanctions). Unsurprisingly, stablecoins have become the prime target of regulators, as you can see below:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/europe-draft-crypto-regulation-mica-limits-use-of-stablecoins-like-dai/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8t3MbAgxuHag0ea5vYIbGMrVG-IGQF-YZUpXlpQtFqupO7FtpAw8zfqAPIUZcG5u9IG6TH">EU</a>: 25 March 2022, the MiCA Bill moved forward, in the current draft of the Bill, stablecoins can be classified as e-money tokens (single fiat backed) or asset-referenced tokens (multiple asset pegged). E-money tokens could be issued by banks or EMIs, while asset-referenced tokens could be issued by banks or authorized entities under MiCA, as summarized&nbsp;<a href="https://www.allenovery.com/global/-/media/allenovery/2_documents/news_and_insights/publications/2021/01/mica_webinar_slides.pdf?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8t3MbAgxuHag0ea5vYIbGMrVG-IGQF-YZUpXlpQtFqupO7FtpAw8zfqAPIUZcG5u9IG6TH">by Allen &amp; Overy</a>, however it is still subject to changes. 
 
 
 <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/uk-government-moves-forward-with-regulatory-framework-on-stablecoins-for-payments?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8t3MbAgxuHag0ea5vYIbGMrVG-IGQF-YZUpXlpQtFqupO7FtpAw8zfqAPIUZcG5u9IG6TH">UK</a>: 4 April 2022, the Government confirms plans to bring stablecoins used as a means of payment, the regulator FCA will set out the detailed requirement in rulebooks. 
 <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/04/06/top-us-lawmaker-proposes-sweeping-stablecoin-regulation-framework/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8t3MbAgxuHag0ea5vYIbGMrVG-IGQF-YZUpXlpQtFqupO7FtpAw8zfqAPIUZcG5u9IG6TH">US</a>: 6 April 2022, the US lawmaker proposed The Stablecoin TRUST Act to give stablecoin issuers the choice between obtaining (1) the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) license, (2) a state money transmitter or similar license or (3) a traditional bank charter. 
 
<p>One way or another, a stablecoin issuer will likely have to apply for a license under the new legislative proposals, or become a bank. Banks and pioneers are already moving as we speak. Last month, Australian bank&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/24/fireblocks-and-anz-create-aud-stablecoin/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8t3MbAgxuHag0ea5vYIbGMrVG-IGQF-YZUpXlpQtFqupO7FtpAw8zfqAPIUZcG5u9IG6TH">ANZ</a>&nbsp;teamed up with Fireblocks to issue Australian dollar-backed stablecoins, 30 million has been minted by March.</p>
<p>Last week,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/video/recent-videos/stripe-to-add-usdc-stablecoin-payments-via-polygon/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8t3MbAgxuHag0ea5vYIbGMrVG-IGQF-YZUpXlpQtFqupO7FtpAw8zfqAPIUZcG5u9IG6TH">Stripe</a>&nbsp;has chosen to use our partner Polygon’s networks to offer stablecoin USDC as payments, and Twitter will use its service to pay content creators in USDC, making payments faster and cheaper while allowing unbanked users to monetize their content.</p>
<p>As a technology infrastructure provider, our token management solutions are already used by several stablecoin projects in the EU, the UK and in the USA. For example, as early as 2020, we announced an interbank settlement coin&nbsp;<a href="https://csqny04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/WZ+113/csQNy04/VVRwzp6M9J_7W5-K53t3pqHcYW8yJSQm4Jk6WnN1vWRsS3q90JV1-WJV7CgD5XW3GW0XM3MbkZWW7jvtl66G5LnQW4q61-66fZqWLW9klSGF64G5R6W8Fdkh277xL9lW239NH11xnZfkW2FB9QJ7PsxksW6XyKrT3fg7s8W2KNvqx57_-L-TMQ0x6zKdmXW5NP7gZ2Dwm78W5_8YYW10QXSHW60H2T94-JFPtW98fwKW7yJ2X3N12BmYr4N3hFW4R2MTw4YKjWVW3nyNwv2wsdc3V4BNvC4yZDRSW2TYj_L93HvDdN4-gqzkPV8BZVLCwVP4Yb76FW3_9BSR1wZ3sJW53TSJv8TdtnnW2tbbRx7fG5wxW1-lWg36SqLkNW4Ms9T92sGzgkW6QQMqW7wtdXwW8lKyy65T_8cs3qk91?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8t3MbAgxuHag0ea5vYIbGMrVG-IGQF-YZUpXlpQtFqupO7FtpAw8zfqAPIUZcG5u9IG6TH">project with a consortium of French banks</a>&nbsp;(BNP Paribas, CACIB and Caisse des Dépôts).</p>
<p>We are prepared to provide technology with a 4-year track record to enable entities to issue compliant stablecoins via the ERC-3643 standard, filling the gap between regulation and blockchain by ensuring that issuers have full control over stablecoins as required by regulators.</p>
<p>The era of regulated stablecoins is coming, we are excited to see it evolving quickly, and we will share some exciting news soon, stay tuned!</p>

How can individuals keep track of, and assert control over, the data they are sharing with many different Data&nbsp;Trusts?  <p>One answer, we suggest, is to use individuals’ personal data stores as infrastructure for Data Trusts. Individuals can use their PDSs to feed their data to the Trusts they want to support and to exercise appropriate controls over this&nbsp;data.</p><p><a href="https://datatrusts.uk/blogs/helping-data-trusts-manage-personal-data">The blog</a> goes into more detail as to how this can&nbsp;work.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/helping-data-trusts-manage-personal-data-4215faaee5f2">Helping Data Trusts Manage Personal Data</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Warwick Ashford</a></p><p>As the world becomes more digital, and the right to privacy becomes enshrined in a growing number of laws and regulations around the world, organizations increasingly have to pay attention to protecting the privacy of individuals in all their data handling and processing.</p>
<p>In the digital era, privacy guarantees need to be taken into account when designing any interactions with individuals that involve personal information, not only to avoid the risk of sanctions for failing to comply with privacy regulations, but also to gain consumer loyalty through winning their trust.</p>
<p>Since the introduction of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), privacy has become very closely associated with data protection, and while there is no real privacy without effective data protection, privacy and data protection are often separate areas that modern businesses need to focus on to remain competitive.</p>
<p>In practice, this means that organizations constantly need to keep up to date on privacy and data protection regulations to ensure that their business operations remain in compliance, while at the same time they need to keep an eye on the cyber threat landscape to ensure they can protect personal and other business critical data from cyber attackers.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity, therefore, is an important part of privacy and data protection, but as remote working becomes more common, and organizations continue to adopt cloud-based services, the attack surface is changing and expanding.</p>
<p>This means that organizations need to adapt to this change and ensure that they adopt modern approaches that combine privacy, data protection and data governance. It is only through this convergence that today’s security and privacy requirements will be met.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The real question is why many organizations have not yet started actively building a trusted relationship with their users/customers/consumers/employees. The awareness is rising, so that security and privacy are moving increasingly into the focus of not only tech-savvy users but also that of everyday customers.</p>
<p>— Matthias Reinwarth, IAM Practice Director, KuppingerCole.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because we understand the important relationship between privacy and data protection, and because we are committed to helping your business succeed, KuppingerCole has a great deal of content available in a variety of formats.</p>

  <p>As the internet has grown, so has the need to protect users from privacy invasions, fraud, or other types of abuse by attackers. The European Union’s solution is the General Data Protection Regulation, or <a href="https://gdpr.eu/">GDPR</a>. First put into effect in 2018, the policy applies not only to the organizations in the EU but to any organization that uses or collects data from people in the EU.</p>

<p>If your organization is subject to GDPR, you’ll need to know how to stay in compliance. This article will break down the details of this policy so that you understand its potential effects on your application.</p>

 What to know about GDPR 

<p>GDPR, which officially took effect on May 25, 2018, primarily encourages organizations to properly handle user data and privacy. Those not in compliance can face fines, in some cases <a href="https://gdpr.eu/the-gdpr-meets-its-first-challenge-facebook/">large ones like Facebook</a>.</p>

 GDPR requirements 

<p>GDPR compliance imposes multiple requirements on your organization. Here is what you must include in your application:</p>

 
   Enhanced application security. For example, end-to-end encryption, multi-factor authentication, and so on. 
   Facilities for users to exercise their data privacy rights. 
   Quick data purge at a user’s request. 
   Users given access to data collected from or about them. 
   Consent from users about what data is obtained and how it’s used. 
   Processing of user data in a way that doesn’t compromise the user. 
 

 GDPR penalties 

<p>The penalties for breaching GDPR are capped at whichever sum is higher: <a href="https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/">$22.8 million USD or four percent of global revenue</a>. In the past three years, this has resulted in more than <a href="https://www.tessian.com/blog/biggest-gdpr-fines-2020/">$1.4 billion USD</a> in fines levied against tech giants, hotels, governmental agencies, and violators in other sectors.</p>

 How GDPR affects application security 

<p>If you’re responsible for managing your application’s security, GDPR can feel like a threat. There is a lot of work involved, and mistakes can lead to costly fines. If you use it properly, though, following GDPR can help your application. Here are some of the benefits it can offer:</p>

 Bigger security budget 

<p>Prior to GDPR, many organizations viewed cybersecurity as an expense rather than an investment. This attitude was reflected in understaffing and decreased purchasing power for critical cybersecurity features. The result was easily exploited digital infrastructure.</p>

<p>Because GDPR demands that organizations increase data security and backs up those demands with fines, managers of organizations would rather devote more of their budget to cybersecurity than risk losing profit to a security breach.</p>

 More security integrations 

<p>Products and services that help with <a href="https://www.globalapptesting.com/blog/what-is-automation-testing">automation testing</a>, <a href="https://www.xmcyber.com/what-is-breach-and-attack-simulation/">automated breach and attack simulation</a>, <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-a-vpn">virtual private networks (VPNs)</a>, and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/vpc">virtual private clouds (VPCs)</a> are more likely to be added to an organization’s security strategy. Such additions can shore up the defenses of digital infrastructure; VPCs and VPNs also offer a sandbox environment for employees to experiment with security features.</p>

 Faster response to security incidents 

<p>Previously, user data theft wasn’t always handled as promptly as it should have been. GDPR enforcement requires organizations to communicate quickly about security breaches, which helps protect affected users and keeps other stakeholders well-informed. This can reduce the fallout of data theft.</p>

 How to comply with GDPR 

<p>The <a href="https://gdpr.eu/checklist/">GDPR checklist</a> provides a snapshot of actions you and your organization need to take to be compliant. They include:</p>

 
   Employ a <a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/legal-and-compliance/employment-law/pages/global-gdpr-data-protection-officer.aspx">data protection officer</a>. 
   Invest in <a href="https://seersco.com/articles/gdpr-training-for-staff/">staff training</a>. 
   Ensure that third-party organizations you <a href="https://gdpr.eu/article-44-transfer-of-personal-data/">transfer data</a> to are compliant as well. 
   Stay updated on <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/third-countries/#:~:text=The%20third%20countries%20which%20ensure,these%20countries%20is%20expressly%20permitted.">which countries</a> are cleared for data transfers. 
 

 GDPR in your application 

<p>The following are questions you need to answer in order to keep your application in GDPR compliance:</p>

<p>Data collection</p>

 
   Is there a good reason for collecting this data? 
   Has the collection of non-necessary data been minimized? 
   Does the user consent to the collection of this data? 
 

<p>Data accuracy</p>

 
   Have you taken reasonable steps to keep data accurate? 
   Can users edit and update potentially inaccurate information? 
 

<p>Data breach</p>

 
   If a data breach has occurred, have you informed supervisors within seventy-two hours of the breach? 
   Have you carried out a data protection impact assessment before adopting new technology that interacts with user data? 
 

<p>Data protection</p>

 
   Have you taken adequate measures to prevent the compromise of user data? 
   Are your cybersecurity policies and measures up to date? 
   Is personally identifiable information (PII) of users properly encrypted to prevent abuse by malignant actors? 
 

<p>Data rights</p>

 
   Do users have the ability to request copies of their data? 
   Do users have the ability to object to certain uses of their data? 
   Can you delete a user’s data immediately if they request it? Does this include removing their data from your backups? 
 

<p>Data transfer</p>

 
   Is the data transfer process handled in a way that doesn’t compromise data? 
   Does the receiver have enough security installations in place to protect data? 
   Does the receiver comply with the human rights charter? 
   Is the receiver allowed to obtain data from entities bound by GDPR laws? 
 

 Common GDPR features 

<p>Here are examples of features that you can implement in your application to ensure GDPR compliance:</p>

 Frontend cookie consent 

<p>Users must be able to choose whether or not to accept cookies. GDPR emphasizes that users should be able to reject cookies easily. Some organizations make it <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/cookie-consent-most-websites-break-law-by-making-it-hard-to-reject-all-tracking/">difficult to do this</a>, but such underhanded tactics can result in heavy fines.</p>

<p>A rule of thumb is to display the Decline button right next to the Accept button (and in the same font size) rather than offering a “Settings” or “Manage Cookies” link that makes it harder for users to refuse cookies and subtly bullies them into accepting the cookies on your platform. There are a ton of <a href="https://betterprogramming.pub/implement-a-cookie-consent-notification-within-5-minutes-82c845c55487">resources</a> online that can help you implement GDPR-friendly frontend cookies. Compare your options so that you can adopt one that suits your organization best.</p>

 Data mapping 

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mapping">Data mapping</a>, or connecting information from multiple data sets, requires a top-down analysis of all of an organization’s databases and what information they hold. This can be a big task, but it ensures transparency and accountability. Data mapping is required for the next steps.</p>

<p>Data mapping can be manual, semi-automated, or automated. You should determine which approach works best for you, depending on the size of your company, your budget, the quality of your data management team, and the amount of data you work with. Deciding how to <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/data-mapping">implement data mapping</a> will require some understanding of your databases, as well as knowing which duplicated columns can be optimized to reduce redundancy.</p>

 Data purge functionality 

<p>Previously, even after users requested that their data be deleted, organizations could remove it from public access and keep it somewhere hidden; however, the GDPR mandates that “officially” deleted data must be deleted everywhere. Organizations must ensure that they monitor data to delete it properly from all resources as needed.</p>

<p>Implementing <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/Best_Practices/Architecture/Data_Purging">data purge functionality</a> will likely require some modification to your database schema so that you can identify data to mark for deletion, per user requests, and data to purge due to staleness. Using <code>last_updated_date</code> and <code>is_deleted</code> columns in your data table can be useful in identifying either type of data.</p>

 Refactoring database schemas 

<p>Data purge functionality may involve refactoring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_schema">database (DB) schemas</a> to add columns noting when a resource was created or whether it was deleted. These columns can be used to automate data purges based on whether the data has been held longer than needed, for instance.</p>

<p>Further DB schema analysis may also be required to ensure that more data isn’t being collected than absolutely necessary.</p>

 Compliance is worth the work 

<p>GDPR rules can be long and esoteric, but it’s important for your organization to understand how to stay in compliance with the policy. Not only will you avoid fines for violations, but users will be more willing to trust your application. Ensuring better data privacy helps all stakeholders.</p>

<p>If necessary, remember you can seek help from a GDPR officer to ensure compliance. Doing this work upfront can save your organization from more costly consequences later on.</p>

<p>Whether it comes to buying homes and automobiles, seeking a personal or small business loan, or even approval to rent an apartment, there can be one daunting step of the loan process: income verification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It can take a long time. It involves a lot of paperwork—if the borrower has devoted the file cabinet space to store it. And without transparency or the right information, the process can feel arbitrary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://finicity.com/open-banking">Open banking</a> can help. Let’s start at the beginning.</p>
 
 Which Documents Usually Provide Verification of Income? 
<p>Paystubs, which are one of the most basic data sources, can provide proof of income as well as employment verification at the same time. With a paycheck traceable to an employer or a client, a lender can determine what kind of income the check represents and can follow up with its issuer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other income documents include proof-of-income letters, the standard W-2 annual tax statement and other tax forms that may be more fragmented. These documents aren’t always readily available. While they can be obtained from payroll providers and tax filing software, that involves even more digging and delays for what should be a simple process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Processing that kind of paperwork, following up with employers and verifying the details is time-intensive—and thus, money-intensive.&nbsp;</p>
 
 How Does Finicity’s Income Verification Make a Difference? 
<p>Open banking gives lenders a way to verify income quickly and securely, by verifying income where income is deposited in bank accounts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finicity’s income verification allows borrowers to connect their financial accounts to the lenders or services they’re interacting with. This lets borrowers quickly and securely skip much of the manual paperwork, while lenders can make informed decisions with comprehensive transaction and income data, ranging from 24 months of deposit transactions to estimated annual income and average monthly income. All of the information is categorized and ranked with confidence streams using artificial intelligence and machine learning as part of Finicity’s data analytics solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do we mean by “comprehensive data?” With open banking, the process of verifying income can go beyond paychecks, tax forms and phone calls. With more consumer-permissioned data sources comes a fuller picture of a borrower’s financial health and more accurate income verification.</p>
 
 Where Does Open Banking Fit into Mortgage Lending? 
<p>Mortgages are one of the most significant loans that many consumers will take out in their lifetimes, and the mortgage application process can be complex—to an intimidating degree. According to <a href="https://www.finicity.com/2021-mortgage-report/">a recent Finicity survey of homebuyers</a>, the top reason that people hesitate to refinance their home is because of the prospect of going through the income and employment verification and qualification processes all over again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mortgage credit decisioning hinges on the borrower’s ability to make their mortgage payments on time. Most mortgage lenders require borrowers to provide at least two years of employment and income history via tax documents, paystubs and asset statements. The same goes for self-employed borrowers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mastercard’s open banking platform (provided by Mastercard’s wholly-owned subsidiary, <a href="https://www.finicity.com/">Finicity</a>), is able to leverage open banking data to satisfy the most stringent guidelines for the highest-value loans. We’re one of the only data providers approved to verify assets and income digitally by <a href="https://www.duvalidationcenter.com/vendors/">Fannie Mae</a> and <a href="https://sf.freddiemac.com/tools-learning/loan-advisor/our-solutions/aim-asset-income-modeler">Freddie Mac</a>. This data also makes it easy to refresh employment verifications right before close to make sure nothing has changed simply by checking whether they received their last paycheck. When you’re working with something as consequential as someone’s home loan, trust is key.</p>
 
 How Can Renters Benefit from Open Banking? 
<p>Homeownership isn’t for everyone, and open banking also helps renters navigating the apartment application process. Landlords screening potential tenants can use the same data to make decisions based on the applicant’s income and their historical rental payments. It can also help give context to low credit scores or other potential red flags on the application, resulting in a fairer decisioning process.</p>
 
 When do Auto Loans Require an Income Check? 
<p>Auto loans don’t typically require income verification, but the process may come into play when the prospective borrower has a thin credit file, smaller down payment or a lower credit score. The same goes for credit cards, personal loans and growing payment segments like buy-now-pay-later (BNPL).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For thin-file borrowers such as young people and recent immigrants, checking a credit score doesn’t tell their whole financial story. It can lead to frustrating denials, even though they have evidence of qualifying income and that they pay their bills on time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By incorporating income and other data—like transactions from connected bank accounts, debt-to-income ratio and more, open finance opens up a world of possibility. Borrowers can be approved for their car loan and qualify for lower interest rates. Lenders, meanwhile, won’t miss out on opportunities to bring new customers on board with a <a href="http://finicity.com/auto-demo">simple process</a> that they can get through while their buyer is still at the dealership.</p>
 
 How can Income Data be Incorporated into Decisioning for Personal Lending? 
<p>For many personal lenders, checking income after the fact may not be the most efficient way to approve loans. With open finance, the income, transaction data and analytics can be just as easily incorporated into their lending algorithms as in mortgage and auto lending.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personal lenders of all types look at hundreds of different pieces of data, depending on how much they’re lending and what it’s for. Open banking provides highly actionable data, direct from the applicant’s bank accounts. It slides seamlessly into their decisioning models.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They no longer have to be satisfied with borrower-submitted income figures or delays in providing supporting documentation when a loan approval is up in the air. Using consumer-permissioned data, lenders receive a nearly real-time view of the applicant’s income and bank account data for a clearer credit decision.</p>
 
 How Does This Help the Consumer? 
<p>Verifying income with transaction data permissioned by consumers allows lenders and fintech innovators to simplify the customer experience with a more flexible underwriting process. It provides more choice to consumers, who can still use their paystubs or bank statements while also speeding up the decisioning process by permissioning their financial data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open banking adds the data necessary to easily verify income quickly, securely and without manual processes. Whether you’re lending, renting or leasing, Finicity’s income data can simplify the process and provide valuable insights. More data, more time saved, more satisfied borrowers and tenants—open banking helps everyone out.</p>

<p>When signing in to popular services today, users will typically use identity providers (IdPs) that are centralized entities with ultimate control over users' identifiers--or "Big Login." Sign-In with Ethereum offers a new self-custodial option for users who wish to assume more control and responsibility over their own digital identity. </p><p>Here are the latest updates from our work on Sign-In with Ethereum:</p> Recently Completed and Announced   All SIWE Core Packages (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe/pull/67">TypeScript</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-rs/pull/31">Rust</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-go/pull/15">Go</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-ex/pull/22">Elixir</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-ruby/pull/16">Ruby</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-py/pull/27">Python</a>) have been streamlined to support unified handling of SIWE message creation, parsing, and verification. We will have a new major release of SIWE Core Packages in the next week where those changes will be available. We've also added additional test vectors.  We've added tests for EIP-1271 in order to have test vectors for Argent and Loopring Smart Contract Wallets:   <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe/pull/69">  Add tests for EIP-1271 by w4ll3 · Pull Request #69 · spruceid/siwe  Add tests vectors for Argent and Loopring Smart Contract Wallets . Do not merge before #67 .  GitHubspruceid    </a>  We've added the option to configure your own JSON RPC provider for the SIWE Discourse plugin as an alternative to being locked into Infura:   <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/discourse-siwe-auth/pull/14">  Add JSON RPC config Option by theosirian · Pull Request #14 · spruceid/discourse-siwe-auth  Adds a JSON RPC option to WalletConnect as discussed in #13.  GitHubspruceid    </a>  We've released a demo that shows the functionality around our Auth0 integration. It demonstrates an example app where a user connects via the Auth0 Sign-In with Ethereum workflow, and is able to view a gallery of the NFTs they own via the OpenSea API. The demo can be found <a href="https://auth0-demo.login.xyz/#/">here</a>.  <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/sign-in-with-ethereum-on-auth0/">  Sign-In with Ethereum to Your Auth0-Powered Application  In our pursuit of best serving web2 and web3 organizations, we’ve partnered with Auth0 to offer a Sign-In with Ethereum option in their marketplace.  SpruceSpruce    </a>  We're continuing to work with wallets on the UX and UI around Sign-In with Ethereum flows. The details on a number of these collaborations will be made public shortly.    Exploration Phase   As mentioned in our previous update, we are exploring creating templates for commonly used development frameworks such as React and Vue. We wish to make it easy for any developer using these frameworks to have a quick way to get started using Sign-In with Ethereum for their next application.   We are planning to release our <a href="https://www.passportjs.org/">passport.js</a> authentication strategy for Sign-In with Ethereum and have it documented this coming month. Passport is authentication middleware used by thousands of applications.  We'll be continuing our work with additional wallets that may require custom UX and UI flows.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>The Digital Services Act (DSA), along with the Digital Market Act (DMA) are initiatives from the European Union Commission, proposed in December 2020 and <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_22_1978">agreed upon in April 2022</a>. The main goal is to provide and ensure an accountable online environment in the EU, and regulate the “gatekeepers” on online interactions.</p>
<p>This is a wide-reaching act that will differentiate “gatekeepers” from other online services, and apply obligations to them to create a more fair, competitive, and safe online market. These acts are not in full force yet – they are subject to formal approval by the European Parliament and European Council, and will apply six months after adoption.</p>
 Which Organizations Are Impacted? 
<p>The DSA makes a clear demarcation between small and medium-sized organizations and large online intermediaries and platforms: The large intermediaries and platforms will carry more responsibility and accountability to both allow freer competition and access to information, and to be transparent in their content moderation decisions. SMEs that provide digital services in the EU (regardless of where they are based) will also be subject to the DSA, but with “<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_2545">obligations proportionate to size, impact, and risk</a>”, as stated by the Commissioner for the Internal Market Thierry Breton.</p>
 Algorithm Transparency 
<p>One of the most labor-intensive actions that online platforms, particularly those that reach 10% of consumers in the EU and subject to the strictest obligations, will need to take is to provide transparency into the algorithms used for content moderation choices, recommendations, and many other functions. However, this could have some of the largest impacts on several fronts:</p>
 
 In beginning to engage with the societal influence of machine learning algorithms – not addressing harms done to individuals, but influences shaping the way large populations of people perceive the world 
 In enforcing accountability on proprietary algorithms, the handling of which will set a precedent for transparency of other proprietary algorithms used in other areas of business 
 In stimulating more investment in explainability for machine learning models, which impacts the transparency of models, the ability for human administrators and those impacted by model recommendations to understand those recommendations, and boosting security of models by making it more human-understandable if a recommendation has been maliciously influenced. 
 
<p>This could be a turning point in our ethics debate on machine learning, moving from the theoretical to the practical and enforceable. This will be closely followed by analysts at KuppingerCole Analysts, as well as the numerous other impacts including the way that businesses can connect and communicate with their consumers or future customers. We will continue to assess and prepare you for those ongoing transitions.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Osman Celik</a></p><p>Widespread use of cloud services, the rising number of integrated solutions and the collaboration between organizations increase the concerns over data privacy and security. Today, we know that many data protection regulations (e.g., FIPS, GDPR, CCPA) require data to be encrypted while it is at rest and in motion. Even though we are not yet able to encrypt the data in all its states, fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) performs encryption while the data is in use state and might become one of the holy grails of encryption methods available. While it is one of the technologies available in the privacy-enhancing technologies (PET) market, FHE offers an encryption technology which allows organizations to remain protected from cybersecurity threats by enabling computations on encrypted data without decrypting it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The state of data denotes the different modes where computing systems are using the data. In this principle, data can be in one of three states. These are data at rest, data in motion, and data in use. Although most encryption methods deal with data at rest and data in transit, homomorphic encryption (HE), as an umbrella term, aims to allow making computations on encrypted data in use while it is being processed, analyzed, or manipulated without first decrypting it with a key. KuppingerCole Analysts predicts that HE technologies pave the way for keeping the data encrypted not only in the data in use state but also throughout the whole data lifecycle.</p>
<p></p>
 Types of HE 
<p>There are three types of HE. In general, the difference between them stems from the types and frequency of mathematical operations that they can perform on the ciphertext.</p>
<p></p>
<p>1. Partially Homomorphic Encryption (PHE): PHE algorithms only allow an infinite number of certain types of mathematical operations (e.g., only addition or multiplication) to be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it.</p>
<p>2. Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption (SHE): Despite being a step up from PHE, SHE algorithms only allow a finite number of any kind of operation rather than an infinite number of a particular operation.</p>
<p>3. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE): FHE algorithms allow all mathematical operations available to be performed unlimited times and up to high level of complexity without decrypting the data. That is why encryption experts consider it as the holy grail of homomorphic encryption.</p>
<p></p>
 How does FHE work? 
<p>1.) The owner of the data wants another party to perform mathematical operations on certain data. The owner also wants to protect the sensitive data in it without revealing it to the other party.</p>
<p>2.) The owner encrypts the data with a public key and sends it to the other party.</p>
<p>3.) The other party receives the encrypted data, performs the necessary operations on it, and sends the encrypted results to the owner. At this stage, FHE eliminates the need for decryption of the data before making operations and while sending the results.</p>
<p>4.) The owner of the data receives the results and decrypts the data with a private key. The owner manages to get results without revealing any data to the other parties.</p>
<p></p>
 Benefits of FHE 
<p>Mitigating Sensitive Data Privacy Risk:</p>
<p>FHE allows organizations to collaborate with each other in a safer environment. By making computations on encrypted data possible, FHE prevents organizations from revealing their sensitive data, such as PCI, PHI, and PII and the results of those computations to the other parties. Also, securing data in untrusted environments, such as public clouds and external parties, strengthens organizations’ cyber resilience. KuppingerCole Analysts predict that FHE can contribute to <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/insights/zero-trust">Zero-Trust approach</a> once the limitations of FHE are overcome.</p>
<p>Secure Use of Cloud:</p>
<p>By providing additional security measures, FHE can help organizations leverage their cloud use. FHE technologies can already perform computations on encrypted data among integrated cloud services.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Complying with Regulations:</p>
<p>Organizations are expected to comply with international and/or regional data protection regulations. Today, many of those regulations, such as <a href="https://gdpr.eu/working-remotely-data-security/">GDPR</a>, require organizations to encrypt their sensitive data. By taking existing encryption methods to a next level, FHE can be a strategic cybersecurity investment for the future.</p>
<p>Supply Chain Security:</p>
<p>Outsourced service providers, 3rd parties, such as contractors and vendors, might have access to organizations’ sensitive data in order to do their jobs. Today’s threat landscape demonstrates how attackers target insecure supply chains among the organizations. By reducing the risk of revealing sensitive data to other parties and enabling those parties to make computations over encrypted data, FHE helps organizations reduce their supply chain risks.</p>
<p>Quantum-Safe:</p>
<p>Existing encryption methods lack capabilities against quantum attacks. However, some companies already offer FHE solutions that are quantum-safe. Organizations which suffer from quantum attacks can consider adopting those solutions as an alternative method to increase their cyber resilience.</p>
<p></p>
 Limitations of FHE 
<p>Performance Issues:</p>
<p>Slow computation speed, accuracy problems while operating, and remarkably high storage requirements are known issues for organizations which rely on compute-intensive applications. Researchers believe that FHE has still some years to overcome performance related challenges.</p>
<p>Still an Emerging Technology:</p>
<p>HE’s roots date back to the 70s, yet FHE is a relatively new encryption method. Considering the fact that FHE, in its current form, yielded its first successful results in<a href="https://ibm-research.medium.com/the-future-of-crypto-ibm-makes-a-new-leap-with-fully-homomorphic-encryption-68e98f35af14"> 2009</a>, we might still have to wait some years to see more effective FHE schemes and solutions. Today’s FHE solutions give the best results when used with supporting solutions and best practices. While vendors are developing their</p>
<p>FHE solutions, there are scientists and engineers working on specific FHE projects and also some universities which are currently researching and developing FHE algorithms.</p>
<p>Narrow Market Size:</p>
<p>As of today, there are limited number of vendors in FHE market. This makes finding and choosing a vendor difficult. Nevertheless, companies like<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ibm-launches-experimental-homomorphic-data-encryption-environment-for-the-enterprise/"> IBM</a> launched experimental FHE services in late 2020.</p>
<p></p>
 Use Cases 
<p>FHE has already been used by various organizations for different purposes. Social media companies can benefit from it for private data analytics. Governmental organizations can deploy it during the electronic voting process. Organizations like e-commerce companies, hospitals, banks, and other financial institutions in which personal, health, and financial data is stored, used, and shared with 3rd parties can also secure themselves from data breaches and increase their cyber resilience with FHE. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/fully-homomorphic-encryption-on-ibm-cloud-hyper-protect-virtual-servers">Cybersecurity experts</a> state that FHE already provides an effective workload protection in financial institutions against fraud intelligence.</p>
<p></p>
 Alternative Solutions 
<p>Since FHE has not yet reached its potential capabilities, organizations might also look for alternative solutions in encryption and PET market. Data Masking, Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), and Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) could be alternative solutions for organizations depending on their needs and requirements. Recently, many experts compared FHE with Functional Encryption (FE) which is also an encryption technology that is in the preliminary stages of development.</p>
<p></p>
 Recommendations 
<p>Clarify Your Needs and Requirements: When considering any solution, organizations should first determine their requirements. Consider the limitations of FHE solutions and look for alternative solutions if needed. A SWOT analysis might be helpful to create at this stage.</p>
<p>Analyze the FHE Market: Understand each solution’s strengths and weaknesses. Since FHE is an emerging solution, try to find out what further developments that vendors are planning.</p>
<p>Conduct a PoC: Determine the best use case scenarios for your organization, create a well-defined checklist and ask initially selected vendors to prepare a PoC.</p>
<p>Choose a Vendor: Make sure that the vendor you select demonstrates the desired capabilities during the PoC. Finally, choose the vendor that best meets your requirements and has the fewest limitations for your organization.</p>

<p>After months of hard work on this project, we are proud to announce the launch of ShareRing eKYC at Barbados Teachers Co-Operative Credit Union Limited (TCU). The launch of eKYC with TCU signifies both entity’s forward thinking position on user data ownership and privacy, whilst ensuring anti-money laundering requirements are adhered to stringently.</p>



<p>The philosophy behind TCU is ‘people helping people’, and ShareRing’s purpose of “frictionless access with digital identities”&nbsp; is a symbiotic partner to the greater vision behind both entities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the launch, customers of TCU are now able to use the ShareRing App to upload, verify, and submit their eKYC documents. After downloading the app, the customer must first set up their ShareRing ID, a digital twin representation of their physical self, before proceeding with their eKYC process.</p>







<p>For user instructions on setting up your ShareRing ID, <a href="https://sharering.network/user-manual-guide/">visit this page here</a>.</p>



<p>For user instructions on submitting your eKYC application, <a href="https://sharering.network/sharering-ekyc-user-instructions-barbados-teachers-cooperative-credit-union-limited/">visit this page here.</a></p>



<p>eKYC with ShareRing and TCU brings a flurry of advantages that are backed by the underlying blockchain technology. A faster and more efficient KYC process is supported by immutability of data hashed on the blockchain. This correlates to time saved by both the individual and institution. On top of that, confidence levels that data is not fraudulent and tampered-with are significantly high.</p>



<p>If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to our customer support team. If you are an institution and are interested in adopting eKYC into your organization, please reach out to Stewart Smith, Head of Sales and Marketing, at stewart.s@sharering.network</p>

<p>ShareRing is a digital identity blockchain ecosystem with a suite of ID driven solutions that enable individuals, and institutions an easier pathway to navigate services across the digital landscape.</p>



<p>Teachers Credit Union has been in existence for over 50 years and is one of the most stable Credit Unions in the Caribbean. Their mission is to provide financial and other related services in a manner that anticipates and satisfies the financial needs of members in the areas of saving and borrowing.</p>

  The benefits of owning and storing your own credentials are unmatched by today’s standards.

<p>On a mission to enable organizations and individuals to create and share verifiable data, Dock has invited its trusted community members to test new features and upgrades on Dock’s Mobile Wallet App. One of these new features allows users to store and manage verifiable credentials directly on their mobile devices. We are committed to delivering a service made entirely for the community and are entrusting our community members to test the wallet app feature. This will ensure the feature is customer-focused and fulfills community needs.</p> Verifiable Credentials Explained<br> <p>Verifiable credentials (VCs) are tamper-proof credentials that can be cryptographically verified. VCs can represent things found in physical forms such as a driving license or passport, and things that have no physical equivalent such as ownership of a bank account or NFT. </p><p>The difference verifiable credentials bring is that they can be instantly verified and cannot be tampered with. &nbsp;</p><p>An issuing body, such as an educational or training institution can create and issue verifiable credentials. These credentials have been cryptographically signed by the issuing authority and cannot be tampered with. The individual receiving this credential now owns the data and can prove the credentials are legitimate without contacting the issuer. </p> The Old-Fashioned Way<br> <p>Let’s take Dave for example. Dave moves around different construction sites each week for work. He has taken several online courses legalizing him to drive a forklift, operate diggers, and more. Dave must carry prints of these certificates or a laptop to display the PDF certificates. Being a construction worker, a laptop isn’t the safest option as it can get damaged easily, therefore Dave usually opts for paper certificates. He prints off the certificates and takes them to each construction site he works at. </p><p>According to COSAC, the average construction worker holds between 8 and 10 certificates. Dave has to carry all these physical certificates to each site he attends and prove his qualifications to work there. </p> The Ease Of Verifiable Credentials<br> <p>If Dave is issued verifiable credentials by the training body, he has complete control over them. The verifying body can validate the credentials are legitimate without the need to contact the issuing body. </p><p>The benefits of owning and storing your own credentials are unmatched by today’s standards. Dock’s Wallet App will allow users to store and manage their verifiable credentials from their mobile devices. This feature will soon be released but we want to ensure we’ve worked out the kinks and that it’s fit for customer use. </p> On With The Beta Testing<br> <p>From Monday, our selected beta testers will be knighted with a unique credential from Dock and have the ability to import this credential into their Mobile Wallet App. They’ll have 7 days to explore the credentials management flow we’ve designed and expose any bugs they find. These bugs will be detailed back to our development team and addressed before launch.</p><p>To ensure the feature fulfills customer needs, the beta testing will continue for another week once all bugs and issues have been reported and resolved. We’re doing this as we want to ensure we are releasing a customer-focused, customer-centric, user-friendly credentials management flow. </p><p>Dock wants to guarantee an intuitive user experience, assuring a seamless and simple import and credential management flow. We believe this feature will serve great importance to the community and will overcome various risks associated with paper and PDF credentials.</p><p>12,500 DOCK tokens are up for grabs for our beta testers who report the best and most in-depth feedback on our credentials management feature. The token rewards are split between 2 scopes - security and user experience of our wallet app feature. If you’re interested in being a part of our future beta testing programs, keep an eye on our <a href="https://linktr.ee/DockNetwork">social media</a> and be the first to trial Dock’s upcoming features and products. </p><p>Late last year, we announced a collaboration with Transak opening the doors for the wider community to buy DOCK tokens via card payments and bank transfers. To on-board as many as we can, Dock has enabled this ability on our Mobile Wallet App. App users can buy tokens from fiat to crypto using local payment methods in a few simple clicks. Our beta testers will have the opportunity to test this feature and ensure the process is as smooth as it can be. </p><p></p><p>Terms and Conditions:</p>  All data should be kept private and they can’t share any link with any other person. Everything in strict confidence and no disclosure of any information.  Only disclose errors and bugs to the company and no one else  Rewards will be given to the best feedback provider and not to everyone participating. However, team can consider rewarding participants that uncover a unique or severe security related bug that brings substantial improvement to the app  Testers should provide feedback only using the google form provided and nothing else

<p>Ensuring widespread Sign-In with Ethereum adoption across apps and services requires serving both web3 applications and more traditional apps and services in web2. Typically, most traditional web2 services already support OpenID Connect, and were open to adding a new Identity Provider that supported the Sign-In with Ethereum workflow. </p><p>By meeting these services where they are today, we can provide a pragmatic stepping stone towards true decentralization, with an upgrade path to direct authentication. In our pursuit of best serving these organizations, we've partnered with Auth0 to offer a Sign-In with Ethereum option in their marketplace:</p><blockquote><p>Signing in with Ethereum wallets is now an available option for all Auth0 clients! A big thanks to our friends (frens?) at <a href="https://twitter.com/SpruceID?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SpruceID</a>.<br><br>We're excited to see how the Web3 world continues to unlock new tools for identity, privacy, and security: <a href="https://t.co/McdjVI7wwy">https://t.co/McdjVI7wwy</a></p>— The Auth0 Lab (@Auth0Lab) <a href="https://twitter.com/Auth0Lab/status/1513553660034355201?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 11, 2022</a></blockquote>

<p>Auth0 is the leading platform for authentication and authorization for web2 applications and services in retail, publishing, B2B SaaS, and more. We are grateful to have worked with Auth0 and the Auth0 Lab team to bring this integration to life and drive web3-based authentication forward. </p><a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-oidc">  GitHub - spruceid/siwe-oidc: OpenID Connect Identity Provider for Sign-In with Ethereum.  OpenID Connect Identity Provider for Sign-In with Ethereum. - GitHub - spruceid/siwe-oidc: OpenID Connect Identity Provider for Sign-In with Ethereum.  GitHubspruceid    </a><p>The integration uses our open-source OpenID Connect Identity Provider for Sign-In with Ethereum implementation in Rust. As mentioned in <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/sign-in-with-ethereum-siwe-now-available-on-auth0/">Auth0's blog</a> on the integration, the entire workflow involved can be seen in this activity diagram: </p><p>Aside from just authenticating users, the workflow also can tap into relevant blockchain data to enhance the session, such as resolving a user's ENS name and avatar. A number of wallets are natively supported in the integration, including MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and more via WalletConnect.</p><p>Instructions on how to set up the integration in your Auth0 application can be found here:</p><a href="https://auth0.com/blog/sign-in-with-ethereum-siwe-now-available-on-auth0/">  Sign In With Ethereum (SIWE), Now Available on Auth0  Marketplace partner Spruce has expanded the Auth0 platform to use web3 wallets as an identity source.  Auth0 - BlogSamuel Frank    </a> Example Application <p>Additionally, we've built an example application to show off the authentication flow which can be found <a href="https://auth0-demo.login.xyz/#/">here</a>. The example features a mock NFT gallery website where users can Sign-In with Ethereum, and their NFT holdings are resolved via the OpenSea API once authenticated. </p>\<p>After hitting the login button, users are redirected to the Auth0 flow and Sign-In with Ethereum using the provided interface.

 Problem <p>Recently we took on a challenge to create a solution for our Analysts who needed to perform a manual action as part of a traceability process. They needed to verify a user-submitted security code against a UK government database to prove a person’s right to work. Then, they needed to take a screenshot to keep a record of it. Considering our requirements we needed to control and automate the screenshot functionality in our application.</p> Solution <p>Browser screenshot tool.</p><p>The answer to the problem was to build a simple tool to take screenshots within the browser. But how? MediaStream API to the&nbsp;rescue!</p><p>What we did consisted of streaming one tab content to another tab video element and capturing one frame of the stream, turning it into an image, and sending the image to the&nbsp;server.</p><p>Let us first take a look at what the MediaStream API is and which parts we needed to build our solution.</p> MediaStream API <p>MediaStream API provides the interfaces and methods for working with streams and their tracks. It is related to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API">WebRTC</a> which provides support for streaming audio and video&nbsp;data.</p><p>Of all the interfaces that make up the MediaStream API we used the MediaDevices and MediaStream interfaces.</p> MediaDevices <p>From MDN Web&nbsp;Docs:</p><blockquote>The MediaDevices interface provides access to connected media input devices like cameras and microphones, as well as screen sharing. In essence, it lets you obtain access to any hardware source of media&nbsp;data.</blockquote><p>The media input we are interested in the screenshot tool is the screen sharing one, so we can obtain its media content and get an image from it. This interface has several methods that we can call to prompt the user to select a display, portion of a display (such as a window or tab), or turn on the camera and/or microphone providing a MediaStream object containing the media&nbsp;data.</p> MediaStream <p>From MDN Web&nbsp;Docs:</p><blockquote>The MediaStream interface represents a stream of media content. A stream consists of several tracks, such as video or audio tracks. Each track is specified as an instance of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack">MediaStreamTrack</a>.</blockquote><p>The MediaStream will contain the content of the stream, we will use it to feed the video element, get a frame, and convert it to the final image we&nbsp;want.</p> Tool Example <p>The simple sample tool we built has three main pieces, the react screenshot tool component and two main methods, one to set up the preview of the image and one to capture an image from the&nbsp;preview.</p> ScreenshotTool <p>The main component ScreenshotTool is fairly small, it has two buttons, one to start the image preview and one to capture the image in the preview element. To show the streaming content we have a video HTML element and to show the image captured we have an img&nbsp;element.</p> ImagePreview <p>ImagePreview is one of the two main functions. It is called when the user clicks on the Preview&nbsp;button.</p><p>It takes as an argument a reference to the video element that is used to set its source object with the MediaStream object that we get from calling the getDisplayMedia() and after selecting the tab or window we want to stream. By doing this the video HTML element starts to show the content of the stream, which in our case will be the content of one of the browser’s tabs.</p> ImageCapture <p>ImageCapture is the function responsible for taking the screenshot we want. In short, it takes a look at the stream content in the video HTML element, grabs a frame, and converts it to a png&nbsp;image.</p><p>We use the getVideoTracks function to get the stream frame, and then we use the frame to generate a png image using a canvas element. Instead of using a canvas element, we tried to use the ImageCapture class and takePhoto function, but it didn’t work because we can’t take photos of muted tracks. For more details take a look <a href="https://github.com/w3c/mediacapture-screen-share/issues/141">here</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/chromium/chromium/blob/master/third_party/blink/renderer/modules/imagecapture/image_capture.cc">here</a>.</p> Demo <p><a href="https://screenshot-browser-demo.netlify.app">Demo App</a></p> Conclusion <p>We can use these amazing interfaces to easily build solutions to our problems that initially may sound a bit complicated but most of the complicated parts are very well implemented and documented. This article shows a very specific problem and solution but I think it is a good, simple, and creative example of what you can build with the MediaStream API.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech/browser-screenshot-tool-with-mediastream-api-97ae79d23afe">Browser screenshot tool with MediaStream API</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech">Onfido Product and Tech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Dr. Angelika Steinacker</a></p><p>Women in Identity (WID) is a global organization with a vision to develop identity solutions for everyone by everyone. It was founded in 2018 by a handful of women and has grown to more than 2000 members in 32 countries. We believe that diverse teams create better solutions, and each of us works with the identity industry to achieve this.</p>
<p>Thanks to the KuppingerCole team who has supported WID from the beginning, we are able to host a WID Get-Together at EIC 2022 on May 12 from 16:30-17:30 followed by a track. The local WID DACH team has been working hard to put together an interesting program for everyone which shows the diversity of our work. Angelika, Silvia, and Irene will (re-)present the results.</p>
<p>Angelika joined WID in 2018 and is WID ambassador for DACH. She has worked in security and identity all her professional life and is still passionate about it.</p>
<p>Based on various studies and research, as well as her own experiences, she will talk about the challenges women face in the security and identity industry. When she started in the IT industry in the Mid-1980s, there were not many women. It was the early days of the commercial security industry, and the situation there was no better. One might have expected the situation to improve over the last 30 years. But it doesn't look that way. Currently, about 20% - 25% of IT workers are women, a steady decline since the late 1980s. What are the main reasons for this? Are there differences between countries and regions that we can learn from to address these reasons? And/or are there differences in education, work environment, recognition, and perception of women in society that attract more - or less - women to the IT and security industry? That's what we want to talk about in this session.</p>
<p>Silvia is a WID member since 2018 and started her career as an Identity engineer. Her topic will be the misbehavior of your digital twin and what you can do if your digital twin misbehaves.</p>
<p>Originating from a virtual model reflecting a physical object, the term “digital twin” also has its application in the cyber security industry. Social media giants and the advertisement industry have a huge interest in modeling your behavior, feelings, and thoughts to tailor advertising to you.</p>
<p>This does not only pose a serious data security threat, but this data mass in the wrong hands can also be very critical. Casting an eye on threats from digital twins, we will look at challenges and opportunities from a cyber security perspective. Which other company assets can be modeled as digital twins and how can enterprises capitalize on this information? How can a digital twin contribute to the future of offensive and defensive security? These questions will be addressed in this presentation.</p>
<p>Irene recently joined the WID DACH team. She is part of the Berlin pioneer start-up Jolocom, which she joined in late 2019. At Jolocom the focus is on building Self-sovereign Identity (SSI) solutions for end-users and organizations alike. Her background is in law, linguistics, and economics.</p>
<p>During her session, Irene will give an overview of the state of play of SSI. Where is it at currently? Where is it not (yet)? While both governments and regulators have started to support the idea of handling digital identities in a decentralized manner and are funding a series of pilot projects worldwide, this implementation and deployment phase we are in also shows us what is still to be done and where the next challenges are arising - in governance models, standards development, and interoperability, as well as stakeholder communication. So, quo vadis SSI? Join this session to find out and learn about the most recent developments and challenges of implementing SSI in Europe.</p>

				   Indicio’s Trusted Digital Ecosystems answer President Biden’s call for “trust in the global digital ecosystem”   
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By James Schulte </p>
<p>The Biden administration, in coordination with 60 other countries, on Thursday unveiled a “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/28/fact-sheet-united-states-and-60-global-partners-launch-declaration-for-the-future-of-the-internet/">Declaration for the Future of the Internet</a>” that “reclaims the promise of the Internet in the face of the global opportunities and challenges presented by the 21st century.”</p>
<p>The declaration outlines principles and commitments to, among other things, “Promote trust in the global digital ecosystem, including through protection of privacy,” and it goes on to say the “United States and partners will work together to promote this vision and its principles globally, while respecting each other’s regulatory autonomy within our own jurisdictions and in accordance with our respective domestic laws and international legal obligations.”</p>
<p>President Biden’s request for a global digital ecosystem to reinforce safety as the world increasingly relies on an “open, free, global, interoperable, reliable, and secure Internet” isn’t far-fetched. It’s ready and accessible today through using decentralized identity and verifiable digital credentials to build Trusted Digital Ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Trusted Digital Ecosystem is a complete system for proving the authenticity of digital information in a privacy-preserving way; it can interoperate between countries, organizations, companies, people, and machines; and it is lightweight enough to slide over and sit on top of existing digital identity and access systems to add the verification, privacy, and security elements that are needed to interact with each other online in a trusted way.</p>
<p>Solving for Trust<br>The fundamental question Indicio has been working to answer for the past two years is: how can we trust digital data?</p>
<p>As the declaration notes, the problem of digital trust is now endemic to life because all our information is digital and we are (almost) all and always online. The very efficiency of digital communication has created an expensive, existential crisis—one costing us a fortune in mitigation, poor user experience, fraud, theft, and missed opportunity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These problems have four dimensions:</p>
<p>One, Verification: How do you encode digital information with authenticity? Information must be able to show, definitively, that it came from the source it says it came from and that it hasn’t been altered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two, Regulation:&nbsp; Compliance and privacy laws have expanded to meet public and political concerns. They’re not going away. Digital identity and access systems must mitigate these risks to minimize their complexity and cost to business and organizations.</p>
<p>Three, Security: One trillion dollars. That’s the estimated cost of cyber insecurity. “Never trust, always verify” now defines the dominant paradigm in cybersecurity: zero-trust. Digital information must be continuously verified as authentic and unaltered.</p>
<p>Four, Resilience: A technology that solves all these problems cannot manifest in a single point of failure whether that is a single database or a single company.</p>
<p>Trusted Digital Ecosystems using decentralized identity technology solve all four problems.</p>
<p>One, Verification: Verifiable credentials anchored to a distributed ledger are able to definitively prove the source of information and that the information hasn’t been altered. They make data immediately actionable.</p>
<p>Two, Regulation: Verifiable credentials allow information to be held by the owner of the information and shared by consent and without the need for third party storage or management. Communications protocols are peer-to-peer. No more GDPR headaches.</p>
<p>Three, Security: Verifiable credentials make the continuous verification needed by <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">zero trust</a> security frictionless. Say goodbye to personal accounts, passwords, logins—all the broken machinery of centralized identity management.</p>
<p>Four, Resilience: Decentralized identifiers and distributed ledgers mean resilient systems. If centralized and federated identity systems go down, it’s like someone shut off the access equivalent to the power grid. Plus, all this technology is open source—it means constant reliability testing and constant, sustainable innovation. It’s also easy to integrate into existing systems and it’s easy to use because resilience also means making adoption and daily use as simple as possible.</p>
<p>Build Trust Now<br>We built out decentralized identity technology into Trusted Digital Ecosystems to meet customer needs. We specialize in solutions for finance, health, IoT, and travel. And, we’ve just closed an <a href="https://apnews.com/press-release/accesswire/technology-business-4dbf651613d76693bc479321f7b041f5">oversubscribed seed round</a>. We’ve moved from solving the four problems to implementing solutions to scale.</p>
<p>The White House statement on the future of the internet isn’t a lofty goal for us; it’s what we’re building every day for companies and organizations.</p>
<p>The future is being made now—so why not <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">tell us</a> how we can make it work for you?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kelsie Nabben, Researcher, <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/">RMIT</a> on Data Trusts, DAOs and use cases of the Data Economy in&nbsp;DAOs</p><p>In this episode of Voices of the Data Economy, we spoke to<a href="https://twitter.com/kelsiemvn"> Kelsie Nabben.</a> She is a researcher in decentralized technology communities. Kelsie is interested in the human outcomes of digital infrastructure, blockchain community culture, and algorithmic governance. She has written various research papers on this topic, the recent one being Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) as data&nbsp;trusts.</p><p>Kelsie is a recipient of a PhD scholarship at the RMIT University Centre of Excellence for Automated Decision-Making &amp; Society and a researcher in the Digital Ethnography Research Centre and Blockchain Innovation Hub. In this chat, we spoke about how principles of data trusts might apply to DAOs as a data governance structure. We also questioned decentralized data ownership, storage, and utilization.</p><p>Here are edited excerpts of the podcast interview:</p><p>How do algorithms work in&nbsp;DAOs?</p><p>In this podcast, we have discussed the non-transparent ways in which <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/voices-of-the-data-economy-safiya-noble-search-engines-b3729568807c">Algorithms operate primarily in Web2.</a> How do they operate in Web3 or peer-to-peer open-source, decentralized, encrypted technologies? Web3 is here to make the rules of governance or the algorithms involved in governance processes semi-transparent or rather fully transparent. Open-source software in the decentralized technology space, such as public blockchains, means that anyone can go and read the smart contracts that have rules encoded in them. However, not everyone is literate in that and not everyone is a software coder. You have digital economies as more and more interactions are mediated by digital technologies. Writing code is synonymous with making policies or setting rules of governance. This makes the role of engineers in these systems, even more, important and responsible. <a href="https://kelsienabben.substack.com/p/algorithms-as-policy?s=r">Read this article on Algorithms as policy for a detailed overview.</a></p><p>Blockchain communities have been influenced by the ideologies of early cypherpunks. The idea in Bitcoin, which is the first blockchain-based cryptocurrency, was that software code is immutable i.e, it should be designed so it can’t be co-opted by a monopoly or dictator. This has influenced how blockchain communities approach algorithms. There was strong debate, for example, on whether the algorithm could be questioned, and the rules of the system could be&nbsp;changed.</p><p>However, algorithms save us from Sybil attacks where people pretend to create multiple fake identities in a DAO as they try to game the system. Such attacks can be avoided by algorithms that are used for quadratic funding.</p><p>Data trusts used as a governance tool for&nbsp;DAOs</p><p>We have discussed d<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/voices-of-data-economy-anouk-ruhaak-data-trusts-8240426c2ecf">ata trusts in Episode 3</a> of Voices of the Data Economy earlier. Data trusts are a relatively new concept, predicated on participatory, democratic, cooperative governance structures whereby a legal entity acts as an independent fiduciary steward of data. Data trusts are data governance and utilization structures that allow individuals to state their aspirations for data use and mandate a trustee to represent those interests through the legal mechanism of&nbsp;trusts.</p><blockquote>“A data trust aims to return power to individuals regarding the use of their data through collective pooling and then appointment and stewardship of that data. Data trusts can continue to steward, maintain, and manage how data is used and shared, including access, who gets to define those terms, and penalties for misbehaviour. Scholars envision an “ecosystem” of data trusts with different rules and risk profiles so that individuals can choose and change how their data is utilized for public good purposes or financial returns”</blockquote><p>A drawback of data trusts as a legal structure is that there are no strong guarantees about enforceability. So when you rely on the law and you entrust your data to a person if that person then goes and sells it to third parties that you didn’t authorize, or the data gets hacked, or it gets duplicated, you could maybe sue that person but that data is gone or replicated or shared or mined&nbsp;forever.</p><blockquote>“That is why I connected this concept to DAOs. The code is law in the DAO; in the blockchain ethos. So what does it mean to have enforceability around how data is governed through smart contracts and DAO governance rather than relying on traditional nation-state legal systems for&nbsp;that?”</blockquote><p>It’s an open field in terms of how people are going to use these composable modules and how they’re going to combine DAOs with storage or streams of data or data marketplaces.</p><blockquote>“I think they can play together to try to create opportunities for data to work for people. Another train of thought is that data should just never be monetized — but that’s maybe a challenging stretch from where we are in terms of the digital economy.”</blockquote><p>Uses cases of Data trusts&nbsp;DAOs</p><p>Think of DAOs as data trusts, as an infrastructure; one of the most interesting components will be around that arbitration and enforcement mechanism.</p><blockquote>“As I mentioned earlier, if you don’t need to rely on the law but rely on the code-based system, what does that actually look like? I think decentralized codes are still in their early days in and it’s fascinating to see communities either implement them or develop their&nbsp;own.”</blockquote><p>DAOs as data trusts hold data that can be applied to short and long-term use cases. They might also donate to medical research, monetize creative expressions, or solve complicated problems in a crisis. Some projects are already exploring this idea, referring to the possible governance structure of these models as data coops or data&nbsp;unions.</p><p>Kelsie also refers to the use case of Ocean Protocol in detail in her paper. She mentioned that Ocean is pioneering the idea of “Compute-to-Data”, whereby algorithms and compute jobs are matched in a marketplace to buy and sell data without exposing the content of that data to preserve privacy. Computation occurs without the data leaving the premises of the data holder, for privacy-preserving analytics, AI modelling, and&nbsp;more.</p><blockquote>“Just as data trusts are one component of governance, which is interdependent on policies, politics, rights, other infrastructure, economics, and more, data DAOs are one approach to structuring data governance through DAO infrastructure. This paper presents generous scope for further research into the contexts in which DAOs are a suitable governance framework for data, DeFi for data, novel cryptography and privacy preservation mechanisms, and development of the technical architecture for real-world sandboxes for functional decentralized data governance ecosystems,” says Kelsie regarding her views on the&nbsp;paper.</blockquote><p>Here is a list of the selected time stamps on the different topics discussed during the&nbsp;podcast:</p>  1.46- 6.40: What got Kelsie interested in DAOs and digital economies?  6.40- 9.42: How do algorithms work in&nbsp;DAOs?  9.42- 14.11: What are data trusts and what is the legal structure of data&nbsp;trusts?  14.11- 17.55: Drawbacks of data trust&nbsp;DAOs  17.55–20.44: Views on data monetization and data&nbsp;economy  20.44- 24.34: Use cases of data trust&nbsp;DAOs  24.34- 30.43: Why DAOs could survive? Why DAOs could&nbsp;fail?  30.43- 41.11: The level playing field in&nbsp;DAOs  41.11- 46.50: Research methods used by&nbsp;Kelsie  46.50- end: Conclusion and what’s next with&nbsp;DAOs?   <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/demystifying-data-trusts-as-daos-in-the-data-economy-a9386b57ae86">Demystifying Data Trusts as DAOs in the Data Economy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>30th April might not seem a particularly significant day but, for Ubisecure, 30th April 2002 marked the start of our journey. It was the day that the brainchild of Charles Sederholm and Petteri Stenius took shape. Our name is derived from a concatenation of “Ubiquitous Security”, and that ubiquitous approach and early vision has stood us in good stead.</p>
<p>Today, 20 years later, we have grown far beyond those early beginnings to become a leading European digital identity expert and the world #1 organisation identity provider. We’ve been involved in a number of ground-breaking projects over that time, and certainly there are many more to come.</p>
 Key projects from Ubisecure’s journey so far 
<p>In 2008, we delivered the core Identity and Access Management (IAM) system that powered the Finnish <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/delegated-id-success-story-finnish-government.pdf" title="Katso platform">Katso platform</a>, providing national level authorisation through delegation between individuals and organisations. Tied to strong individual and organisation identities, the Katso platform revolutionised B2B and B2G interactions, and enabled phenomenal savings for those involved. You can <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/delegated-id-success-story-finnish-government.pdf" title="read our case study here">read our case study here</a> to learn the breadth of capability and depth of saving.</p>
<p>In 2014, we took the next generation of that platform to DNA Telecom and revolutionised its B2B identity management, providing delegated administration for their business customers. The deployment was recognised internationally and awarded ‘Best B2B Identity Project’ at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/staehler/european-identity-cloud-awards-2015">2015 European Identity and Cloud Awards</a>. <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ubisecure_DNA_case_study.pdf" title="Read the case study here">Read the case study here</a>.</p>
<p>2018 contained a number of significant events for Ubisecure, having been taken private the previous year. Doubling down on our commitment to organisation identity, we became accredited by the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) as a ‘Local Operating Unit’ – more commonly known as an LEI issuer. Our experience with Katso had confirmed the value of combining strong individual identity with strong organisation identity and the LEI provides the required global steppingstone to ubiquitous strong organisation identity.</p>
<p>2018 was also the year we secured Series A funding from Octopus Investments to expand our capabilities across the Nordics and beyond. Octopus have been a great partner in our growth journey, bringing a strong corporate development drive and effective corporate governance models.</p>
<p>2019 saw growing success with Telia Company winning the <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/stories/eic-award-telia-company/" title="Best Consumer Identity Project">Best Consumer Identity Project</a> award for their use of our platform at the core of their Identity Broker Service. <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Telia-Identification-Broker-Service-Ubisecure-Case-Study.pdf" title="Read the case study here.">Read the case study here.</a></p>
<p>2020 saw Ubisecure taking the global #1 position as issuer of new LEIs, passing Bloomberg and then GMEI in early 2020. We have maintained this #1 consistently since, and in March 2022 issued 1 in 4 new validated LEIs globally. Today we are helping global organisations manage their customer bases, enhance their KYC processes, and access the $4B annual saving potential identified by <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/mckinsey-company-and-gleif-leis-and-client-lifecycle-management-in-banking-a-u-s-4-billion-beginning">McKinsey</a>. 2020 was also the year we launched IDaaS (Identity-as-a-Service) – our IAM as a managed service solution for organisations needing to deploy IAM capabilities quickly via a cloud or hybrid approach.</p>
<p>2021 saw us announce support for vLEI, a verifiable credential based on the LEI. We expect the vLEI to be at the centre of next generation organisation identity attribute solutions.</p>
<p>2022 is shaping up to be an interesting year. We are adding significant new capabilities to our IAM solution to improve how IAM supports risk-based authentication and online fraud prevention. We will also be presenting next month at the Gartner IAM Summit in London, where I will be on stage with Telia Company to talk about “How Reusable Digital Identity Will Drive Your Business &amp; Delight Customers”. If you are attending the event, come and <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/gartner-iam-summit-2022/" title="join us">join us</a>.</p>
 
<p></p>
 Where do we go from here? 
<p>Looking forward we see a continued growth plan, commercially and technically. The Katso platform proved the value of combining organisation and individual identity; now with LEIs we have the ability to deliver those proven savings globally. We see growing usage of Verifiable Credentials (VC) and we are working hard to ensure all the knowledge and business benefits we have realised in the classical identity domain can be transitioned to the upcoming VC based identity world.</p>
<p>Of course, none of this would be possible without the fantastic Ubisecure team. All aspects of our business are blessed with dedicated, hardworking individuals who together have shaped where we are today, and where we will be tomorrow.</p>
<p>We are in the midst of an exciting journey. It’s hard to predict what the next 20 years will hold instore for us, but we are looking to grow our teams.

<p>BEP2, BEP20, ERC20. These are what we call token standards, that is, a set of rules that a token must follow in order to be issued with the corresponding blockchain. For the 3 token standards mentioned:</p>



<p>BEP2 tokens are issued on the Binance Beacon Chain.</p>



<p>BEP20 tokens are issued on the BNB Chain.</p>



<p>ERC20 tokens are issued on the Ethereum Chain.</p>



<p>ShareToken exists across multiple blockchains, namely ShareLedger, Ethereum, and the Binance Beacon Chain. This has over the years given us and our users more flexibility, and to continue this trajectory we have decided to issue BEP20-SHR.</p>



<p><a href="https://sharering.network/shr-bep2-to-bep20-cross-chain-swap/">See article: $SHR – BEP2 to BEP20 Cross Chain Swap LIVE NOW!</a></p>



<p>Why BEP20 and BNB Chain?</p>



<p>BNB Chain was designed to be compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), and as such BEP20 tokens would have increased versatility when interacting with the growing number of DApps across the chain.</p>



<p>Another key benefit of BEP20 is the gas fees, which is significantly cheaper in comparison to Ethereum. An average transaction using BEP20 tokens would likely cost no more than a few cents. In comparison, the average ERC20 token transfer gas fee was slightly over $100USD at the start of 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>BEP20 transactions are also much faster when compared to ERC20 transactions. Though individual transaction speeds may vary depending on various factors, the average block verification times on BSC are 3 seconds, and close to 15 seconds for Ethereum (1.0).</p>



<p>What does this mean for ShareToken?</p>



<p>For one, those who hold BEP2 tokens are now able to swap their $SHR holdings into BEP20 via Binance Wallet. Once you obtain your BEP20, you have the option of going onto PancakeSwap to add liquidity into the SHR-BNB pool.</p>



<p>We are planning a cross chain swap direct between BEP20-SHR and SLP3-SHR. In the meantime we are waiting for the cross chain bridge approval for BEP20-SHR into ERC20-SHR. Once this bridge is live, users can then follow the <a href="https://sharering.network/sharering-swap-user-manual/">Swapping Manual instructions</a> to swap their ERC20-SHR into SLP3-SHR, and stake inside the ShareRing App.</p>

				 <p>By Heather Dahl</p>
<p>It was a race toward the next big thing—except it felt like everyone was jogging in circles. All of the&nbsp; talk was about decentralized identity solving all the big online problems—verification, privacy, security—but where were the solutions? We had been talking and jogging for years and the finish line for the technology wasn’t getting closer.</p>
<p>It was time to up the pace, to lead a group of talented, like-minded individuals—and to get the technology to a stage where enterprises and organizations could start implementing working solutions. That was the sense of opportunity and need that drove the creation of Indicio two years ago.</p>
<p>There was a lot to do. It would have been overwhelming if we hadn’t broken it down into a roadmap of small steps, each building on the other, each extending the technology, each adding a community of builders, each bringing more customers and collaborators into the mix, and all feeding a virtuous cycle of innovation and growth.</p>
<p>The initial investment was conservative; but customer revenue was instant and scale was rapid. We focused on building solutions, starting with our customers’ simplest problems and use cases. And when those solutions worked, and our customers saw what the technology could deliver, they asked for more and to deliver new features; they began to think of new applications and opportunities.</p>
<p>The success of decentralized identity technology lay in each of our customers being successful. Each successful customer deployment was a victory, each advanced the technology, and each created new opportunities.</p>
<p>This was our strategy: the more we built solutions, the more customers we’d have, and the more they’d ask us to do. It worked; indeed, the investment community liked this strategy so much, our seed round ended up oversubscribed.</p>
<p>Actionable data now</p>
<p>Normally, a startup would use a seed round to launch a business; but we were already up and running: we had customers, products, and services. That’s what excited our investors: if we had come so far on so little, how much faster would we go with more?</p>
<p>Well, we’re excited too. We’ve completed what we set out to do two years ago: finish the technology’s foundation and create a full, open source ecosystem around it. You can issue, share, and verify data through verifiable digital credentials today. You can layer this on top of your existing identity and access management systems now.</p>
<p>We’ve also developed machine-readable governance to simplify managing complex information flows and governance processes offline and in ways that meet the needs of regulatory authorities. Governance for decentralized identity has often been a sticking point in the marketplace because it reads like a bigger problem than the problem decentralized identity is supposed to solve. Not any more.</p>
<p>Even the language around this technology has shifted to resonate with what the market understands and needs. It’s not just about engineers talking to engineers anymore; it’s about the value we create in trusted digital interaction, the efficiencies that come with verification, and the protean capacity of the communication protocols to manage this interaction in new, secure ways; it’s about actionable data and digital relationships.</p>
<p>In short, we’ve made it easy and cost-effective to begin a powerful process of digital transformation that creates trust. These flexible, customizable “Trusted Digital Ecosystems” can be deployed rapidly by being layered on top of your existing identity systems. This means creating digital transformation in weeks rather than years. They are easy—surprisingly easy—to use. They deliver value fast and set you up to manage the wider digital change of coming with web 3 and the spatial web.</p>
<p>Creating magic</p>
<p>In many ways, closing this seed round is the end of the beginning, we’ve warmed up for the real race and we’re going to run it fast. Because we now have the foundational interoperable framework to drive use and adoption of verifiable credentials and decentralized identity, we can start demonstrating the real power behind this technology to businesses, governments, and organizations.</p>
<p>History&nbsp; has shown that with a small set of robust, interoperable components, you can create magic. And that’s what we’re going to do with this seed investment.</p>
<p>Finally, none of this would be possible without a stellar team all pulling together.&nbsp; Our architects and engineers are at the top of their game because the business side is at the top of its game. It means our passion and expertise are in sync. It means we approach problems and build solutions holistically.</p>
<p>The result is that people like working with us. We make their needs ours, we give them everything, and together we get things done.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Andrea Beskers</a></p><p>Everybody wants the benefits of biometric authentication but nobody wants to pay the potential privacy price. What is the risk for individuals and society at large? To address these challenges Mike Kiser, Director, Strategy and Standards at SailPoint, is giving a keynote speech <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5044">New Face, Who Dis? Privacy vs Authentication in a World of Surveillance</a> on Tuesday, May 10, at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2022">European Identity and Cloud Conference 2022</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Mike some questions about his presentation.</p>
<p> </p>
 Your talk describes a tension in how facial recognition is used: authentication vs privacy concerns. Can you give a high-level description of this split? 
<p>Sure. Facial recognition technology is like a lot of technology. It's neither moral nor immoral in and of itself, right? But it depends on how it's used. Really, there are two sides to this kind of technology that often depends on machine learning underpinning. It could provide a means of authentication, preferably on a locked-down secure device, maybe in a secure enclave. In that case, it gives kind of a one-to-one match of a person, to an identity and a pretty great form of biometric authentication and opens up new opportunities, new markets. And I'll talk about that in my session. The flip side is the one to end matching, and by that I mean more what people think of maybe when they think of facial recognition, picking an individual out of a crowd or identifying you if you're walking through a shopping center or an airport or some other kind of surveillance type of scenario, especially with some of the technology and the flaws underlying it, these can be problematic. And so there is tension between like a lot of technologies making things easier for us to use and more secure, and then having a side that, if it's misused or abused, can be dangerous, particularly for particular populations.</p>
 Various providers have halted or abandoned facial recognition research and products over the past few years. Does that mean that research into this technology is too problematic from an ethical perspective?&nbsp; 
<p>Like I said, technology is not necessarily moral or immoral, but it's how we use it. And like a lot of these new burgeoning rapidly developing ideas, we're kind of outstripping the thoughts about how it could be used. And so part of this is, you know, needing an IRB (Institutional review board) to oversight some of these projects. Another interesting split is a solution versus a toolset development. What I mean is if you are a vendor developing a solution for a particular use case like authentication, for instance, it can be somewhat... have some boundaries around it to make sure it's only doing what you intended it to do. If, however, you're providing technology, that's a different thing entirely because you're not really sure how that componentry will be embedded in other systems. And so there's an interesting usage and deployment ethics that are involved here as well. So I don't know if it's too problematic in and of itself, but like just about anything from facial recognition all the way back to say fire can be used for a good purpose or an evil purpose.</p>
 Do you believe that the public at large – particularly the younger generation – is actually concerned about their biometric privacy?&nbsp; 
<p>I think that yes, I think that a lot of people are concerned with their biometric privacy, including younger generations, who are much more accustomed to having their faces out there, their biometric information out there. I've done some research, I have a mobile app I've developed to kind of demonstrate some of the ways to potentially get around some of this with some adversarial research. And no one says, I don't want that. No, they all say, Yes, I expect to have a right to privacy independent almost of their actions. And so everyone wants it. But the question is, what's the cost and how are you going to define harm for individuals and for society at large? So those are kind of open-ended, huge questions that are worth discussing.</p>
 Is it "too late" for securing biometrics – particularly in a generation of "selfies" (aren't most people's photos and faces already out there?)&nbsp; 
<p>Yes and no. Oddly, in my research, I discovered that if you really want to hide yourself, the best way to do that is to actually put yourself in stock photography, because then you're everywhere and nowhere at the same time. People have a hard time figuring out who the real you is. That said, there are lots of photos out there with people tagged in it, and so there may be problems in hiding your facial biometric. But that said, there are still use cases that some of this adversarial research can address. Think about it. If you can identify someone and you can identify their location, that's also a dangerous use case. So if you think of stalkerware or people pursuing other people, it's not about foolproof prevention. Even if you didn't have any photos out there at all, some of these techniques you shouldn't rely on to always protect your biometrics, it's always a defensive depth chart approach. But the idea is more to keep the discussion going, show the path forward and advance the good uses of this technology and a community approach.</p>
 What is the one thing you would like people to take away from EIC? 
<p>The one thing I would like people to take away from EIC is that there's always something more to learn. Always some boundary to push, always some new tool, new approach that we haven't thought of. And the way to do that is in community because we learn from each other. And that gives us boundary checks on new ideas and new technology to make sure that we haven't forgotten some of the boundary cases or potential side effects that we wouldn't have thought of if we were acting on our own. So learn new things together.</p>

<p>Many tasks and services are becoming digital these days. Across industries, more and more happens online, and automation continues to replace manual processes. This has special relevance in financial services. Automation of KYC through eKYC is not only making processes faster and safer, it is also improving the customer experience. As regulators trust more eKYC methods and permit further use, its potential continues to grow.</p>



 What is KYC? 



<p>A quick recap on KYC is helpful before we look at eKYC. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">“Know your Customer,“ or KYC</a>, is the process of verifying the identity of customers. It is about knowing and trusting the identity of a customer and their financial transactions. KYC protects the financial institution, its customers and wider markets from fraud, money laundering or other financial crime.</p>



<p>KYC takes place whilst onboarding a new customer, but it also has an important ongoing element throughout the customer relationship.</p>



 What is eKYC? 



<p>There has been a rapid increase in digitalization in most industries over recent years. <a href="https://www.deepdyve.com/lp/unpaywall/global-banking-transformation-innovation-competition-m1DYXcG1Qi">Banking and financial services have been at the forefront of this</a>, with more customer interaction and other processes moving online.</p>



<p>In general, eKYC refers to the digitalization and automated conception of KYC processes. It is the digital and remote transposition of traditional KYC processes – automated, online and paperless.</p>



 Transitioning to a digital KYC process 



<p>Many areas of banking and finance have become digitalized in recent years. More customers open accounts online, and more services are offered digitally. There is less need than ever before for customers to visit physical bank branches. The COVID pandemic has accelerated a transformation that was already well underway. A <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/how-covid-19-has-pushed-companies-over-the-technology-tipping-point-and-transformed-business-forever">study by McKinsey</a> suggests that companies are now seven years ahead in digital transformation post-pandemic.</p>



<p>This digitization of services applies to many different areas. Many of these seemed difficult to digitize not that long ago. Improvements in technology, artificial intelligence and connections have made so much more possible.</p>



<p>KYC is a leading one of these areas. Previously, to onboard a new customer and open an account, the customer would need to present physical identity documents and other evidence at a branch location. The first stages of eKYC saw this process move online.</p>



<p>Digitalization has gone even further since then. eKYC now refers to the full digitization of the KYC process. This includes not just paperless customer onboarding and checking of identity, but ongoing KYC and AML monitoring, and more advanced techniques such as digital signatures.</p>



<p>Regulation has been key to the expansion of eKYC. KYC is a highly regulated area, and financial institutions are limited by law and regulations in what process they can use. Techniques such as video and biometric verification, and the use of electronic signatures, are increasingly being accepted by regulators. Moreover, the acceptance shows the increased trust placed in eKYC and its ability to deliver more secure KYC.</p>



 The benefits of eKYC 



<p>Faster processes. Anything that becomes automated and digital usually becomes faster. This is a key benefit of KYC – onboarding and verification of customers with eKYC can take place in minutes rather than days or even weeks when handled manually.</p>



<p>Improved customer experience. Verifying customers in real-time <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ekyc-europe-regulation-customer-experience/">is great for the customer experience</a>. Financial institutions want customers to be able to access products and services as quickly as possible, and the customer wants an easy and friction-free experience, but still robust and secure. A <a href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/press-releases/2016/may/thomson-reuters-2016-know-your-customer-surveys.html">Thomas Reuters survey</a> found that 89% of corporate customers had a bad experience with KYC processes – to the point that 13% changed banks.</p>



<p>Improved conversion rates. Ultimately, faster and improved experiences lead to an increase in the conversion rate of customers – a vital measure for any financial institution.</p>



<p>More secure KYC. As well as fast, eKYC is also secure. It meets or exceeds the security of traditional manual processes and follows all relevant regulations, including AMLD and eIDAS. The increasing acceptance of eKYC by regulators is evidence of this.</p>



<p>Flexible and adaptable processes. As regulations change or technology improves, eKYC processes and workflows can be easily adapted. Many eKYC platforms are modular, allowing the simple integration of additional functionality.</p>



 What does an eKYC process look like? 



<p>The eKYC process is the digital transposition of the traditional manual KYC process. It is fast – with verification taking minutes rather than days or weeks. It is also seamless for the customer, with verification taking place in real-time. This keeps customers engaged and leads to a much-improved conversion rate.</p>



<p>Processes make use of several different technologies and verification methods. These will appear seamless to the customer, but be automated and well-built into the process. Techniques used include video-based identification, biometrics, and the reading of NFC cards.</p>



 What are the use cases of eKYC? 



<p>eKYC replaces standard KYC and can be used throughout the KYC process and the customer relationship. It is used to onboard customers, conduct due diligence, and carry out continued monitoring. This includes the following main use cases or eKYC methods:</p>



<p>Video KYC. This was one of the first eKYC methods to be developed and remains key. Customers can be verified by comparing live video with identity documents, with automatic verification now possible. Where likeness is unclear or regulators require it, manual video-based verification can be used.</p>



<p>Document verification. Capturing and verifying images of identity documents is another use case of eKYC. AI techniques are used to verify the authenticity of several different types of documents.</p>



<p>Digital due diligence. KYC procedures require a risk assessment to be carried out to determine the likelihood of a customer (both individual and corporate) being involved in financial crime or money laundering. While such checks would require lengthy manual searches and document checking in the past, much of this can now be automated through eKYC.</p>



<p>Fraud detection and ongoing monitoring. A final consideration for eKYC is its ongoing involvement in customer monitoring. The “three pillars of KYC” remind us that effective KYC requires not just an initial assessment of a customer, but ongoing monitoring throughout the relationship. With eKYC much of this can be automated. Accounts can be checked, and customers can be regularly monitored against watchlists, PEP and sanction lists.</p>



 







 IDnow and eKYC 



<p>IDnow offers a leading eKYC solution that fully meets KYC and AML requirements in the UK, Europe and elsewhere. It has developed <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent</a> with comprehensive KYC and AML features.</p>



<p>AutoIdent has evolved as technology has advanced, and regulation has expanded. Video-based identity verification has been supplemented by fully automated biometric identity verification. Furthermore, AutoIdent offers automated or hybrid verification as required by regulations in different jurisdictions.</p>



<p>Further solutions have been added to offer increased functionality – all within the single platform. This includes <a href="https://www.idnow.io/aml-screening-monitoring/">KYC and AML screening</a> required under AML regulations, the use of NFC technology, and electronic signatures.</p>

Individuals can now truly own their most important documents and regain control over their data using our technology.</p><p>This didn't show in our design.</p><p>While Dock's development team prepared for a future of decentralization, our design and marketing team embarked on the journey of updating the company's brand.</p><p>The main challenge? Being in the futuristic Web3 space and needing to differentiate ourselves from other blockchain and crypto projects, but keeping in mind that most of our clients are SMEs and large organizations.</p> Imagery That Shouts Trust and Security <p><br>Dock’s primary colors are blue (#0063F7), white (#FFFFFF), and black (#000000).</p><p>Blue is primarily seen and used in corporate logos, making its business connection and more specifically, the technology industry. Blue is seen to reflect loyalty, trust, and stability making it the perfect addition to our primary color pallet. Blue reinforces the trust that people have in technologies linked to Web3 and decentralized identifiers. Unlike Web2 where trust is established solely with central organizations and DIDs built by them, Web3 is open-source where anyone can create their DIDs. Web3 creates an environment where people trust each other because of the code embedded in the protocol, the environment becomes trustless because users with their DIDs trust the protocol. Dock has built that protocol which anyone can trust. Blue stands for the unmatched loyalty to our community and users, and is reflected in the numerous platform updates we have to Dock Certs and the Dock Wallet App, and new feature releases. Taking on board feedback from our users, we ensure to update and maintain Dock Certs to the highest standard.</p><p>All logos hovering on our channels are comprised of black and white. The color black represents sophistication, security, and power. It’s a color that will never go out of style. White, in the business world, signifies a fresh new beginning. The two put together, make the perfect duo to represent Dock. Dock serves organizations into a new beginning in the Web3 world of decentralization and verifiable credentials. We aim to strengthen and future-proof the flow of credentials and data, empowering the individual with control of their own data.</p> A Designer’s Mind in Web3 <p><br>Our new imagery and website scream futuristic technologies - Web3 and Blockchain. The use of blue gradients, 3D styling, and textured backgrounds gives us a unique, vibrant, and suave appearance required for a Web3 pioneer. The new graphics give Dock a trendy new look and conveys creativity and innovation in our technology, which is exactly what Dock has set out to do.</p><p>Just as the Dock Certs product suite and Dock’s Wallet App were built with the community in mind, our new branding now demonstrates the expertise that lies within our team. </p><p>The world is rapidly changing and the old-fashioned transfer of data doesn’t fit the bill anymore. We’ve seen our technology advance organizations' data flows and now our branding will depict these advancements. This strategic redesign will reflect our position as leaders in the Web3, decentralized identities, and verifiable credentials space as we strive to cater Dock Certs and upcoming DID solutions to business and individual needs. </p><p>Our products are already capable of serving the largest of organizations to instantly issue verifiable credentials and we are preparing to complete the full circle where individuals can hold and manage these verifiable credentials on a secure wallet app, and finally providing the tools for individuals and organizations to verify these credentials. </p><p>With a strong product suite, we hope our new brand style encompasses the visual elements of leadership, loyalty, stability, and a company you can trust. Check out Dock’s new website and admire the new graphics.</p>

<p>As you’d be aware, the initial enthusiasm for the internet has been replaced with the sweeping realization that it has evolved in a way that is negative for its users. Big Data analytics technology is being used to commercialize knowledge about user behaviors, and influence and shape those behaviors. Big Tech companies use sophisticated analytic technology to analyze, predict, and manipulate user behavior while profiting at each step.&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2022/02/another-reason-to-use-mysudo-data-breaches-hit-record-high-in-2021/">Data breaches</a>&nbsp;disclose our personal information at a scale never seen before. We say it often: we are in the midst of a&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/how-bad-is-the-global-data-privacy-crisis/">privacy crisis</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Big Tech companies can leverage many sources of information, but perhaps the most important is&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/what-is-digital-exhaust-and-why-does-it-matter/">digital exhaust</a>. This is user-generated data harvested from users’ daily interactions with online sites and services. These interactions include every action users take – Facebook likes, Google searches, tweets, emails, text messages, photos, songs, videos, location and movement, and purchases. What’s more, this digital exhaust spans all aspects of a person’s life – family, community, professional and the deeply personal, such as medical and health – reducing privacy and anonymity right when a person might want them most. Interactions are captured, abstracted, aggregated, packaged, analyzed and sold.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Users are unwittingly even helping Big Tech to correlate their digital exhaust by providing unique personal identifiers every time they give their email address, phone number, or credit card details.</p>



 But there is a solution. 



 The Sudo is a privacy-protecting digital identity 



<p></p>



<p>Anonyome Labs envisions a world where personal data is secure and under the exclusive control of the individual; where people have the tools to create personalized identities that match the context and content they wish to share in particular environments. We believe being private doesn’t mean opting out of online services or hiding from the world. We empower people to determine what information they share, and how, when and with whom they share it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To help protect personal information, Anonyome Labs created the concept of a&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo</a>, a digital identity that users can take into the world and use in place of their&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/14-real-life-examples-of-personal-data-you-definitely-want-to-keep-private-plus-how-to-do-it/">personal information</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Users have found it simple to use digital identities for many scenarios in their daily physical and digital lives. Some digital identities are long lived, while some are short lived. Some users have one digital identity, while others have many digital identities.</p>



Figure 1: The Sudo digital identity.



<p>Digital identities make it easy to&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalization-is-the-most-powerful-data-privacy-strategy/">compartmentalize</a>&nbsp;activities that a user may engage in with different people, services, or applications under a specific identity. This puts the user’s information in their control because it cannot be easily correlated to either their personal identity or their other digital identities.</p>



<p>Digital identities are suitable across a vast array of online and offline scenarios such as dating, shopping, classifieds selling, social networking, and web searching.&nbsp;</p>



 Creating a privacy-protecting digital identity has some very important fundamental characteristics: 



<p></p>



  User Control (Always): Digital identities should be under the user’s control. The user should be able to create them, decide when to use them, and know when they have been used.  Situational Personas: A user should be able to have more than one digital identity. The user can decide at any time which digital identity they want to use.  Secure: Digital identities should be secure, not forgeable, and prevent impersonation by another user.  Easy Device Synchronization: Digital identities should be available to a user on multiple devices and be able to be backed up and restored.  Selectable Disclosure: A user should be able to control what data about their digital identity they disclose to a service.  Deletable: A user should be able to delete their digital identity at any time, including any information on its use and any information associated with it.&nbsp;  



 Through the&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo app</a>, and other partner apps, Anonyome Labs provides digital identities to everyday users so they can go out into the world with enhanced privacy and safety.&nbsp; 



<p><br><br>Next week, in part 2, we’ll explain how to use the Sudo Platform to deliver customer privacy solutions.</p>

 Case study: Gravity digital ID solution enables vulnerable migrants in Kenya to receive consistent healthcare services <p>Since 2019, Gravity has been providing decentralized identity solutions for the Dignified Identities for Cash assistance project (DIGID). The first phase was implemented by KRCS to meet the needs of the vulnerable populations without official IDs to receive cash assistance during covid-19. Over KES 2.1 million (19,000 dollars) were distributed to more than 300 households to address their essential needs.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/gravity-earth/case-study-gravity-digital-id-solution-propels-dignified-identities-in-cash-programing-digid-e527bc55ae43">read more about&nbsp;DIGID</a></p><p>Starting this year, the second phase of the project (DIGID 2) is planned until July to apply the learnings on Digital IDs so far to the migration context in Uganda and Kenya. The aim is to further test the DIGID Platform within a new setting — that of enabling vulnerable migrants to receive healthcare services with the help of verifiable health credentials.</p> Digital ID solutions for healthcare services <p>Digital Identities have been increasingly used in the healthcare sector to record and share patients’ medical and treatment history and ensure consistent care. Inspired by <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Initiative</a>, Gravity’s digital ID solution empowers patients to securely store and share their medical data while providing reliable means for healthcare providers to identify and authenticate patients.</p><p>Gravity’s digital ID solution is based on decentralized identity and blockchain technology, it provides user-centric platforms for data sharing and identity verification, and multiple interfaces for various types of users(smartphone, feature phone, no phone) to achieve an inclusive digital ID ecosystem.</p><p>In the context of healthcare services, Gravity enables patients to create their digital wallets and health service providers to issue verifiable medical credentials to patients’ digital wallets. When the patients go to healthcare service points, their credentials, which contain medical data like treatment history, prescription, and disease records will be verified. The data that has been shared between patients and health service providers are verifiable, accurate, and streamlined.</p>technology structure<p>With Gravity, DIGID 2 is designed to promote dignity for migrants, balancing their needs to reveal critical information about themselves (due to fears or concerns about being identified) and also facilitate their access to healthcare services.</p> Medical credentials for migrants in Kenya: challenges and solutions <p>The digital ID solution for healthcare will be piloted in the Kakuma refugee camp and Kalobeyei integrated settlement. The Kakuma refugee camp is located in north-western Kenya, in the Turkana West sub-county, and was created in 1992 following the arrival of the “Lost Boys of Sudan”. Kalobeyei integrated settlement was created in 2015 to decongest the Kakuma refugee camp and promote self-resilience among the refugees and encourage integration between the host community and the refugees.</p><p>Health care services in Kakuma camp and Kalobeyei integrated settlement are free for both refugees and the host community. However, refugees face unique barriers to accessing free health care such as requirements for documentation before service, continuity of health care, the threat of harassment, and language barriers.</p><p>Currently, the KRCS in Kakuma and Kalobeyei manually processes the health records of patients making it difficult to keep the records of people and track their disease progress. Furthermore, no digital records are issued to patients as they move around even across borders, which affects their continuation of medical&nbsp;plans.</p><p>To overcome the obstacles, Gravity’s digital ID solution helps the KRCS to create digital medical credentials for patients, and enables healthcare providers to track and share their medical&nbsp;records.</p><p>To create a medical credential, KRCS will issue a digital wallet containing the patient’s medical data based on the manually-processed medical card that has been currently used. For patients who have a smartphone, they can directly view and manage their medical credentials on their wallet application; for patients who are equipped with feature phones, they can interact with their credentials via a dedicated USSD menu; for those who don’t have a phone, the medical credentials will be stored in a printed QR&nbsp;code.</p>manually-issued patient&nbsp;card<p>After receiving the medical credential, when the patient goes to a designated health facility operated by the KRCS, their medical credential will be verified. The verifier can check when testing was done, by whom, what medication was prescribed, and what steps for follow-up were recommended.</p><p>Each time when the medical testing or treatment was done, the information will be stored in the same digital wallet. In the future, more issuers and verifiers will be onboarded, for example, the International Rescue Committee, Kakuma Mission Hospital, Ministry of Health, and&nbsp;UNHCR.</p><p>Gravity’s digital ID solution for healthcare will change how patients fundamentally interact with health systems, clinics, pharmacies, medicine delivery networks, and public health organizations.</p><p>The benefits of digital medical credentials are:</p>  For patients: the quality of healthcare and experience will be dramatically improved, and the transferability of care regardless of physical location is also possible. More importantly, patients are able to control personal information data sharing with healthcare providers.  For healthcare providers: the efficiency in care planning and management will be improved, and patients’ data can be easier shared between different hospitals and clinics to keep medical&nbsp;records.

Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>Cointelegraph — “<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-web3-is-redefining-storytelling-for-creators-and-fans-through-nfts">How Web3 is redefining storytelling for creators and fans through&nbsp;NFTs</a>”</p><p>“Web3 has given rise to generative NFTs that allow both fans and creators to tell stories across different mediums. Storytelling is at the heart of everything we do. It serves as the basis of the relationships people have with our characters and eventually becomes an emotional bond that lasts a lifetime. Web3 allows people to actively participate in different ecosystems, which is a huge opportunity.”</p><p>This places demands on our digital identities — we need full ownership of our identity. On this basis, the narratives we create will become part of the digital identity, interwoven to form a complete Web3 “protagonist” image. Now, this digital identity can be created through the Web3 gateway ONTO, and the reputation can be scored through the data on the chain, and then a Web3 identity can be built to participate in various blockchain transactions.</p><p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Andrea Beskers</a></p><p>How can organizations prepare to maintain data privacy while using a multi-tenant cloud, managed service providers, and distributed data center environments?&nbsp;Anil Bhandari from Arcon will elaborate on this challenge in his Keynote<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5034">&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5035">Digital Identity and Privacy: Stories from the Frontline</a> on Tuesday, May 10, at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2022">European Identity and Cloud Conference 2022</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Anil some questions about his presentation.</p>
<p></p>
 What can we expect to learn from your session on Digital Identity and Privacy: Stories from the Frontline? 
<p>Well, I think digital identities have.... let's just take a step back and look at identities which were in the sense like we used to use a passport or we used to use a driving license in the past. And then we had several other ways to identify a person and it could be you and sometimes your credentials, which is a user ID and passwords and you know what to access your applications. I think currently and in the very near future, this is all going to take the shape of a digital identity and probably you may have even different authors when you kind of get yourself on the online platforms, for example, be it Facebook's or be it Google's or be it LinkedIn's. And you may even completely show a different emotion when you're online, considering the fact that you're doing something there. But you may be a completely different person when you're offline or whatever. So what I'm trying to say is that it's a very... I guess the world will have to look at identity very differently in the very near future. And I think just for the sake of calling them, let's call them digital identities, and these digital identities are, of course, connected to something that you're doing, something that you are writing, something that you exposing, something's an emotion, some things are news or you're creating something or you're logging on and you're doing something for your organization, right? So it could be privacy, it could be confidentiality and so many other things put together, right? So I think it's important for us to identify and understand the linkages between a digital author that a person has, whether they exist within an organization, outside an organization, to the content or the data that you create eventually, which would lead to the next question of, you know, what do you do in terms of privacy? Where do you put those controls if at all required? We don't even know if those controls are required in today's world. So what the session would essentially try and cover is some fundamentals and ideas around how do you link them and some stories around, what kind of digital identities and what kind of content could be created, and what has happened to this going forward or what you're seeing today in the market right? So it could be, well, fake news, for example, a very important element in today's time when you see the world being chaotic and especially in Europe, when so many things are happening around, you know, like what is happening around the world. So I think a very important conference. I think EIC continues to be one of the mainstays in Europe when we discuss identities. And I've had the pleasure of being there in the conference for several years now, three or four at least. So I think this topic would be very interesting in terms of some stories that we'll bring to the table and how do you connect and what do you do and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How is the rapid digitization of businesses and utilization of cloud capabilities relevant to digital identities and privacy? 
<p>Well, so all that you did in this physical world before is now shifted to digital assets, which are digital identities, which do not have a home, unfortunately, right? You have got a nice window behind you and a nice house that you're in. Literally, we're all in the cloud today. In fact, almost all critical assets that you have even today is in the cloud. So, for example, I'm not sure if you hold any investments, but if you do, they all happen to be stored somewhere in the cloud or a provider is storing it somewhere, that you have no idea about. Equity shares are in demat form, so they are in digital format. Currencies are likely to be more and more in digital formats. Now, with every piece of technology that you use people are trying to understand and see whether they could use it in the cloud because nobody wants to own assets today. Access versus ownership is one of the most important models, which has come upon the world, right? So everybody wants to access something. They don't want to own it. And with that reality in mind, the cloud is kind of become all-pervasive and likely to see more and more, which means data is likely to be all across different locations, which sometimes you may not even know where it's located. So a connection between identity, privacy, and confidentiality of, I don't know, data is something like water, right? It just keeps flowing and it creates a new set of data. Right. And it takes a different shape and then it breaks itself into multiple pieces. And it's all across the world, which is in the cloud. How do you even reconstruct it, how do you make a sense of it? Forget about protecting it, right? So I think data and cloud become one very critical element for one to look at. And I have no idea how the world is going to look at it in the future. But I think these thoughts are really interesting to discuss and maybe some ideas around what can one do.</p>
<p></p>
 What is the interaction between digital identities and privacy issues and why is it important? 
<p>Well, like I was trying to establish the fact that digital identities are all-pervasive, our data kind of moves with your thoughts and what you construct and how you break them. These storages are all across the world. So the final question would be, and with the GDPR and the like and the compliance is coming up where the government wants to protect your data. At the same time, the government wants all your data, right? So there is this huge governance that somebody puts up where they kind of literally take every piece of data that you have at the same time that is this government wanting to protect. And every government in the world wants to protect the data and make sure that the data does not go out. And they put huge compliances and fines around organizations wanting to do that. And we have this huge set of people trying to innovate tools and technologies and solutions, are trying to protect your machines, trying to protect data on your machines. If one is not able to appropriately link what you have and what meaning does that data have to you. I don't know how to put this, but let's put it this way. I think data security is likely to be contextual in the near future. So for example, you have my telephone number, you have my email ID and you have my address because I happen to be your client, for example, right? Because you've reached out and you happen to be a client and we happen to have a business relationship. Or somebody else has my data, which is the same, which is an email address, telephone number, but the context in which he holds the data and the context in which you hold the data are completely different. Your organization or yourself or your need to protect the data, but some other organization or person may not need to protect the data, right? because he holds it in a different context. So what I'm saying is, while I don't know whether this example would be the best, what I'm saying is that security in the future is no longer to protect a person. It's no longer to protect a machine. It would all be trying to protect the data in the context that which you hold the data, right? So data security is likely to be contextual data security in the future. And I think as we progress further, I'm sure all tools and technologies would start to deep dive and try and reconstruct what you're doing, how you're doing, where to protect, how to protect. And also you're spending millions and billions of dollars trying to protect because you tried to put controls everywhere, identity controls, standard controls for everybody. Machine controls. You've got a standard antivirus, everybody. You've got malware, everybody. All right. But I don't think this is how it's likely to be in the near future, which means one would need to now start understanding the formats, the frameworks, and understand digital assets in the context in which excoriate and finally understand the data and the context in which it's created. So I think contextual data security would become one mainstay in the future.</p>

 What is Elasticsearch? 

<p>At its core, Elasticsearch is a NoSQL analytics database with an extensive JSON-centric REST API used for querying and indexing data. It’s built in Java, on top of <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/">Apache Lucene</a>, providing a scalable and performant search experience.</p>

<p>Over time, Elasticsearch and its ecosystem have evolved dramatically, turning into a set of software components called the Elastic Stack (also known as ELK Stack). This stack includes the Elasticsearch service as the core, Kibana for data visualization and management, and Logstash for processing and indexing data into Elasticsearch.</p>

<p>Elasticsearch and the accompanying Elastic Stack provide solutions for a growing number of use cases, such as the following:</p>
 
   Search services: Whether it’s inside an app or website or across an enterprise’s internal data sets, Elasticsearch can power all kinds of search experiences. 
   Data analytics: Because of its near-real-time data querying and easy data injection, Elasticsearch is suitable for analyzing data from system logs or business operations. 
   Monitoring: Apart from analytics, Elasticsearch is also suitable for all kinds of monitoring, serving as a central hub for different data sources. 
 

 Integrating Elasticsearch with Express 

<p>Before getting started with the app, you’ll first want to ensure you have the following software installed:</p>

   <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">Okta CLI</a> 
 

 Backend setup 

<p>Next, create a new directory for the projects and two folders inside it: frontend and backend. Inside the backend folder, set up a new Express app with the following commands:</p>

   <code>npm init -y
npm install express body-parser express-async-errors express-openid-connect dotenv @elastic/elasticsearch

 Elastic Cloud setup 

<p>When it comes to the setup, Elasticsearch provides two primary options: self-managed or Elastic Cloud. This tutorial will guide you through the setup process for the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/cloud/">Elastic Cloud trial</a>.</p>

<p>Remember that you can always switch to a self-hosted Elasticsearch instance without much effort. For reference, here’s the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html">official guide to installing Elasticsearch on Docker</a>.</p>

<p>To get started, create a new Elastic Cloud account or log in to an existing one.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Inside the dashboard, click Start your free trial and configure a new deployment.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Copy the resulting deployment credentials and put them inside the .elastic.env file inside the backend folder:</p>

   <code>ELASTIC_USERNAME="your-username"
ELASTIC_PASSWORD="your-password"
</code>   

<p>The last detail you need is your deployment’s Cloud ID. To get that, return to your dashboard and go to the deployment settings. You can access the settings by clicking on the cog next to the deployment name under the Elasticsearch Service section.</p>

<p></p>

<p>From there, copy the Cloud ID and paste it into the .elastic.env file as <code>ELASTIC_CLOUD_ID</code>:</p>

   <code>ELASTIC_CLOUD_ID="your-cloud-id"
ELASTIC_USERNAME="your-username"
ELASTIC_PASSWORD="your-password"
</code>   

 Creating the Elasticsearch index 

<p>With the Elastic Cloud credentials in place, create an elastic-client.js file where you’ll initialize the Elasticsearch Node.js client:</p>

   <code>// backend/elastic-client.js
const { Client } = require("@elastic/elasticsearch");

require("dotenv").config({ path: ".elastic.env" });

const elasticClient = new Client({
  cloud: {
    id: process.env.ELASTIC_CLOUD_ID,
  },
  auth: {
    username: process.env.ELASTIC_USERNAME,
    password: process.env.ELASTIC_PASSWORD,
  },
});

module.exports = elasticClient;
</code>   

<p>The script loads the environment variables with <code>dotenv</code> and initializes the client through dedicated <code>cloud</code> and <code>auth</code> properties in its config object.</p>

<p>The initiated client is then exported for use in other files. This includes create-index.js, in which a new posts index for storing sample blog post data is created:</p>

   <code>// backend/create-index.js
const elasticClient = require("./elastic-client");

const createIndex = async (indexName) =&gt; {
  await elasticClient.indices.create({ index: indexName });
  console.log("Index created");
};

createIndex("posts");
</code>   

<p>Running the script with node create-index.js will initiate the index and prepare Elasticsearch for the next steps.</p>

 Creating Express routes 

<p>Start integrating Elasticsearch with Express by creating an index.js file, where you’ll initialize a new Express app:</p>

   <code>// backend/index.js
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const elasticClient = require("./elastic-client");
require("express-async-errors");

const app = express();

app.use(bodyParser.json());

// Express routes

app.listen(8080);
</code>   

<p>The JSON body-parser parses incoming JSON request bodies, while <code>express-async-errors</code> patches Express v4 to automatically handle errors in async code.</p>

<p>The routes themselves will serve as a controlled proxy for the calls to the Elasticsearch REST API. The methods from the Elasticsearch client used here are <code>index()</code>, <code>delete()</code> and <code>search()</code>:</p>

   <code>// ...
app.get("/", (req, res) =&gt; {
  res.redirect("http://localhost:3000/");
});
app.post("/create-post", async (req, res) =&gt; {
  const result = await elasticClient.index({
    index: "posts",
    document: {
      title: req.body.title,
      author: req.body.author,
      content: req.body.content,
    },
  });

  res.send(result);
});
app.delete("/remove-post", async (req, res) =&gt; {
  const result = await elasticClient.delete({
    index: "posts",
    id: req.query.id,
  });

  res.json(result);
});
app.get("/search", async (req, res) =&gt; {
  const result = await elasticClient.search({
    index: "posts",
    query: { fuzzy: { title: req.query.query } },
  });

  res.json(result);
});
app.get("/posts", async (req, res) =&gt; {
  const result = await elasticClient.search({
    index: "posts",
    query: { match_all: {} },
  });

  res.send(result);
});
// ...
</code>   

<p>To operate on the index’s data, the <code>index()</code> method can be used to insert documents, while <code>delete()</code> can remove a document matching a provided ID. Finally, <code>search()</code> is one of the most important and versatile methods of the client, providing tons of options for querying the data.</p>

<p>For this example, only <code>fuzzy</code> matching (matching the term closely rather than exactly to the query) and <code>match_all</code> query parameters are used to search for blog posts by their titles and return all blog posts from the index.</p>

<p>You might have noticed that the root route (<code>/</code>) redirects to port <code>3000</code>—that’s where the frontend will be located.</p>

 Frontend setup 

<p>To see how this backend setup integrates with a modern frontend, let’s create a new React app powered by <a href="https://vitejs.dev/">Vite</a>.</p>

<p>To set up a new Vite project from a template, install necessary dependencies and start the development server. Use the following commands to do so in the project root folder:</p>

   <code>npm create vite frontend -- --template react
cd frontend
npm install
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @faker-js/faker @mui/icons-material @mui/x-data-grid axios
npm run dev
</code>   

<p>The dependencies include the following:</p>
 
   <a href="https://mui.com/">MUI</a>: React component framework with accompanying libraries and submodules like icons and data-grid component 
   <a href="https://fakerjs.dev/">Faker</a>: Library to quickly generate fake data for development and testing purposes 
   <a href="https://axios-http.com">Axios</a>: Isomorphic (can run in both Node.js and browsers with the same codebase) HTTP client 
 

<p>To complete the setup, make sure to link the Roboto font inside the index.html file, <a href="https://mui.com/getting-started/installation/#roboto-font">as recommended by MUI</a>:</p>

   <code>&lt;link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,700&amp;display=swap"
/&gt;
</code>   

<p>Additionally, to make the development and integration with the backend smooth (without unnecessary <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">CORS</a> issues), make sure to set up Vite proxy from the vite.config.js file:</p>

   <code>import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server: {
    proxy: {
      "/api": {
        target: "http://localhost:8080",
        rewrite: (path) =&gt; path.replace(/^\/api/, ""),
      },
    },
  },
});
</code>   

<p>With the above configuration, all requests to the Vite development server’s <code>/api</code> route will be redirected to the back-end server, allowing access to both from the same host.</p>

 Building the UI 

<p>While not the primary focus of this tutorial, thanks to MUI, it’s easy to make a good-looking frontend without much effort.</p>

<p>The whole UI will fit into the src/App.jsx file, with only a few changes required to the src/main.jsx file:</p>

   <code>// src/main.jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";
import CssBaseline from "@mui/material/CssBaseline";

ReactDOM.render(
  &lt;React.StrictMode&gt;
    &lt;CssBaseline /&gt;
    &lt;App /&gt;
  &lt;/React.StrictMode&gt;,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
</code>   

<p>The added <code>&lt;CssBaseline/&gt;</code> component will apply an MUI-specific CSS reset stylesheet.</p>

<p>Inside App.jsx, the <code>&lt;App/&gt;</code> component will be at the center of the whole UI, managing the state and core components. This component sets up the state for holding the search query, current selection, and all the posts, while also building the UI with help of MUI components.</p>

   <code>import {
  AppBar,
  Box,
  Container,
  Button,
  IconButton,
  InputAdornment,
  TextField,
  Toolbar,
} from "@mui/material";
import { useState } from "react";
import { DataGrid } from "@mui/x-data-grid";
import { Add, Search, Delete } from "@mui/icons-material";
import axios from "axios";
import faker from "@faker-js/faker";
import { useEffect } from "react";

const api = {
    // ...
};
const columns = [
  {
    field: "title",
    headerName: "Title",
    flex: 2,
    minWidth: 150,
  },
  {
    field: "author",
    headerName: "Author",
    flex: 1,
    minWidth: 150,
  },
  {
    field: "content",
    headerName: "Content",
    flex: 1,
    minWidth: 150,
  },
];
const TopMenu = (props) =&gt; {
  // ...
};
const EditMenu = (props) =&gt; {
  // ...
};
const App = () =&gt; {
  const [posts, setPosts] = useState([]);
  const [selection, setSelection] = useState([]);
  const [query, setQuery] = useState("");
  const addPost = async () =&gt; {
    // ...
  };
  const removePosts = async (removedIds) =&gt; {
    // ...
  };
  const search = async () =&gt; {
    //...
  };

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    // ...
  }, []);

  return (
    &lt;&gt;
      &lt;TopMenu /&gt;
      &lt;Container maxWidth="md"&gt;
        &lt;TextField
          placeholder="Search"
          fullWidth
          value={query}
          onInput={(event) =&gt; setQuery(event.target.value)}
          InputProps={{
            startAdornment: (
              &lt;InputAdornment sx={{ pr: 1.5 }} position="start"&gt;
                &lt;IconButton onClick={search}&gt;
                  &lt;Search /&gt;
                &lt;/IconButton&gt;
              &lt;/InputAdornment&gt;
            ),
          }}
        &gt;&lt;/TextField&gt;
        &lt;EditMenu
          selection={selection}
          addPost={addPost}
          removePosts={removePosts}
        /&gt;
        &lt;div style={{ width: "100%" }}&gt;
          &lt;DataGrid
            autoHeight
            rows={posts}
            columns={columns}
            pageSize={100}
            checkboxSelection
            onSelectionModelChange={(model) =&gt; setSelection(model)}
            selectionModel={selection}
          /&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/Container&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  );
};

export default App;
</code>   

<p>The app consists of a search bar, editing menu, and a table to display and manage the data. You can see the structure for API integration in the form of the <code>api</code> object, table configuration for the incoming data in the <code>columns</code>, and multiple state management functions right inside the <code>&lt;App/&gt;</code> component.</p>

<p>The <code>&lt;TopMenu/&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;EditMenu/&gt;</code> components will serve as the app bar and data-edit controls, respectively. Where necessary, they’ll use the state and control methods provided through props to control the state.</p>

   <code>// ...
const TopMenu = (props) =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;Box sx={{ flexGrow: 1, mb: 1 }}&gt;
      &lt;AppBar position="static"&gt;
        &lt;Toolbar /&gt;
      &lt;/AppBar&gt;
    &lt;/Box&gt;
  );
};
const EditMenu = (props) =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;Button
        startIcon={&lt;Add /&gt;}
        variant="contained"
        sx={{ my: 1, mr: 1 }}
        onClick={props.addPost}
      &gt;
        Add
      &lt;/Button&gt;
      &lt;Button
        startIcon={&lt;Delete /&gt;}
        variant="contained"
        disabled={!props.selection.length}
        sx={{ my: 1, mr: 1 }}
        onClick={() =&gt; props.removePosts(props.selection)}
      &gt;
        Remove
      &lt;/Button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};
// ...
</code>   

<p>With this setup, the app will look like this:</p>

<p></p>

 Integrating the frontend with the backend 

<p>To integrate the app with the backend, wrap the Axios API requests into reusable methods:</p>

   <code>// ...
const api = {
  async addPost(post) {
    const response = await axios.post("/api/create-post", post);

    return response.data;
  },
  async removePost(id) {
    const response = await axios.delete(`/api/remove-post?id=${id}`);

    return response.data;
  },
  async search(query) {
    const response = await axios.get(`/api/search?query=${query}`);

    return response.data;
  },
  async getAllPosts() {
    const response = await axios.get("/api/posts");

    return response.data;
  },
  async isAuthenticated() {
    const response = await axios.get("/api/is-authenticated");

    return response.data;
  },
};
// ...
</code>   

<p>Now, inside the main <code>&lt;App/&gt;</code> component, create the functions to connect the API with the state:</p>

   <code>// ...
const addPost = async () =&gt; {
  const post = {
    title: faker.lorem.lines(1),
    content: faker.lorem.paragraphs(3),
    author: faker.name.findName(),
  };
  const response = await api.addPost(post);
  setPosts([...posts, { ...post, id: response._id }]);
};
const removePosts = async (removedIds) =&gt; {
  setPosts(posts.filter((post) =&gt; !removedIds.includes(post.id)));
  await Promise.all(removedIds.map((id) =&gt; api.removePost(id)));
};
const search = async () =&gt; {
  const response = await api.search(query);

  setSelection(
    response.hits.hits.map((hit) =&gt; {
      return hit._id;
    })
  );
};
// ...
</code>   

<p>Here, the <code>addPost()</code> function creates a new post using the data from Faker.js and updates it both on the frontend and the backend. A similar process happens in <code>removePosts()</code>, which, given an array of post IDs, removes the related data on both ends. Finally, <code>search()</code> sends a query to the backend and selects the matching results in the table.</p>

<p>To load the initial data on the component mount, you’ll have to use the <code>useEffect()</code> hook, which will fetch the posts and update the view accordingly:</p>

   <code>// ...
useEffect(() =&gt; {
  loadUser().then((authenticated) =&gt; {
    if (authenticated) {
      api.getAllPosts().then((response) =&gt; {
        setPosts(
          response.hits.hits.map((hit) =&gt; ({
            id: hit._id,
            ...hit._source,
          }))
        );
      });
    }
  });
}, []);
// ...
</code>   

<p>Now, ensure both your backend and frontend servers are running, and check out all the features of your app!</p>

<p></p>

 Securing data access with Okta 

<p>While the app is working, it’s completely exposed to unauthorized access, which can be harmful to your data, code, and infrastructure as a whole. To fix that, you can use <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup">Okta</a>.</p>

<p>The entire process is quite simple and requires only a few changes on both ends of the app.</p>

 Securing the backend 

<p>Inside the backend folder, use the Okta CLI to create an .okta.env file with all required credentials.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>

<p>Select Other. 
    Then, change the Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:8080/callback</code> and use <code>http://localhost:8080/</code> for the Logout Redirect URI.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>

   <code>export OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER="https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID="0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET="NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS"
</code>   

<p>Your Okta domain is the first part of your issuer, before <code>/oauth2/default</code>.</p>

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/-/create-okta-application/">Create a Web App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>With that done, load the env file inside index.js and initiate <code>express-openid-connect</code> middleware:</p>

   <code>const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const elasticClient = require("./elastic-client");
const { auth, requiresAuth } = require("express-openid-connect");
require("dotenv").config({ path: ".okta.env" });
require("express-async-errors");

const app = express();

app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(
  auth({
    issuerBaseURL: process.env.OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER,
    clientID: process.env.OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID,
    clientSecret: process.env.OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET,
    secret: process.env.OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET,
    baseURL: "http://localhost:8080",
    idpLogout: true,
    authRequired: false,
    authorizationParams: {
      scope: "openid profile",
      response_type: "code",
    },
  })
);
// ...
</code>   

<p>The middleware not only secures the endpoints but also handles the callback and creates new <code>/login</code> and <code>/logout</code> routes for the configured 
 OpenID provider — we’re using Okta.</p>

<p>By setting <code>authRequired</code> to <code>false</code>, you get to selectively choose which endpoints to secure. In this case, this will include all endpoints related to Elasticsearch:</p>

   <code>// ...
const securedRouter = express.Router();

securedRouter.use(requiresAuth());
securedRouter.post("/create-post", async (req, res) =&gt; {
  const result = await elasticClient.index({
    index: "posts",
    document: {
      title: req.body.title,
      author: req.body.author,
      content: req.body.content,
    },
  });

  res.send(result);
});

// Other routes

app.use(securedRouter);
// ...
</code>   

<p>For simplicity, a separate, secured router is used. All you have to do is move the routes you want to secure to that router.</p>

<p>Lastly, you should create an unsecured <code>/is-authenticated</code> route for the frontend to contact when making initial requests:</p>

   <code>// ...
app.get("/is-authenticated", (req, res) =&gt; {
  const authenticated = req.oidc.isAuthenticated();
  if (authenticated) {
    res.json({
      authenticated,
      username: req.oidc.user.name,
    });
  } else {
    res.json({ authenticated: false });
  }
});
// ...
</code>   

<p>Additionally, the endpoint returns the username of the authorized user.</p>

 Integrating the frontend 

<p>Inside the src/App.jsx file on the frontend, add the <code>isAuthenticated()</code> method to the <code>api</code> object:</p>

   <code>// ...
const api = {
  // ...
  async isAuthenticated() {
    const response = await axios.get("/api/is-authenticated");

    return response.data;
  },
};
// ...
</code>   

<p>Then, inside the <code>&lt;App/&gt;</code> component, check if the user is authenticated and, if so, load his username:</p>

   <code>// ...
const App = () =&gt; {
  // ...
  const [username, setUsername] = useState("");
  // ...
  const loadUser = async () =&gt; {
    const response = await api.isAuthenticated();

    console.log(response);
    if (response.authenticated) {
      setUsername(response.username);
      return true;
    }

    return false;
  };

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    loadUser().then((authenticated) =&gt; {
      if (authenticated) {
        api.getAllPosts().then((response) =&gt; {
          setPosts(
            response.hits.hits.map((hit) =&gt; ({
              id: hit._id,
              ...hit._source,
            }))
          );
        });
      }
    });
  }, []);

  return (
    &lt;&gt;
      &lt;TopMenu username={username} /&gt;
      &lt;Container maxWidth="md"&gt;
        {/* ... */}
        &lt;EditMenu
          username={username}
          selection={selection}
          addPost={addPost}
          removePosts={removePosts}
        /&gt;
        {/* ... */}
      &lt;/Container&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  );
};
// ...
</code>   

<p>Finally, in the menus, disable editing and show the LOGIN button in the app bar. If the user is logged in, show the LOGOUT button instead alongside his username:</p>

   <code>const TopMenu = (props) =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;Box sx={{ flexGrow: 1, mb: 1 }}&gt;
      &lt;AppBar position="static"&gt;
        &lt;Toolbar&gt;
          &lt;div style={{ flex: 1 }}&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
          {props.username ? (
            &lt;&gt;
              &lt;span&gt;{props.username}&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;Button color="inherit" href="/api/logout"&gt;
                LOGOUT
              &lt;/Button&gt;
            &lt;/&gt;
          ) : (
            &lt;Button color="inherit" href="/api/login"&gt;
              Login

<p>Hi everyone and welcome to this SEO identity community meetup for January 2022. We are very excited to have Gabriel Rene with us today and our topic is how web 3.0 will connect humans, machines, and AI to transform the world. Before we get started we would like to have a few words from heather dahl, CEO of Indicio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heather</p>
<p>Hi Maya, thank you, welcome to everyone, I’m excited to kick off the first of our monthly meetups for 2022. We are moving into our just second year of providing this type of content to the community, and I think the topics that we tackle and the experts that we bring on bring really intriguing conversations. I want to give a special welcome to anyone who’s here and new to our community, it’s so cool to see in the chat where everyone’s coming from. Hamburg, I heard a shout out from Brussels, Dublin, go Fairfax, Virginia, we have Seattle, Canada, by all means if you’re new to the meetup or you’re returning, add your location to the conversation because I think it’s really interesting that we bring together this global community. For those of you who aren’t familiar with Indicio, we are a public benefit company, and our mission is to advance decentralized identity. A part of our mission is running educational events like this, and because we’re out there building ecosystems for trusted data, today’s topic we find really exciting, absolutely provocative, excited to see Gabe here, and to talk about the internet of everything, and what it means for people and digital objects and non-digital objects to provide identity and to communicate with each other in ways that are secure and trustworthy. Ken was supposed to be here today to lead the conversation but he couldn’t make it, so senior architect Sam Curren is here to lead the conversation and interview with our absolutely terrific guest, Gabrielle Rene, thank you all for being here and I’m gonna turn it over to you Sam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Thanks Heather, and and thanks Gabriel for being here, I guess we should start with an introduction, that’s appropriate, Gabriel is the architect of the spatial web, it’s a vision he’s described with his co-author Dan Mapes, in the international best-selling book titled the spatial web, how web 3.0 will connect hans machines and ai to transform the world. He’s the executive director at VERSUS lab and the spatial web foundation, and he and his team are bringing this vision to life. The groundbreaking hyperspatial markup language is currently being discussed at a new working group with the IEEE, both web 3 and the metaverse have been recent hot topics in the last couple of months but the spatial web is where the real becomes virtual and the virtual real. So welcome to Gabriel Rene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me Sam, thank you Heather, and Ken when you watch this hopefully we’re doing you proud, good work. on your behalf so Sam thank you, thanks for hosting me today, and it’s an honor to be here and have a chance to speak to everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Excellent, I’ve been stunt doubling for Ken in a few areas and I’m not as good looking as Ken is but I’ll do my best. So excellent all right, let’s dive into some questions here, and please answer with whatever you think is relevant, and we can take this discussion wherever we need to go. So you’ve described the spatial web as the internet of everything and you’ve thought a lot about what the internet of everything will look like, what do you see?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well the first thing I see is a more holistic approach to the concept of the application of network computing technologies, like the internet, and a lot of times what tends to occur is that perspectives on emerging technology are industry specific or technology specific. We talk about AI or we talk about XR, we talk about IOT or we talk about blockchain, and we talk about quant, or it’s by industry, this applies to the government or this applies to supply chain which applies to retail and this applies to healthcare. So these narratives are constantly emerging where we even have these themes: human 2.0, we have dialogues around web 3.0, industry 4.0, and the Japanese are talking about society 5.0. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all of those cases almost the exact same set of technologies are being discussed, and it’s the usual suspects I just rattled off. Some people started talking about the internet of things a handful of years ago, this idea that it wasn’t just the internet where we had sort of interconnected communications, but rather these physical connected smart devices would form this new network. That was very exciting, it remains exciting, we’ve yet to see a whole lot of it work. I can tell you that the smart home struggle is real, and interoperability is at the heart of every problem. So this idea that you can connect things is one level, then there’s another debate about things being smart. So at one level you’ve got the internet of things, and then there’s been spatial computing, which has really emerged around this idea and is now re being repackaged again into the metaverse narrative, which you might call the internet of non-things, or sort of virtual things, that are not things or “what are they” things. And then there’s been this idea that is the blockchain folks saying that the internet of money, or the internet of trust, it sort of starts to intersect with the work that your community is doing. And there’s the internet of intelligence thing, which is the AI folks attempt early on the semantic web again. Whether we use the internet, or the web, or some sort of talking variations of this kind of a network where the data is intelligent or smart in and of itself. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The term smart, which has taken over everything, so there’s a smartphone that was the first thing, it’s just a computer, but that’s fine it’s a smartphone. Why? Because it has some connected capability, and in the beginning smart meant connected. As machine learning and deep learning found its footing over the last decade. The idea of things becoming smart meant actually being intelligent to the feedback loops, adaptive smart home now means that your nest adjusts the temperature for you, and that the lights turn on and off based on some feedback loop or information. Then of course we’re talking about smart cities, and so we go from smartphones, smart things, smart cars, smart cities, the idea is that these cities become intelligent and adaptive. Your autonomous car is able to just drive. Because, traffic is this sort of amorphous thing, like a bunch of starlings moving through. Drones and automated functionality that the amazon go, vacation of everything, you walk into a store, you take what you want, you walk out. All these sort of smart functions that might be built into government services, and all this sort of future sci-fi smart city narratives, but when I spoke to a community of smart cities four years ago in Europe, cities that came together to explore this, their number one thing was well how do we connect with other smart cities? So how do we form a network of smart cities? Well smart cities with all these smart cars and smartphones and smart devices and smart things with these internet and web connections across these various sets of interests and industries forms what you might call a smart world. And that idea that you’ve got this global cyber physical network now that encompasses all of these things, and that the addressability of an object isn’t just that it’s connected, it might just be that it’s being viewed by a camera, it could be an object that has no internet connection in and of itself, but this network has its own, and it’s essentially showing up on the network, that network we call the spatial web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Really good explanation, so a natural follow-on to that, I realize that web 3.0 has become a loaded term. You used it first in the title of your book, obviously, so it’s recorded there, but it’s come to mean some different things in recent times. Using sort of your original meaning of web 3.0 why doesn’t web 2.0 already solve this? What is missing from what we’ve got today that we need to go where we need to go?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well there’s a handful of things, and I think that some of the architects of web 1.0 have lamented about some of the infrastructure decisions that were made at the time. Now there were technical limitations or practical limitations, hardly anyone actually cared, but there were debates around identity and privacy and security, there was a tendency, being academics and scientists, not to think too deeply into all of the societal implications of these technologies. So the anticipation that people would use this for good, and not for personal, selfish, or otherwise harmful ends was the default. “Oh it’s gonna be this awesome network and we’re gonna do information sharing” great, problem solved. Decades of work had gone into that, from the ARPAnet all the way up into the world wide web, where you have Tim Berners-lee pulling a bunch of threads together and stitching that into what became the backbone of this amazing communications network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identity was actually one of the real missing ingredients in my opinion, and that anonymity part, the thing that makes the web open is also the thing that makes the web dangerous. The hackers, trackers, and fakers that are permeating our lives from simple sort of issues around misrepresentation, all the way to identity theft, all the way to now ransomware, and we’re about one hop away from biotech, and people being able to hack devices that were what we’re wearing, or that are on our bodies, or that are in our bodies, and so the the openness of the web is a double-edged sword that seems to cut both ways. That allowed the web 2.0 era organizations and companies to maximize the capital potential of that structure, and so they essentially monetized that openness, that anonymity was a function of the sort of the fact that you didn’t have an identity, so we’ll rent you one. We’re google here’s ours, we’re Facebook here’s ours, apple here’s one for you as well, how about one for linkedin and facebook? Alright so we all run around with these sort of two-dimensional avatars, locked in these digital fighters where we serve certain functions. We get certain services from that, so i don’t think that a pure polarized view on this looking at web 2.0 is inherently negative is fair or accurate, but these are major holes in the architecture that allowed for this type of capitalism to thrive in a new dimension, and that thriving has compromised some of the inherent freedoms, and some might say human rights. Now It’s becoming part of the debate: what property do we own here with respect to our data? And I think that those holes have produced really horrific outcomes, like not just on the monetization side, but on how we are programmed into wanting or thinking certain things. One of those things are products and services, whether those things are our own ideas about ourselves and our identity and our self-image, or whether it’s our viewpoint on the effectiveness of vaccines and science, and what political representative we think is in our best interests. You can no longer separate the technical work that we’ve done here with the web and our societal implications, and that’s the real zeitgeist challenge that I think we face at this moment. It requires some new ways of thinking about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’ve talked about some architectural adjustments that would get that will help get us there, one of one of those pieces of architecture i think is the hyperspatial markup language, HSML, that is part of your work at the IEEE, can you describe what HSML will help us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah, so just one quick parenthetical, and it’s a function of a little bit of us copying something. It is HSML, but it’s hyperspatial modeling language instead of markup language, although there was quite a bit of debate internally about whether that was an accurate description. The function of a market language and a modern language are different, but depending on your perspective, in this case it is about modeling at the heart of it. How do we model the world digitally in a way that is coherent with the way that humans cognize the world? And I provide that caveat because there are other ways of cognizing the world that we’re unable to be aware of, and that is not what our concern is with respect to what we need to teach machines or AIs. We need to ensure that they can cognize the world in a way that is similar, or compatible, or at least incorporates our understanding of reality. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What HSML does is it functions in a sort of semIOTic structure of forming the core elements, in which there are 12, that act like a language. So just like nouns, verbs, prepositions, and adjectives are sufficient components with which to construct descriptions and representation of reality that predominantly is all we’re using today. Like today I’m just using magic mouth sounds to paint pictures in everyone’s heads, and if I had it with squiggly lines it would do nearly as well. But if i could just do what we’ve been able to see some whales and some dolphins do which is actually just project an entire three-dimensional holographic representation of this particular bay, and the position of all the fish, kind of like a sonar snapshot, and just send that to you 20 miles away, “like hey the party’s over here, here’s where the fish are guys” that might be another way to communicate. So HSML enables multiple IOT devices to do what’s called sensor fusion, or data fusion, even policy fusion. So you can take information from sensors, we take information from databases, and you can take policy related information laws, or instructions, or whatever, and you can fuse those together into a multi-layered scene graph, which is a way of representing the information about any set of activities in any given space. All of the objects in the space, all the users in the space, all the activities in space, all the permissions in the space, and at the end of the day that it is intended to enable you to construct descriptions of states of things, and then describe workflows for what needs to happen, so you could conceivably program all the smart things in your house to work in a very certain particular way, one could inform another one, and this could then extend all the way out into the city, and so forth and so forth to the world at large. So the idea of making a standard here in the in many of the same ways that HTML allows us to structure content and information on pages, HSML lets us structure context and information in spaces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So I like that the modeling of context is a sign of something that sort of begun to happen, but without much organization. So when the web was new it was a new location, we would visit websites and we would go there and it was all about this new world and this new place, and honestly web 2.0 was a lot of that too. IOT starts to get a little interesting because now there’s this internet of things, but the things generally exist in real life and also on the internet, so it’s blending now between there. Of course now we’ve got augmented reality, and virtual reality, and a lot of things that pull that together, so when we think about all this stuff that in the real life that’s sort of blending together with a digital life that means like a proliferation of cameras and sensors and objects that we can interact with etc. So this means identity for everything, which is great. But there’s some implications here that the tinfoil hat wears among us, and I occasionally wear one of a particular shape. What are the implications of all of this interconnectedness upon the privacy we have and maybe governance that can help us with that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, so that was the question we started to ask ourselves back in 2016, which was all of that connectedness, all of that capability, all of that monitoring was going to happen anyway. Like that was the clear thing that was happening, so then the question became okay can you ensure certain levels of interoperability? And you need that in order to enable governance, if things are not interoperable you can make as many rules as you like, and it doesn’t it doesn’t matter. So what there’s a bit of a logical cake here, coherence is the first requirement, if you have coherence then interoperability is a function of your description of coherence. What is or isn’t coherent, like if you can describe the physics of the environment, and you want to say how you navigate through it, you can’t do it until you’ve done the first part. And then governance is a function of saying well what you can or cannot do are the ways that you must then navigate that environment, or who can when and what time and all sorts of all the parameters of activity management or activity governance. Because governance at the end of the day is really about changing states in the world. It’s not a theoretical function, it’s a practical function, and so that was what we saw as being really the scariest thing I’ve ever noticed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this cyber stuff is going to get all interconnected, you’re going to end up with this internet of everything. Which there was no term spatial web in that sense, the GIS community had been using it for many years, but not in the sense that we saw this multi-dimensional, multimodal sort of thing, it was like okay this internet of everything is going to happen, there are a handful of real challenges with that, including the possibility for abuse and looking at how wonderfully we did the web 2.0. this was just going to cascade into essentially black mirror, that’s what we’re all concerned about. So it was at that time that identity became clear to me that it was a fundamental infrastructural architectural requirement. Having been in telecom before that, and looking at telemedicine services, that was when I started looking at blockchain and the idea that you might need to own these assets related to your medical history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> I wasn’t interested in crypto in the beginning, Bitcoin seemed interesting, but not enough for me to buy any or care, blockchain looked really interesting, and this idea that you would own your sort of property. At that point I started looking for what kind of new identity structure, or what would become like a spatial web url, some sort of key identifier, and that’s when I came across the work that many of you on this call were pioneering. You were working on it before that of course, but also like right around that time, and that was a real eye opener, and it frankly made it possible for us to focus on the other bits. Because it was like this community is completely dedicated to the identity, in our version of this the human is one of those entities, or one of those actors, but every single object, including conceptual objects, can have a DID in the spatial web, and all of these are sort of structured using HSML, and some of these other ontology and taxonomy structures you’re looking at to maintain that coherence. That then grants you this ability to do governance, which gives you the second portion of this of the standard, which is called HSTP, which is hyperspace transaction protocol. What that does is it basically says “okay cool world give me all the information of the states of all these objects, users, actors,” and again they could be holographic objects in that space that that you otherwise wouldn’t be aware of, the IOT device isn’t going to pick that up, but the space knows that it’s there. You sent me something to this room so I could present it on this call as an example. I wanted to get this exact “xyz” position and I knew it was coming. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today one challenge is that you can send anything you want to my email address, I can’t stop you, you can come to my website, I can’t stop you, in fact you can send money to my eth wallet, and I cannot prevent that. But in the spatial web those everything is sort of permission based, and so that ability to then transport objects users activities and the governance around those is described in HSML, and essentially activated using HSTP, which says what are those states, i would like this state to change this way, or if the state changes what is or isn’t allowed in this case in this space, and HSTP says that transaction has passed or failed. So if only Heather is allowed to enter this room, if the temperature is x, and the time of day is y, and her facial expression or other biometric information says she’s in a certain state, all of which are just inputs that would be happening with any modern technology, but now could coherently say okay Heather’s at the right state the door can open and if she’s not then then the door remains closed. So this becomes you are able to program cyber physical activities, and define the governance for those if you were an authority of that space, and so that is the key sort of requirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>I think that it’s important that this doesn’t invent some brand new type of authority, but rather gives existing authorities the ability to express the rules about what they have authority over. So our house still remains our house, and I posit that we’ll have even more control over what’s actually going on in it from a digital perspective than we do today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes and so you could ensure that nothing is installed in your house, if it doesn’t make a certain threshold of some privacy standard, or that requires some certificate, if it doesn’t have it, it can’t it can’t be there, or it can’t turn on. The city could say drones are only allowed to fly in the city in these specific flight lanes, and if they have cameras on them those cameras are allowed to be on, but the drone cannot fly within five miles of the airport. it can’t have its cameras on when it’s flying over schools, or certain private properties, or certain zones, and all this can be spatially defined as if it were a video game. But now you can do it in the physical world in any digitally mediated set of functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>And that’s an incredibly powerful piece of this, so to switch gears just a little bit, we’ve talked about the blending of the digital and the real life thing, but with it with better technology that we’ve got for for things like virtual reality, you can now sort of have a spatially aware virtual thing, instead of a website that we’re looking at as a docent on a screen. So how do these same concepts apply in a pure virtual space? Where I might be in a fictitious world rather than in real life, and what’s the blend between the real and the virtual?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I love that question, so if you’ll allow me to nerd out for a moment, if you’ve seen the original avengers series of movies that marvel put out, there’s a moment where you get the arc of bruce banner and the hulk. It’s like when he can or cannot become the hulk, and everyone’s afraid he’s going to do it, in the final scene of the first avengers movie they’re like “Bruce get angry”, and he goes “that’s my trick I’m always angry”. So the the parallel here is that it’s actually always virtual, in one instance it must map to the physical world, in all other instances it doesn’t need to. So a harry potter world or the death star rendered in a 3d engine somewhere can have all the exact same authorities, and policies, and functions that apply. Vader is allowed to apparently strangle people at the helm of the thing, and Dumbledore, if he does something wrong the ministry fires him for a couple weeks, he’s got to go into hiding. So there are actually policies and things that exist in these virtual spaces, as we look at things like decentraland, and ownership, and NFTs, and assets and rights around this we’re going to need certain guarantees around what we can trust in these environments. How these authority structures are set up what is transparent, and and what we can investigate, what we can audit and so building property in a virtual world that you don’t ultimately have ownership of, or you can’t take those assets somewhere else, for example you don’t have any rights in roblox or fortnite they can do whatever they want, it’s a corporation they own it they can just change it, and change all your assets, change your skins, they can just flip the whole thing they can sell it, they can take the company public, there’s all kinds of other functions and interests at play. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if we expect and of course it seems natural that we’re going to want digital assets, they are becoming increasingly valuable, they’re also becoming increasingly more realistic, and to that degree at some point even experiences themselves will be indistinguishable from reality. Our senses are not that sophisticated, and you have people like Elon and others working on neural link, and others working on neural dust, that at some point are not going to require any sort of ocular interface. There’s not just a singularity of AI, there’s a singularity of reality that is a whole consideration that’s coming, so having certain guarantees around these environments will become increasingly important. This whole move with cryptocurrency, which is native internet money, and now NFTs, which are really smart assets, well not yet, they’re smart receipts to a virtual asset. I think DID’s really get you all the way across the line there, and HSML by the way would allow you to describe the asset in such a way that it would match up. So with the IDs in HSML I would know all these attributes down to color, texture, size or whatever is that version of that thing, and not just a receipt that says that I own something which could be copied a thousand times. A bit wondering of an answer but hopefully that hit a couple of notes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>No, that’s fantastic, so I want to draw something out a little bit. You sort of talked about how the same applies when I brought up this virtual versus real thing. You said real is the only instance where it actually needs to line up with reality and all these other things can exist virtually as well, that sounds like the metaverse has been talked about by a lot of folks and facebook audaciously renamed themselves to sort of try and own the space. What’s the difference here between the hyperspatial web that you see and the vision of the metaverse that facebook or other companies might be interested in offering?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Okay great question, so i think that i’ll try and provide a nuanced answer. I actually think everyone is making their best attempt to describe the same thing, which is an open and interoperable network. I think the battle right now is not for Facebook to become AOL, everyone’s seen this we’ve all seen this game before, like you don’t you don’t ultimately win with a closed version of this thing. In fact facebook thrives on an open web so that’s not a requirement that they sort of close their borders and they’re going to defend those borders, i think the battle right now is who’s the wordpress of the metaverse. Where are you going to go to build your sites, your stuff, who’s going to provide all the services, all the plugins, all that. So it’s not about Facebook changing their name to Meta and then saying we’re all about the metaverse, even though they’ve been the least arguably the least trustworthy brand in the modern era since I don’t know, Exxon. We go towards well they want to keep doing the same thing and making money the same way and that’s what Meta is for. I don’t actually think that, I think this is a massive pivot for the company, and that they’re doomed. I talk about this in the book. I don’t think that surveillance capitalism will be a profitable business in 10 years. I think it completely comes apart, look at GDPR right now saying google analytics is not going to work here anymore. That’s his web 2.0 getting smashed, these pillars are already coming down, and I think Mark Zuckerberg has seen this coming since the day he walked in to lucky palmers and put on something that was a space and realized that he had a company about a book. He must have said “oh it’s no longer about pages it’s about spaces” and we’re just seeing the arc of that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark wants an economy, he wants to build the largest economy with the largest amount of services to capture the most. Now people will willingly give over their data in order to optimize and maximize all kinds of inputs and data services around that. He doesn’t have to stay in that same game, and if he doesn’t get out of that game, while building hardware that’s capturing biometric information, the regulators are just going to keep squeezing and squeezing, and the laws and the walls are going to close in. So I don’t see a way out of this for surveillance capitalism-centered businesses, and I think actually that they’re smart enough to know that. This is why they already just announced last week, “hey we’re Twitter, everyone NFTs we have NFTs now” you can take them and move things around. You can build assets as well, say the asset I would like to move around is everything that you have about me, so let me NFT my data, and then I want to move it around, okay that’s what i would like. So I think that everyone’s still pointing in the same direction, and if you’re not, and you think that you’re gonna be the prodigy in aol, it didn’t work last time, but we’re gonna really give it a shot this time. So I just I think everyone’s smart enough not to repeat that play, but just like the oil companies and the automobile companies drag their feet as long as possible squeezing every dollar out of something that was causing arguable harm to the world, they still need to maximize the lens that they operate on, which is a fundamentally, their corporations with capital based goals. So now everyone ever wants an electric car, but it took someone like Elon and Tesla to just come in and change the whole game. So think that that’s what’s happening here, is that the battles for the wordpress of the spatial web or the wordpress of the metaverse, no one’s going to win being the siloed version of the metaverse where you don’t own any of your stuff. It’s going to be a wasteland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a fantastic answer, so we’ve talked about this vision and i think we all have a vision in our minds of what this looks like, we see even films depict this like Ready Player One for example does a really great job like laying out this universe of what it could possibly be like in the future. What’s less clear is how we get from today to there. What does this roll out actually look like? Is there a cut over? Is there a gradual way we get there? What’s this like?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well I mean I can only guess like the rest, but the hardware is the problem. So that’s why you’re seeing billions and billions of dollars being poured into that space, and more or less everyone is going there, so everyone wanted a smartphone. Does everyone remember the facebook smartphone that came out? That lasted like an hour. So Mark was very smart in jumping in on the VR thing when everyone thought that was just whatever, and Google said we’re going to play around in the AR space and their commitment has been soft. Two steps forward, one step back, and a lot of people in that community have not been happy about it, then Magic Leap emerged and said we’re gonna we’re gonna be the new Apple of this space. They said we only need a few billion dollars, and then “oh we spent it all” because it’s hardware and it’s absolutely the worst possible thing to work on, and it’s super hard. So you’re talking about innovation in battery life, innovation in optics, innovation in computing, and it’s just there’s so many pieces. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s like that smartphone moment again, which is why Apple just takes their time, and does the exact same thing they always do, waiting in the background so a lot of the froth is squeezed out and some of the core problems are solved, then they find their own path in. They’re like we don’t care about the metaverse, we’re not talking about the metaverse and they’re gonna come out with something different. But you’re gonna see four or five of these all start to really hit the market in a meaningful way, variations on AR and VR or hybrid sort of mixed reality devices or glasses. Then you’ve got Qualcomm, and others that are building chips now that have so much capability in them, AI powered chips with powerful spatial computing capabilities on it. So you’re gonna get 25 chinese companies that are making essentially the android versions of these things. I think by next year we’re going to see sort of that “iPhone 1” moment, and then that’s going to kick off the party. By the end of the decade, for some that can afford it, because the prices will go down you will have those early “Ready Player One” moments. Halfway into the next decade it seems like that’s the dominant thing so that’s the arc. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course one of the places we’re looking at, because we always tend to look at this through the consumer market lens, really where a lot of this is needed is in industrial spaces. In warehouses and ports, mining and agriculture, and that’s where the holographic part of this is only one layer, like you could think of the metaverse as sort of being the internet of experience. It’s a human-like interface layer of the spatial web while the internet of things is a machine interface. You having an experience where you go into a store, you grab some stuff, a bunch of cameras identify you and the object, and your account, and your wallet, and you walk out and it just charges you, that’s not a metaverse experience. That’s that you’re embedded in a mesh network of the internet of things, but from our lens that’s still the spatial web, and if then something popped up in front of you that gave you a holographic receipt and that was maybe that’s part of the metaverse. But if as you’re walking into the environment you’re seeing information displayed on top of all of the items saying “hey you’re gluten-free this week how about 10 off that”, that’s a metaversal layer on top of an IOT mediated experience. So you have to consider that component, that sort of digitization of the physical, and physicalization of the digital. These things are intersecting, and one sort of abstract point here is that, that’s what language is. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The experience that a deer has of the physics of a space is almost identical. The deer is in my living room. It can navigate that room better than I can, it understands the objects, but it doesn’t know what they are. But I’ve embedded the meaning, “oh that’s my couch, that’s my tv, that this is a picture of my family” it can see all those things, but it doesn’t know what they are. So I’ve embedded this virtual layer of meaning into the world, all these objects have terms, functions, and ideas. I know what they’re supposed to do. A monkey can still tell that it can sit on a couch, it understands the basic physics, it understands gravity, it can even understand the function of a couch, in that manner, but it doesn’t know whether that it might be meaningful socially to me whether it’s from Ikea or it’s from some fancy italian store. That’s a social virtual layer that humans, the human monkey has embedded into the world around us. We both configured it physically, like we shaped all this stuff, all these objects, but we’ve also added this whole virtual layer. Now we’re just doing it in a completely multi-dimensional way, so that the sort of digital twinification is putting those data sets onto the objects, and into the environment, and then we’re going into those sort of imaginary spaces that we put in our brains that we put into books we put in pictures we put into paintings we put into films. Now we’re just making them fully experiential. I think that’s that big shift, is moving from the information based web, to this experiential based web, whether that’s in the physical world or the digital world. Those blurred lines really create some new kind of digital environment and digital era. I don’t have a good word for it, that’s not a good word, forget it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a good start though. So you’ve implied that the roll out of the spatial web is not tied to the success in the hardware of augmented reality or virtual virtual reality hardware, meaning it can start sooner. So what does the rollout of the spatial web technologies look like as opposed to things that are tied to a VR or AR experience?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah what a good question. So well one of the things we just spoke about was it’s really the IOT first perspective. So in a warehouse you’ve got workers that essentially spend eight hours a day walking around 100,000 square feet trying to locate an item in a box. So what you do is you you build a three-dimensional map in your head, because some things are high, and something’s low, and some things are on the second floor, and then you get an order on your android phone it says go to row 17, isle 12 section l and grab item xj4-92. Okay where am I? You do all this three-dimensional triangulation, and then you route yourself. What we found is if you build a digital twin of that entire environment, and you map the inventory into every single location, so you now embedded the information into the space, you can take that same android phone and route that person to that location, and the cognitive load drops in half, and they basically speed up by 30 percent. The productivity, and performance, and actually the mental cost, the tax, we think about “oh people working hard for eight hours and now you’re making them more productive” there are some societal concerns about optimizing human activity in these environments, and there’s been some real concerns about how amazon is doing it, at the same time if you can reduce the cognitive load that’s actually the most expensive part for them, and so that’s one of the functions. So you’re building a three-dimensional twin you’re embedding the information into the environment, and you’re routing the human worker through that, now ultimately that human worker is hands and feet, because you’re no longer relying on the brain to do that much so the ability to then have humans and robots working in that same space or having humans in the day and robots at night or any combination thereof is a function of creating that shared model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> If there’s a shared model, whether it’s in the city and how how drones then decide are the certain flight lanes that they have, or or government policy that says in europe maybe the eu wants to say that the total flight height for all drones of a certain class is 120 meters, but in the netherlands they might want to say that it’s 100, and brussels maybe they say it’s 80, and as a drone passes through, it cannot ever go higher than 120, but as it goes through the netherlands and over the brussels it has to go down and then down. This is the machine’s view of the spatial web, and all of those capabilities and things are necessary right now, look at the supply chain, we had 500,000 cargo containers sitting off the coast here over christmas, and that’s because the ability for these systems to be able to communicate to each other is really poor, and our understanding of supply and demand globally is really bad. You have something like the pandemic hit and the butterfly fly effect is just happening all over the place and we’re not resilient enough to be able to adapt at this scale.&nbsp;So that’s really what the ultimate value of something like the spatial web means, adaptation. So it’s about the internet of experience over here on the metaverse side, the internet of things, this industry 4.0 narrative is about automation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s really the goal. Can we use machines and algorithms to automate physical functions in the system, and if you did that the impact on climate and the amount of carbon we’d be using would be hyper optimized, and we could set thresholds and regulations and the machines could adapt and adjust this. Instead something like the pandemic hits, we all go to Amazon and buy everything we ever wanted to buy because we can’t go anywhere, and then we just log jam every port in the world. This allows us to start to get a more holistic view, and the way that we start to look at the function of monitoring is not so much monitoring and surveillance, because those capabilities will be there, but if you use things like verifiable credentials, you use things like the IDs, and these get built into law and regulation, then we have we can have the ability to share this kind of information with each other. So you can set up a relay race of an adaptive supply chain, don’t send the automated truck until the thing arrives at the port, minimizing the total amount of carbon output. This adaptive thing is very much what organic systems do, this is how the body manages, you’ve got the autonomic nervous system, we need autonomous supply chains. These are the kind of functions that you can have in the spatial web which are absolutely critical, that are not about having an awesome virtual experience or or trying to sell a jpeg for a million bucks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’re claiming then that the world yesterday needs the spatial web, and that the visualization can currently be done, maybe in a 2d factor, or something like on a smartphone, or other flat screens that we have, and then as soon as the AR and VR get ready it’ll slide right into to that function for visualization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>That’s a really important point in this, in the warehouse we have an application that is multi-modal, and some people prefer just the audio, like with turn-by-turn instructions. Some people want to look at the map, some people prefer to hear it, some people want both, in our cases a lot of the workers are spanish so they want spanish audio. Generally they don’t want 3d, we started with 3d holograms, people were like “this is awesome, but i just need this” this is what’s most useful for me. So even this idea that “oh yeah 3d information is better and holograms are better”, we started doing that four years ago, and everyone was impressed and it was faster and easier, but it hurt to wear the headset for eight hours and the battery would only last three hours. So the hardware isn’t ready on that front, but cameras, AI, algorithms, and computer vision are ready to go, and so that’s a place where this is able to start. It’s really quite useful in some of these really critical environments that are far more relevant to our day-to-day lives and not so much in the entertainment or gaming or space. There’ll be education, we won’t be doing zooms like this, we’ll all be awkwardly sitting around a very large table, but there are functions today that are super meaningful for deploying the capabilities and use of the spatial web, and this is without even getting into any of the the broader needs around how DIDs can permeate, and self-sovereign identity is relevant in and of itself. Just like land title ownership by the dimensions this is going to end up being the domains of the spatial web, we will essentially be bound like boundaries. Your home is a domain, your property is a domain, the city’s a domain, today we think of domains as urls but domains in the spatial web are spaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Absolutely, so you’ve hinted at this a little already, which is really powerful. What do governments and companies do now to prepare for the coming spatial web?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I mean I think that there are a few groups that governments and researchers and regulators need to start becoming aware of. Predominantly that’s the work that’s being done around DIDs and DIDcomm, verifiable credentials, and the spatial web foundations working group at the IEEE. I think those are the critical components that you need to understand. I think that there is a more provocative branch off of this question, which is what role do governments play in virtual worlds? So it’s outside your jurisdiction, so what is legal or not not legal, and who says and how? So thinking about your geopolitical domain is one thing, thinking about people physically in your dimension that are experiencing something in another dimension that you have no jurisdictional power or authority over is a question. This ties into larger questions of governance, i mean Minecraft i think is eight times the size of earth. That’s big, that’s a big space, okay that’s one little world, you’re talking there’ll be thousands and then hundreds of thousands. There’s 300 million websites today, there’ll be billions and billions of these environments and spaces, at some point AIs will just auto generate whatever experience you want. Just start choosing adventure in real time based on biometric feedback, so the possibilities here are going to get really weird, really interesting. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chinese quote may you live in interesting times is sort of a double-edged sword. These are interesting times and so these are the kinds of questions. The last question I want to leave you with on this point is if Disney land or H&amp;M or whoever builds a store in decentraland, can I build a Disney store right next to the Disney store in decentraland? Who’s preventing it? Are they respecting the trademark and IP agreements of the United States? We will need treaties between organizations, countries on earth, and in these virtual worlds as if they were other planets. In the same way that we had to look at these challenges when we formed the league of nations or the united nations, we’re going to have other dimensions that we need to interact with that have entire economies that we trade in where the jurisdictions don’t apply. Then again who do you trust in those environments relative to what authorities? And so what prevents me from doing that in decentraland? Why can’t I sell Disney merch? or modify it with marvel or warner brothers stuff or whatever i like? So i think this is where trusts and guarantees around verifiability and credentialing of authorities becomes really critical, and if we’re going to digitize all of this, all of our reality in this next age, and all this money is flowing into the space, these are the kinds of big questions that we’re constantly thinking about and working on with respect to the standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, we are unfortunately out of time, but this has been great to hear your vision and thoughts around these things. Is there anything you’d like to leave us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, I think that the the role of identity is a fundamental pillar, and i think that in the the arc of history when we look at the role of property, and property rights, physical property rights, i just talked about intellectual property rights, data property rights, and digital asset property rights are are the next challenge. This is not a purely philosophical question, this is going to come down to law. So we need to start thinking of what does digital law mean in the 21st century? And making sure that the work we’re doing is addressing some of those questions, or hosting some of those conversations, I’d like to see more constitutional lawyers involved in these conversations. I’d like to see people that are really working through this sort of lens of data rights and ethics having these dialogues. That’s why I think that the next battleground is property rights, with respect to the function of data and the things that data form, which become these new hyperspatial objects in this next era.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, Gabriel, thank you for spending this time with us we’re we’re grateful for your willingness to be here. I hope everyone enjoyed this conversation and we’ll look forward to seeing you all in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me, take care everybody&nbsp;</p>

<p>By Ingo Rübe, founder of KILT Protocol and CEO of BOTLabs GmbH, the initial developer of&nbsp;KILT.</p><p>The internet is evolving as rapidly as technology develops, leading to a lot of talk lately about Web3 and the Metaverse. These developments are not just about a better quality of immersive gaming, they also point to a bigger shift in the way we all live and do business. While it may take years for this new era to reach maturity, now is the time to consider how it is developing and what kind of a future we want to be part of creating.</p> Web3 <p>Web3 has been described as the next generation of the internet — a fairer, decentralized version where big corporations lose their monopolies and their hold on our data. Blockchain technology is a major contribution to this development, due to its ability to facilitate decentralization and enable the transfer of both data and tokens (cryptocurrencies) safely without having to trust in an individual or centralized organization.</p><p>While Web3 has been criticized in some quarters as a shift away from the free internet, it could rather be seen as a shift away from our current internet model where users are the product, with their data used and monetized by service providers.</p> The Metaverse <p>The Metaverse has many definitions. In its simplest form a Metaverse can be understood as a digital universe running alongside our physical universe. Although often associated with gaming and 3D technologies like virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), a Metaverse can also be in 2D, like our internet or platforms that offer a way to create a second life in a digital world. These Metaverses have many of the features of our physical world. We can exist, we can interact and communicate with others, we can create objects of value, and we can own and trade things there. Therefore, these digital worlds can become a kind of&nbsp;reality.</p> Making the Connection <p>But as the number of Metaverses grow, so do the challenges. How do you connect your individual identity, your “me”, in the physical universe with your identity in the Metaverse? How can you move and take things with you from one Metaverse – platform, game, or service — to another? When a user connects their real-life personality and bank account to their avatar, participates in a game, and buys or wins land or accessories, how do they manage their ownership of these goods? How can digital identity and continuation of ownership extend across Metaverses?</p> Identity in the Metaverse <p>Solutions to these challenges can be found using blockchain technology. Identity in the metaverse needs to be linked to the real-life person using it. A game in the Metaverse is more than a game. It also involves in-game purchases, so as a user, you need money, and you need to store your purchases somewhere. As a player you can build a reputation and want to bring that reputation with you to other games and platforms. You may not need to know your opponent’s real name or address, but you do need to be able to identify and trust who you’re talking to, playing against, or paying for a&nbsp;service.</p><p>Practically, there’s also a need to provide a way for the people who build the software to earn money. And virtual things in the virtual world connect to the real world. Already, the technology exists for brands in the real world to advertise in the metaverse. Virtual billboards are owned by real people who have part-ownership of this virtual billboard, can vote on what brands get to advertise, and can receive part of the profits from this advertising. This level of complexity requires new solutions.</p> Blockchain Solutions <p>This is the point we are at now, with Web3 infrastructure that makes this possible safely. While the current version of the internet runs on advertising, in the Metaverse, work and time are valued. The principles and structures of the real world apply: If I can create something that someone wants to own, I can create a business. Anyone can start producing digital goods and data, and getting paid for it. Work, even on a small scale, is valued and rewarded.</p><p>On a larger scale, blockchain technology also provides the ability to create Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), online organizations or companies in a virtual world that can connect to the real world. In a DAO, no one person takes responsibility or ownership, but there are rules that need to be followed. Although early DAOs failed with very public consequences — the most famous example lost the equivalent of around US$50 million worth of funding in a hack — with subsequent improvements in the technology, DAOs of the future can be created to be truly decentralized and safe, creating a whole new way of working. Anyone can work anywhere, and be paid in digital tokens that can be easily converted into the local currency.</p><p>But how do we avoid the mistakes made in Web2, where a few big corporations often have the monopoly on business and hold the data of many? Although blockchain has the potential for decentralization, it does not inherently give a guarantee of decentralization, as it can also be used to create private&nbsp;systems.</p><p>All technology is as good or bad as its users. Although it has often been criticized by mainstream sources as something that is used by criminals to hide their ill-gotten gains, the reality is that changes to a blockchain are generally very transparent, leaving a trail that is easy to follow once the initial address is&nbsp;known.</p><p>Equally, while data recorded on the blockchain can be changed, the fact that a change was made is evident. Data can be stored privately or publicly on the blockchain. Data can be distributed and stored in the cloud across several locations using services such as IPFS (the Interplanetary File System) or Filecoin. Data may be simply attested on the blockchain to say it exists or belongs to the specified owner, with only a record of the data or its owner rather than the data itself being recorded. Like everything else in life, the blockchain and its services are not black and white, and the need to do your own research (DYOR) and establish the decentralization of services you use is highly recommended.</p><p>Identity in the Metaverse is too important to be left to centralized companies. That’s where protocols like KILT come&nbsp;in.</p> KILT Protocol <p><a href="https://www.kilt.io/">KILT</a> was built to counter monopolies and their poor handling of user data, specifically addressing the issues of digital identity in Web3. Run using on-line, transparent governance by the community of token holders, it’s a decentralized network that uses blockchain.</p><p>In the real world, identity is made up of an identifier — for example, your name — that is linked to credentials, such as your passport, driving license, qualifications, skills, etc. All these things together make up who you&nbsp;are.</p><p>KILT replicates this in the digital world. Digital identity is built around a decentralized identifier — a unique string of numbers and letters specific to you — and any credentials you choose to add to this identity. Credentials in the physical world can be recreated in digital form and remain with you, not with an external company, until you choose to show them. Nothing is stored on the blockchain except a proof that the credentials are still valid. Using this method means that companies can, for example, do KYC (know your customer) checks without needing to store data, reducing centralized silos that are a honeypot for hackers. Your identity belongs to you, and no external service can deny you access to your credentials.</p><p>This is the kind of decentralized identity service that is essential for the Metaverse.</p> The Way&nbsp;Forward <p>The changes the Metaverse brings will probably have as big an impact on our lives as the development of the smartphone. While these changes can have many benefits, they also come with the risk of repeating the mistakes of the past, handing control of our data and digital freedom to large corporations. These corporations potentially end up having even more power over us than our government does. Thanks to blockchain technology, we now have the tools to avoid recreating these&nbsp;issues.</p><p>Decentralization is essential for the Metaverse and has the ability to return the power to us, the users of the internet. As we move into this new era, it would serve us well to make informed choices, starting&nbsp;now.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/moving-through-the-metaverse-the-path-of-decentralization-6a3e7df739a">Moving Through the Metaverse: The Path of Decentralization</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>A happy customer is a repeat customer. You might have heard that phrase a lot and for a good reason. An eCommerce business cannot survive without clients who are willing to pay frequently.</p><p>While new customers are hard to acquire and often lead to increased marketing costs, current customers can significantly boost your sales process and optimize your marketing strategy. What is customer retention and how does it affect your finances? Let’s find&nbsp;out.</p> What is Customer Retention? <p>Customer retention is an important part of customer relationship management, and achieving it requires more than just keeping customers happy. It is key to any business, but it can be especially important for eCommerce businesses. As customer retention goes up, so does the lifetime value of your customer — but this only happens when you have excellent customer service. So, how can you retain customers and what are the benefits of their loyalty? Let’s&nbsp;see.</p> Why is Customer Retention Important? <p>If you want to lay your success on customer loyalty and build a thriving brand, then it’s critical to keep your customers happy. The best way for businesses to get better results is by listening to their feedback and addressing their concerns as soon as possible. Customer retention isn’t just about retaining your customers — it’s about knowing what they want and anticipating their&nbsp;needs.</p> 1. Reduced Marketing Costs <p>Without a doubt, keeping your existing customers will bring a lot of value to the company. Instead of spending a fortune to acquire new customers, which isn’t guaranteed, you can decrease your marketing spending and allocate finances to other departments.</p><p>Retaining your existing clients is not just about saving a critical budget. And it also contributes to a company’s growth and raises its credibility in the eyes of other consumers.</p> 2. Word of Mouth Marketing <p>We’ve all heard about the most legacy way to attract more customers — by word of mouth marketing. Customers make up your best advocates or your harshest critics, and you can decide who they will be by how you treat&nbsp;them.</p><p>When you take care of customers, they’ll want to tell everyone about your service. If you take advantage of this power and use this capability to maintain a positive brand image, you’re set up for&nbsp;success.</p> 3. Increased Revenue <p>You’ve heard about the Pareto principle. 80% of the revenue comes from 20% of your clients. While it’s not 100% right, it’s very close to the truth, believe me. Loyal customers tend to spend a lot more than new customers, and the customer lifetime value can reach up to tenfold the first&nbsp;order.</p><p>Of course, to lift your revenue, you need to have all hands on deck — from the delivery guy to the customer service team, marketing department, and everyone in the&nbsp;chain.</p> How to Choose the Best Customer Retention Tool <p>There are many customer retention tools on the market. But there should be a way to differentiate the best from the good&nbsp;ones.</p> Find your customers’ needs <p>In the early stages of your business, the one thing you need to keep working on is understanding what your customers want. I know you want to charge ahead and create new products, but unless your customers want them, they won’t&nbsp;sell.</p><p>Keep listening and learning from your feedback loop — aim to gather information on how your customers prefer to pay, engage with your brand, or give feedback — because this will help you provide more personalized experiences.</p> Look for the right&nbsp;solution <p>To grow a business, you need to keep customers loyal. Luckily for you, there’s no shortage of customer retention tools to choose from — while a few are reasonably priced and effective, others fall under the premium segment. Experiment with different features, look at your budget and choose the best option that fits your&nbsp;needs.</p> The 15 Best Customer Retention Tools on the&nbsp;Market <p>Let’s see which customer retention tools top our list&nbsp;today.</p> 1. Zendesk — The King of Customer&nbsp;Service <p>Zendesk is a help desk software utilizing integrations and automation to enable customers to fix different problems — saving you time and increasing customer loyalty. Zendesk builds each of its products to solve specific pain points in customer experience.</p><p>Optimized for large organizations, it has become a widespread tool for managing customer problems and facilitating communication between businesses and customers.</p><p>Prices start at $49/month on an annual plan, but you will get a lot of features — like an industry-leading ticketing system, over 1,000 apps and integrations, a smooth user interface, and up to 500 automated answers.</p> 2. Hubspot — The Gatling Gun of&nbsp;CRMs <p>While many tools are available to help marketers improve their outreach, Hubspot can be considered the best of its kind. And no, it’s not just hype: the software has dozens of features, including dynamic personalization, custom data analysis, customer satisfaction surveys, omnichannel automation, A/B testing, and predictive lead&nbsp;scoring.</p><p>Of course, that doesn’t come cheap. The starter plan costs $45/month, but it is nowhere as good as the advanced ones. Businesses with lots of customer data and contacts may pay thousands of dollars to get hold of the platform. While it’s a great customer engagement platform, it’s not a solution targeted at everyday small businesses.</p> 3. Optimizely — test, test, test,&nbsp;repeat <p>Optimizely helps businesses transform their digital products through the power of experimentation from startups to large enterprises. By leveraging the platform’s top-notch web, mobile, and API testing solutions, businesses can easily create personalized experiences for their audience and make data-driven decisions with confidence.</p><p>Optimizely empowers marketers to generate leads, increase conversions, and boost sales through personalized marketing campaigns.</p><p>If you can afford to spend between $50,000 and $200,000 per year on software, you can gain more loyal customers, reward returning customers, and identify repeat customers and new prospects.</p> 4. Qualaroo <p>Qualaroo provides a simple, straightforward way of collecting real-time feedback from your customers — whether you’re looking to improve the customer experience on your website or you want to understand what’s working and what&nbsp;isn’t.</p><p>Qualaroo is ideal for both. Its easy-to-use surveys and insightful data help businesses collect intelligence and make better decisions.</p><p>To be fair, this is one of the more budget solutions on the list. It starts at $80 per month, but for $160/month, you can get more than decent features — like integrations, branding, advanced targeting, and exit&nbsp;surveys.</p> 5. Zoho&nbsp;CRM <p>Zoho is a business software suite that businesses can use to make their lives easier. With over 50 online apps such as Zoho Docs, Zoho Books, and Zoho Expense, it can help keep track of everything you need, from inventory and projects to employee expenses and customer&nbsp;orders.</p><p>Zoho provides affordable customer retention business software for SMBs to manage time, projects, and client relations without the overhead cost of dedicated enterprise solutions.</p><p>The Indian platform has a free plan for up to 3 users, but the other plans are reasonably priced. For SMBs who want to elevate their customer retention rate, a Standard plan costs $14/month, and the Professional plan costs $23/month.</p><p>But even the most premium one (the Ultimate) is not expensive — $52/month. Bear in mind these prices are at an annual&nbsp;rate.</p> 6. LoyalZoo <p>The LoyalZoo software lets businesses of all shapes and sizes create customer loyalty programs that appeal to their customers’ unique needs. LoyalZoo is easy to set up and use to avoid having much trouble with the platform.</p><p>Businesses can then share the reward system online and on mobile with their customers — orchestrating a seamless customer experience that’s both efficient and highly rewarding.</p><p>The platform is relatively cheap, and it charges per store rather than per user, which is a massive boost. $47 is the base plan. If you want to create SMS marketing campaigns, you will have to pay $30 extra, but it is totally worth&nbsp;it.</p> 7. Thanx <p>Thanx has taken digital and brick-and-mortar loyalty programs to the next level. Businesses can reach out to their best customers and deliver a personalized experience without the inconveniences of old-fashioned, manually updated&nbsp;details.</p><p>By streamlining the system and creating an algorithm that automatically rewards regular customers, Thanx helps businesses crank over the wheel of their most profitable customers.</p><p>Considering some previous options, the prices start from $99 per month, which isn’t cheap. Nonetheless, not many apps allow you to interact with guests, so the app is worth a shot. Let me try it,&nbsp;Thanx!</p> 8. Yotpo <p>Yotpo helps businesses build relationships with current and potential customers. Their eCommerce marketing software allows users to leverage customer feedback to improve lead generation and sales. The platform features a centralized location where users can publish content, conduct polls, and collect&nbsp;reviews.</p><p>The system stores all the data related to the customer and their purchase history. It helps businesses grow by being sure that they are offering a satisfactory shopping experience to their customers.</p><p>Yotpo starts at $19/month (the Growth plan). However, as your needs grow, so does the pricing. The Prime plan costs $59/month, but you should have deeper pockets if you want to access AI-powered predictive segmentation and unlimited A/B testing. That’s what you pay for using a legacy name in the industry.</p> 9. Mailchimp <p>Seriously, is there a chart where Mailchimp doesn’t participate? Jokes aside, Mailchimp is an all-in-one marketing tool that can help you increase your reach while reducing your costs. Its built-in eCommerce features, landing pages, and digital ads have helped a lot of businesses in their growth&nbsp;journey.</p><p>And due to its powerful integrations with Zapier, Slack, Canva, and WordPress, it is set up for success. So, yes, it is on our list for a&nbsp;reason!</p><p>The software is also very balanced in terms of pricing. It has a generous free plan, and the starting plan is only $11/month. Of course, it can reach more than $1,300 for 200k+ contact in your email list, but still — it has something for everyone.</p> 10. Heap Analytics <p>Heap Analytics is so much more than a client retention tool. From understanding customer behavior to improving personalized experiences, Heap can be used to enrich your business. The best part? They’ve got an intuitive interface that even people who aren’t tech-savvy can&nbsp;use.</p><p>The platform is refined and very detailed. Well, you price the price for it is steep — the Growth plan starts at $3,600 per year, but it can get tenfold the&nbsp;amount.</p> 11. Litmus <p>Using Litmus’ robust tools, you can create beautiful and effective emails that will engage your customers. With these email templates and drag-and-drop elements, and Litmus’ expertise, you can make sure most campaigns resonate with your potential and current customers.</p><p>It’s all about making your customers feel in control of their experience with your&nbsp;brand.</p><p>Litmus Basic starts at $79/month, but if you have a small team, you can jump to Litmus Plus — it costs $159/month, but it gives you five user seats, as well as spam testing, QA testing, code editor, and productivity integrations all at the same&nbsp;place.</p> 12. Amplitude <p>Amplitude gives you all the tools to analyze user behavior to know what’s working and what isn’t. With features like grouping users based on their activities and recording information down to the session level, Amplitude helps your business understand which parts keep customers engaged.</p><p>It’s a leading platform, but you can’t see any pricing when you go to the website. You can find sources online that indicate you have to pay between $5,000 and $100,000 per year, so you’ll spend a&nbsp;lot.</p> 13. Crazy&nbsp;Egg <p>Crazy Egg’s heatmaps allow users to see where their visitors are clicking and what webpages are, resulting in qualified leads. The tool automatically creates A/B tests for essential landing pages so that brands can increase conversion from visitors to leads, sales, and more loyal customers.</p><p>There are no free plans, but Crazy Egg doesn’t charge a fortune either. Its pricing plan starts from $24 per month up to $249 per month, and it’s worth the cost of the product. With over 300,000 users, it’s on the list of best tools to generate heat maps and simple click-tracking data.</p> 14. Woorise <p>Woorise is a one-stop-shop for all of your marketing needs. This customer retention tool provides the features to create engaging contests, landing pages, and giveaways. Build your email list and drive new sales by offering a fabulous prize and incentivizing people to&nbsp;enter.</p><p>Make your brand fantastic! A well-designed landing page can help you raise leads, generate sales, and build your database at lightning speed.</p><p>Woorise is so well-built, but also it is very reasonably priced. There is a free plan, and the starting plan is only $23/month. The Grow plan is $39/month, and Pro starts at $79, but it won’t exceed $900 per&nbsp;month.</p> 15. Monetha for&nbsp;Business <p>Monetha for business (monetha.io/business) is a part of the Monetha platform that allows shops easily create their loyalty programs, and these points can be used within the whole Monetha platform. On top of that, you get built-in customer analytics and a chance to join the network of&nbsp;Monetha.</p><p>It’s a very ambitious project, and it even has a cryptocurrency coin (MTH)! Monetha is arguably an up-and-coming customer retention tool with a bright future for its&nbsp;worth.</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/retention-tool/">https://www.monetha.io</a>.</p>

 DM Note #8: On Art, Imagination Infrastructures, and Shared Memories of the&nbsp;Future <p>This is the 8th in a series of DM notes, which share information and insights from DM Downloads — our regular internal learning sessions. The aim is to make our practice more legible, for us as well as for&nbsp;you.</p><p>DM Note #8 is an opportunity to reflect together on the role of art: in making the future present; in expressing our ideas in ways that are more tangible and visceral at early stages; in building imagination as a civic-infrastructure for tomorrow’s societies; in valourizing “softer” and often neglected ways of knowing and exploring; and a lot&nbsp;more.</p><p>DM might have started with a design and architecture focus, but it’s become increasingly transdisciplinary, including expertise in: financial structuring, governance innovation, international law, real estate, policy and regulatory design, and full stack development. In this DM Note, we reflect on the role that art plays (or could play) in our practice.</p>Our Free House initiative, whose various parts are being developed with different partners in various locations, had its first material incarnation at the <a href="https://museumofthefuture.ae/en">Museum of the Future</a> in Dubai recently, as a small model with augmented reality. Building Imagination Infrastructures <p>We work on various novel, entangled, tangible and intangible types of civic infrastructure (<a href="https://treesasinfrastructure.com/#/">Trees As Infrastructure</a> being one of the most advanced examples), and recently we have started exploring imagination infrastructure, which falls within intangible infrastructure. Here’s our current working definition for intangible infrastructuring, which Linnéa, Mihai and Anjeline have been working on within&nbsp;DM:</p><blockquote>the shared recipes, relationships, and abilities that underpin society’s social, ecological, and economic&nbsp;systems.</blockquote><blockquote>It refers to the process of using and creating these to scaffold functionings and values at a societal&nbsp;scale.</blockquote><blockquote>They emerge through interactive processes between diverse actors and tangible structures in a given context, relative to each actor’s conversion factor.</blockquote><blockquote>Intangibles enable the reduction of fundamental uncertainty, prevention of damage, and most importantly fulfill conditions for societal thriving.</blockquote><p>At an event in June 2021 organized by the <a href="https://www.tnlcommunityfund.org.uk/">Community Fund</a>, Indy from Dark Matter Labs was on a panel discussing how we define infrastructure, and unpicking what it means to use the term in the context of something as intangible as imagination.</p><p>When we think of infrastructure, we might think of roads or telephone lines, durable built environments, technologies that encode relationships and political ideas, and structures that drive how we interact with each other. Infrastructures are collective and cooperative ways of supporting our individual and shared agency and our ability to live our lives according to certain values. The juxtaposition between infrastructure and imagination is useful because it reminds us that imagination doesn’t happen as stroke of genius, it requires scaffolding, especially when thinking about collective imagining.</p><p>Since the beginning of the pandemic, our challenge was somehow to collaborate globally to return to the normal we knew, while the climate breakdown requires us to collaborate at various scales around transitioning into a new normal. How can we build a deeper democracy of the imagination, so as to better be able to see and feel the kind of futures we want and need? How to do so in a way that is intrinsically motivated, and contextually enabled? How to liberate other ways of sensing and knowing that allows our minds to help each other travel to places unknown, in new expressions of our shared humanity? And how to do that in a context where uncertainty and complexity seems to be increasing?</p><p>This won’t happen all by itself; it will also require significant care and investment. It can easily be dismissed by governments and policy makers as a simple nice-to-have that can’t be a priority right now, but it is increasingly fundamental if we are to organize into bigger and bigger groups of humans and transition towards more regenerative futures that we can’t yet see or feel. Repeating facts about climate change is part of the work of changing how we understand our roles and impact in this world, but it is insufficient by&nbsp;itself.</p> Experiencing Possibilities Now: Economic Art as a&nbsp;Practice <p>From early childhood we are trained to believe that a good amount of money corresponds to a safe life, a happy life. In some senses that is true, but it has created a snowball effect where there is no clear idea on how much capital one single person actually needs to be, and feel, safe and&nbsp;happy.</p><p>For people and organizations attempting to thrive in this tumultuous time, fixed mindsets and stagnated approaches no longer work. To create a better future where everyone can flourish, leaders and organizations need to find brave ways to engage and encourage emotions more fully, but also truly comprehend how they connect us to the economic systems we have&nbsp;created.</p><p>How can we make more concrete and palpable new economic systems with experiences that guide us through deeper exploration in soft values, vulnerability, culture, dark matter, unknowns, emotions, radical innovation, gender, politics, economy, storytelling.</p><p>This is what Jenny from DM has been exploring from Sweden, in partnership with SVID. Within Economic Spaces, we have started working on public art installations and exhibitions. We share our thoughts and what has come out of learning, studying and discussing with partners, organizations and citizens with both shared and oppositional mindsets. The purpose of these installations is to create real world tangible experiences of future economic possibilities whilst prototyping the dark matter innovations necessary for this&nbsp;future.</p><p>Through art we can emotionally introduce ourselves to a whole new set of experiences and ideas that we may have never witnessed before. Rather than only discussing climate change, economic powers and human behaviours through distant science and hard-to-grasp technological language we can provide space to emotionally connect our experience of the world through current realities.</p><p>“Economy” encompasses more than money and finance; in the recent DM Download Jenny framed economy as the larger, more holistic space in which we interact and share, care (or not), perform acts of generosity and create mindsets for a sustainable future. In this sense, an economy can be softer, more emotional and filled with innovation. Economic Spaces is an exploration in having new dialogues about all of these types of economies. It is an invitation to be remarkably creative in finding new ways to explore an economy with a comprehensive understanding that we are&nbsp;free.</p><p>The Use of Participatory Futuring <br>to Craft Shared Memories of the&nbsp;Future</p><p>Hollywood blockbusters and Netflix series made countless films imagining the end of the planet as we know it, from alien invasions to fertility decline, yet none that shows a plausible end and desirable alternative to the problematic aspects of our current economic systems.&nbsp;Why?</p><p>Partly because we live in an age of communicative capitalism where our attention span is being fought over by multinational corporations, where short-termism is the norm across sectors, <a href="https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2015/05/the-science-of-scarcity">where inequalities and scarcity steals mental capacity beyond more urgent needs</a>, and where the most visible long term visions are those of billionaire space explorers, authoritative governments and private tech companies. Furthermore, our collective imagination is constrained by inherited 19th-century world economic models that have become second nature; like water to a fish. As a consequence, our future is colonized by our past and the few, and our imagination is constrained to the point of feeling almost&nbsp;broken.</p><p>But it is not broken; we just need better imagination infrastructure which, unlike state-led top-down propaganda of the past world wars, will provide us with more legitimate and collectively-led narratives towards socio-ecological transition. It might be easy to dismiss powerful stories and narratives in the necessary social transformations to come, but it would be underestimating how essential it has always been in enabling large-scale numbers of humans to cooperate effectively in history. Unlike other animals that evolve only through their DNA alone, humans can bypass their genome through cultural evolution.</p><p>As Jonathan from DM in Montreal pointed out in his presentation, the army and large corporations have already been hiring science fiction writers to better anticipate and predict the future, but where are similar resources for society’s shared transitions? Humans are not as rational as the age of enlightenment might have made us believe. As we are entering the age of entanglement, we will need to not only plan for better futures but also to imagine and experience them today in a manner that is so visceral that we start building memories of these futures and start caring about the generations that will inherit them. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23846418/">According to neuroscience research, going through an immersive experiment of futuring activates the regions of the brain associated with memory</a>. We are literally creating memories of the future, which can help keep ideas viscerally alive in a community passed short-term political cycles.</p><p>Call it cathedral thinking, but for our economic&nbsp;systems.</p>A preview of the workshop on the future of rights of nature — Biosphère, Montréal<p>In 2019 DM organized a workshop at the Biosphere in Montreal on natural ecosystems, as part of the preliminary reflection with <a href="https://radicle.studio/">Radicle</a> and ExpoLive leading to the Dubai World Expo and with the McConnell Foundation. We invited various Indigenous leaders, scientists, environmental activists and legal experts to reflect on the future of rights of nature in Canada. We started with a preliminary scenario of five rivers being granted rights of nature in 2040, and the challenges and possibilities that would emerge from that. We then invited the participants to speak in the present tense about life around them in 2040. The first person to speak began: “Since I became the first Indigenous Prime Minister of Canada last year, I decided to…”. and instantly, a higher level of creativity and freedom flew through the conversation. Instead of bumping against each other’s current positions, people were weaving their imaginations together to embody the full complexity they represented into a future scenario.</p><p>Two years later, <a href="https://www.ledevoir.com/societe/environnement/596053/la-riviere-magpie-obtient-le-statut-de-personnalite-juridique">when the first river was granted rights of nature in Québec</a>, Jonathan from DM shared that the first thought that came to mind was “Oh, I remember that”. Because it “happened” in that workshop, without any sophisticated immersive media or technology; just through the power of shared projection and imagination. What could we achieve if we brought that to a whole new collective level, using all the power of the most recent advances in media, art and technologies?</p>Some case studies of the role of art, culture and digital technologies, in participatory futuring (In&nbsp;French) From Strategic Foresight to Participatory Futuring <p>As the growing uncertainty of the world is recognized, methods such as predictive forecasting that pretend to predict the future have become almost antiquated, while strategic foresight has become increasingly used by various levels of government and institutions as a way not to predict the future, but to prepare strategies that are robust across a range of plausible futures.</p><p>However, as explained by Nesta in this<a href="https://www.nesta.org.uk/report/our-futures-people-people/"> report on participatory futures</a> (which we inspired ourselves from for this work): rarely are the strategic foresight exercises moving beyond a few actors (small groups of academics, corporations, and government teams) or beyond certain mediums (written reports with a few diagrams). Participatory Futuring aims at creating a democratized body of collective intelligence on exploring and shaping the future using some of the most engaging, visceral, and tangible cultural, mediatic, and artistic tools out&nbsp;there.</p><p>Engaging groups in this process has the promise of creating better policy-making, more effective socialization of emerging technologies, and greater legitimacy for hard decisions, as well as creating the constituencies for long-term change that can survive political cycles, through the creation of shared memories of the&nbsp;future.</p><p>This process involves working together&nbsp;to:</p>Inspired by <a href="https://medium.com/r?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nesta.org.uk%2Freport%2Four-futures-people-people%2F">Nesta’s Report</a> — Our Futures: By the people, for the&nbsp;people<p>Participatory Futures set out to bring people together to think about the future and inform collective actions in the present. The involvement of, for example, artists in the process invites people to engage in the process without defaulting to the limits of traditional problem framing, or the rational, linguistic categories that may constrain the full range of possibility and&nbsp;desire.</p><p>The design of a participatory futures exercise depends on the strategic impact desired, the scale of engagement, and the way the future or alternative futures are going to be used. Through many case studies we looked into, it’s increasingly clear that art and culture are crucial to cultivating long-term attitudes and behaviours. They are foundational in shaping our collective direction of travel, from the kinds of laws we make, to the technology we develop, to the way we think about our role in shaping the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Over the past few years, Dark Matter Labs explored this emergent practice thanks to the support of the<a href="https://mcconnellfoundation.ca/fr/accueil/"> McConnell Foundation</a>, and worked on various exploratory pieces of research relevant to the topic, including the<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/futures-in-long-termism-16c1745c361c"> Futures in Longtermism series</a> and the Future Generation Desk at the Office of Rules and Norms, initially hosted at the Art Faculty of Concordia University in Montreal. For this last one, we worked with two researchers, Joelle and Maddy, to answer the following question: How can we invite future generations in present negotiations to influence current decision-making processes? The<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vuuo-VF17ooPyPnJKmTVVzyeCPUXHpUN/view"> final report</a> explores the diverse possibilities of theatrical, interpersonal experimentations and creative bureaucratic practices for long-term decision-making.<a href="https://www.orn.studio/research-projects/inviting-future-generations"> Read more about it&nbsp;here.</a></p><p>We are also looking to explore how art could be channelled into the development of Radicle Civics — looking at how art as a social practice could expand the comprehension of now and allow us to see the world differently, and shift the Overton window. <a href="https://radiclecivics.cc/">Please do stay in touch here if you’re interested.</a></p>Summary Slide from <a href="https://radiclecivics.cc/">Radicle&nbsp;Civics</a> Art as the Next Frontier of our Transdisciplinarity: <br>Political Legitimacy and Movement&nbsp;Building <p>In January 2020, at the dawn of the coronavirus crisis that would soon shake global society to its core, Quebec’s TVA network began airing a series titled <a href="https://www.qub.ca/tvaplus/tva/epidemie">Épidémie</a> (Epidemic) about the outbreak of… a coronavirus</p><p>The parallels between the fictional show and reality are astounding: the same type of virus (Coronavirus) with a similar name (Cova instead of Covid), challenges in getting people to take the virus seriously, racism linked to the origin of the outbreak (in the show, people call it the “Inuit virus”), shortages in vital supplies such as masks,&nbsp;etc…</p><p>How did that happen? The screenwriters based their scenario on scientific papers and predictions from health organizations, but brought it to a much wider audience than traditional reports could ever dream&nbsp;of.</p><p>Uncanny to say the least, this eerie parallel between fiction and reality-to-come is indicative of the ways in which creative speculations on the future can illuminate pitfalls of current ways of thinking and living and accurately depict catastrophes to come and ways to address them — the same way fire emergency and evacuation rehearsals have become mainstream in many buildings.</p><p>What if that TV show had been done years ago, not only as entertainment, but as a way to better anticipate known risks to come and better prepare for it together?</p><p>Traditional policy making as usual simply hasn’t had all the answers. Can the Arts sector — under pressure with increasing reduced or restricted funding streams and the impact of Covid-19 — be empowered and more importantly equipped with the resources to provide some new policy tools? Can the Arts sector help civil society to mobilize and find solutions and tools to address the wicked problems of our society in new ways? Zehra argued in her presentation that the civic movement to address certain wicked problems such as climate change is already there — at least in the UK, and that DML and many other organizations looking at using Art and imagination infrastructure can help provide the tools and direction for the right interventions. One example of that is our recent involvement with UNDP North Macedonia, where we did some very preliminary work on how to think of imagination Infrastructure as scaffolding for distributed collaborative capabilities at a national&nbsp;level.</p>Here’s a preliminary process that we are working on of how participatory futuring could work at a societal scale (in&nbsp;French)<p>Indeed, to mobilize systems change, the state has to enable and provide the scaffolding for distributed collaborative capabilities across society. In this age of complexity, top down government is neither sustainable given the scope and scale of interventions required, nor effective given the range of actors involved in an interconnected nation system. Moreover, the increased risks faced by the nation system need bold interventions that require building legitimacy across society for such&nbsp;actions.</p><p>The<a href="https://www.mackinac.org/7504"> Overton Window</a> is a model for understanding how ideas in society change over time and influence politics. The core concept is that politicians are limited in what policy ideas they can support — they generally only pursue policies that are widely accepted across society as legitimate policy options. This window of politically acceptable options is primarily defined not by what politicians prefer, but rather by what they believe they can support and still win re-election or secure election. However, the Overton Window can shift and expand to include different policy options when ideas change in the society that elects&nbsp;them.</p><p>We have to build the imagination infrastructure of society as whole because currently the limitation is not what politicians can say or do, but rather our collective sense-making as to the future — that can then become a reinforcement for political action. Without investing in societal sense-making of the future, we cannot create pathways for transition as the Overton window is currently too small to deal with the scale of the challenge presented by this age of uncertainty.</p><p>Imagination infrastructure constructs the space for the organizational transformation that Governments require to meet the challenge of transition. This learning process also allows the public to recognize that there are no linear futures. It fundamentally transforms the relationship between citizens and the state to a new societal contract. The question becomes not what can a Government do but how will it do&nbsp;so.</p><p>Imagination infrastructure provides a simple structure to shift the Overton window from politicians to communities. Civic duty is moved far beyond merely exercising a right to vote to becoming part of a more inclusive, deliberative democracy that can hold our interdependencies. This is about democratizing the future, enabling citizens to dream and contribute to shaping our collective futures. It builds trust and a new language of the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Furthermore, the reality has been that too much of Government policy has been based on the imagination of a few policy makers or legislators, and that can create blindspots. Imagination infrastructure serves to break down the silos in the machinery of the state. It democratizes the ability to create the shared worlds that further unlock hallmarks of humanity (such as creativity and care). It builds the societal capacity to deliver the NDS with a whole of society approach, and new societal sense making capabilities for the&nbsp;future.</p>Governance as system transition challenge — From our <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/nextgengov-the-big-boring-bureaucratic-revolution-39ccc3a6c9f8">#NextGenGov (the Big Boring Bureaucratic Revolution) blog</a> in November&nbsp;2018 Strategic considerations to build political momentum around imagination infrastructures:   Increasingly difficult + vital — We live in an age of disinformation, increased polarization and distractions, and difficult living conditions, yet this work has never been more important. Furthermore, given that many political and government actors are dealing with scarce resources, it might be difficult to convince public authorities that this kind of imaginative and futuristic take on governance and planning is worth spending time or money on. How to reconcile these tensions?  Lack of evidence / The challenge of the first mover — Often governments won’t be able to justify investing in that kind of practices until it proves effective. Evidence based reductionist / analytical thinking is currently the dominant style, and proving that other forms of knowing could provide serious insights for decision makers might be a challenge, especially since there isn’t yet clear impact measurements for participatory futuring mechanisms, as Nesta justly points out in its report. Yet if every actor waits for that evidence, we will never move forward. Where do we even create authorizing spaces for that kind of work with governments, and who will be willing to be the first movers and investors on&nbsp;this?  Long term and expensive — Much of this work cannot be done on a tight budget or short term, which goes against many current constraints. How do we build that in? How do we create, restructure or reorient current funding opportunities to be open to that kind of work, whether it comes from the art and media sectors, public participation offices, or others? One example is<a href="https://canadacouncil.ca/funding/strategic-funds/strategic-innovation-fund"> the new strategic innovation fund</a> from the Canada Council for the Art, which we have contributed to the reflection of in the past few&nbsp;years.  Communities of practice and impact — One pathway to success is to build a coalition of collaborators — that each have a value system that is truly open and about citizen engagement. Of course a lot of this work is very contextual, but there can still be shared resources on some levels. How do we learn across experiments in a way that informs everyone? What strategies for network development help scale ﬁndings in ways that are accessible and deployable beyond the limits of each&nbsp;project?  Becoming legitimate / Being taken seriously — There can be a gender and race dynamic with this work. Women (and qualities that have been reduced to femininity) and ethnic minority practitioners (and their deeply culturally rooted alternative worldviews) will say this sort of work is hard enough to do, but you also struggle to be taken seriously doing “softer work” as a woman, ethnic minority person, etc. Can we build concrete utility and social legitimacy around these conceptual and practical approaches to knowledge production, for the benefit of&nbsp;all?  Building shared language across practices — This work requires interdisciplinary working;rtists, policy and finance specialists, etc.. Language tailored to our audience matters, but many practitioners needed aren’t used to do this work either. How do we train both artists and non-artists in engaging with participatory futuring methods, for instance? How do we connect the right artists and arts practices with the right opportunity or challenge?  Impact measurement / Evaluation — What methods can we use to frame explicit, anticipated goals, and take meaningful measurement of impact? <br>What methods of data collection and interpretation ensure results are transferable? How does measurement and evaluation feedback into framing methodology?   The potential roles of art in our practice:   Art for internal sense-making — How to walk the talk with how we design the organization and our initiatives?  Art as a strategy for engagement — How can art help us organize communities of practice around complex&nbsp;topics?  Art as change-making and subversive agent — How can art accelerate the materialization of our ideas by intervening in grey areas of regulation  Art as pedagogy — How to make public various forces and forms of influence that are often invisible  Art as decision-making — How to reorient modes of knowing and deliberating so that they take into consideration more&nbsp;aspects  Art as shared joy — How can working and living with art make our lives more meaningful and&nbsp;joyful.   The role of the art&nbsp;sector <p>As we wrote about with<a href="https://massculture.ca/"> Mass Culture</a> and<a href="https://metcalffoundation.com/publication/art-and-the-world-after-this/"> David Maggs</a> in Canada, the relationship between art and society has always been in flux, the past few years has been unprecedented thanks to four distinct disruptions: The disruption of activity, stemming from COVID-19; the disruption of society, emerging from rising social unrest; the disruption of industry, based on the digital revolution; and the disruption of world, rooted in the sustainability crisis. Here, the arts sector finds its business model on life support, its purchase on the public imagination in decline, and its relationship to social issues insufficient. As we try to reinvigorate the relationship between art and society, two linked capacities may be helpful: 1) identify an explicit grasp of its unique value proposition — what does art do better than anything else?; 2) couple that recognition with an increased capacity to understand social challenges in terms of the capacity we offer — what are the arts-shaped holes in our worlds right&nbsp;now?</p><p>Happily, the answer is, many. An increasing number of challenges have reached the limits of rational, analytical problem-solving and are searching for ways to transform traditional thinking, shift collective practice, and reimagine underlying assumptions. As a result, arts-shaped holes are emerging everywhere. Consider climate change. Here, the science and technology of the crisis are largely resolved. We know enough about the problem and have the solutions needed to fix it. And yet our imaginative horizons balk at a post-carbon existence. So just when many countries’ arts sector is on the ropes, the capacities of creative practices are emerging as critical to some of our most urgent needs. Here we arrive at the relationship between art and social transformation.</p><p>How do the arts contribute meaningfully to challenges in socio-ecological transformations without simply defaulting to communication exercises? How do we bring the elusive agency of the aesthetic to concrete social problems? And how do we measure the effects of having done so? The art space has the potential to expand the boundaries of the current legitimate conversation — vital to making the transition — by asking key structural questions, questions outside the current orthodoxy of thinking, acting and doing; and yet critical from our perspective.</p> A shift in our hearts, bodies and&nbsp;minds <p>This work might require an important shift, because we have been trained to value forms of sensing and knowledge that can be more easily demonstrable and measured in a certain way, and to repress others as invalid, illegitimate, impertinent, not very serious, or too soft. The kind of work we are discussing in this DM Note can’t be done via the analytical brain alone, and requires us to be more vulnerable, by jumping into the unknown with others, with no assurance of what exactly will come out of it, yet hoping for the needed visceral and exciting shared memories of futures we want to work towards together.</p><p>And if it’s true that experiencing effective participatory futuring exercises can create shared “memories” of the future, how can we build from what we understand about the brain and memory functions to build a more collective imagination infrastructure?</p><p>We end this DM Note with some inspiration from Pixar’s movie Inside Out.&nbsp;;-)</p> Get in&nbsp;touch <p>If you enjoyed this 8th DM Note, you can clap the article to show appreciation,<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/dm-note-4-2aa2636e581e"> read all of our previous notes here</a>, and follow us on Medium for more.

“Pairwise Trust” now available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdxkDzQOsFI&amp;t=48s">MetaMUI&nbsp;SSID</a><p>In the ever-evolving digital society, one of the most important thing is to control one’s digital identity and digital property. Since the invention of the internet, it has brought great advantages for people to send, receive and exchange information, data, and even money through the web in real time. The internet has given us an exciting space and boundless possibilities. However, at the same time, it brings great risks and responsibilities to users, although many people have not noticed it&nbsp;yet.</p><p>There are many risks while using the internet, and one of the critical issues for all the internet users is that the users can get damages by accessing a wrong website by putting wrong address, or entering a phishing website with exposing personal data. Some people might say that it won’t happen to them, but in reality, it actually happens and can happen to all the internet users. It causes lots of property damage, and personal information leakage.</p><p>In 2019, the FBI(Federal Bureau of Investigation) documented a record $3.5 billion in losses due to internet crimes (<a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2019-internet-crime-report-released-021120">2019 Internet Crime Report Released</a>) and in 2021, the losses became almost doubled($6.9 billion). (<a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2021_IC3Report.pdf">2021 Internet Crime&nbsp;Report</a>)</p>Internet Crime Statistics for last 5 Years <br>(<a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2021_IC3Report.pdf">“2021 Internet Crime&nbsp;Report”</a>)<p>As mentioned earlier, these internet crimes usually happen to the users who registered their personal information to a wrong website or provide personal data to a web service provider which sells the data to unknown third&nbsp;parties.</p><p>To prevent these billions of losses and crimes, and make the internet a safe and reliable place, MetaMUI team has developed an ultimate blockchain-based identification solution called “Pairwise Trust”. Pairwise Trust is a security protocol that verifies the identities of both parties in a transaction simultaneously, powered by Two-Way Cryptographic Binding.</p><p>Pairwise Trust runs on MetaMUI, the world’s first identity-based blockchain, and 4th generation blockchain which provide the Identity Blockchain. In MetaMUI, users can create their own DID by submitting their personal information(KYC) to one of the Sidechain Operators, and the operator will decide whether approving or denying the request depending on the status of the submitted data. Once the request is approved, the user’s personal data get hashed, and the hashed data is safely stored in the user’s device. In the case of Public DIDs, a KYC provider is exclusively operated by MetaMUI, so operators such as all other stores, banks, and public institutions can have their own public DIDs with the approval of&nbsp;MetaMUI.</p><p>Non-individual companies and institutions will be issued a Public DID rather than a Personal DID, and the issued Public DID will be disclosed as a Public DID on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdxkDzQOsFI&amp;t=2s">MetaMUI SSID</a>. Users can access the correct website by searching and clicking on the Public DID in the MetaMUI SSID. Furthermore, MetaMUI SSID supports an integrated DID log in solution. It enables the users to log in any websites without registering a new ID and password but only with DID. Once a user log in through MetaMUI SSID app with his/her DID and connect to online stores by searching it on the Public DID list, the user can safely buy goods, groceries and products without exposing personal data. There is no risk to enter wrong websites.</p><p>In addition, MetaMUI users can check their personal transaction records and check their balance using the Pairwise Trust after accessing MetaMUI Blockchain Explorer(<a href="https://scan.metamui.id/dashboard">https://scan.metamui.id/dashboard</a>). While most public blockchains, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, are disclosing the user’s transaction data on its explorers, MetaMUI prevents personal information leakage and ensure safe transactions by allowing only the owners to view their transaction records.</p><p>Pairwise Trust is a strong safeguard to protect user’s personal information not to be leaked by accessing wrong websites, and users don’t need to provide personal data to use any website or app but just use their DID. Pairwise Trust is a safe bridge between the real world and the Metaverse world, and will position as one of the important roles for Web3 infrastructures.</p> About MetaMUI <p>MetaMUI is the world’s 1st Identity-based blockchain to truly enable regulated Peer_to_Peer (P2P) transactions. It can be used as the cornerstone for most financial offerings, with its high versatility and support for custom-developed use cases that enable Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) implementation and issuance easily on the MetaMUI CBDC platform.<br>MetaMUI is built around Self-Sovereign Identity (SSID) technology. By combining the SSID and blockchain token mechanism, MetaMUI was able to create a new identity-based CBDC system that can protect user’s privacy while providing an identity-based transfer system that can satisfy travel rules and other regulatory requirements such as Know your customer (KYC), Anti-money laundering (AML) and Counter Financing of Terrorism (CFT).</p><p><a href="https://sovereignwallet.network/">Website</a>/<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/metamui/">Linkedin</a>/<a href="https://twitter.com/MUIcommunity">Twitter</a>/<a href="https://t.me/muicommunity">Telegram</a>/<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SWNGlobal">Youtube</a>/<a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/">Medium</a></p>

<p>The perfect password doesn't exist, just like the password you wrote down on that post it that uses your mother's maiden name with your daughter's birth date. We explain why a password manager can help you.</p> The most used passwords in France‌‌ <p>In 2021, the most common passwords are weak. As the top 10 most used passwords in France show, all of them are decipherable in less than 1 second by malicious people. Since 2018, the number sequence 123456 remains number 1 in the ranking. In 2021, this password has been used more than 103 million times.‌‌France appears among the countries with a high risk index, with more than 406 million disclosed passwords, or 6 on average per capita, in 2021.‌‌</p><p>Here are the top 10 most used passwords in France:‌‌123456‌‌123456789‌‌azerty‌‌12345‌‌000000‌‌tiffany‌‌qwerty‌‌1234561‌‌loulou‌‌marseille‌‌</p><p>The weak link in computing is most of the time not the software but the human.‌‌</p> The recommendations of the ANSSI <p>‌‌The ANSSI (National Agency for the Security of Information Systems) has published recommendations for the creation of secure passwords. We share them with you.‌‌</p>  Use a unique password for each service. In particular, the use of the same password for both your professional and personal email accounts should be avoided. You can use a password manager like Cozy Pass to have your passwords with you at all times without having to remember them. We had written a comparison of the different password managers available on the market.  Choose a password that is not related to you (password made up of a company name, date of birth, etc.);  Never ask a third party to generate a password for you;  Always change default passwords as soon as possible when systems contain them;  Renew your passwords with a reasonable frequency. Every 90 days is a good compromise for systems containing sensitive data;  Do not store passwords in a file on a computer that is particularly exposed to risk (e.g., online on the Internet), let alone on an easily accessible paper;  Do not send your own passwords to your personal email;  Configure software, including your web browser, so that it does not "remember" chosen passwords.  <p>Data theft is a reality. Forgetting passwords is a daily occurrence.</p><p>Two methods to choose your passwords:‌‌- The phonetic method: "I bought eight CDs for a hundred euros this afternoon" will become ght8CD%E7am ;‌‌- The first letters method: the quote "one yours is better than two you'll get" will yield 1yibttu'lg.</p><p>‌‌💡 You can also calculate the strength of a password with the ANSSI tool. This will allow you to know the strength of your password: <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/administration/precautions-elementaires/calculer-la-force-dun-mot-de-passe/">Calculate the "strength" of a password</a></p>  A capital letter (see +)  A minimum of 8 characters  One or more special characters  One or more numbers  Does not contain your first or last name  Does not contain your date of birth  Does not contain your nickname‌‌   A password manager to get rid of 123456 <p>As far as the password is concerned, you should know that a hacker will not look for your password at random, he will look for information about you:‌‌</p>  Your first and last name‌‌   The first names of your relatives‌‌  The name of your pet‌‌  Your habits (if you are a sportsman, there is a big chance that your password is something related to sports)‌‌  Your date of birth.  <p>A password manager is a very simple tool that holds your passwords for you, automatically enters them as you browse the internet, and makes it easier for you to shop online.‌‌The latest barometer on digital practices and personal data control published at the end of 2019 (before the health crisis) shows a four-point increase in the use of a password manager among men and 25-34 year olds. With the health crisis, this usage must have increased further.</p><p>At <a href="https://cozy.io/en/features/#pass">the launch of Cozy Pass</a>, some Cozy users told us that they were already using the Apple Keychain or Chrome, and that they didn't see the need for a password manager.</p><p>‌‌Many users save their passwords in Chrome or Firefox without even realizing it. When you're surfing the Web, a pop-up window appears asking you to save the password, and you click yes or no. When you come back to this page later, your password may be saved.</p><p>‌‌But you'll run into a problem when you try to log into an account from your iPhone while browsing the web with Safari. The passwords you saved on Chrome are then not available. Even worse, the passwords saved in Keychain may be different! You might even find yourself in a situation where you reset a password because you can't access a certain account, rendering the password saved in Chrome invalid.‌‌This situation can drive you crazy and is not sustainable over time.‌‌Maybe you use Chrome at home, but if your company's network only allows Internet Explorer or Firefox, your passwords stay "at home.</p><p>Cozy Pass users can easily access all of their passwords on all platforms, whether they use a PC for work, a Mac at home, an Android device or an iPhone. Cozy Pass works on all devices and all browsers even from their Cozy web interface. So your passwords follow you wherever you go. No black boxes. No duplicates. Only you have control.‌‌</p><p>The bottom line: as our personal and professional lives become increasingly digital and the vast majority of people use multiple devices in different ecosystems, an effective password management solution must work everywhere and when asked "how do I make a perfect password?", a password manager can help you get rid of post-it notes and other "password woes".‌‌</p><p>But keep in mind that the weakest link in computing is most of the time not the software but the human being.‌‌</p><p>To learn more about the Cozy personal cloud and its password manager, Cozy Pass, go to our page.‌‌</p><p>For those who want to install an extension on their favorite browser‌‌</p>  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cozy-personal-cloud/jplochopoaajoochpoccajmgelpfbbic??id=io.cozy.pass&amp;hl=en&amp;pk_campaign=nouveautesnovembre&amp;pk_kwd=passchrome">Chrome‌‌</a>  <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cozy-personal-cloud/?id=io.cozy.pass&amp;hl=fr&amp;pk_campaign=blog&amp;pk_kwd=passfirefox">Firefox‌‌</a>  Safari‌‌  <p>For those on the go, Cozy Pass is also available on mobile</p><p>🐙 <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.cozy.pass&amp;hl=en&amp;pk_campaign=sitecozy&amp;pk_kwd=passandroid">Android</a></p><p>🍏 <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cozy-pass/id1502262449?platform=iphone">iOS</a></p><p>Thank you for reading this article 🙌.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Andrea Beskers</a></p><p>Digital systems have become very complex, 95% of admins have too many permissions, and 76% of IT decision-makers are facing a skills gap. This is a recipe for disaster, so how do you fix it? Patrick Parker from EmpowerID will elaborate on this challenge in his Keynote<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5034">&nbsp;Model, Measure, Manage - The Journey to Autonomous Security in a Hybrid Multi-Cloud World</a> on Tuesday, May 10, at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2022">European Identity and Cloud Conference 2022</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Patrick some questions about his presentation.</p>
<p></p>
 Why is there a need for Autonomous Security in a Hybrid Multi-Cloud World? 
<p>That's a good question. So there are four major cloud platforms in use right now today by most enterprise organizations and these cloud platforms have a depth of functionality that also is increasing the complexity of their security models, producing about 40,000 unique permissions across the four platforms. So what you end up with are very complex systems for which 95% of admins in these systems are over permissioned because most people do not understand how you would get to a least privilege model and how to manage those complex systems with that many permissions. So from the technology side, from the business side currently 76% of IT decision-makers are facing a skills gap. We've had a great turnover right now where most people have left their jobs in IT, they're looking for something new. We also have a major skills gap. The skills gap in cybersecurity alone has increased by 39%. So you have more complex systems, you have the struggle to find properly skilled or trained people. And then that all is going to produce by next year, which is predicted to be 99% of cloud security failures will be the customer's fault due to misconfiguration. So it's all coming together that really we can't keep up with it just from a human manual effort perspective.</p>
<p></p>
 How can organizations define their ‘desired state’ for identity and access management? 
<p>So you really need a desired state because you need to know where you're headed to align your resources and your people and your technology toward a mission. A clear goal. There are different metrics you can use. One overarching principle is zero standing privilege, the idea that on weekends and at night you shouldn't have identities that are privileged, lying around waiting to be compromised by hackers, that you should convert your organization or optimize it into more of a just in time infrastructure. So privileged access is granted just in time just enough and just for the purpose that it's needed. And then it's also monitored. That's one key principle, is measuring your organization's progress from standing privilege. Where people have it permanently all the time to where it's just in time so that when people go home at night, there aren't these privileged identities. There are also many other measures. One other goal would be to move toward zero trust, which means that you're always proxying, never giving direct unmonitored access which you could measure that using tools like privileged access management. And then other statistics like the number and percentage of your user accounts that are orphans that do not belong to a specific person, so they're kind of unmanaged and they represent a risk. The average age for your passwords, for users and privileged users, the percentage option for multi-factor authentication, the average age of risky access from the time it was last recertified and then all of this you can produce an overall risk maturity score to track your organization's progress to how they're getting better and more secure. And what's really needed is some industry benchmarks maybe to be produced by an organization like IDPro that we could all share this knowledge in agree on a set metric to help gauge or compare one organization's progress towards another.</p>
<p></p>
 How can modeling and abstraction lead to a more secure automated identity infrastructure? 
<p>So abstraction and computer science especially has always been our savior, managing things at the machine code level was early days and it was not very productive. Really, the abstraction has allowed us with very little effort to have levers that are more powerful, that can move more things. So really the same applies to security and permissions across all these complex systems. Right now every system has its own security model and you really need to be an expert in each system and there's no way for the different domains of expertise like business intelligence, IGA, SIEM, and AI to talk to each other and know that we're speaking the same language or that we're actually talking about the same thing because we're managing at the technical level. The real abstraction and the use of a semantic language or modeling language where we're bubbling up these fine-grained permissions and activities across systems into one common language that's understandable by business people and can be gauged and assessed for risk will allow those different domains to tie together processes, IGA to understanding access you're allowed to have based on what you should be able to do from a business perspective, SIEM to let you know what you are doing, and is it appropriate in the same language and then AI to use that same language to automate toward a mission or a goal, to reduce standing privileges, to monitor for risky activities. And again, if we all get on the same page, then it'll increase our awareness. We'll get the benefit of a multi-disciplinary approach and we'll have a better overall security perspective across the enterprise. And one more thing, just with that standard language or that modeling or a defined end state, then people work best with a mission and so does AI. If you're going to throw AI to beat against the problem, if it has clearly defined mission parameters or a goal that it's working towards, then you can apply AI principles and AI technologies to help you continuously get to that goal. That's the autonomous part. We are enforcing least privilege optimizing permissions from permanent standing permissions to just in time permissions and just hacking away or banging away at our attack surface to reduce it and make the organization better overall, which again, that's the part that the humans can't really do because we don't have enough skilled people and just too many systems, too many permissions these days.<br><br></p>
 What can attendees expect from your talk at EIC? 
<p>I hope a little bit of fun. I hope it's not dry. I hope we have a good time. I hope that after the talk we will come up and we can really chat about it and continue the conversation in the social media world as well as maybe at the next upcoming conferences. And really, I guess the goal would be to help them plot a course and leverage the best technologies available to accelerate their journey toward a more secure and mature organization to deal with this multi-cloud complexity.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://webauthn.io/">Web Authentication (WebAuthn)</a> specification, given <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/03/pressrelease-webauthn-rec.html">official approval</a> by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the FIDO Alliance in 2019, aims to strengthen online security by allowing users to sign in to sites with elements like biometrics and FIDO security keys. The WebAuthn API can replace or supplement less-secure passwords, which may be weak and are often shared.</p>

<p>WebAuthn is supported by default in Firefox and Chrome browsers and can be used in Edge browsers on recent Windows systems. As support for the new standard is built into more devices, more websites will offer this easier, more secure method of authentication.</p>

<p>In this post, I’ll explain what WebAuthn is, how it works, and we’ll build a Java web application that allows a user to register and log in with a supported WebAuthn device.</p>

 How WebAuthn works 

<p>WebAuthn authenticator generates a public-private key pair, using public-key cryptography, scoped to a specific URI to be used for authentication. The service provider must identify the application based on this key. The private key used to generate the credentials is also kept hidden by the authenticator, so the authenticating software and service provider are less susceptible to malicious actors.</p>

<p>There are two distinct steps for using WebAuthn: credential registration and credential authentication. Registration is the process of generating, scoping, and storing a public key for authentication. Both the authenticator and server will store some information about the other party. Authentication is the process of requesting a credential from an authenticator, then verifying its validity.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In this application, the user hits a Register button and the server responds with information about the origin of the registration (hostname and origin), a byte-based user handle for identification, a randomly generated challenge nonce, and other optional information about the type of registration the server will accept.</p>

<p>The browser receives this information. A JavaScript function on the client re-encodes and formats the data for the WebAuthn API, and the generated JavaScript object is passed to the browser’s <code>navigator.credentials.create()</code> function.</p>

<p>The WebAuthn API passes the request to a connected authenticator, which normally requests some form of user verification (such as a PIN number or fingerprint), then generates a key pair for future verification and a credential ID to scope the relying party. The public key, credential ID, and challenge nonce, along with optional additional information, are passed back to the service provider; the provider checks the challenge nonce for tampering and then stores the public key and credential ID for future use.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Authentication functions similarly, though the content of the data passed around is slightly different. The user hits a Sign-in button and the service provider sends identifying information (credential ID and a challenge nonce). JavaScript on the client passes that request to the authenticator using the WebAuthn API, then the authenticator verifies the credential and returns a key, which is passed back to the service provider. The service provider verifies the key and performs any steps necessary to grant the user access to appropriate resources, like setting authentication cookies.</p>

 How to authenticate using WebAuthn in Java 

<p>In this article, you’re going to build a Java application that authenticates users using WebAuthn. To bootstrap a Java web framework that can create and store user sessions, you’ll use <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot">Spring Boot</a> to implement the web application, then implement the WebAuthn server, built by the hardware authentication manufacturer <a href="https://www.yubico.com/">Yubico</a>, to create the necessary JSON for the client to create and use credentials.</p>

<p>The final version of the code can be found <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/webauthn-java-example">here</a>. The demo application uses Java 17 and Apache Maven for dependency management.</p>

 Get started with WebAuthn and Spring Boot 

<p>First, go to the <a href="https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&amp;language=java&amp;&amp;packaging=jar&amp;jvmVersion=17&amp;groupId=com.webauthn&amp;artifactId=app&amp;name=app&amp;description=Demo%20Java%20project%20for%20WebAuthN%20Authentication&amp;packageName=com.webauthn.app&amp;dependencies=lombok,data-jpa,h2,web,thymeleaf">Spring Initializr page</a> and add your dependencies:</p>

 
   Lombok: A library used to speed up development by automatically generating constructors, getters and setters. 
   Spring Data JPA: An ORM (Object-relational mapping) tool to persist data and map Java classes to data objects. 
   H2 Database: An in-memory database for simple data persistence. No saved data will exist after application shutdown. For a production-ready application, replace this with a traditional database and edit the <code>spring.datasource.driver-class-name</code> property. 
   Spring Web: To handle web requests. 
   Thymeleaf: For HTML templating. 
 

<p>After creating and downloading this project, add the <a href="https://github.com/Yubico/java-webauthn-server">Yubico WebAuthn server dependency</a>. The application also needs some server-side caching, used to verify a challenge token that’s generated by the server and then provided by the client after a successful authenticator ceremony. This application uses <code>HttpSession</code> to track challenge tokens.</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.yubico&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;webauthn-server-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;1.12.1&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

 Spring JPA data layer overview 

<p>The application stores two data object classes: users and credentials. Users are people using the system, and they can have multiple credentials. Credentials contain the information needed to identify and verify a device implementing Client to Authenticator (CTAP2) protocol. CTAP2 is a spec that describes communication between a roaming authenticator and another client/platform at the application layer, as well as bindings to a variety of transport protocols that use different physical media.</p>

 User data 

<p>There are two goals for the user data: track the existence and uniqueness of the user and their credentials, and enable the creation of two JavaScript objects for the browser to make WebAuthn API requests: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CredentialsContainer/create"><code>PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions</code></a> for registration and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PublicKeyCredentialRequestOptions"><code>PublicKeyCredentialRequestOptions</code></a> for authentication.</p>

<p>Using Spring JPA, the <code>AppUser</code> data class starts with traditional fields for organizing users in a system, an <code>id</code> for database lookup, and a unique <code>username</code> to enable user self-identification.</p>

<p>The <code>displayName</code> and <code>handle</code> fields are used by the server to create WebAuthn requests:</p>

   <code>import com.yubico.webauthn.data.ByteArray;
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;

import javax.persistence.Column;
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.GenerationType;
import javax.persistence.Id;
import javax.persistence.Lob;

@Entity
@Getter
@NoArgsConstructor
public class AppUser {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
    private Long id;

    @Column(nullable = false, unique = true)
    private String username;

    @Column(nullable = false)
    private String displayName;

    @Lob
    @Column(nullable = false, length = 64)
    private ByteArray handle;
}
</code>   

<p>The username field is set by the user. It is intended to be displayed by UI elements on the client as part of the registration and authentication process, but it’s also entirely optional in the WebAuthn process. According to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-1/#sctn-user-handle-privacy">WebAuthn Specification</a>, a nickname string like <code>username</code> is not suitable for identification, so WebAuthn identity requests are made using a user handle, a byte sequence with a maximum length of 64.</p>

<p>Byte data (like the user handle) is stored in the database as a binary large object (BLOB). To convert these data fields to the <code>ByteArray</code> object the application uses, the application implements a JPA <code>AttributeConverter</code> class with the <code>Converter</code> annotation.</p>

   <code>import com.yubico.webauthn.data.ByteArray;
import javax.persistence.AttributeConverter;
import javax.persistence.Converter;

@Converter(autoApply = true)
public class ByteArrayAttributeConverter implements AttributeConverter&lt;ByteArray, byte[]&gt; {

    @Override
    public byte[] convertToDatabaseColumn(ByteArray attribute) {
        return attribute.getBytes();
    }

    @Override
    public ByteArray convertToEntityAttribute(byte[] dbData) {
        return new ByteArray(dbData);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The application converts data classes into Java objects provided by the Yubico library that can produce JSON-formatted strings the client will pass to the WebAuthn API. The <code>toUserIdentity()</code> function converts a <code>AuthUser</code> data class to a <code>UserIdentity</code> object that can access the username, the screen name, and the all-important user handle. Traditional property getters are created with the Lombok <code>@Getter</code> annotation.</p>

   <code>public AppUser(UserIdentity user) {
    this.handle = user.getId();
    this.username = user.getName();
    this.displayName = user.getDisplayName();
}

public UserIdentity toUserIdentity() {
    return UserIdentity.builder()
        .name(getUsername())
        .displayName(getDisplayName())
        .id(getHandle())
        .build();
}
</code>   

<p>Create a Spring Data <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/repository/CrudRepository.html"><code>CrudRepository</code></a> to manage the <code>AppUser</code> objects:</p>

   <code>import com.yubico.webauthn.data.ByteArray;
import org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;

@Repository
public interface UserRepository extends CrudRepository&lt;AppUser, Long&gt; {
    AppUser findByUsername(String name);
    AppUser findByHandle(ByteArray handle);
}
</code>   

 Credential data 

<p>The server also stores information about the user’s credentials. There is a standard <code>id</code> and a <code>name</code> field used to identify the authenticator on the server side.</p>

<p>To authenticate a credential, the server constructs an <code>AssertionRequest</code> Java object that contains the server-side information about any credential. The <code>AssertionRequest</code> is converted into JSON and sent to the browser, which it turns into <code>PublicKeyCredentialRequestOptions</code> during the WebAuthn authentication ceremony. The required fields are a <code>credentialId</code>, a random byte array created by the authenticator that identifies the scope of a credential. A <code>publicKey</code> is also required, which is another array of bytes. This is generated by the authenticator’s cryptographic algorithm and is used to check the authenticity of a credential signature provided during authentication.</p>

   <code>import com.yubico.webauthn.RegistrationResult;
import com.yubico.webauthn.data.AttestedCredentialData;
import com.yubico.webauthn.data.AuthenticatorAttestationResponse;
import com.yubico.webauthn.data.ByteArray;
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;

import javax.persistence.Column;
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.GenerationType;
import javax.persistence.Id;
import javax.persistence.Lob;
import javax.persistence.ManyToOne;
import java.util.Optional;

@Entity
@Getter
@NoArgsConstructor
public class Authenticator {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
    private Long id;

    @Column
    private String name;

    @Lob
    @Column(nullable = false)
    private ByteArray credentialId;

    @Lob
    @Column(nullable = false)
    private ByteArray publicKey;

    @ManyToOne
    private AppUser user;

    /* The authenticator potentially provides a range of additional information. This 
     * application stores some of it to enable functionality that could be useful for
     * a production-quality web authentication project.
    */

    @Column(nullable = false)
    private Long count;

    @Lob
    @Column(nullable = true)
    private ByteArray aaguid;
}
</code>   

<p>The W3 recommendation strongly encourages authenticators to implement a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#sctn-sign-counter">signature count field</a> that increments each time the authenticator is used. By storing the 32-bit <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#signcount">signCount integer</a> provided by the authenticator, the server can verify how many times the authenticator has been used. Increasing counts are expected; if the authenticator reports a decreasing count, it should raise a red flag.</p>

<p>The <code>aaguid</code> field is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#aaguid">an identifier</a> that should be provided by authenticators (but isn’t always), which identifies the type of credential used. This can be used to verify the authenticator’s make and model. Also, it can be useful for denying access for outdated authenticators with known security vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>The credential data class has one constructor that uses the Yubico <a href="https://developers.yubico.com/java-webauthn-server/JavaDoc/webauthn-server-core-minimal/latest/com/yubico/webauthn/RegistrationResult.html"><code>RegistrationResult</code></a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#iface-authenticatorattestationresponse"><code>AuthenticatorAttestationResponse</code></a> object (converted from JavaScript to Java), along with a username and name for the credential.</p>

   <code>public Authenticator(RegistrationResult result, 
                     AuthenticatorAttestationResponse response, 
                     AppUser user, 
                     String name) {
    Optional&lt;AttestedCredentialData&gt; attestationData = response.getAttestation()
        .getAuthenticatorData()
        .getAttestedCredentialData();
    this.credentialId = result.getKeyId().getId();
    this.publicKey = result.getPublicKeyCose();
    this.aaguid = attestationData.get().getAaguid();
    this.count = result.getSignatureCount();
    this.name = name;
    this.user = user;
}
</code>   

<p>Create another <code>CrudRepository</code> to mange the <code>Authenticator</code> objects.</p>

   <code>import java.util.List;
import java.util.Optional;

import com.yubico.webauthn.data.ByteArray;
import org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;

@Repository
public interface AuthenticatorRepository extends CrudRepository&lt;Authenticator, Long&gt; {
    Optional&lt;Authenticator&gt; findByCredentialId(ByteArray credentialId);
    List&lt;Authenticator&gt; findAllByUser (AppUser user);
    List&lt;Authenticator&gt; findAllByCredentialId(ByteArray credentialId);
}
</code>   

 Application properties 

<p>Create a configuration bean to hold the application’s properties:</p>

   <code>import java.util.Set;
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

@Configuration
@Getter
@Setter
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "authn")
public class WebAuthProperties {
    private String hostName;
    private String display;
    private Set&lt;String&gt; origin;
}
</code>   

<p>Add configuration for localhost in your <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code>:</p>

   <code>authn.hostname=localhost
authn.display=Spring Boot WebAuthn Sample Application
authn.origin=http://localhost:8080
</code>   

 Implementing the WebAuthn server library 

<p>Now that the data classes exist, the next step is building classes that retrieve and store data from the WebAuthn API. Yubico provides the <a href="https://github.com/Yubico/java-webauthn-server/blob/master/webauthn-server-core/src/main/java/com/yubico/webauthn/CredentialRepository.java"><code>CredentialRepository</code></a> interface to handle credential storage and lookup. The demo application’s <code>RegistrationService</code> class overrides the five functions needed for the interface to function.</p>

   <code>import com.yubico.webauthn.CredentialRepository;
import com.yubico.webauthn.RegisteredCredential;
import com.yubico.webauthn.data.ByteArray;
import com.yubico.webauthn.data.PublicKeyCredentialDescriptor;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;
import lombok.Getter;

import java.util.List;
import java.util.Optional;
import java.util.Set;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

@Getter
@Repository
public class RegistrationService implements CredentialRepository {

    @Autowired
    private UserRepository userRepo;

    @Autowired
    private AuthenticatorRepository authRepository;

    // methods added in next section    
}
</code>   

 Data interface 

<p>The <code>getCredentialIdsForUsername()</code> function is used during credential registration. Any associated credential IDs stored in the database are returned as a set of <a href="https://developers.yubico.com/java-webauthn-server/JavaDoc/webauthn-server-core/1.5.0/com/yubico/webauthn/data/PublicKeyCredentialDescriptor.html"><code>PublicKeyCredentialDescriptor</code></a> objects. This list of existing credential IDs is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#dom-publickeycredentialcreationoptions-excludecredentials">passed to the WebAuthn API</a> as a list of excluded credentials to prevent the same credential from being registered twice.</p>

   <code>@Override
public Set&lt;PublicKeyCredentialDescriptor&gt; getCredentialIdsForUsername(String username) {
    AppUser user = userRepo.findByUsername(username);
    List&lt;Authenticator&gt; auth = authRepository.findAllByUser(user);
    return auth.stream()
            .map(credential -&gt;
                PublicKeyCredentialDescriptor.builder()
                    .id(credential.getCredentialId())
                    .build())
            .collect(Collectors.toSet());
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>getUserHandleForUsername()</code> function is called during credential authentication when the user provides a username. The authenticator looks up generated credentials with the help of the user handle byte array, which the server needs to store for this purpose. The demo application uses this function to look up the user handle that’s passed into the <code>navigator.credential.get()</code> function in the browser.</p>

   <code>@Override
public Optional&lt;ByteArray&gt; getUserHandleForUsername(String username) {
    AppUser user = userRepo.findByUsername(username);
    return Optional.of(user.getHandle());
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>getUsernameForUserHandle()</code> function lets applications handle logins without usernames. The server organizes and recognizes users by means of usernames, but only user handles are necessary for the WebAuthn API to function. <code>getUsernameForUserHandle</code> can be used in login flows that don’t require usernames upfront. Hypothetically, an application could entirely dispense with usernames and identify users exclusively by unique byte array identifiers, though this application does not explore that possibility.</p>

   <code>@Override
public Optional&lt;String&gt; getUsernameForUserHandle(ByteArray userHandle) {
    AppUser user = userRepo.findByHandle(userHandle);
    return Optional.of(user.getUsername());
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>lookup()</code> function is active during the final step of credential verification. A registered authenticator provides an assertion signature and a credential ID to the browser’s WebAuthn API, which is sent to the server. The server looks up a stored credential using the credential ID and user handle provided by the authenticator. At this point, the server will use the object returned by this lookup function to validate the assertion signature (and optionally the signature count) from the authenticator.</p>

   <code>@Override
public Optional&lt;RegisteredCredential&gt; lookup(ByteArray credentialId, ByteArray userHandle) {
    Optional&lt;Authenticator&gt; auth = authRepository.findByCredentialId(credentialId);
    return auth.map(credential -&gt;
        RegisteredCredential.builder()
            .credentialId(credential.getCredentialId())
            .userHandle(credential.getUser().getHandle())
            .publicKeyCose(credential.getPublicKey())
            .signatureCount(credential.getCount())
            .build()
    );
}
</code>   

<p>In a similar way, the <code>lookupAll()</code> function returns a set of <code>RegisteredCredential</code> objects. Instead of validating the authenticator’s signature, this function ensures that there aren’t multiple credentials registered with the same credential ID.</p>

   <code>@Override
public Set&lt;RegisteredCredential&gt; lookupAll(ByteArray credentialId) {
    List&lt;Authenticator&gt; auth = authRepository.findAllByCredentialId(credentialId);
    return auth.stream()
            .map(credential -&gt;
                RegisteredCredential.builder()
                    .credentialId(credential.getCredentialId())
                    .userHandle(credential.getUser().getHandle())
                    .publicKeyCose(credential.getPublicKey())
                    .signatureCount(credential.getCount())
                    .build())
            .collect(Collectors.toSet());
}
</code>   

<p>Yubico provides a <code>RelyingParty</code> object that’s responsible for handling all authentication requests on the server, so the application constructs and provides that object to all controllers. Because WebAuthn credentials are scoped to only one website, the hostname, origin, and a display name for the website are all provided by the relying party.</p>

<p>In the <code>AppApplication</code> class define the <code>RelyingParty</code> bean:</p>

   <code>@Bean
public RelyingParty relyingParty(RegistrationRepository registrationRepository, 
                                 WebAuthProperties properties) {
    RelyingPartyIdentity rpIdentity = RelyingPartyIdentity.builder()
        .id(properties.getHostName())
        .name(properties.getDisplay())
        .build();

    return RelyingParty.builder()
        .identity(rpIdentity)
        .credentialRepository(registrationRepository)
        .origins(properties.getOrigin())
        .build();
}
</code>   
 Authentication controllers 

<p>The web controller for the application creates routes and constructs the data needed for the client to make WebAuthn API requests by:</p>

 
   Constructing JSON strings used in the registration and authentication ceremonies. 
   Caching intermediary information necessary for the secure execution of a ceremony (the challenge nonce). 
   Passing information from the browser’s credential creation ceremony to the data storage classes. 
 

<p>Create an <code>AuthController</code> class:</p>

   <code>import com.yubico.webauthn.RelyingParty;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;

@Controller
public class AuthController {

    private RelyingParty relyingParty;
    private RegistrationService service;

    AuthController(RegistrationService service, RelyingParty relyingPary) {
        this.relyingParty = relyingPary;
        this.service = service;
    }
    
    @GetMapping("/")
    public String welcome() {
        return "index";
    }
    
    @GetMapping("/login")
    public String loginPage() {
        return "login";
    }

    @GetMapping("/register")
    public String registerUser(Model model) {
        return "register";
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Both registration and authentication ceremonies happen in two steps. The client makes an initial request to the server with some identifier. The code below uses the username, but the user handle works as well. After prompting the user for a unique username, the server constructs a <code>PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions</code> for registration, which contains the user handle, the domain of the key, and a challenge token.</p>

<p>Registration endpoints:</p>

   <code>public String newUserRegistration(@RequestParam String username,
                                  @RequestParam String display,
                                  HttpSession session) {
    AppUser existingUser = service.getUserRepo().findByUsername(username);
    if (existingUser == null) {

        byte[] bytes = new byte[32];
        random.nextBytes(bytes);
        ByteArray id = new ByteArray(bytes);
        
        UserIdentity userIdentity = UserIdentity.builder()
                .name(username)
                .displayName(display)
                .id(id)
                .build();
        AppUser saveUser = new AppUser(userIdentity);
        service.getUserRepo().save(saveUser);
        String response = newAuthRegistration(saveUser, session);
        return response;
    } else {
        throw new ResponseStatusException(HttpStatus.CONFLICT, "Username " + username
            + " already exists. Choose a new name.");
    }
}

@PostMapping("/registerauth")
@ResponseBody
public String newAuthRegistration(@RequestParam AppUser user, HttpSession session) {
    AppUser existingUser = service.getUserRepo().findByHandle(user.getHandle());
    if (existingUser != null) {
        UserIdentity userIdentity = user.toUserIdentity();
        StartRegistrationOptions registrationOptions = StartRegistrationOptions.builder()
            .user(userIdentity)
            .build();
        PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions registration = relyingParty.startRegistration(registrationOptions);
        session.setAttribute(userIdentity.getDisplayName(), registration);

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: These requests require server state to work properly. The authentication request includes a challenge nonce generated as part of the <code>StartRegistrationOptions</code> and <code>AssertionRequest</code> objects. The reply from the client must include this nonce, so the server uses the session to cache the short-lived challenge by caching the full registration (or assertion) request object.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Information is sent to the browser, where it’s encoded and passed to the WebAuthn API as a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PublicKeyCredential"><code>PublicKeyCredential</code> object</a>. The response containing all the data needed for verification is sent to the server and used to create or verify a credential.</p>

 Start the registration ceremony 

<p>To kick off the registration ceremony, the client submits a uniquely identifying piece of information using a <code>fetch</code> request—in this case, a username. The server verifies that the username is unique and then creates and saves a 16-byte user handle. Configuration information about the server (like hostname and origin) was included in the <code>RelyingParty</code> bean when the server was created. This bean takes a <code>PublicKeyCredentialRequestOptions</code> object to collect the user information, and generates a challenge field, a random buffer of at least 16 bytes long. This object is cached on the server to preserve the challenge field, then turned into a JSON string and sent to the client.</p>

<p>Once the information is received by the client, it’s parsed into a JavaScript <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#dictionary-makecredentialoptions"><code>PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions</code></a> object. Then it is passed into the <code>navigator.credentials.create()</code> function as a <code>publicKey</code> option.</p>

   <code>.then(credentialCreateJson =&gt; ({
    publicKey: {
        ...credentialCreateJson.publicKey,
        challenge: base64urlToUint8array(credentialCreateJson.publicKey.challenge),
    user: {
        ...credentialCreateJson.publicKey.user,
        id: base64urlToUint8array(credentialCreateJson.publicKey.user.id),
    },
    excludeCredentials: credentialCreateJson.publicKey.excludeCredentials.map(credential =&gt; ({
        ...credential,
        id: base64urlToUint8array(credential.id),
    })),
    extensions: credentialCreateJson.publicKey.extensions,
    },
}))
.then(credentialCreateOptions =&gt;
    navigator.credentials.create(credentialCreateOptions))
</code>   

<p>The browser checks with whatever source of authentication is available to it using the “Client to Authenticator Protocol version two” (CTAP2). This check can be implemented by the operating system, browser, or by a standalone authentication device connected by USB or Bluetooth. This device generates a series of fields—the most important are <code>credentialId</code> and <code>publicKey</code> (generated from a private key the authenticator should never share). Next, the browser collates this information into a <code>PublicKeyCredential</code>, which is turned into a JSON object, stringified, and sent back to the server.</p>

   <code>.then(publicKeyCredential =&gt; ({
    type: publicKeyCredential.type,
    id: publicKeyCredential.id,
    response: {
    attestationObject: uint8arrayToBase64url(publicKeyCredential.response.attestationObject),
    clientDataJSON: uint8arrayToBase64url(publicKeyCredential.response.clientDataJSON),
    transports: publicKeyCredential.response.getTransports &amp;&amp; publicKeyCredential.response.getTransports() || [],
    },
    clientExtensionResults: publicKeyCredential.getClientExtensionResults(),
}))
.then((encodedResult) =&gt; {
    const form = document.getElementById("form");
    const formData = new FormData(form);
    formData.append("credential", JSON.stringify(encodedResult));
    return fetch("/finishauth", {
        method: 'POST',
        body: formData
    })
})
</code>   

<p>The server receives the <code>PublicKeyCredential</code> object and verifies the challenge field against the cached <code>PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions</code> object. It checks the origin of the response, then creates a new credential data object by saving the <code>PublicKey</code> and <code>credentialId</code>. The server also saves some helpful information like a user-friendly name, the associated <code>user_id</code> for username and user handle lookup, and the AAGUID field associated with the authenticator. In addition, it creates a count field for tracking the number of times the credential has been used. A simple application would probably only need to store <code>publicKey</code> and <code>credentialId</code> for the credential.</p>

<p></p>

 Client JavaScript overview 

<p>The client is generating JavaScript objects containing byte fields that are Base64Url encoded. Don’t confuse this with regular base64 encoding. Base64Url is mostly the same, but it encodes <code>-</code> and <code>_</code>, whereas the more familiar base64 encodes <code>+</code> and <code>\</code>. This enables Base64Url to safely encode filenames and URLs. When encoding and decoding strings, be sure that the application is using the correct data encoding.</p>

<p>Also, be aware that the registration and authentication ceremonies performed by the client produce and consume byte fields in the form of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array">Uint8Array</a>. The demo application uses the <a href="https://github.com/beatgammit/base64-js"><code>base64js</code></a> library to handle the encoding of these fields to and from Base64Url encoding to Uint8Array objects.</p>

   <code>function base64urlToUint8array(base64Bytes) {
    const padding = '===='.substring(0, (4 - (base64Bytes.length % 4)) % 4);
    return base64js.toByteArray((base64Bytes + padding).replace(/\//g, "_").replace(/\+/g, "-"));
}

function uint8arrayToBase64url(bytes) {
    if (bytes instanceof Uint8Array) {
        return base64js.fromByteArray(bytes).replace(/\+/g, "-").replace(/\//g, "_").replace(/=/g, "");
    } else {
        return uint8arrayToBase64url(new Uint8Array(bytes));
    }
}
</code>   

 Authentication ceremony 

<p>Registering a credential is the first step in the authentication ceremony. Using a credential is similar, but the JSON objects provided to and produced by the client are slightly different. Additionally, the function the client calls is <code>navigator.credentials.get()</code> instead of <code>create()</code>.</p>

<p>The client provides a username, which is sent to the server using a <code>fetch</code> request. This triggers the creation of an <code>AssertionRequest</code> request object, which includes an associated <code>publicKey</code>, a list of allowed <code>credentialIds</code>, and a generated <code>challenge</code> (creating the requirement that the <code>AssertionRequest</code> is cached server-side for security).</p>

<p>This <code>AssertionRequest</code> is passed to the client in a JSON response body. Any byte fields are again converted into Uint8Array objects, and the object is passed into <code>navigator.credentials.get()</code>. The resulting <code>AuthenticatorAssertionResponse</code> is Base64Url encoded and sent to the server as a JSON string. <code>clientDataJson</code>, like the server origin and challenge, are checked for tampering against the cached <code>AssertionRequest</code>; <code>authenticatorData</code> like <code>signatureCount</code> is updated and saved; and, most importantly, the <code>signature</code> field is checked against the stored <code>publicKey</code> generated during the creation ceremony. If all of these checks pass, the user is assigned a session, successfully signed in, and granted access to the application.</p>

<p></p>

 Testing the application 

<p>To test this application, pull out any <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/fido-certified-products/">CTAP2-compliant authentication device</a>. The easiest is activating WebAuthn emulation in <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/webauthn/">Chrome</a>. Using one of these devices, open the network inspector and watch the network requests to get a sense of the data passed back and forth between the client and server.</p>

<p>There are other devices that can be used for WebAuthn. For a complete list, you can do a search for <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/fido-certified-products/">FIDO-certified products</a>:</p>

 
   Chromebook PIN 
   Windows Hello 
   YubiKey 
   Apple Touch ID 
 

<p>Start the application using your favorite IDE or run:</p>

   <code>mvn spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Then open your browser to <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>

<p></p>

 An easier way to WebAuthn 

<p>Walking through this sample is a great way to learn how WebAuthn works in Java, but it’s still only part of an overall login experience. Your application needs a way to deal with other user scenarios, such as what to do when someone loses their YubiKey or drops their phone in a pool. Both <a href="https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Security/mfa-webauthn.htm">Okta</a> and <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/auth0-webauthn-passwordless-with-device-biometrics-is-now-available/">Auth0</a> make it easy to add WebAuthn factor support to your application without applying any of the code above.</p>

 Why WebAuthn is the future 

<p>Associating devices with sign-ins provides a powerful tool to make many of the challenges, failures, and abuses of passwords a thing of the past. Once initial development is complete, user registration is simpler, more secure, and more sustainable. Using the WebAuthn specification, developers can create passwordless applications with an increasingly broad and accessible range of hardware authenticators.</p>

<p>Mastercard’s open banking platform can deliver verification of income, asset, and employment reports directly to credit unions during the underwriting process, all built with consumer-permissioned data from the borrower.

				 <p>Maya</p>
<p>Hi everyone and welcome to this SEO identity community meetup for January 2022. We are very excited to have Gabriel Rene with us today and our topic is how web 3.0 will connect humans, machines, and AI to transform the world. Before we get started we would like to have a few words from heather dahl, CEO of Indicio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heather</p>
<p>Hi Maya, thank you, welcome to everyone, I’m excited to kick off the first of our monthly meetups for 2022. We are moving into our just second year of providing this type of content to the community, and I think the topics that we tackle and the experts that we bring on bring really intriguing conversations. I want to give a special welcome to anyone who’s here and new to our community, it’s so cool to see in the chat where everyone’s coming from. Hamburg, I heard a shout out from Brussels, Dublin, go Fairfax, Virginia, we have Seattle, Canada, by all means if you’re new to the meetup or you’re returning, add your location to the conversation because I think it’s really interesting that we bring together this global community. For those of you who aren’t familiar with Indicio, we are a public benefit company, and our mission is to advance decentralized identity. A part of our mission is running educational events like this, and because we’re out there building ecosystems for trusted data, today’s topic we find really exciting, absolutely provocative, excited to see Gabe here, and to talk about the internet of everything, and what it means for people and digital objects and non-digital objects to provide identity and to communicate with each other in ways that are secure and trustworthy. Ken was supposed to be here today to lead the conversation but he couldn’t make it, so senior architect Sam Curren is here to lead the conversation and interview with our absolutely terrific guest, Gabrielle Rene, thank you all for being here and I’m gonna turn it over to you Sam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Thanks Heather, and and thanks Gabriel for being here, I guess we should start with an introduction, that’s appropriate, Gabriel is the architect of the spatial web, it’s a vision he’s described with his co-author Dan Mapes, in the international best-selling book titled the spatial web, how web 3.0 will connect hans machines and ai to transform the world. He’s the executive director at VERSUS lab and the spatial web foundation, and he and his team are bringing this vision to life. The groundbreaking hyperspatial markup language is currently being discussed at a new working group with the IEEE, both web 3 and the metaverse have been recent hot topics in the last couple of months but the spatial web is where the real becomes virtual and the virtual real. So welcome to Gabriel Rene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me Sam, thank you Heather, and Ken when you watch this hopefully we’re doing you proud, good work. on your behalf so Sam thank you, thanks for hosting me today, and it’s an honor to be here and have a chance to speak to everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Excellent, I’ve been stunt doubling for Ken in a few areas and I’m not as good looking as Ken is but I’ll do my best. So excellent all right, let’s dive into some questions here, and please answer with whatever you think is relevant, and we can take this discussion wherever we need to go. So you’ve described the spatial web as the internet of everything and you’ve thought a lot about what the internet of everything will look like, what do you see?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well the first thing I see is a more holistic approach to the concept of the application of network computing technologies, like the internet, and a lot of times what tends to occur is that perspectives on emerging technology are industry specific or technology specific. We talk about AI or we talk about XR, we talk about IOT or we talk about blockchain, and we talk about quant, or it’s by industry, this applies to the government or this applies to supply chain which applies to retail and this applies to healthcare. So these narratives are constantly emerging where we even have these themes: human 2.0, we have dialogues around web 3.0, industry 4.0, and the Japanese are talking about society 5.0. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all of those cases almost the exact same set of technologies are being discussed, and it’s the usual suspects I just rattled off. Some people started talking about the internet of things a handful of years ago, this idea that it wasn’t just the internet where we had sort of interconnected communications, but rather these physical connected smart devices would form this new network. That was very exciting, it remains exciting, we’ve yet to see a whole lot of it work. I can tell you that the smart home struggle is real, and interoperability is at the heart of every problem. So this idea that you can connect things is one level, then there’s another debate about things being smart. So at one level you’ve got the internet of things, and then there’s been spatial computing, which has really emerged around this idea and is now re being repackaged again into the metaverse narrative, which you might call the internet of non-things, or sort of virtual things, that are not things or “what are they” things. And then there’s been this idea that is the blockchain folks saying that the internet of money, or the internet of trust, it sort of starts to intersect with the work that your community is doing. And there’s the internet of intelligence thing, which is the AI folks attempt early on the semantic web again. Whether we use the internet, or the web, or some sort of talking variations of this kind of a network where the data is intelligent or smart in and of itself. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The term smart, which has taken over everything, so there’s a smartphone that was the first thing, it’s just a computer, but that’s fine it’s a smartphone. Why? Because it has some connected capability, and in the beginning smart meant connected. As machine learning and deep learning found its footing over the last decade. The idea of things becoming smart meant actually being intelligent to the feedback loops, adaptive smart home now means that your nest adjusts the temperature for you, and that the lights turn on and off based on some feedback loop or information. Then of course we’re talking about smart cities, and so we go from smartphones, smart things, smart cars, smart cities, the idea is that these cities become intelligent and adaptive. Your autonomous car is able to just drive. Because, traffic is this sort of amorphous thing, like a bunch of starlings moving through. Drones and automated functionality that the amazon go, vacation of everything, you walk into a store, you take what you want, you walk out. All these sort of smart functions that might be built into government services, and all this sort of future sci-fi smart city narratives, but when I spoke to a community of smart cities four years ago in Europe, cities that came together to explore this, their number one thing was well how do we connect with other smart cities? So how do we form a network of smart cities? Well smart cities with all these smart cars and smartphones and smart devices and smart things with these internet and web connections across these various sets of interests and industries forms what you might call a smart world. And that idea that you’ve got this global cyber physical network now that encompasses all of these things, and that the addressability of an object isn’t just that it’s connected, it might just be that it’s being viewed by a camera, it could be an object that has no internet connection in and of itself, but this network has its own, and it’s essentially showing up on the network, that network we call the spatial web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Really good explanation, so a natural follow-on to that, I realize that web 3.0 has become a loaded term. You used it first in the title of your book, obviously, so it’s recorded there, but it’s come to mean some different things in recent times. Using sort of your original meaning of web 3.0 why doesn’t web 2.0 already solve this? What is missing from what we’ve got today that we need to go where we need to go?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well there’s a handful of things, and I think that some of the architects of web 1.0 have lamented about some of the infrastructure decisions that were made at the time. Now there were technical limitations or practical limitations, hardly anyone actually cared, but there were debates around identity and privacy and security, there was a tendency, being academics and scientists, not to think too deeply into all of the societal implications of these technologies. So the anticipation that people would use this for good, and not for personal, selfish, or otherwise harmful ends was the default. “Oh it’s gonna be this awesome network and we’re gonna do information sharing” great, problem solved. Decades of work had gone into that, from the ARPAnet all the way up into the world wide web, where you have Tim Berners-lee pulling a bunch of threads together and stitching that into what became the backbone of this amazing communications network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identity was actually one of the real missing ingredients in my opinion, and that anonymity part, the thing that makes the web open is also the thing that makes the web dangerous. The hackers, trackers, and fakers that are permeating our lives from simple sort of issues around misrepresentation, all the way to identity theft, all the way to now ransomware, and we’re about one hop away from biotech, and people being able to hack devices that were what we’re wearing, or that are on our bodies, or that are in our bodies, and so the the openness of the web is a double-edged sword that seems to cut both ways. That allowed the web 2.0 era organizations and companies to maximize the capital potential of that structure, and so they essentially monetized that openness, that anonymity was a function of the sort of the fact that you didn’t have an identity, so we’ll rent you one. We’re google here’s ours, we’re Facebook here’s ours, apple here’s one for you as well, how about one for linkedin and facebook? Alright so we all run around with these sort of two-dimensional avatars, locked in these digital fighters where we serve certain functions. We get certain services from that, so i don’t think that a pure polarized view on this looking at web 2.0 is inherently negative is fair or accurate, but these are major holes in the architecture that allowed for this type of capitalism to thrive in a new dimension, and that thriving has compromised some of the inherent freedoms, and some might say human rights. Now It’s becoming part of the debate: what property do we own here with respect to our data? And I think that those holes have produced really horrific outcomes, like not just on the monetization side, but on how we are programmed into wanting or thinking certain things. One of those things are products and services, whether those things are our own ideas about ourselves and our identity and our self-image, or whether it’s our viewpoint on the effectiveness of vaccines and science, and what political representative we think is in our best interests. You can no longer separate the technical work that we’ve done here with the web and our societal implications, and that’s the real zeitgeist challenge that I think we face at this moment. It requires some new ways of thinking about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’ve talked about some architectural adjustments that would get that will help get us there, one of one of those pieces of architecture i think is the hyperspatial markup language, HSML, that is part of your work at the IEEE, can you describe what HSML will help us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah, so just one quick parenthetical, and it’s a function of a little bit of us copying something. It is HSML, but it’s hyperspatial modeling language instead of markup language, although there was quite a bit of debate internally about whether that was an accurate description. The function of a market language and a modern language are different, but depending on your perspective, in this case it is about modeling at the heart of it. How do we model the world digitally in a way that is coherent with the way that humans cognize the world? And I provide that caveat because there are other ways of cognizing the world that we’re unable to be aware of, and that is not what our concern is with respect to what we need to teach machines or AIs. We need to ensure that they can cognize the world in a way that is similar, or compatible, or at least incorporates our understanding of reality. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What HSML does is it functions in a sort of semIOTic structure of forming the core elements, in which there are 12, that act like a language. So just like nouns, verbs, prepositions, and adjectives are sufficient components with which to construct descriptions and representation of reality that predominantly is all we’re using today. Like today I’m just using magic mouth sounds to paint pictures in everyone’s heads, and if I had it with squiggly lines it would do nearly as well. But if i could just do what we’ve been able to see some whales and some dolphins do which is actually just project an entire three-dimensional holographic representation of this particular bay, and the position of all the fish, kind of like a sonar snapshot, and just send that to you 20 miles away, “like hey the party’s over here, here’s where the fish are guys” that might be another way to communicate. So HSML enables multiple IOT devices to do what’s called sensor fusion, or data fusion, even policy fusion. So you can take information from sensors, we take information from databases, and you can take policy related information laws, or instructions, or whatever, and you can fuse those together into a multi-layered scene graph, which is a way of representing the information about any set of activities in any given space. All of the objects in the space, all the users in the space, all the activities in space, all the permissions in the space, and at the end of the day that it is intended to enable you to construct descriptions of states of things, and then describe workflows for what needs to happen, so you could conceivably program all the smart things in your house to work in a very certain particular way, one could inform another one, and this could then extend all the way out into the city, and so forth and so forth to the world at large. So the idea of making a standard here in the in many of the same ways that HTML allows us to structure content and information on pages, HSML lets us structure context and information in spaces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So I like that the modeling of context is a sign of something that sort of begun to happen, but without much organization. So when the web was new it was a new location, we would visit websites and we would go there and it was all about this new world and this new place, and honestly web 2.0 was a lot of that too. IOT starts to get a little interesting because now there’s this internet of things, but the things generally exist in real life and also on the internet, so it’s blending now between there. Of course now we’ve got augmented reality, and virtual reality, and a lot of things that pull that together, so when we think about all this stuff that in the real life that’s sort of blending together with a digital life that means like a proliferation of cameras and sensors and objects that we can interact with etc. So this means identity for everything, which is great. But there’s some implications here that the tinfoil hat wears among us, and I occasionally wear one of a particular shape. What are the implications of all of this interconnectedness upon the privacy we have and maybe governance that can help us with that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, so that was the question we started to ask ourselves back in 2016, which was all of that connectedness, all of that capability, all of that monitoring was going to happen anyway. Like that was the clear thing that was happening, so then the question became okay can you ensure certain levels of interoperability? And you need that in order to enable governance, if things are not interoperable you can make as many rules as you like, and it doesn’t it doesn’t matter. So what there’s a bit of a logical cake here, coherence is the first requirement, if you have coherence then interoperability is a function of your description of coherence. What is or isn’t coherent, like if you can describe the physics of the environment, and you want to say how you navigate through it, you can’t do it until you’ve done the first part. And then governance is a function of saying well what you can or cannot do are the ways that you must then navigate that environment, or who can when and what time and all sorts of all the parameters of activity management or activity governance. Because governance at the end of the day is really about changing states in the world. It’s not a theoretical function, it’s a practical function, and so that was what we saw as being really the scariest thing I’ve ever noticed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this cyber stuff is going to get all interconnected, you’re going to end up with this internet of everything. Which there was no term spatial web in that sense, the GIS community had been using it for many years, but not in the sense that we saw this multi-dimensional, multimodal sort of thing, it was like okay this internet of everything is going to happen, there are a handful of real challenges with that, including the possibility for abuse and looking at how wonderfully we did the web 2.0. this was just going to cascade into essentially black mirror, that’s what we’re all concerned about. So it was at that time that identity became clear to me that it was a fundamental infrastructural architectural requirement. Having been in telecom before that, and looking at telemedicine services, that was when I started looking at blockchain and the idea that you might need to own these assets related to your medical history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> I wasn’t interested in crypto in the beginning, Bitcoin seemed interesting, but not enough for me to buy any or care, blockchain looked really interesting, and this idea that you would own your sort of property. At that point I started looking for what kind of new identity structure, or what would become like a spatial web url, some sort of key identifier, and that’s when I came across the work that many of you on this call were pioneering. You were working on it before that of course, but also like right around that time, and that was a real eye opener, and it frankly made it possible for us to focus on the other bits. Because it was like this community is completely dedicated to the identity, in our version of this the human is one of those entities, or one of those actors, but every single object, including conceptual objects, can have a DID in the spatial web, and all of these are sort of structured using HSML, and some of these other ontology and taxonomy structures you’re looking at to maintain that coherence. That then grants you this ability to do governance, which gives you the second portion of this of the standard, which is called HSTP, which is hyperspace transaction protocol. What that does is it basically says “okay cool world give me all the information of the states of all these objects, users, actors,” and again they could be holographic objects in that space that that you otherwise wouldn’t be aware of, the IOT device isn’t going to pick that up, but the space knows that it’s there. You sent me something to this room so I could present it on this call as an example. I wanted to get this exact “xyz” position and I knew it was coming. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today one challenge is that you can send anything you want to my email address, I can’t stop you, you can come to my website, I can’t stop you, in fact you can send money to my eth wallet, and I cannot prevent that. But in the spatial web those everything is sort of permission based, and so that ability to then transport objects users activities and the governance around those is described in HSML, and essentially activated using HSTP, which says what are those states, i would like this state to change this way, or if the state changes what is or isn’t allowed in this case in this space, and HSTP says that transaction has passed or failed. So if only Heather is allowed to enter this room, if the temperature is x, and the time of day is y, and her facial expression or other biometric information says she’s in a certain state, all of which are just inputs that would be happening with any modern technology, but now could coherently say okay Heather’s at the right state the door can open and if she’s not then then the door remains closed. So this becomes you are able to program cyber physical activities, and define the governance for those if you were an authority of that space, and so that is the key sort of requirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>I think that it’s important that this doesn’t invent some brand new type of authority, but rather gives existing authorities the ability to express the rules about what they have authority over. So our house still remains our house, and I posit that we’ll have even more control over what’s actually going on in it from a digital perspective than we do today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes and so you could ensure that nothing is installed in your house, if it doesn’t make a certain threshold of some privacy standard, or that requires some certificate, if it doesn’t have it, it can’t it can’t be there, or it can’t turn on. The city could say drones are only allowed to fly in the city in these specific flight lanes, and if they have cameras on them those cameras are allowed to be on, but the drone cannot fly within five miles of the airport. it can’t have its cameras on when it’s flying over schools, or certain private properties, or certain zones, and all this can be spatially defined as if it were a video game. But now you can do it in the physical world in any digitally mediated set of functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>And that’s an incredibly powerful piece of this, so to switch gears just a little bit, we’ve talked about the blending of the digital and the real life thing, but with it with better technology that we’ve got for for things like virtual reality, you can now sort of have a spatially aware virtual thing, instead of a website that we’re looking at as a docent on a screen. So how do these same concepts apply in a pure virtual space? Where I might be in a fictitious world rather than in real life, and what’s the blend between the real and the virtual?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I love that question, so if you’ll allow me to nerd out for a moment, if you’ve seen the original avengers series of movies that marvel put out, there’s a moment where you get the arc of bruce banner and the hulk. It’s like when he can or cannot become the hulk, and everyone’s afraid he’s going to do it, in the final scene of the first avengers movie they’re like “Bruce get angry”, and he goes “that’s my trick I’m always angry”. So the the parallel here is that it’s actually always virtual, in one instance it must map to the physical world, in all other instances it doesn’t need to. So a harry potter world or the death star rendered in a 3d engine somewhere can have all the exact same authorities, and policies, and functions that apply. Vader is allowed to apparently strangle people at the helm of the thing, and Dumbledore, if he does something wrong the ministry fires him for a couple weeks, he’s got to go into hiding. So there are actually policies and things that exist in these virtual spaces, as we look at things like decentraland, and ownership, and NFTs, and assets and rights around this we’re going to need certain guarantees around what we can trust in these environments. How these authority structures are set up what is transparent, and and what we can investigate, what we can audit and so building property in a virtual world that you don’t ultimately have ownership of, or you can’t take those assets somewhere else, for example you don’t have any rights in roblox or fortnite they can do whatever they want, it’s a corporation they own it they can just change it, and change all your assets, change your skins, they can just flip the whole thing they can sell it, they can take the company public, there’s all kinds of other functions and interests at play. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if we expect and of course it seems natural that we’re going to want digital assets, they are becoming increasingly valuable, they’re also becoming increasingly more realistic, and to that degree at some point even experiences themselves will be indistinguishable from reality. Our senses are not that sophisticated, and you have people like Elon and others working on neural link, and others working on neural dust, that at some point are not going to require any sort of ocular interface. There’s not just a singularity of AI, there’s a singularity of reality that is a whole consideration that’s coming, so having certain guarantees around these environments will become increasingly important. This whole move with cryptocurrency, which is native internet money, and now NFTs, which are really smart assets, well not yet, they’re smart receipts to a virtual asset. I think DID’s really get you all the way across the line there, and HSML by the way would allow you to describe the asset in such a way that it would match up. So with the IDs in HSML I would know all these attributes down to color, texture, size or whatever is that version of that thing, and not just a receipt that says that I own something which could be copied a thousand times. A bit wondering of an answer but hopefully that hit a couple of notes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>No, that’s fantastic, so I want to draw something out a little bit. You sort of talked about how the same applies when I brought up this virtual versus real thing. You said real is the only instance where it actually needs to line up with reality and all these other things can exist virtually as well, that sounds like the metaverse has been talked about by a lot of folks and facebook audaciously renamed themselves to sort of try and own the space. What’s the difference here between the hyperspatial web that you see and the vision of the metaverse that facebook or other companies might be interested in offering?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Okay great question, so i think that i’ll try and provide a nuanced answer. I actually think everyone is making their best attempt to describe the same thing, which is an open and interoperable network. I think the battle right now is not for Facebook to become AOL, everyone’s seen this we’ve all seen this game before, like you don’t you don’t ultimately win with a closed version of this thing. In fact facebook thrives on an open web so that’s not a requirement that they sort of close their borders and they’re going to defend those borders, i think the battle right now is who’s the wordpress of the metaverse. Where are you going to go to build your sites, your stuff, who’s going to provide all the services, all the plugins, all that. So it’s not about Facebook changing their name to Meta and then saying we’re all about the metaverse, even though they’ve been the least arguably the least trustworthy brand in the modern era since I don’t know, Exxon. We go towards well they want to keep doing the same thing and making money the same way and that’s what Meta is for. I don’t actually think that, I think this is a massive pivot for the company, and that they’re doomed. I talk about this in the book. I don’t think that surveillance capitalism will be a profitable business in 10 years. I think it completely comes apart, look at GDPR right now saying google analytics is not going to work here anymore. That’s his web 2.0 getting smashed, these pillars are already coming down, and I think Mark Zuckerberg has seen this coming since the day he walked in to lucky palmers and put on something that was a space and realized that he had a company about a book. He must have said “oh it’s no longer about pages it’s about spaces” and we’re just seeing the arc of that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark wants an economy, he wants to build the largest economy with the largest amount of services to capture the most. Now people will willingly give over their data in order to optimize and maximize all kinds of inputs and data services around that. He doesn’t have to stay in that same game, and if he doesn’t get out of that game, while building hardware that’s capturing biometric information, the regulators are just going to keep squeezing and squeezing, and the laws and the walls are going to close in. So I don’t see a way out of this for surveillance capitalism-centered businesses, and I think actually that they’re smart enough to know that. This is why they already just announced last week, “hey we’re Twitter, everyone NFTs we have NFTs now” you can take them and move things around. You can build assets as well, say the asset I would like to move around is everything that you have about me, so let me NFT my data, and then I want to move it around, okay that’s what i would like. So I think that everyone’s still pointing in the same direction, and if you’re not, and you think that you’re gonna be the prodigy in aol, it didn’t work last time, but we’re gonna really give it a shot this time. So I just I think everyone’s smart enough not to repeat that play, but just like the oil companies and the automobile companies drag their feet as long as possible squeezing every dollar out of something that was causing arguable harm to the world, they still need to maximize the lens that they operate on, which is a fundamentally, their corporations with capital based goals. So now everyone ever wants an electric car, but it took someone like Elon and Tesla to just come in and change the whole game. So think that that’s what’s happening here, is that the battles for the wordpress of the spatial web or the wordpress of the metaverse, no one’s going to win being the siloed version of the metaverse where you don’t own any of your stuff. It’s going to be a wasteland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a fantastic answer, so we’ve talked about this vision and i think we all have a vision in our minds of what this looks like, we see even films depict this like Ready Player One for example does a really great job like laying out this universe of what it could possibly be like in the future. What’s less clear is how we get from today to there. What does this roll out actually look like? Is there a cut over? Is there a gradual way we get there? What’s this like?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well I mean I can only guess like the rest, but the hardware is the problem. So that’s why you’re seeing billions and billions of dollars being poured into that space, and more or less everyone is going there, so everyone wanted a smartphone. Does everyone remember the facebook smartphone that came out? That lasted like an hour. So Mark was very smart in jumping in on the VR thing when everyone thought that was just whatever, and Google said we’re going to play around in the AR space and their commitment has been soft. Two steps forward, one step back, and a lot of people in that community have not been happy about it, then Magic Leap emerged and said we’re gonna we’re gonna be the new Apple of this space. They said we only need a few billion dollars, and then “oh we spent it all” because it’s hardware and it’s absolutely the worst possible thing to work on, and it’s super hard. So you’re talking about innovation in battery life, innovation in optics, innovation in computing, and it’s just there’s so many pieces. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s like that smartphone moment again, which is why Apple just takes their time, and does the exact same thing they always do, waiting in the background so a lot of the froth is squeezed out and some of the core problems are solved, then they find their own path in. They’re like we don’t care about the metaverse, we’re not talking about the metaverse and they’re gonna come out with something different. But you’re gonna see four or five of these all start to really hit the market in a meaningful way, variations on AR and VR or hybrid sort of mixed reality devices or glasses. Then you’ve got Qualcomm, and others that are building chips now that have so much capability in them, AI powered chips with powerful spatial computing capabilities on it. So you’re gonna get 25 chinese companies that are making essentially the android versions of these things. I think by next year we’re going to see sort of that “iPhone 1” moment, and then that’s going to kick off the party. By the end of the decade, for some that can afford it, because the prices will go down you will have those early “Ready Player One” moments. Halfway into the next decade it seems like that’s the dominant thing so that’s the arc. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course one of the places we’re looking at, because we always tend to look at this through the consumer market lens, really where a lot of this is needed is in industrial spaces. In warehouses and ports, mining and agriculture, and that’s where the holographic part of this is only one layer, like you could think of the metaverse as sort of being the internet of experience. It’s a human-like interface layer of the spatial web while the internet of things is a machine interface. You having an experience where you go into a store, you grab some stuff, a bunch of cameras identify you and the object, and your account, and your wallet, and you walk out and it just charges you, that’s not a metaverse experience. That’s that you’re embedded in a mesh network of the internet of things, but from our lens that’s still the spatial web, and if then something popped up in front of you that gave you a holographic receipt and that was maybe that’s part of the metaverse. But if as you’re walking into the environment you’re seeing information displayed on top of all of the items saying “hey you’re gluten-free this week how about 10 off that”, that’s a metaversal layer on top of an IOT mediated experience. So you have to consider that component, that sort of digitization of the physical, and physicalization of the digital. These things are intersecting, and one sort of abstract point here is that, that’s what language is. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The experience that a deer has of the physics of a space is almost identical. The deer is in my living room. It can navigate that room better than I can, it understands the objects, but it doesn’t know what they are. But I’ve embedded the meaning, “oh that’s my couch, that’s my tv, that this is a picture of my family” it can see all those things, but it doesn’t know what they are. So I’ve embedded this virtual layer of meaning into the world, all these objects have terms, functions, and ideas. I know what they’re supposed to do. A monkey can still tell that it can sit on a couch, it understands the basic physics, it understands gravity, it can even understand the function of a couch, in that manner, but it doesn’t know whether that it might be meaningful socially to me whether it’s from Ikea or it’s from some fancy italian store. That’s a social virtual layer that humans, the human monkey has embedded into the world around us. We both configured it physically, like we shaped all this stuff, all these objects, but we’ve also added this whole virtual layer. Now we’re just doing it in a completely multi-dimensional way, so that the sort of digital twinification is putting those data sets onto the objects, and into the environment, and then we’re going into those sort of imaginary spaces that we put in our brains that we put into books we put in pictures we put into paintings we put into films. Now we’re just making them fully experiential. I think that’s that big shift, is moving from the information based web, to this experiential based web, whether that’s in the physical world or the digital world. Those blurred lines really create some new kind of digital environment and digital era. I don’t have a good word for it, that’s not a good word, forget it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a good start though. So you’ve implied that the roll out of the spatial web is not tied to the success in the hardware of augmented reality or virtual virtual reality hardware, meaning it can start sooner. So what does the rollout of the spatial web technologies look like as opposed to things that are tied to a VR or AR experience?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah what a good question. So well one of the things we just spoke about was it’s really the IOT first perspective. So in a warehouse you’ve got workers that essentially spend eight hours a day walking around 100,000 square feet trying to locate an item in a box. So what you do is you you build a three-dimensional map in your head, because some things are high, and something’s low, and some things are on the second floor, and then you get an order on your android phone it says go to row 17, isle 12 section l and grab item xj4-92. Okay where am I? You do all this three-dimensional triangulation, and then you route yourself. What we found is if you build a digital twin of that entire environment, and you map the inventory into every single location, so you now embedded the information into the space, you can take that same android phone and route that person to that location, and the cognitive load drops in half, and they basically speed up by 30 percent. The productivity, and performance, and actually the mental cost, the tax, we think about “oh people working hard for eight hours and now you’re making them more productive” there are some societal concerns about optimizing human activity in these environments, and there’s been some real concerns about how amazon is doing it, at the same time if you can reduce the cognitive load that’s actually the most expensive part for them, and so that’s one of the functions. So you’re building a three-dimensional twin you’re embedding the information into the environment, and you’re routing the human worker through that, now ultimately that human worker is hands and feet, because you’re no longer relying on the brain to do that much so the ability to then have humans and robots working in that same space or having humans in the day and robots at night or any combination thereof is a function of creating that shared model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> If there’s a shared model, whether it’s in the city and how how drones then decide are the certain flight lanes that they have, or or government policy that says in europe maybe the eu wants to say that the total flight height for all drones of a certain class is 120 meters, but in the netherlands they might want to say that it’s 100, and brussels maybe they say it’s 80, and as a drone passes through, it cannot ever go higher than 120, but as it goes through the netherlands and over the brussels it has to go down and then down. This is the machine’s view of the spatial web, and all of those capabilities and things are necessary right now, look at the supply chain, we had 500,000 cargo containers sitting off the coast here over christmas, and that’s because the ability for these systems to be able to communicate to each other is really poor, and our understanding of supply and demand globally is really bad. You have something like the pandemic hit and the butterfly fly effect is just happening all over the place and we’re not resilient enough to be able to adapt at this scale.&nbsp;So that’s really what the ultimate value of something like the spatial web means, adaptation. So it’s about the internet of experience over here on the metaverse side, the internet of things, this industry 4.0 narrative is about automation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s really the goal. Can we use machines and algorithms to automate physical functions in the system, and if you did that the impact on climate and the amount of carbon we’d be using would be hyper optimized, and we could set thresholds and regulations and the machines could adapt and adjust this. Instead something like the pandemic hits, we all go to Amazon and buy everything we ever wanted to buy because we can’t go anywhere, and then we just log jam every port in the world. This allows us to start to get a more holistic view, and the way that we start to look at the function of monitoring is not so much monitoring and surveillance, because those capabilities will be there, but if you use things like verifiable credentials, you use things like the IDs, and these get built into law and regulation, then we have we can have the ability to share this kind of information with each other. So you can set up a relay race of an adaptive supply chain, don’t send the automated truck until the thing arrives at the port, minimizing the total amount of carbon output. This adaptive thing is very much what organic systems do, this is how the body manages, you’ve got the autonomic nervous system, we need autonomous supply chains. These are the kind of functions that you can have in the spatial web which are absolutely critical, that are not about having an awesome virtual experience or or trying to sell a jpeg for a million bucks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’re claiming then that the world yesterday needs the spatial web, and that the visualization can currently be done, maybe in a 2d factor, or something like on a smartphone, or other flat screens that we have, and then as soon as the AR and VR get ready it’ll slide right into to that function for visualization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>That’s a really important point in this, in the warehouse we have an application that is multi-modal, and some people prefer just the audio, like with turn-by-turn instructions. Some people want to look at the map, some people prefer to hear it, some people want both, in our cases a lot of the workers are spanish so they want spanish audio. Generally they don’t want 3d, we started with 3d holograms, people were like “this is awesome, but i just need this” this is what’s most useful for me. So even this idea that “oh yeah 3d information is better and holograms are better”, we started doing that four years ago, and everyone was impressed and it was faster and easier, but it hurt to wear the headset for eight hours and the battery would only last three hours. So the hardware isn’t ready on that front, but cameras, AI, algorithms, and computer vision are ready to go, and so that’s a place where this is able to start. It’s really quite useful in some of these really critical environments that are far more relevant to our day-to-day lives and not so much in the entertainment or gaming or space. There’ll be education, we won’t be doing zooms like this, we’ll all be awkwardly sitting around a very large table, but there are functions today that are super meaningful for deploying the capabilities and use of the spatial web, and this is without even getting into any of the the broader needs around how DIDs can permeate, and self-sovereign identity is relevant in and of itself. Just like land title ownership by the dimensions this is going to end up being the domains of the spatial web, we will essentially be bound like boundaries. Your home is a domain, your property is a domain, the city’s a domain, today we think of domains as urls but domains in the spatial web are spaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Absolutely, so you’ve hinted at this a little already, which is really powerful. What do governments and companies do now to prepare for the coming spatial web?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I mean I think that there are a few groups that governments and researchers and regulators need to start becoming aware of. Predominantly that’s the work that’s being done around DIDs and DIDcomm, verifiable credentials, and the spatial web foundations working group at the IEEE. I think those are the critical components that you need to understand. I think that there is a more provocative branch off of this question, which is what role do governments play in virtual worlds? So it’s outside your jurisdiction, so what is legal or not not legal, and who says and how? So thinking about your geopolitical domain is one thing, thinking about people physically in your dimension that are experiencing something in another dimension that you have no jurisdictional power or authority over is a question. This ties into larger questions of governance, i mean Minecraft i think is eight times the size of earth. That’s big, that’s a big space, okay that’s one little world, you’re talking there’ll be thousands and then hundreds of thousands. There’s 300 million websites today, there’ll be billions and billions of these environments and spaces, at some point AIs will just auto generate whatever experience you want. Just start choosing adventure in real time based on biometric feedback, so the possibilities here are going to get really weird, really interesting. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chinese quote may you live in interesting times is sort of a double-edged sword. These are interesting times and so these are the kinds of questions. The last question I want to leave you with on this point is if Disney land or H&amp;M or whoever builds a store in decentraland, can I build a Disney store right next to the Disney store in decentraland? Who’s preventing it? Are they respecting the trademark and IP agreements of the United States? We will need treaties between organizations, countries on earth, and in these virtual worlds as if they were other planets. In the same way that we had to look at these challenges when we formed the league of nations or the united nations, we’re going to have other dimensions that we need to interact with that have entire economies that we trade in where the jurisdictions don’t apply. Then again who do you trust in those environments relative to what authorities? And so what prevents me from doing that in decentraland? Why can’t I sell Disney merch? or modify it with marvel or warner brothers stuff or whatever i like? So i think this is where trusts and guarantees around verifiability and credentialing of authorities becomes really critical, and if we’re going to digitize all of this, all of our reality in this next age, and all this money is flowing into the space, these are the kinds of big questions that we’re constantly thinking about and working on with respect to the standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, we are unfortunately out of time, but this has been great to hear your vision and thoughts around these things. Is there anything you’d like to leave us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, I think that the the role of identity is a fundamental pillar, and i think that in the the arc of history when we look at the role of property, and property rights, physical property rights, i just talked about intellectual property rights, data property rights, and digital asset property rights are are the next challenge. This is not a purely philosophical question, this is going to come down to law. So we need to start thinking of what does digital law mean in the 21st century? And making sure that the work we’re doing is addressing some of those questions, or hosting some of those conversations, I’d like to see more constitutional lawyers involved in these conversations. I’d like to see people that are really working through this sort of lens of data rights and ethics having these dialogues. That’s why I think that the next battleground is property rights, with respect to the function of data and the things that data form, which become these new hyperspatial objects in this next era.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, Gabriel, thank you for spending this time with us we’re we’re grateful for your willingness to be here. I hope everyone enjoyed this conversation and we’ll look forward to seeing you all in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me, take care everybody&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Graham Williamson</a></p><p>One of the deplorable components of the Russian aggression toward Ukraine has been resumption of cyber-attacks on the electrical grid. This has highlighted the vulnerability of the electrical distribution network to this kind of attack. The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine disclosed that a Russian hacking group has recently attacked the grid’s industrial control systems.</p>
<p>The attack methodology is commonly called CrashOverRide or Industroyer. It is targeted at industrial control systems, specifically electrical grids. It is configured to use fieldbus protocols for communication with controllers and devices.</p>
 How the CrashOverRide works 
<p>The attack on the Ukraine used a multi-stage process commencing with an account takeover to gain administrative access to control systems. It has not been revealed how this was achieved, possibly by credential-stuffing with commonly used passwords or with insider assistance. It was revealed that the electricity grid management operation still uses antiquated systems, incapable of supporting modern networking and security technology.</p>
<p>Once access to a networked device has been achieved, the hacker installs a CrashOverRide module on a system capable of communicating directly with a PLCs or HMI device to change settings, operate actuators, or stop the controller altogether.</p>
 The chronic problem of OT infrastructure 
<p>The lesson is clear: the electrical grid continues to be vulnerable. This is a chronic problem with OT infrastructure where an ‘if-it’s-not-broken-don’t-fix-it’ approach is often the corporate strategy. Change is more difficult in the electrical generation and distribution sector where critical infrastructure regulation restricts the options available to management.</p>
<p>For instance, regulation maintains a strategy of IT/OT isolation by prohibiting direct network interconnection. If the need for a file transfer warrants it, staff must resort to manual transfer via secure storage media.</p>
 What can be done? 
<p>But, while change is not for the faint-hearted, it is eminently possible and the briefest of cost/benefit analysis supports increasing cyber-protection:</p>
 
 The plan for retirement of legacy systems should be accelerated. There is no excuse for the continued use of Solaris. While choosing an upgrade path is complex it must be done. 
 Communication between control systems and devices should be secured. A basic PKI installation can avoid communication compromise. 
 Monitoring solutions to detect communication anomalies on OT networks are available and effective. Once a baseline of normal communications has been achieved any change or interactive communication on the network is readily detectable. 
 Detection of a change of status for a controller, which might indicate a firmware update, is basic and should be implemented. 
 Uni-directional gateways are a promising technology that can securely support near real-time monitoring of OT infrastructure via corporate SOC and SIEM tools. 
 
<p>The war has served to highlight the problem; can it provide the motivation to fix it?</p>

<p>ECommerce business owners know that retaining loyal customers is more challenging than acquiring new&nbsp;ones.</p><p>Repeat customers are responsible for ushering in a significant amount of the revenue. According to <a href="https://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/the-economics-of-e-loyalty">research</a>, improving the customer retention rate by almost 5 percent can increase profits by 25 to 95&nbsp;percent.</p><p>Additionally, repeat purchases amount to more than 40 percent of the net revenue for an eCommerce site.</p><p>Repeat purchases are an excellent parameter for judging why your store is preferred over your competitors. It shows the rate of your current customer base who frequently come back to purchase again. This is not only a metric of loyalty but also defines the business’ reputation in the retail industry.</p><p>For eCommerce businesses, it is imperative to encourage customers to keep visiting and purchasing from their platform, which will ensure the company’s sustainable growth over time. Thus, in today’s blog, we will discuss how businesses can boost their repeat purchase&nbsp;rate.</p> WHAT IS A REPEAT PURCHASE? <p>Repeat purchase refer to those made by customers who have shopped more than once. These are existing customers familiar with your brand and trust your store, so they keep returning to&nbsp;it.</p><p>The need for convenience primarily drives repeat purchases. A store’s repeat purchase rate (RPR) can range from 0 percent to 100 percent, and the higher the number, the better it is. If your business’s RPR is zero, none of your customers are coming back, and you must make improvements.</p><p><a href="https://www.verfacto.com/blog/behavioral-data/tracking-ecommerce/">Customer behavior</a> is different for repeat customers and first-time customers. In the case of eCommerce websites, repeat customers always know what they are looking for and go straight to purchase the desired product, leading to zero shopping cart abandonment.</p><p>Whereas first-time customers may take time to explore the site, find what they are looking for, explore prices, and even bounce or abandon their&nbsp;carts.</p><p>RPR is a metric that helps measuring brand&nbsp;loyalty.</p> WHY IS REPEAT PURCHASE RATE IMPORTANT? <p>The majority of eCommerce businesses tend to spend a large chunk of their marketing budget on trying to acquire new customers. However, only 41 percent of an eCommerce store’s net revenue is created by only 8 percent of its new customers.</p><p>When repeat customers frequent the same eCommerce store, it creates a halo effect. The ‘halo effect’ is a term that describes the process of consumer favoritism towards a line of products sold by a store. This is influenced by the customer’s positive experience while navigating the store. The halo effect is often correlated with repeat purchase rate and brand&nbsp;loyalty.</p><p>The opposite of the halo effect is the ‘horn effect,’ where consumers have an unfavorable experience on the store’s website. This may account for a higher bounce rate or frequent shopping cart abandonment.</p><p>There are several reasons why repeat purchases are better than first-time ones. Here are six&nbsp;reasons:</p> 1. THEY GENERATE MORE&nbsp;REVENUE <p>According to a survey conducted by BIA/Kelsey, more than 50 percent of a business’s annual revenue is generated from repeat purchases. RJMetrics also reported that repeat customers spend 300 percent more than first-time buyers.</p><p>The more times a business can convince customers to buy from its portal, its potential lifetime value is greater. The more repeat customers convert, the higher their average order value becomes compared to new customers. This is because repeat purchases are made based on a brand’s trust and&nbsp;loyalty.</p> 2. REPEAT CUSTOMERS ARE EASIER TO SELL&nbsp;TO <p>Gaining new customers is an important goal of eCommerce businesses. But when a brand has limited time and resources, it shouldn’t be wasted on acquiring new customers who may never buy anything. In fact, there is only a mere 13 percent chance of converting a prospect into a buying customer.</p><p>Things are entirely different when marketing to existing customers. By paying attention to customer service and striving to improve user experience, a brand can make existing customers want to purchase again. There is a 60 to 70 percent chance of repeat purchases, which happens because there’s already an established relationship.</p><p>For repeat customers, marketing efforts can be targeted toward customer retention.</p> 3. NEW CUSTOMERS COST THE BRAND&nbsp;MORE <p>Businesses need to be financially savvy and save money wherever they can. Keeping existing customers involves far less hassle and resources than trying to gain new ones. Studies show that attracting a potential customer can cost 5 times more than retaining existing customers.</p><p>Since most brands operate on limited money, it is wiser to focus on ensuring customer retention.</p> 4. REPEAT CUSTOMERS PROMOTE BUSINESSES <p>The best marketing tactic is through word-of-mouth of a loyal customer. Marketing is highly expensive, and getting influencers or ambassadors to endorse your brand can be&nbsp;costly.</p><p>However, by focusing on repeat business, brands can create a band of loyal customers who will willingly promote the business and market its products and services. The power of word-of-mouth referrals is unrivaled when it comes to eCommerce stores.</p><p>A study conducted by Bain &amp; Company showed that repeat customers could refer 50 percent more prospective buyers than one-time customers. In most industries, the more a customer returns to the store to make a purchase, the more they will promote the&nbsp;brand.</p> 5. THESE PURCHASES ARE INCREDIBLY PROFITABLE DURING THE HOLIDAY&nbsp;RUSH <p>During the peak season, like Christmas or wedding season, first-time customers spend only 17 percent more per transaction, but repeat customers can spend up to 25 percent more per transaction. Studies have also shown that the percentage of revenue from repeat purchases increases steadily even during a recession period.</p> 6. MOST BUSINESSES ARE BUILT ON REPEAT PURCHASES AND CUSTOMER RETENTION <p>Businesses shouldn’t be a revolving door for customers. Research shows that 64 percent of businesses with decent customer loyalty make more money. The average customer is always on the hunt for the best deals and will more likely engage with a brand that offers loyalty&nbsp;points.</p><p>Implementing loyalty and rewards programs can greatly impact the business’ growth. More than 80 percent of future profits come from 20 percent of repeat purchases.</p> HOW TO CALCULATE REPEAT PURCHASE&nbsp;RATE? <p>Calculating an eCommerce business’ RPR involves a simple mathematical formula, which considers the purchases from repeat customers divided by total purchases on the site within a given date&nbsp;range.</p><p>The formula can be expressed in the following calculation:</p><blockquote>Repeat Rate = number of customers who have shopped more than once / Number of customers</blockquote><p>For example, if your brand has 100 customers, 46 have made repeat purchases, the RPR would be 46&nbsp;percent.</p><p>Brands should track RPR daily, weekly, and monthly. This can be an important indicator of whether your efforts at boosting customer loyalty are paying&nbsp;off.</p> WHAT’S A GOOD RPR FOR ECOMMERCE? <p>Benchmarks for a good repeat purchase rate for eCommerce vary from brand to brand. Most eCommerce businesses have an average RPR of between 20 to 40&nbsp;percent.</p><p>According to former VP of Growth at Facebook, Alex Schultz, if businesses can get 20 to 30 percent of their customers coming back and making a purchase every month, it is a good sign that the brand is doing&nbsp;well.</p><p>If your brand has accumulated close to 50 percent of repeat customers, it should re-focus marketing efforts on expanding the customer base. And, if you have less than 25 percent of repeat customers, it’s time to incentivize purchases from your store and actively encourage one-time customers to buy&nbsp;again.</p><p>So, how can businesses increase their RPR? Let’s find out the&nbsp;answer!</p> 10 WAYS TO INCREASE YOUR REPEAT PURCHASE&nbsp;RATE <p>To increase the RPR, you have to deploy customer retention strategies, and these strategies help the business to acquire post-purchase value.</p><p>We have listed 10 practical strategies that can be used to increase the RPR of an eCommerce business.</p> 1. SENDING TARGETED POST-PURCHASE MESSAGES <p>One of the worst mistakes a brand can make is not following up after the customer makes the purchase. Sending targeted and personalized post-purchase messages can create a lasting impression in the customer’s mind, and this will keep your brand’s name on top when they need to re-purchase.</p><p>Targeted post-purchase messages can be sent in many creative ways. For instance, customers can receive relevant tips or a guide on using the product. Messages about similar or recommended products that the customer will enjoy can also be&nbsp;sent.</p><p>These messages can be sent via a marketing automation platform that delivers content across all channels, including email, push notifications, Whatsapp, etc.</p> 2. BUILDING AN EMAIL&nbsp;LIST <p>Sending regular and targeted emails to existing customers is a standard marketing technique to encourage repeat purchases. Sometimes, customers need to be reminded of the brand and its offerings. And to do this, building an email list is&nbsp;crucial.</p><p>However, make sure that you use “send frequency optimization” and lower the frequency of your emails for customers who show declining interest.</p> 3. INCENTIVIZING THE SECOND&nbsp;PURCHASE <p>Incentivizing the second purchase is a good way to improve your RPR. Discounts, promo codes, or referral links can be effective but only if used correctly. Especially for first-time buyers, this is an excellent way of luring them back in for a second purchase.</p><p>Brands can also use AI to identify customers who haven’t purchased in a while but are browsing. This way they can engage with offers to drive your numbers&nbsp;up.</p> 4. SHOWING OFF REVIEWS AND TESTIMONIALS ON THE&nbsp;WEBSITE <p>The best way to convert a first-time buyer into a repeat customer is by leveraging other people’s opinions and reviews about the products on your website. Customers are more likely to trust brands when there is evidence that other shoppers like the&nbsp;brand.</p><p>A 2019 survey by BrightLocal proved that positive reviews could make 91 percent of customers more likely to purchase from a store. Similarly, 82 percent of customers can be discouraged by negative reviews. This framework is known as social&nbsp;proof.</p><p>Brands should highlight the positive reviews on their website by including them in landing pages, product pages, or even email campaigns. Posting pictures of happy customers is an excellent way of supporting these testimonials.</p> 5. SENDING CART ABANDONMENT EMAILS <p>More than 70 percent of customers add items to their shopping cart only to leave without completing the purchase. Every 7 out of 10 people who visit your website abandon their shopping carts. This is a missed opportunity for every eCommerce business, and a significant portion of potential revenue goes down the&nbsp;drain.</p><p>An easy solution to this problem would be sending shopping cart abandonment emails. An automated email triggered when someone leaves their cart behind can act as a provocation, encouraging some customers to go ahead with their purchases.</p> 6. IMPLEMENTING A REWARDS OR LOYALTY&nbsp;PROGRAM <p>Another effective way of improving your RPR is through rewards or loyalty programs. A strong rapport with the customer is the true driver of repeat purchases and brand&nbsp;loyalty.</p><p>Brands need to show their customers that they are valued, and this is a simple way of thanking the customer and increasing RPR. Points and rewards can be offered for every purchase the customer makes in the store, encouraging them to buy from you&nbsp;more.</p><p>For instance, H&amp;M runs one of the most robust loyalty programs where customers are rewarded with points every time they shop, and these points can be later redeemed for discounts and vouchers.</p> 7. UNDERSTANDING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION THROUGH&nbsp;SURVEYS <p>Customer feedback can help improve RPR and customer retention. If you want your customers to keep buying from you, you must determine what they think about your business.</p><p>If customers are unhappy with your business, it can result in a poor conversion rate. Through customer surveys, brands can listen to their customers, give them what they are looking for, and rebuild trust. When brands are able to solve issues by analyzing customer surveys quickly, customers are likely to stay loyal to the&nbsp;brand.</p><p>Brands need to ask the right questions during customer surveys. A few examples of customer feedback questions are:</p>  On a scale of 1–10, how likely are you to buy our products&nbsp;again?  How likely are you to recommend our business to a&nbsp;friend?  Rate your browsing experience of our app/&nbsp;website.  How satisfied are you with our product/services?  How did you learn about our&nbsp;website?   8. MAKE ORDERING FROM YOUR WEBSITE A SEAMLESS&nbsp;PROCESS <p>Customers like hassle-free websites that provide them with a seamless ordering experience, encouraging them to revisit the platform. For instance, Amazon has millions of loyal fans because ordering from its website is seamless.</p><p>One way of doing this is by letting customers create accounts on your website. They can save their billing and payment option, address, and checkout quickly whenever required, streamlining the buying&nbsp;process.</p> 9. SENDING PERSONALIZED PRODUCT RECOMMENDATIONS <p>Personalization has a special place in marketing. Studies show that more than 33 percent of customers are likely to abandon a business if they don’t feel a personal connection to it. When brands interact with their customers, they have data on their preferences, which can be used wisely to tailor messages.</p><p>By analyzing the customer’s previous activity on the site, brands can send personalized product recommendations. This makes customers feel heard and increases their chances of purchasing again.</p><p>Also, brands should note a customer’s birthdays and anniversaries and send special discounts and referrals on these special occasions.</p> 10. ANSWERING QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS ON THE&nbsp;WEBSITE <p>Last but not least, superior customer service is the key to increasing repeat purchases. Although 80 percent of businesses believe they offer exceptional customer service, only 8 percent of customers feel that they are receiving adequate customer&nbsp;service.</p><p>Being responsive to customers should be a given when running an eCommerce business. If you want to build a band of loyal customers, you have to engage with them and answer their queries across social media channels. Companies that actively interact with their customers have a higher ROI than those that&nbsp;don’t.</p><p>A happy customer is a loyal customer. Therefore, eCommerce businesses should prioritize strengthening customer relationships.</p><p>Several aspects of the post-purchase experience get neglected, leading to a low repeat purchase rate. Businesses should feel prepared to take on the challenge and focus on customer retention strategies.</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/repeat-purchase/">https://www.monetha.io</a>.</p>

<p>Nowadays, a lot of companies are investing in customer retention efforts. They say it’s what literally any business needs. But what exactly are these benefits? Let’s find&nbsp;out!</p> WHAT IS CUSTOMER RETENTION? <p>Before discussing the list of benefits of customer retention, let’s make it clear what it is all about. So, what is customer retention?</p><p>Customer retention refers to activities and actions that businesses take to decrease customer defection rates. Its main goal is to help businesses retain as many customers as possible through various initiatives. Examples of such initiatives are loyalty programs or reward&nbsp;systems.</p> 11 CUSTOMER RETENTION BENEFITS <p>Here are 11 top benefits of customer retention:</p> 1. IT MAKES YOUR BRAND STAND OUT FROM COMPETITION <p>From the perspective of customers, brands that make an effort to interact with them show how much they value their patronage. Unfortunately, there are only a few who genuinely do this which is why it’s a great opportunity to make your brand stand&nbsp;out.</p><p>Moreover, a lot of brands are more focused on acquiring new customers instead of retaining their old ones. This makes businesses that are retention-centric even more noticeable in the competition.</p> 2. YOU CAN EARN MORE WITH LOYAL CUSTOMERS <p>Research reveals that engaged customers spend 60% more per transaction and <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170815005733/en/Prices-Raise-Customer-Loyalty">buy 90% more</a> than new customers. In contrast, disengaged customers can cost brands to lose some of their revenues. These customers refer to those that are actively spreading opposing options against the&nbsp;brand.</p><p>In addition, loyal customers also tend to be more accepting of price increases. However, you should just increase your prices needless with the confidence that they will stick around because they are loyal to your brand. Remember, the end goal is lifetime revenue so think of long-term outcomes.</p> 3. CUSTOMER RETENTION IS MORE COST-EFFECTIVE THAN ACQUISITION <p>If you do the math, it is more expensive to invest in efforts to acquire new customers compared to the investment you need to make for customer retention. This is because you have to invest in the following to attract a new customer&nbsp;base:</p>  Social media marketing  Email campaigns  SEO  PPC  Retargeting ads  Web banners  Prospecting leads  Outbound sales  <p>Each of these customer acquisition approaches has a hard cost. Besides that, they are labor-intensive and time-consuming. When you look at the result, you’ll realize that customer retention efforts often can yield higher numbers across various&nbsp;metrics.</p><p>There have been several pieces of research proving this claim. However, although retention is much more cost-effective than acquisition, there’s no denying that it is not an easy feat to accomplish.</p> 4. IT ALLOWS YOU TO UPSELL AND CROSS-SELL <p>Another major benefit of customer retention is that it allows you to upsell and cross-sell your products and services.</p><p>One of the most common mistakes many sales teams make is that they assume that once they sell something to a particular customer, then that is the end of it all. However, they don’t realize that by using customer retention, they are in the perfect position to know the needs and pains of their customers, allowing them to upsell and cross-sell their products and services.</p> 5. IT’S BETTER FOR THE EMPLOYEES’ WELL-BEING <p>Customer retention is very similar to relationship building and a good relationship is much healthier for everyone involved since it’s mutually beneficial. On the other hand, sales are always transactional. They are price sensitive and affected by various&nbsp;factors.</p><p>Because of the nature of sales, a lot of employees struggle with meeting their regular quota because it’s not easy to convert strangers into paying customers. This is where focusing on being relational through customer retention can help. There’s less chance for engaged customers to switch brands when there are signs of trouble, protecting your revenue and making your employees’ lives a lot&nbsp;easier.</p><p>Sure, customers are important for all businesses. However, employees are equally as important because they make the day-to-day operation run. This is why you should also pay attention to their well-being, instead of being solely customer-centric.</p> 6. YOU CAN HAVE ROOM TO EXPERIMENT <p>Being able to establish a solid customer base allows you to expand the boundaries of your brand and explore new things. Whether this may be a new product line or messaging, a loyal customer base will still be there for&nbsp;you.</p><p>The important thing is, you should maintain the main reasons why they are loyal to you in the first place and they will stay with you no matter what new things you introduce.</p> 7. CUSTOMERS WILL WELCOME YOUR MARKETING EFFORT <p>A lot of people easily get annoyed with marketing efforts, especially when there is a disconnect between them and the brand. This is exactly why email marketing campaigns fail mostly because a lot of customers unsubscribe, making it ineffective.</p><p>However, that is not the case for loyal customers. Loyal customers love to hear about new promotions and discounts that their brands have to offer. In some cases, even if they initially did not have the intention to buy, seeing the marketing effort can push them into making purchases almost immediately after.</p> 8. LOYAL CUSTOMERS ARE MORE UNDERSTANDING <p>Poor customer service can be very detrimental to a business. In fact, a study shows that <a href="https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/customer-experience-statistics">$1.6 trillion</a> is lost yearly because customers switch to other brands after experiencing bad customer service. It’s safe to say that it’s one of the main reasons why customers switch to another&nbsp;brand.</p><p>However, loyal customers tend to have more tolerance for customer service shortcomings. Of course, this does not mean that it should be turned into a norm since the goal should be to consistently provide high-quality and consistent customer&nbsp;care.</p> 9. MORE CUSTOMERS WILL EXPLORE YOUR&nbsp;BRAND <p>A brand that has proven itself with its flagship product or service has a higher chance of encouraging its customers to check their other products and services. These customers are also more likely to consider the newly launched products and services from this&nbsp;brand.</p><p>The simple act of exploring what are the other things your brand has to offer can be very valuable for sales revenues. At the same time, these customers can also provide vital feedback regarding the honest quality of the product and services and how they could be further improved later&nbsp;on.</p> 10. LOYAL CUSTOMERS PROVIDE MORE&nbsp;FEEDBACK <p>Customer feedback plays a vital role in the success of a business. It can serve as a guide on essential business decisions regarding your products and services. It also provides you with a clear direction on which aspects you have to improve. Unfortunately, it’s rare to see customers who take time out of their busy lives and provide businesses with feedback unless they are loyal to&nbsp;them.</p><p>Whether it’s positive or negative, receiving feedback from customers is a good thing. Bad feedback is an opportunity to show them that you genuinely care about their satisfaction. Plus, the fact that you make an effort to improve based on negative feedback will make you stand out since most businesses out there just leave them unresolved.</p> 11. WORD OF THE MOUTH REFERRALS ALLOWS YOU TO EARN&nbsp;MORE <p>You also get acquisition benefits from doing customer retention efforts. This is because your loyal customers will be the ones who will be bringing new business.</p><p>Loyal customers who are confident with your products and service won’t hesitate to recommend you to their brands and services. This is a very prominent trend, especially among millennials who are not shy about sharing their brand preferences online.</p> TIPS ON HOW TO INCREASE CUSTOMER RETENTION <p>There’s no denying that the benefits of customer retention can help a business soar to greater heights. With this in mind, here are some customer retention tips that you might want to consider applying to your business.</p> KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER RETENTION RATE <p>The first thing that you have to do to increase your customer retention rate is to know what your current rate is in the first&nbsp;place.</p><p>You can compute your customer retention rate for a specific period by subtracting the newly acquired customers and dividing it by the number of customers that you originally had at the start of the period. The result of this will then be multiplied by 100 to get your total retention rate.</p><p>Your retention rate will show you how happy customers are and how they value the products and services that you are providing. It will also reveal if your source of revenue is reliable or if you have to make some improvements.</p> INCREASE YOUR ENGAGEMENT <p>Increasing your retention rates means that you should also up your customer engagement efforts. Convincing customers to become repeat buyers requires target effort to help earn their trust. The best approach to doing this is by actively engaging with&nbsp;them.</p><p>There are several ways for you to increase your engagement with your customers. Some examples include the following:</p>  Personalize content  Make it easy for customers to reach out to&nbsp;you  Take advantage of social&nbsp;media  Make your brand meaningful and relatable   BUILD TRUST <p>Trust is the foundation of a good relationship between a company and its customers. However, establishing this is easier said than done. But, there are basically 2 main things that you should always remember:</p>  Building trust takes&nbsp;time  Don’t assume that just because customers trust you then they will automatically buy from&nbsp;you.  <p>There is no one-size-fits-all strategy when it comes to building trust. However, one of the main things that you should focus on if this is your goal is making sure that you are reliable and you consistently deliver value to customers. It would also help if you follow through with your brand promises and&nbsp;claims.</p> USE VARIOUS COMMUNICATION CHANNELS <p>In this day and age, there are various communication options available at a person’s disposal. If you want to increase your customer retention, you should take advantage of&nbsp;it.</p><p>When reaching out to customers, it’s also highly recommended to maintain a communication calendar. Don’t just send them a message or email on holidays and special occasions. You should also make an effort to re-establish your relationship by asking customers how they are doing from time to&nbsp;time.</p><p>However, make sure to be strategic when reaching out to customers. Your approach must still follow the essence of your brand tone and messaging.</p><p>Conversely, it should also be easy for customers to reach out to you if they have concerns or questions. You should make it more accessible for them to leave comments and reviews regarding the products and services that you have to offer. The best way of doing that is by opening various communication channels other than the traditional emails and phone&nbsp;numbers.</p> FINAL WORDS <p>When done right, customer retention can significantly help make your business successful. However, it does have a learning curve and you need to invest time, money, and effort into the process. But, given the list of benefits mentioned above, those efforts will eventually pay&nbsp;off.</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/retention-benefits/">https://www.monetha.io</a>.</p>

 Time to Have YOUR&nbsp;Say. <blockquote>Time: 5am, April 25th, 2022–5am May 2nd, 2022&nbsp;(UTC)</blockquote><p>At the start of April, Ontology announced the launch of their <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-promotes-web3-and-privacy-innovation-through-dorahacks-hackathon-and-100k-usd-developer-be8b5cea4f54">$100,000 global virtual hackathon with DoraHacks</a>, to help BUIDL the future of Web3. The Ontology grants program is running between the 1st-30th April, and offers Web3 developers the opportunity to showcase their ideas, particularly around privacy and decentralized identity.</p><p>Projects are being submitted at the official DoraHacks <a href="https://dorahacks.io/grant/ontology/">portal</a>, and developers are encouraged to keep submitting their projects, with more details available in the handy Dorahacks <a href="https://dorahacks.io/blog/guides/ontology-grant-hackathon-voting-guide/">guide</a>.</p><p>Of course, with all of these great ideas being submitted, we’re going to need some help voting for the winners. This is where you can help to vote for the projects you like, and increase the prize pool available to them. All of your votes will count towards the prize pool for developers, providing even greater incentives for them to build the Web3 we want to experience.</p><p>To thank you for taking the time to vote, we have over 1500 ONG to give away to people who take the time to vote for their favorite projects. Taking part couldn’t be easier, simply follow the official <a href="https://publicdocs.gitbook.io/onto-web-help-center/guides/interact-with-dapps/ontology-x-dorahacks-hackathon-voting-guide">VOTING&nbsp;GUIDE</a>.</p> Rules:  1. First-Come-First-Served (900&nbsp;ONG) <p>The first 300 participants voting for candidate projects in the Ontology Grant Hackathon, will each earn 3&nbsp;ONG.</p> 2. Top Voters (390&nbsp;ONG) <p>The 10 participants with the highest vote total will share the ONG reward&nbsp;pool</p><blockquote>Top 1: 100&nbsp;ONG</blockquote><blockquote>Top 2: 70&nbsp;ONG</blockquote><blockquote>Top 3: 50&nbsp;ONG</blockquote><blockquote>Top 4–6: 30 ONG&nbsp;each</blockquote><blockquote>Top 7–10: 20 ONG&nbsp;each</blockquote><p>* If there are winners with the same number of votes, the corresponding rewards will be shared&nbsp;equally.</p> 3. Lucky Draw (300&nbsp;ONG) <p>Every vote you make equals one lucky draw ticket. 10 winners will each win 30 ONG in the&nbsp;draw.</p><p>Note that according to the <a href="https://dorahacks.io/blog/guides/ontology-grant-hackathon-voting-guide/">voting rules</a>, “The Nth vote towards the same project will cost N*1 ONG, so if you’re going to give 3 votes to the same project, you need to pay 1+2+3=6 ONG”. If you give 3 votes to 3 different projects, you need to pay 1+1+1=3&nbsp;ONG.</p><p>* Each participant can be rewarded only once. (The highest reward will be&nbsp;taken.)</p><p>ONG used for voting will not be returned to the voter, but will go to the project they voted for (minus a 5% protocol&nbsp;fee).</p><p>The Ontology team will reserve the final rights of interpretation of this&nbsp;event.</p><p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

Tether를 대체하는 Stablecoin(USD $1 등 pegging, 고정된 가치를 유지하는)의 비전을 제시했고, 은행과 유사한 자산관리의 가능성을 Compound가, 그리고 탈중앙화 거래소(DEX)의 개념을 Uniswap 같은 곳에서 제시하기&nbsp;시작했다.</p><p>이에 더해 2020년과 작년 DeFi 2.0 시대를 이야기하면서 Protocol to control liquidity, 자산의 유동성에 대한 개념들이 나타나면서 Yield farming 같은 이자 농사나 기존 금융과 유사한 파생상품, 합성자산 등 다양한 시도들이 이루어졌다. 최근 들어서 아예 DeFi 3.0을 언급하면서 Money Lego(레고 조립하듯이 맞다)라는 용어들도 등장하면서, 내부 DeFi 팀에서 실험적으로 진행했던 프로젝트들이 어느 정도 구체화되는 단계가 드디어 된 것 같다. 이는 최근 코인플러그가 전문 파트너사와 JV(합자법인)으로 출범한 <a href="https://uupfi.com/">Uupfi</a>나 <a href="https://deltafinance.io/">DeltaFinance</a> 같은 DeFi 사업들의 출발점에&nbsp;해당한다.</p><p>메타디움의 첫 DApp 제품이었던 <a href="https://metadium.com/products#keepin-application">Keepin</a>과 코인플러그의 보다 한국형(?) 서비스인 <a href="https://www.mykeepin.com">MYKEEPiN(마이키핀)</a>은 모두 DID(Decentralized ID, 탈중앙화 신원증명) 기반 서비스들인데, 이는 다른 말로 ‘신원인증 지갑'이라고도 불린다. NFT 소유뿐만 아니라 인증 정보들이 각종 기술로서 구현되어 있는데, 이는 이러한 DeFi 생태계에 있어서 극도로 단순화하여 보통 강의에서 설명하는 ‘지갑과 노드와의 연결'이라는 블록체인 내에서 토큰 정보뿐만 아니라 각종 투표와 승인 과정에 있어서 이용자를 연결하는 이정표 역할을 하게&nbsp;된다.</p>각종 탈중앙화 거래소(DEX, Decentralized Exchanges)들이 이러한 DeFi 2.0 시장을 견인해왔다. © <a href="https://medium.com/@keplerswap_dex/whats-the-difference-between-defi-2-0-vs-defi-1-0-3be77ea02004">Keplerswap</a> Web3라고 불리는 User-owned Internet에서도 DID와 지갑(Wallet)은 모든 것의 시작점이&nbsp;된다 <p>최근 가장 많이 사용되고 있는 지갑인 MetaMask를 비롯해, 코인플러그도 한국 법제에 맞춰 마이키핀월렛(MYKEEPiN Wallet)의 <a href="https://news.naver.com/main/read.naver?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=101&amp;oid=003&amp;aid=0010905389">가상자산사업자 인증</a>(VASP, Virtual Asset Service Provider) 등을 통해 관련 사업들을 진행하고 있는데, 메타디움의 DID도 역시 이런 근간을 통해 관련 사업들이 추진된다. 보다 리워드 생태계를 투명하고 공정하게 관리하기 위해 메타디움 기반으로 <a href="https://news.naver.com/main/read.naver?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=105&amp;oid=421&amp;aid=0006036026">신규 토큰 발행을 진행 예정인 THEPOL</a>이나, 앞으로 공개할 신규 프로젝트들이 모두 이런 시작점으로서 DID가 활용되는&nbsp;구조이다.</p><p>특히 대표적으로 mirror.xyz나 DEX를 비롯한 각종 탈중앙화 커뮤니티, Web3 서비스들은 기존 SSO(Single sign-on, 통합로그인) 사업자인 Google, Facebook, Naver 같은 대형 중앙화된 사업자의 계정이 아닌, 내가 소유한 탈중앙화된 지갑주소, DID 계정으로 로그인하는 것이 당연하게 Web3 환경에서 공통적으로 구현되고 있다. 가장 유명한 MetaMask를 개발한 Consensys가 <a href="https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/metamask-surpasses-21-million-maus-as-consensys-raises-200-million-to-make-web3-universally-easy-to-use-access-and-build-on/">작년 11월 21M MAU</a>(월간 이용자 2,100만명) 돌파, 지난 라운드 대비 최근 2배 이상의 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/15/metamask-parent-company-consensys-raises-series-d-at-7b-valuation/">기업가치 $7B(3월, 8.4조 규모) 평가, 투자유치</a>를 받은 것을 볼 때, 이 분야는 매우 빠른 성장 속도를 보여주고&nbsp;있다.</p><p>벤처캐피탈(VC) 등 투자업계도 마찬가지여서 다들 인터넷을 편하게 우리가 지금처럼 쓸 수 있도록 만들어준 Mosaic 브라우저와 최초의 상용화된 브라우저인 Netscape를 만든 Marc Andreessen과, 지금은 우리가 쓰는 메신저나 슬랙(Slack) 같은 협업 도구 — SaaS (Software as a Service)라는 개념과 DevOps 개념을 제시했던 Opsware의 Ben Horowitz가 만든 A16Z (Andreessen Horowitz)가 가장 이 분야에 적극적인 투자를 보여주는데, 이들 투자 포트폴리오 상위 3개 카테고리는 다름 아닌 DeFi, NFT / Digital Ownership, Security / Privacy&nbsp;분야이다.</p><a href="https://medium.com/@nick.5montana/a16z-crypto-portfolio-breakdown-89836229def7">https://medium.com/@nick.5montana/a16z-crypto-portfolio-breakdown-89836229def7</a> Metadium 팀과 함께 먼저 선보인 NFT 마켓에 이어 DeFi 로드맵이 드디어 곧 공개될&nbsp;예정이다 <p>격변하는 시장 분위기 탓인지, 작년부터 부쩍 관련 문의들을 코인플러그는 물론 Metadium Team도 동일하게 요청받고 있어서, 지금까지 진행해온 경험적 자산을 바탕으로 향후 새로운 로드맵을 함께 정비 중에 있다. 최근 ReFi(Re-imagined Finance)를 표방한 곳이나 DeFi 3.0이라 언급하고 있는 다양한 자산들을 다루는 기술들을 종합하고, 코인플러그 역시 IRL(In Real Life) 현실 세계와 연결된 DID 기술과 경험으로서 보다 적극적으로 메타디움 팀과 협력하고자&nbsp;한다.</p><p>최근 발표한 관광이나 배달, 물류 등에서 친환경 전기차를 통해 추진하는 EMC(Energy/Mobility Cluster) 컨소시엄 역시 주로 코인플러그에서 그동안 쌓아온 전통적 IT 서비스 기술 영역의 대표 사례들 — 부산 블록체인 특구사업에서 보여준 DID의 지방정부 활용 사례, 경기도 퓨처쇼에서 보여준 실제 방문 현장에서의 신원인증과 관련된 사례, 그리고 주문배송 O2O 사업에서 보여준 운전면허 인증이나 대표적인 실생활 사례에서 오는 각종 Legacy 비즈니스와 맞닿을 경우 파급력 높게 이 시장이 성장할 수 있을 것으로&nbsp;기대한다.</p><p>앞으로 공시 외에도 양사 간 메타디움(Medium) 공식 채널 등을 통해 보다 더 자세하게 로드맵과 연관된 프로젝트들의 의미, 추진 상황 등을 지속적으로 공유할 계획이다. 한국 기업 중 협력하실 분들은 언제든지 <a href="https://mykeepin.org">마이키핀얼라이언스</a> 통해서 가입/연락 주시면 관련된 네트워킹을 비롯해 신규 프로젝트 중 적합한 사례들을 연결하여, 지금까지 다소 진입장벽이 높았던 DeFi 프로젝트들의 실제 생활에서의 사례를 만드는 과정에 함께할&nbsp;예정이다.</p><p>Stay tuned!</p><p>코인플러그 &amp; 메타디움&nbsp;팀</p><p><a href="https://mykeepin.org">마이키핀 얼라이언스</a></p><p>최근 업데이트된 코인플러그 웹사이트도 한 번 방문하시면 그동안에 쌓여있는 경험 자산들을 확인해 보실 수 있다.

<p>Blocko Signs An MOU With Bespin Global To Promote Blockchain MSP (Managed Service Provider)Business</p>Blocko Has Just Signed The Largest MOU In Its History: Bespin Global Has 2000 Enterprise Customers!<p>Introduction: The Great Cooperation: Blocko And&nbsp;Bespin</p>Bespin Global and Blocko signed a business agreement to promote the blockchain MSP business. (Left) Han-Joo Lee, CEO of Bespin Global, and Jae Shin, Executive Vice President of Blocko&nbsp;(Right)<p>It is evident that Blocko has made massive strides to become one of the largest service providers for enterprise blockchains, not only in Korea, but globally. Today, Blocko is proud to announce that Bespin Global and Blocko have signed an MOU to establish a cooperative system to promote the blockchain MSP (Managed Service Provider) business. These two enterprise grade behemoths compliment one another through mutually related industries. Bespin Global, whose aim is to be the world’s most automated management company meets blockchain specialization through the enterprise grade reliability and expertise of Blocko. This dynamic paradigm will emphasize and promote blockchain and cloud technology support through technological collaboration and specific know-how and solution models. This business agreement was made with the primary goal of providing blockchain technology conveniently and safely to corporate customers.</p><p>The Close Cooperation Model: The Compliments Of Enterprise Business Agreements</p>Bespin Global: Helping You Adopt Cloud Through Bespin And Blockchain Through&nbsp;Blocko<p>There is always a reason, a goal and a vision behind business collaborations; they’re never made haphazardly without a defined goal. These two companies plan to establish a close cooperation system for the successful initiation and implementation of the blockchain-specialized MSP project to cooperate with each other. Blocko will provide its technological know-how and related solutions as a blockchain specialized company, and Bespin Global will also support cloud technology know-how, networks and solutions. Blocko is a blockchain-specialized MSP (Managed Service Provider) that helps anyone easily use the often times complex blockchain systems that enterprises are still attempting how to utilize to their benefit, simultaneously it reduces the troubles of companies adopting blockchain through the Aergo mainnet-based blockchain technology.</p><p>Bespin Global is a cloud delivery platform company that provides comprehensive cloud services such as migration to the cloud environment, construction, operation, management, DevOps, big data, and security. Hanju Lee, CEO of Bespin Global, said, “Through this MOU, Bespin Global’s experience of operating cloud-based services for over 2,000 customers and Blocko’s unrivaled blockchain technology are combined. I am confident that the partnership between the two companies will be a new leap forward in the blockchain management and operation industry. We will collaborate with Jonghwan Kim.” Jonghwan Kim, CEO of Blocko emphasized “blockchain is a technological innovation with infinite potential for future development. Through this agreement, Bespin Global will be able to receive support for cloud operation management know-how. We hope that the mutual cooperation between the two companies will serve as an opportunity to easily provide blockchain-based services to more customers, such as the STO (Security Token Disclosure) service, which has recently been in rapid demand.” Now I know AERGO token holders are wondering “how does this benefit me as a token holder”, well, the possibilities are numerous.</p><p>The Bespin And Blocko Collaboration: AERGO Possibilities: Endless: 2000 Enterprise Customers</p>2000 Enterprise Customers From Bespin Global Will Be Introduced To AERGO: Its Time To Show You&nbsp;How<p>Bespin Global, specializing in cloud IT software, aims to utilize the AERGO mainnet through a variety of ways, adding to the utility of the platform on an immense scale. Bespin Global has expressed interest in converting their enterprise customers with a point system to an STO based platform that is, you heard it here first, on the AERGO mainnet! Jae Shin has begun to train the Bespin salesforce as well as the engineers to turn this vision into a concrete reality of utility for the AERGO mainnet. Not only will an STO based platform be utilized on the AERGO mainnet in association with Bespin Global, but increased utility will occur with GEMPAY, as it will play a massive role in this brand new paradigm; PlusFi will also be a major role in accordance to Bespin&nbsp;Global.</p><p>Through the utilization of GEMPAY, the net result of accelerated adoption of the AERGO token has the potential to be massive. GEMPAY will be the wallet that will hold all the various new tokens onboarded by enterprise clients as well as AERGO mainnet tokens; now why is this important, because it introduces enterprise customers to the AERGO platform and the AERGO mainnet tokens. The successful amalgamation of an STO platform as a service, built on the AERGO platform for new enterprise customers and the Bespin salesforce introducing this platform to their two-thousand enterprise clients cannot be overstated. PlusFi will also play a major role in these new inductions into the AERGO ecosystem. If you aren’t aware of the intricacies of PlusFi, think of it as the KlaySwap Service for the AERGO platform: PlusFi is the AERGO Swap Service. The AERGO Gem will be the stable token pegged to the Korean Won. As more tokens within the ecosystem are successfully issued and launched, there will be a necessary hub for swaps, this is where PlusFi comes in! Our expectation is that new token issuers will provide liquidity for their swaps, adding more liquidity into the AERGO sphere. The opportunities for AERGO’s expansion, with this brand new collaboration, are&nbsp;endless!</p><p>Conclusion: The Blocko Expansion: Fueling The Accelerated Adoption Of&nbsp;AERGO</p>As Blocko Expands, AERGO Adoption&nbsp;Expands<p>It is evident that the MOU between Blocko and Bespin Global will onboard numerous enterprise grade clients into the AERGO ecosystem through the expertise delivered by both of these companies. This is a massive feat for Blocko and Bespin Global alike; successfully amalgamating their mutual expertise’s to develop solutions for one another, while simultaneously enabling over two-thousand clients to interact with the AERGO mainnet, it is a complete win for every enterprise involved. This fostering of relationships are what propel businesses forward, and in this case, Blocko, Bespin Global and&nbsp;AERGO.</p><p>Disclaimer: Cryptocurrency investing involves substantial risk. Do not invest more than you can afford to lose! I am not responsible for your&nbsp;trades!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/the-blocko-story-of-the-century-the-great-mou-74485e11abea">The Blocko Story Of The Century: The Great MOU</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">John Tolbert</a></p><p>The Payment Card Industry (PCI) Standards Council has <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI-DSS-v4_0.pdf?agreement=true&amp;time=1648815252915">published a major update to the Data Security Standard (DSS), version 4.0.</a> This version is an improvement over the current version, 3.2.1, which came out in 2018. &nbsp;<br><br>The new publication directs organizations that need to be compliant with the standard to</p>

 build-in “Dynamic Analysis”, or risk-based authentication, in alignment with Zero Trust 
 perform access reconciliations

 use file integrity monitoring 
 deploy and integrate Physical Access Control Systems (PACS) 
 utilize strong data and transport layer encryption 
 use key management. 
 
<p>All of the items on the list above are good generic recommendations for any organization. Though PCI-DSS 4.0 was only recently published and will not fully take effect for up to three years, it’s never too early to suggest improvements. What follows is an examination of some of the provisions in PCI-DSS 4.0. <br><br>Section 1.4.4: “System components that store cardholder data are not directly accessible from untrusted networks.” The notion of trusted and untrusted networks is outdated and ineffective today. The <a href="https://tsapps.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=930420">principles of Zero Trust Architecture</a> mandate proper authentication and authorization for each resource access attempt, regardless of source network or IP address. This is necessary, but not necessarily easy, to reduce risks of attacks that originate from what may have once been considered the trusted network. PCI-DSS 4.0 does refer to the NIST SP 800-207 but should have been more prescriptive about using Zero Trust as a basis for all aspects of implementation. <br><br><br>Figure 1: How Zero Trust Spans Multiple Areas of IT <br><br>Section 2.2.2 provides guidance for how to manage and use vendor default accounts. These accounts are defined as “…accounts and passwords, including, but not limited to, those used by operating systems, software that provides security services, application and system accounts, point-of-sale (POS) terminals, payment applications, and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) defaults” (p.64). PCI-DSS 4.0 states that such passwords be changed in accordance with requirement 8.3.6, or to have inactive accounts disabled.&nbsp; Ideally, passwords should be eliminated with passwordless, risk-analysis-based, multi-factor authentication methods. For situations where service accounts with passwords still exist, PCI-DSS 4.0 should have mandated the use of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/bc80200/privileged-access-management">Privileged Access Management solutions</a>. The related technology of password vaults is mentioned in sections 8.2.3 and 8.6.2-3. <br><br>Section 4.2.1 mentions that exploits are available for old SSL and “early TLS” crypto. TLS 1.3 is the current version and should be at least recommended. Given the context around Point-of-Sale (POS) systems, we understand that full scale replacement of so many devices in the field will take some time. &nbsp;<br><br>Section 5.2.1-3 requires the use of anti-malware solutions on all systems that are at risk from malware. This leaves an out for systems that cannot run anti-malware agents or are not thought to be at risk: “Certain systems, at a given point in time, may not currently be commonly targeted or affected by malware. However, industry trends for malware can change quickly, so it is important for organizations to be aware of new malware that might affect their systems” (p. 115). KuppingerCole encourages the use of full Endpoint Protection Detection &amp; Response (EPDR) solutions wherever possible. If for some reason components of your architecture don’t support EPDR agents, then use other controls and monitoring tools such as Network Detection &amp; Response (NDR). <br><br>Section 8 pertains to “Processes and mechanisms for identifying users and authenticating access to system components” (p. 163).&nbsp; This section applies to employees, contractors, consultants, and other 3rd-parties, but intentionally does not address accounts held by consumers or cardholders. It loosely differentiates between identification and authentication. US NIST SP 800-63 is mentioned, but no clear processes for identity proofing or provisioning are defined. Group accounts are discouraged but not disallowed. Identity de-provisioning is required for terminated users, and user accounts must be at least disabled after 90 days of inactivity. Sessions should timeout after 15 minutes. &nbsp;<br><br>Section 8.3.3 says that a user identity must be verified before allowing modification to authentication factors. This is a good recommendation, but it is followed with an example of using Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA) or using “security questions”. KBA is an extremely weak form of authentication and/or identification and should be avoided if possible. &nbsp;<br><br>Section 11.4 states that internal and external penetration testing should be performed every 12 months. Annual pen testing is insufficient. Organizations in this industry should instead use more state-of-the-art Attack Surface Management tools. &nbsp;<br><br>Section 11.5 calls for Intrusion Detection Systems to be used in critical areas. Network Detection &amp; Response (NDR) tools are the more modern and effective alternatives. <br><br>PCI-DSS 4.0 does make some headway in prescribing security posture enhancements. Identity management components, though, are not as well defined as they should be. However, the reality is that the organizations that make up the payment services and broader financial services ecosystems are motivated to go beyond PCI-DSS <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research?q=Fraud+Reduction">to reduce the ever-present and seemingly ever-increasing risks of fraud</a>. Moreover, members of the payment services and financial services industries have specifications from other industry consortia and differing regulations in various jurisdictions to consider when building and upgrading their infrastructure. Mappings and/or harmonizations between these specifications and regulations would be useful. Explicit references to governmental standards such as EU PSD2 (Strong Customer Authentication) and US NIST SP 800-63 (Authentication Assurance Levels) would be helpful as well. <br><br>Building compliant systems and then demonstrating compliance with specifications such as PCI-DSS requires effort and expense but are necessary to reduce fraud.

<p>Getting something to work is one of the greatest feelings you can have as a developer. Especially when you’ve spent hours, days, or months trying to make it happen. The last mile can be one of the most painful and rewarding experiences, all wrapped into the same day or two.</p>
 
 
<p>I experienced this recently with <a>Spring Native for JHipster</a>. If I look back, it took a year’s worth of desire, research, and perseverance to make it happen. When we finally got it working—and automated—you can imagine my excitement!</p>
 
 
<p>After a few days of euphoria, I thought it’d be easy to create native builds for each operating system (Linux, macOS, and Windows) using GitHub Actions. I was wrong.</p>
 
 
<p>If you’d like to follow along and learn how to configure GitHub Actions to create native binaries, you’ll need a few prerequisites.</p>
 
 
<p>Prerequisites:</p>

 Configure a JHipster app to use GitHub Actions 
 
 
<p>I’m going to speed things up for you and just show you how to configure GitHub Actions for an existing JHipster app. In this case, it’s a full-stack React + Spring Boot app.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>If you’d like a bit more background, please read <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/full-stack-java-with-react-spring-boot-and-jhipster/">Full Stack Java with React, Spring Boot, and JHipster</a> followed by <a>Introducing Spring Native for JHipster</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Clone the result of these two blog posts, right after I integrated the JHipster Native blueprint. Install its dependencies using npm.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git clone -b jhipster-native-1.1.2 \
  https://github.com/oktadev/auth0-full-stack-java-example.git flickr2
cd flickr2
npm install</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, create a <a href="https://github.com/new">new repo on GitHub</a>. For example, <code>jhipster-flickr2</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>Next, push this example project to it.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>USERNAME=&lt;your-github-username&gt;
git remote rm origin
git remote add origin git@github.com:${USERNAME}/jhipster-flickr2.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 Automate the wait with JHipster’s CI/CD 
 
 
<p>Building native images with GraalVM brings me back to the days when we’d build Java apps with Ant and XDoclet in the early 2000s. We’d start the build and go do something else for a while because it took several minutes for the artifact to be built.</p>
 
 
<p>Another often-overlooked issue with native binaries is that you have to build one for each operating system. It’s not like Java, where you can build a JAR (Java ARchive) and run it anywhere.</p>
 
 
<p>Next, generate continuous integration (CI) workflows using <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/setting-up-ci/">JHipster’s CI/CD sub-generator</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npx jhipster ci-cd</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This command will prompt you to select a CI/CD pipeline. Select GitHub Actions.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>When prompted for the tasks/integrations for this quick example (Sonar, Docker, Snyk, Heroku, and Cypress Dashboard), don’t select any. The sub-generator will create three files:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p><code>.github/workflows/main.yml</code></p>
 
 
<p><code>.github/workflows/native.yml</code></p>
 
 
<p><code>.github/workflows/native-artifact.yml</code></p>
 
 
 
 
<p>I’ll show you what each file contains in the sections below. Let’s start by examining <code>main.yml</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>The <code>main.yml</code> workflow file configures GitHub Actions to check out your project, configure Node 16, configure Java 11, run your project’s backend/frontend unit tests, and run its end-to-end tests. Not only that, it’ll start your dependent containers (e.g., Keycloak) in Docker. You can see that most of this functionality is hidden behind <code>npm run</code> commands.</p>

<p>To test this out on your new repository, you’ll need to create a branch and pull request (PR) with your changes.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git checkout -b actions

git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions"
git push origin actions</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You should see a link in your terminal to create a pull request (PR).</p>
 
 
 
 <code>remote: Create a pull request for 'actions' on GitHub by visiting:
remote:      https://github.com/mraible/jhipster-flickr2/pull/new/actions</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you watch the tests run from your PR, you’ll be pretty pleased until it hits the E2E: Package phase. It’ll likely fail with the following error:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>Found orphan containers (docker_keycloak_1) for this project. If you removed or renamed
this service in your compose file, you can run this command with the --remove-orphans flag
to clean it up.</code> 
 
 
 
<p>I <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/18387">reported this issue in JHipster</a> since <code>--remove-orphans</code> was recently removed from the <code>docker:db:down</code> and <code>docker:keycloak:down</code> commands. The explanation provided enough information for me to close the issue. Add them back into <code>package.json</code> as a workaround.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>"scripts": {
  ...
  "docker:db:down": "... --remove-orphans",
  ...
  "docker:keycloak:down": "... --remove-orphans",

<p>Commit and push these changes. Now everything should pass.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Merge this PR into the <code>main</code> branch.</p>
 
 
 
 
 The environmental impact of GraalVM builds 
 
 
<p>This brings us to an interesting dilemma. If you’re creating native images as your application’s distribution artifact, shouldn’t you use the <a href="https://github.com/graalvm/setup-graalvm/issues/6">setup-graalvm action</a> to configure GraalVM and your Java SDK?</p>
 
 
<p>I don’t think so. If you do, every time you create a PR and commit to it, it will run a native build. A GraalVM build of this project takes 3-4 minutes for me locally. With GitHub Actions, it takes 30+ minutes!</p>
 
 
<p>To me, this seems as bad for the environment as cryptocurrency. If you’re using a private repo, it’ll also make you wish you bought crypto several years ago. You only get 2000 free minutes of GitHub Actions for private repos. Any minutes after that, you get charged for.</p>
 
 
<p>Yes, I know the cryptocurrency topic is controversial. I do like to poke fun at it though. Native builds on every commit and mining bitcoin seem similar to me. Then again, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90717181/surfing-the-web-isnt-just-bad-for-your-brain-its-terrible-for-the-environment">simply surfing the web</a> is terrible for the environment too.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Best Practices for GraalVM with GitHub Actions 
 
 
<p>When I first started investigating GitHub Actions for GraalVM, the JHipster Native blueprint modified commands in <code>package.json</code> to always build native images and to use them when running end-to-end tests. This meant that when you first tried to add GitHub Actions support, the build would fail because <code>GRAALVM_HOME</code> wasn’t found. To solve this, you could switch from <code>actions/setup-java</code> to <code>graalvm/setup-graalvm</code>, but that’s not very environmentally sustainable.</p>
 
 
<p>Since then, we’ve modified the blueprint to generate two new workflows that reflect (in my opinion) best practices for GitHub Actions and GraalVM.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p><code>native.yml</code>: run nightly tests at midnight using GraalVM</p>
 
 
<p><code>native-artifact.yml</code>: builds and uploads native binaries for releases</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>The <code>main.yml</code> stays the same as JHipster’s default and continuously tests on the JVM.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Run nightly tests with GraalVM and GitHub Actions 
 
 
<p>The <code>native.yml</code> workflow file performs similar actions to <code>main.yml</code>, but with GraalVM. It runs on a schedule every day at midnight UTC. Adding a timezone is <a href="https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions/13454">currently not supported</a>.</p>

 How to build and upload native binaries when releasing on GitHub 
 
 
<p>The <code>native-artifact.yml</code> workflow file creates binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows when a release is created. This workflow configures Linux and Windows to have enough memory, uploads artifacts to the actions job, and uploads the native binaries to the release on GitHub. It will only execute when you create a release (aka a tag).</p>

 Linux and Windows problems and solutions 
 
<p>When I first started trying to build native binaries with GraalVM, I quickly ran into <a href="https://github.com/graalvm/setup-graalvm/issues/6">issues</a> on Linux and Windows:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Linux: <code>java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded</code></p>
 
 
<p>Windows: <code>The command line is too long.</code></p>
 
 
 
 
<p>I’m happy to say that I was able to fix the OOM error on Linux by specifying <code>-J-Xmx10g</code> in the build arguments of the <code>native-maven-plugin</code> plugin. JHipster Native now configures this setting by default and optimizes it for your OS when building native artifacts.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;native-image-name&gt;native-executable&lt;/native-image-name&gt;
&lt;native-build-args&gt;--verbose -J-Xmx10g&lt;/native-build-args&gt;
...
&lt;plugin&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.graalvm.buildtools&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;native-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    ..
    &lt;configuration&gt;
        &lt;imageName&gt;${native-image-name}&lt;/imageName&gt;
        &lt;buildArgs&gt;
            &lt;buildArg&gt;--no-fallback ${native-build-args}&lt;/buildArg&gt;
        &lt;/buildArgs&gt;
    &lt;/configuration&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The Windows issue was fixed by <a href="https://github.com/graalvm/setup-graalvm/issues/6#issuecomment-1054582083">native build tools 0.9.10</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>We use <code>windows-2019</code> instead of <code>windows-latest</code> because I <a href="https://github.com/graalvm/setup-graalvm/issues/6#issuecomment-1058328963">ran out of disk space</a> when I tried it.</p>
 
 
 
 Publish a release on GitHub 
 
<p>Open your repository’s page in your favorite browser and click Create a new release. Create a new <code>v0.0.1</code> tag, title the release <code>v0.0.1</code>, and add some fun text in the description. Click Publish release.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Click the Actions tab to watch your release execute. I want to warn you though, it’s gonna take a while! My <a href="https://twitter.com/mraible/status/1498471457638293507">first successful release</a> took just under an hour.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>macOS: 31m 30s</p>
 
 
<p>Linux: 33m 50s</p>
 
 
<p>Windows: 59m 45s</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>I think you’ll be pleased with the results. 🤠</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 






If your builds fail, you can delete the tag for the release by running <code>git push origin :v0.0.1</code>. Your release will then become a draft, and you can easily create the release again using the GitHub UI.



 
 
 
 
 
 Run your released binaries locally 
 
 
<p>If you were to download these binaries from GitHub and try to run them locally, you’d get failures because they can’t connect to instances of Keycloak or PostgreSQL.</p>
 
 
<p>To start up a PostgreSQL database for the app to talk to, you can run the following command from your <code>flickr2</code> directory.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>docker-compose -f src/main/docker/postgresql.yml up -d</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You could do the same for Keycloak:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>docker-compose -f src/main/docker/keycloak.yml up -d</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Or, configure the app to use <a>Okta</a> or <a>Auth0</a>!</p>
 
 
<p>The Okta CLI makes it so easy, you can do it in minutes.</p>
 
 
<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create jhipster</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
  Accept the default Redirect URI values provided for you.</p>
 

  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI streamlines configuring a JHipster app and does several things for you:</p>

 
   Creates an OIDC app with the correct redirect URIs:
     
       login: <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> 
       logout: <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761</code> 
     
   
   Creates <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups that JHipster expects 
   Adds your current user to the <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups 
   Creates a <code>groups</code> claim in your default authorization server and adds the user’s groups to it 
 

<p>NOTE: The <code>http://localhost:8761*</code> redirect URIs are for the JHipster Registry, which is often used when creating microservices with JHipster. The Okta CLI adds these by default.</p>

<p>You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app. It will look like this (except the placeholder values will be populated):</p>

   <code>export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI="/oauth2/default"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID="{clientId}"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET="{clientSecret}"
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#okta">Create a JHipster App on Okta</a> for more information.</p>


 
<p>Then, start the app by setting the environment variables from <code>.okta.env</code> and executing the binary. For example:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>source .okta.env
chmod +x flickr2-macOS-v0.0.1-x86_64
./flickr2-macOS-v0.0.1-x86_64
# verify in System Preferences &gt; Security &amp; Privacy and run again</code> 
 
 
 






If you’re on Windows, you may need to install the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a> for these commands to succeed. Or, you can rename <code>.okta.env</code> to <code>okta.bat</code> and change <code>export</code> to <code>set</code> in the file. Then, run it from your terminal to set the variables.



 
 
<p>Everything should work as expected. Pretty slick, don’t you think?</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>You can see a released version of the artifacts <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/auth0-full-stack-java-example/releases">on the auth0-full-stack-java-example’s releases page</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Learn more about CI, JHipster, and GraalVM 
 
 
<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed this tour of how to configure GitHub Actions to create GraalVM binaries of Java applications. Native binaries start quite a bit faster than JARs, but they take a lot longer to build. That’s why it’s a good idea to farm out those processes to a continuous integration server.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Matthias Reinwarth</a></p><p>Let us face it, we do not have a choice. The overall context for all our activities and every interaction has been and is being changed without us being asked. Digital Transformation is here, and it impacts everyone, businesses, and governments. It is changing society as a whole and the way we engage with each other in virtually every area of life.&nbsp; The question of if and when to develop a digital transformation strategy is not even an issue. The need for a comprehensive approach and the resulting challenges are crystal clear.</p>
 <br>The next normal 
<p>The next normal will definitely not be the status quo ante. The mirroring of formerly analog processes in every aspect of our lives by their digital equivalents is a reality and has become part of the reality of everyone's life. Powerful end devices, which 30 years ago could be described as supercomputers, are in our pockets, sit on our desks, are central components in our car dashboards, and add gaming and entertainment to our televisions. Even more, the fact that the European Identity and Cloud Conference 2022 (EIC2022) will take place in May in Berlin in a hybrid form, so that participants can decide whether they want to "be there" in digital or analog form, is an unmistakable indication that this area of life, the event industry, is also changing accordingly, in other words, is being digitally transformed.</p>
 <br>The world is colorful and hostile&nbsp; 
<p>At the same time, the threat situation has continuously intensified. Identity theft and fraud are commonplace. Digital infrastructures of all kinds are subject to continuous attacks from a wide variety of actors. The geopolitical situation, which changed with force in March 2022, brings new and more threats, and the number of hostile actors increases even more. While this is only one of the drivers, the overall number of attacks is consistently increasing. <br><br>Platforms and users alike must be comprehensively and sustainably protected against this. This does not only concern the interaction of customers with online platforms for the sale of goods and services. Company employees (both employed and external) will also increasingly want to access company resources from anywhere in the future. Changing supply chains enable completely new ways of interaction between companies, their partners, and their respective employees.</p>
<p></p>
 All access must be user-friendly and secure 
<p>All our daily interactions are becoming more digital, forward thinking decision makers have a responsibility here and now to make these changing processes strategically secure and user friendly. &nbsp;<br><br>Again, let us be honest: the last few years have spoiled us as users; we are now, after two years (and counting) of a pandemic, more accustomed than ever to extremely user-friendly digital processes. In online shopping, for example, we have a choice. If onboarding or using digital services is bumpy or lengthy, in many cases we can simply choose another digital platform that is more in line with our expectations. <br><br>All of this defines the standard we should set for any access to digital services, whether as an employee, a customer, a citizen, or a partner's employee: access must be as user-friendly and seamless as it can possibly be in any given situation. In parallel, the highest level of security and privacy must be ensured for personal data and the breadth of digitally transformed services provided.</p>
<p></p>
 Seamless Access at EIC 2022 
<p>Enabling appropriate and secure access of all identities to all services they need is a central credo of IAM (Identity and Access Management) at KuppingerCole Analysts. &nbsp;<br><br>The KuppingerCole Identity Fabric, an indispensable component in modeling future-proof IAM concepts has just been extended and updated in some details. As a framework and guideline describing a modern, future proof and adaptable IAM, it demands and promotes seamless and secure access for every actor to all required resources.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br><br>The same applies analogously to the KuppingerCole Analysts IAM Reference Architecture.

<p>The global market for identity and access management was <a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/identity-and-access-management-market-100373">$9.53 billion</a> USD in 2018 and is expected to reach $24.76 billion USD by the end of 2026, showing a CAGR of 13.2% during the forecast year. </p>



  



<p>The identity and access market is growing at an unprecedented rate, due, in part, to the rising need for compliance management and the demand for mobility solutions. </p>



<p>In the case of an avoidable data breach, the costs come in the form of compromised data, lost resources, and fines under privacy legislation, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). </p>



<p>The ability to accurately validate a user’s identity is key to any security infrastructure because of these very real concerns, making identity proofing a necessity.&nbsp;</p>



 What is Identity Proofing? 



<p>Identity Proofing is the process of validating a user’s identity, or proving that they are who they claim to be. Though this process may appear to be standard authentication, such as a username and password combination, identity proofing is actually conducted before users receive their credentials to access an application or in conjunction with traditional authentication.</p>

<p>An identity proofing system includes:</p>



  Claimed identity: Information about a user’s declared identity when they register with an IAM system (who they claim to be).  Actual identity: Information that proves a user’s identification is genuine (who they are).  



<p>Identity proofing’s ultimate goal is to confirm that a user’s stated identity corresponds to their actual identity. In other words, that their identity is genuine and not made up or stolen. As a result, identity proofing is a first-line defense against today’s identity perimeter attacks.</p>



 How does Identity Proofing Work? 



<p>Before providing user access to your system, standard ways to verify identification include using life history (e.g., a credit report), <a href="https://imageware.io/biometric-voice-recognition/">biometrics</a> (e.g., a facial scan), along with other variables. Additionally, you can manually verify your users’ identities by requiring them to present paper evidence (e.g., a copy of their passport) or by using online meeting technologies, like Zoom, to conduct an interactive verification. </p>



<p>Though many of us are used to using these methods in the past, they’re time-consuming, manual processes that do not scale well and inevitably detract from your users’ experience.</p>



<p>In today’s tech-dominated global environment, adopting virtual ways of identity proofing is the most streamlined and efficient way to go. However, there are certain guidelines that you should follow:</p>



  Strength: Obtain official identification documents as proof of identity  Validity: Verify the documents’ authenticity  Activity: Use other records to track the prevalence of the identity through time  Identity Fraud: Assess the danger of identity fraud by comparing it to the national fraud database  Verification: Ensure that the identity claimed belongs to the person who claims it  



<p>This virtual process can be completed automatically with the identity proofing system taking the following steps: gather information about the user, verify their claimed identity matches their actual identity, and accept their registration or access request. </p>



<p>All of these steps occur in real-time, without the need for human interaction, resulting in a secure authentication system that does not compromise the user’s experience.</p>



 3 Key Benefits of Identity Proofing 



  Accelerates Brand Value: Given how cyberattacks influence a company’s finances, reputation, and, most importantly, customer experience, anyone considering doing business with a company will undoubtedly investigate the robustness of a company’s cybersecurity. Identity proofing dramatically reduces cyberthreats and projects a company’s public image as a brand that cares about its customers’ security.  Enhanced Operational Efficiency: The saying “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure” is apparent when looking at the effects of cyberattacks versus proactively blocking those attacks.. The consequences of cyberattacks are difficult to manage and reduce an organization’s operational efficiency. However, implementing identity proofing blocks unauthorized access, dramatically reducing cyberattacks.&nbsp; This Preemptively implementing identity proofing allows businesses to focus on establishing better security systems rather than constantly repairing the damage caused by cyberattacks.  Mitigating Identity Theft: During <a href="https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-emerging-threats-2019-data-breaches.html">February 2019,</a> an unauthorized entity gained access to an inactive data store at Capital One, exposing the names, e-mail addresses, and IP addresses of 106 million customers. Identity proofing helps avert these kinds of&nbsp; potential data breaches at their source. Unauthorized users are prevented from accessing critical systems or records because a user’s identity is verified.  



 Identity Proofing Solutions 



<p>Identity Proofing from Imageware is a configurable turnkey solution that allows businesses to authenticate users’ identities as part of a seamless digital onboarding process.</p>



<p>To establish their identification, new users can take a photograph of their driver’s license or other government-issued ID card using their phone, and then take a selfie or provide additional identifying information as needed. </p>

To learn more visit <a href="https://imageware.io/products/imageware-proof/">here</a>.</p>



 Conclusion&nbsp; 



<p>Cyber-attacks are becoming more common as businesses and people become more reliant on technology and cloud-based ecosystems. The advantages of identity proofing and cybersecurity are frequently overlooked by many businesses.</p>



<p>By enhancing privacy, the identity proofing process aids in creating a trustworthy brand in the minds of your customers.</p>

 A glossary explainer of our FATF Travel Rule solution (for dummies). <p>Veriscope is a blockchain-based solution powered by the Shyft Network, intended to allow crypto exchanges to comply with global regulations, most notably, the FATF (Financial Action Task Force) Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>In 2019, the FATF, an intergovernmental organization focused on preventing money laundering and other malicious financial activities, implemented the Travel Rule in crypto. This rule requires exchanges (referred to as VASPs) to collect personal data on participants in financial exchanges exceeding 1,000&nbsp;USD/EUR.</p><blockquote>Read: <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/8-reasons-to-choose-veriscope-cryptos-most-frictionless-secure-travel-rule-solution-d714b8056d08">8 Reasons to Choose Veriscope, Crypto’s Most Frictionless &amp; Secure Travel Rule&nbsp;Solution</a></blockquote><p>Veriscope aims to “solve” global regulatory compliance for VASPs, including the Travel Rule. We believe that Veriscope will accelerate the global adoption of cryptocurrency throughout regulated markets and promote new products and services to enter the space. Below, we have included some simple explanations regarding Veriscope and how it works. For more information on Veriscope, head to our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.veriscope.network/">website</a>.</p><p>What is the difference between Shyft Network and Veriscope?</p><p>Veriscope is, for all intents and purposes, a product; Shyft Network is the blockchain on which the product is deployed.</p><p>Why is Versicope special to Shyft Network? Why could it not have been built on Ethereum or another blockchain?</p><p>Here are some reasons why Veriscope works best on the Shyft&nbsp;Network:</p><p>1. The consensus mechanism (<a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/read-it-now-the-shyft-node-federation-constitution-is-public-c6b8957492d7">Shyft Network Node Federation</a>) guarantees throughput (the rate of successful messages over a communication channel, i.e., a blockchain), and stability, two essential elements when offering enterprise-level services.</p><p>2. While Shyft Network is Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based, it has smart contract enhancements that make it an easier solution to integrate.</p><p>What does a compliance framework mean?</p><p>A compliance framework is nothing more than a set of base-layer functions; these enable more case-specific products to be developed, all within the original capabilities and rules. In Veriscope’s case, the framework enables the identification of addresses between two or more participants. This is what we call discoverability, and its main use is the creation of compliant data channels.</p><p>To put it in simpler terms, a framework is a collection of general rules and abilities (functions) that can be modified or applied to more specific use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>How does Veriscope allow VASPs to communicate but also protect user data &amp;&nbsp;privacy?</p><p>The framework helps VASPs identify each other, and set up a secure side-channel so they can exchange the required information; this information is never actually stored on Veriscope itself. It is entirely peer-to-peer. Veriscope also protects against data mining due to a customer’s consent mechanism, meaning only customers can permit access to their&nbsp;data.</p><blockquote>Read: <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/together-we-can-see-the-light-inside-veriscopes-solution-to-the-crypto-sunrise-issue-856b70c30ff1">Together We Can See the Light: Inside Veriscope’s Solution to the Crypto Sunrise&nbsp;Issue</a></blockquote><p>Why should I care about the travel rule and its solutions?</p><p>As a crypto user, you’ve probably heard that regulation is coming. Some jurisdictions have been tremendously open to Bitcoin, like El Salvador, while entire regions have signed off on severely damaging regulation, like the EU, where even non-custodial wallets are becoming subject to regulation. Because crypto is getting regulated across the globe, it inevitably is coming to everyone (even you) at some point — and that’s not a bad thing! Regulations like the Travel Rule are meant to protect customers and crypto overall from money laundering and other malicious activities.</p><p>Additionally, as an end-user of centralized exchanges, you are often already requested to provide personal identifiable information, i.e., your ID and proof of address. Solutions like Veriscope help exchanges protect your data when complying to the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>When people use crypto to do wrong, it takes away from the industry’s progress. Compliant transactions help crypto move forward safely and securely. Ultimately, this allows regulators, governments, customers, and exchanges to work together more efficiently, with less friction and confusion.</p><p>Remember, the key is global adoption.</p><p>What is a specialized smart contract&nbsp;suite?</p><p>Smart contracts are digital contracts (aka programmable computer code) stored on a blockchain that automatically execute when predetermined terms and conditions are met. Veriscope’s smart contract suite helps establish the predetermined terms and conditions between exchanges, so that they can be confident they are communicating with trusted&nbsp;parties.</p><p>What is an attestation?</p><p>An attestation is a message on the Shyft Network blockchain that proves that data is legitimate and has been vetted by a trusted third party (for example, an exchange). You can think of it as a stamp of approval that ensures that necessary data is verified and accurate.</p><p>What is a VASP Discovery layer?</p><p>This automated system allows exchanges to seamlessly detect other VASPS based on their crypto wallet addresses.</p><p>What is Vaspscan?</p><p>VASPscan obtains transaction data that helps exchanges announce to the network that they are about to initiate a cryptocurrency transaction controlled by an exchange whose info they are not aware of at that given point in time. If hidden treasures lie beneath the sand on a beach, VASPScan is like a metal detector.</p><p>Why is DLA Piper significant to Veriscope? What is their&nbsp;role?</p><p>We want customers to be confident that their data is verified globally, and not just within the crypto ecosystem. Veriscope’s partnership with global law firm DLA Piper, which, upon request from the exchange, will receive transaction data from exchanges, and then review and confirm it, is a first for compliance and crypto. This partnership sets to bridge the gap between crypto and the traditional world so that the highest level of trust is capable for all involved&nbsp;parties.</p><p>Well, there you have it!

   Verifiable Presentations (VPs) are an under-defined part of the Verifiable Credential (VC) ecosystem. This is a problem because presentations are a critical part of making a viable, working, useful credential ecosystem.

<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#presentations">Verifiable Presentations</a> (VPs) are an under-defined part of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credential</a> (VC) ecosystem. This is a problem because presentations are a critical part of making a viable, working, useful credential ecosystem. Imagine graduating from a university and not being able to receive your degree in the mail. Or being asked for a copy of your driver’s license and not being able to provide it. A credential is valuable because it can be sent (i.e., “presented”) from one party to another. Leaving verifiable presentations under-defined is a huge risk for the continued success of&nbsp;VCs.</p> The Problem With Presentations <p>Despite being mentioned 118 times in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#">W3C VC spec</a>, VPs are generally under-explained in the specification. In particular, we have little information about differences between VPs. For example, take a look at this <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#ecosystem-overview">diagram in the specification</a>:</p><p>VPs seem somewhat ambiguous in this picture. For example, the holder “Acquires, stores, [and] presents” VCs, but how do they acquire the VCs in the first place? According to this diagram, it looks like they are “issued credentials,” but is issuance the same thing as a VP? The arrow for “Issue Credentials” is exactly the same as “Send Presentation,” leading us to believe these activities are similar, but how are they similar? We can’t adequately answer these questions by looking at the above picture and the specification doesn’t provide a ton of help&nbsp;either.</p><p>We can come up with more complicated arrangements of issuers, holders, and verifiers too, which complicates our mental model of VPs. For example, is there a holder that only presents to other holders? Are there verifiers that present to other verifiers? These questions are probably outside the scope of the W3C specification but are nonetheless important for understanding (and building) VC ecosystems.</p> Presentation Personas <p>The goal of this piece is to fill these gaps in our comprehension of VPs. To that end, I’ve constructed three VP personas that zoom in on different motivations for creating presentations: Certifiers, Consolidators, and Submitters.</p><p>Certifiers: As a certifier, I’m an issuer and want to be able to issue a VC about a holder and send it to them or another&nbsp;party.</p>  Certifiers care about enabling VC features like expiration dates and revocation.  Certifiers are often “roots of trust.” The value of a VC is derived from the credibility of the certifier.  Includes any organization that is making claims about entities.  E.g., <a href="https://www.gs1.org/">GS-1</a>, <a href="https://www.ams.usda.gov/resources/organic-certifying-agents">organic certifiers</a>  <p>Consolidators: As a consolidator, I’m a holder and want to be able to receive/send VCs about another&nbsp;holder.</p>  Consolidators care about where VPs are coming from and where they’re going&nbsp;to.  Consolidators care about the status of the VCs they’re receiving and sending (e.g., revocation status &amp; expiration date).  Includes any organization that is collecting claims about entities.  E.g., Subsidiaries/sub-organizations, brokers  <p>Submitters: As a submitter, I’m a holder and want to be able to present VCs about myself or another holder to a verifier.</p>  Submitters are similar to consolidators in that they’re both holders, but submitters are specifically responsible for VPs to verifiers.  The VC subject(s) can be about the submitter, but not necessarily so.  Submitters care about the status of the VCs they’re submitting (e.g., revocation status &amp; expiration date)  Includes any organization that is asserting claims about entities.  E.g., Certified organic farms, university graduates, brokers   Caveats <p>There are a few caveats about these personas worth mentioning. First, this breakdown is not exhaustive. As the VC and VP ecosystem grows and changes I fully expect to find new interactions and scenarios that demand individual attention. In fact, there is an edge case that I’ve purposefully left out: self-certifiers. This persona both issues a VC about themselves and sends it directly to a verifier, but the credibility of self-certified claims is suspect, so my working hypothesis is that this persona will not be super critical for many use-cases.</p><p>Second, while I am differentiating between VP personas, I am not arguing that the underlying technology differs (or should differ) between each type of VP. A kitchen knife can be used to chop an onion or open a box. The kitchen knife is still a kitchen knife. While there may be room to argue that we should use different kinds of knives for cutting onions and opening boxes, that line of reasoning is outside the scope of this piece. I’m working under the assumption that there is one kind of VP, as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#presentations-0">defined in the W3C spec</a>, that is being used for different purposes.</p><p>Third, these personas are not mutually exclusive. For example, a single party can be a certifier and a consolidator, or a consolidator and a submitter, but my working hypothesis is that these roles are often played one at a&nbsp;time.</p> Key Takeaways <p>Now that I’ve talked about Certifiers, Consolidators, and Submitters, you’re probably wondering how this breakdown helps&nbsp;us.</p><p>From a product development perspective these personas represent different types of users with different needs and pain-points. For example, a Submitter might need different tools to do their job than a Consolidator or a Certifier. Building a one-size-fits-all VC platform risks accommodating everyone and no one. While the technology underpinning these activities might be the same, their purpose is not. That’s a critical distinction that should inform how we build amazing and easy-to-use VC products.</p><p>Alternatively, this persona breakdown makes us reflect on how we use the language of “Verifiable Presentations.” A VP made by a Submitter is done for different reasons than a VP made by a Certifier, just as chopping an onion has a different aim than opening a box, even though I’ve used a kitchen knife to do both. In other words, the term “presentation” risks falling into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivocation">fallacy of equivocation</a>. “Presentation” is said in a different sense depending on which persona we’re talking about. We should strive to eliminate this equivocation when we can. The personas I’ve outlined above should help us achieve that&nbsp;goal.</p><p>VPs are a complex and important yet under-developed part of our VC ecosystem. We should strive to continuously improve the specificity of our mental models of VPs as VCs evolve and grow as a standard. It’s imperative that we do so if we want VC technology to flourish.</p><p>Written by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-s-lerner/">Adam Lerner</a>, Technical Product Manager Transmute</p>

<p>Spring has sprung and brings a lot of new features to your Cozy. For those of you joining us here, <a href="https://cozy.io/en/">Cozy</a> is the French open source personal data platform that lets you control your data in one place.</p>
<p>Spoiler: a hint about the next big feature of Cozy has been added into this article.</p>
 What's new? 
 Cozy Drive 
 Sync application for your files 
<p></p>
<p>This is it: it's here. The most anticipated feature is now available in all Cozy. Did you guess it?<br>
It makes many of our users happy and so are we.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I really appreciate the team's efforts in developing selective sync, and I congratulate them on a job well done. The ability to sync differently on different computers is exceptional.<br>
And most of all, I am very touched by your efficiency in keeping track of and contacting a conversation that was over a year old. The fact that you were kind enough to come back to me after so long is exceptionally commendable, and I thank you for it.<br>
Thanks again, and congratulations for your work and the service you provide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Erwan, our Full Stack engineer behind the selective synchronization developments, <a href="https://blog.cozy.io/fr/dans-les-coulisses-de-lequipe-desktop/">tells you a bit more</a>(in French).</p>
<p>Of course, Claude has written some support in <a href="https://help.cozy.io/article/533-how-to-use-the-selective-sync">our FAQ</a>.</p>
 Mobile application 
<p>If you are a share link user in your Cozy, we have just deployed a <a href="https://help.cozy.io/article/526-breadcrumb-for-your-sharings">new breadcrumb trail</a>, which is more convenient and will now be displayed all the time to make it easier to navigate through any share you have created.</p>
<p>This does not change the rights associated with the link, which remains associated with the directory from which you created it and all its subdirectories.</p>
 🔑 Cozy Pass 
<p>What do the verbs Unlock and Disconnect have in common?</p>
<p>No, not the letter D...</p>
<p>They have found their right place in your favorite password manager extension.</p>
<p>Can you click the right button to open Pass?</p>
<p>If you are not yet using our password manager, Pass, go to <a href="https://cozy.io/en/features/#pass">our page</a> to learn more.</p>

 🗒 Cozy Notes 
<p>Notes is still evolving:</p>
 
 
<p>until now, it was only possible to share a note via a public link. From now on, it is also possible to share it between two Cozy.</p>
 
 
<p>you can add an image to a note by dragging it from your file manager;</p>
 
 
<p>in the Notes application, you can see the location of each note;</p>
 
 
<p>still in the Notes application, you can share from the list of notes, as for the files;</p>
 
 
<p>the display of this list on a small screen (phone for example) has been improved;</p>
 
 
<p>when editing a note, the toolbar is now at the bottom of the screen, to lighten the menu at the top of the screen;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Warwick Ashford</a></p><p>Passwords are inherently insecure, and adding multifactor authentication can help compensate, but ultimately, organizations should be aiming to eliminate the password altogether because strong password polices are difficult to enforce, and passwords are easily compromised and are costly in terms of management, password resets, and lost productivity.</p>
<p>Adopting multi-factor authentication (MFA) can immediately enable stronger authentication to reduce cybercrime, but it should be regarded as a short-term improvement over passwords alone, with the ultimate goal being truly passwordless authentication.</p>
<p>It could be argued that with the migration to cloud and increased remote working, it is critical for organizations to adopt passwordless authentication, because traditional MFA systems typically involve the use of a password, and are therefore inherently vulnerable.</p>
<p>Fortunately, going passwordless is becoming easier due to the development of new authentication standards and personal computing devices capable of creating and storing biometric data locally in secure enclaves such as Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs).</p>
<p>MFA does, however, offer multiple layers of authentication. For this reason, IT and security practitioners at organizations that require high levels of identity assurance are looking to move their organizations to passwordless MFA to remove the weaknesses of passwords, but to retain the value of multiple levels of authentication.</p>
<p>The modern enterprise finally has ways of combining passwordless and multifactor authentication by using facial or fingerprint scanning, and then authenticating to other systems and services using the cryptographic keys securely stored on the device without the need to create passwords, maintain huge databases of passwords or password hashes, and without any password having to travel over any network.</p>
<p>This approach is a strong form of authentication because it includes multiple factors of authentication, such as biometrics and possession of the device, and there is nothing that can be stolen to enable attackers to hijack legitimate credentials.</p>
<p>The added advantage is ease of use, which is important in improving the end user experience, whether it is for employees or customers. In other words, passwordless authentication combines security and convenience without compromising either.</p>
<p>For these reasons, organizations should be investigating what they need to do to go passwordless as soon as possible to offer end users alternative, easier to use, and more secure ways to authenticate.&nbsp; It will be a long journey because a lot of services, applications and websites still use passwords, but the sooner everyone makes a start, the sooner everyone will benefit.</p>
<p>KuppingerCole Analysts has a range of content about passwordless authentication, including this this Leadership Brief on <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/wp80165/digital-transformation-for-business-enablement-requires-a-modern-identity-fabric">How to Get Rid of&nbsp;Passwords - Today</a>, this advisory on <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/an70283/mobile-biometrics-for-authentication-and-authorization/">Mobile Biometrics for Authentication and Authorization</a>, and this executive view on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/ev80949/hypr-passwordless-and-phishing-resistant-authentication">HYPR Passwordless and Phishing-resistant Authentication</a>.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Welcome to the Let’s Talk About Digital Identity podcast. I’m Francesca Hobson and I’ll be guest hosting this episode of the podcast all around inclusive identity.</p>
<p>Francesca: When I say I work in Identity, my friends and family usually don’t know what I’m talking about. To explain, I’ll often give the example of signing up to an app and logging in – which really doesn’t begin to cover the myriad of use cases that identity enables (some of which we’ve explored on this podcast), but it’s such a common experience that it’s often the easiest for them to relate to. They’re touching our industry several times a day, many of them without really thinking of Identity as the key to so many processes.</p>
<p>Of course, that’s not the case for everyone. Some people, often the more vulnerable in society, are only too aware of how important identity is to accessing and using services. Security is clearly high priority for service providers when it comes to identity, as is regulatory compliance. But when these aspects aren’t correctly balanced with user experience – or when users with varying abilities, technical proficiency, or access to resources are not fully catered for – there is a very real risk that the intended users will be excluded from, or have trouble, using the service, bringing all kinds of implications from ethical to economic.</p>
<p>Making identity solutions inclusive for everyone wanting (or needing) to use them is a topic that’s coming more and more to the forefront of our industry. From that almost-universal use case of logging into apps; to what happens when people are prevented from accessing essential services; to how barriers to organisation identity is impacting individuals – in this episode, we speak to three guests from the identity industry on what they’re doing to help solve these issues.</p>
<p>One of the clearest areas of digital identity where we see the impact of not doing enough to include vulnerable people is authentication – the point where a user must verify their identity in order to gain access to a service. Many services still require authentication via a password – though many others are now opening up options for authentication via biometrics, identity providers, real-time document proofing, and so on.</p>
<p>To explore this topic further, our regular podcast host –Oscar Santolalla – spoke to Schehrezade Davidson – the CEO of Tricerion, which provides strong authentication with picture-based passwords.</p>
<p>Oscar: How do current authentication methods, especially but not exclusively username/password, are impacting inclusion?</p>
<p>Schehrezade: Inclusion is a very wide term as we know, Oscar, and one of the key issues post-pandemic is an increase of use of digital across the board. That’s obvious to a lot of people. But what isn’t so obvious is this whole concept of digital divide and how that impacts inclusion. So if you are not sophisticated in using online services, and maybe because you’re too young or you’re too old, that is excluding people from accessing services.</p>
<p>In addition, it is true that there’s a whole cohort of people that find the simple alphanumeric passwords very challenging, maybe they have learning difficulties or maybe they don’t but they have something like dyslexia. That’s not a learning difficulty. That’s just difficulty maybe typing in numbers and letters. But if that’s the way the corporate entity forces you to authenticate then there’s an issue. Similarly, I think sometimes biometrics and fingerprints are things that people don’t necessarily want to use as well in terms of, where is my data stored, who gets access to it.</p>
<p>So I think corporate entities need to think wider than just what looks simple might be complex for some people, and that’s why I think it’s important to bring in experts on user interface and actually usage by consumers or people using services online to get an idea of the wider impacts of this race to digital.</p>
<p>There needs to be a wider review by corporates and governments on how people of all abilities manage to access digital services. And it is true that one size doesn’t fit all and corporates need to be quite flexible in the alternative ways that they offer authentication.</p>
<p>And I think we talked about this – where if the onus is on the individual to authenticate themselves, those in the industry need to make it truly inclusive with alternative ways, depending on a customer’s needs.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. And what are these alternatives? What are the available alternatives for those providers who have decided to be more inclusive? And you can tell us what is Tricerion’s role in this.</p>
<p>Schehrezade: Yeah. So our solution at Tricerion is an image-based password where it’s very simple, and we like to say you can use it whether you are from age 2 to age 100 because it’s based on images. And your brain is wired to remember a series of images or pictures much better than a long string of letters and numbers. So you have the keypad you recognise that’s delivered to you at each authentication occurrence. The images jumble around on the keypad but your password stays the same. So simple, easy, visual.</p>
<p>And of course, we will acknowledge that not everybody can use a visual password but I think this is where it comes back to the first point is giving individuals choices on how they authenticate and allowing them to choose something that works for them. And that’s a different way of thinking for corporates actually because they do want to force all of their customers to use the same methodology because it’s cheaper for them and easier.</p>
<p>But I think it is really beholden on all of us who work in the industry to push hard for alternative authentication methods because then digital truly becomes an inclusive secure environment where people aren’t nervous about going online. And that has got to be a good thing all around, right?</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>Francesca: Thank you to Schehrezade for filling us in on the impact of exclusion in the online service authentication process.</p>
<p>So what about national-level IDs, such as physical documents, which are now often used for both virtual and in-person identity verification? What happens when people are prevented from accessing essential services, such as Banking, because of a lack of perceived sufficient identity documentation?</p>
<p>One organisation carrying out important research in this area is Women in Identity – a not-for-profit organisation making practical steps towards an identity industry that is “built for all, by all”. To fill us in on its latest research on this topic, Oscar spoke to Sarah Walton, who’s managing Women in Identity’s innovative Code of Conduct programme.</p>
<p>Oscar: Hi, Sarah. Could you tell us what is the impact of identity exclusion?</p>
<p>Sarah: Yes, certainly. There’s a number of really quite detrimental impacts both to end-users to organisations who are involved in the identity ecosystem, so that would include reliant parties and also it would include identity providers.</p>
<p>But in terms of the impact to end-users, it can mean sometimes that they can’t find work, they can’t find somewhere to live because they can’t prove their identity and so they can’t support their request in their application for a bank account for example, which would then enable them to find somewhere to rent. So end-users end up sometimes having to compromise their integrity and to lie in order to find ways around quite a rigid system, and the system doesn’t have to be that rigid.</p>
<p>So we interviewed a number of end-users in our <a href="https://www.womeninidentity.org/cpages/code-of-conduct">Human Impact of ID Exclusion Report</a>. And we found that there were similarities both in more developed economies and emerging markets. We took Ghana and the UK as representative of one of each of those types of economy. And we found that there were definitely similarities to the quite horrendous experiences that end-users have and how it limits their engagement in society. But also, very importantly, this is something that makes people outsiders within society that they don’t belong, and so there’s an emotional aspect and impact to that for real people in their lives too.</p>
<p>And very quickly I’ll just add that that’s the human impact, the emotional impact, the impact on individual people’s lives and livelihood, and children suffer because if parents can’t make money then children sometimes can’t get fed. So it’s really very serious.</p>
<p>But from a global perspective, from a national perspective, from economic and commercial perspective, the McKinsey report has recently suggested that between 3 and 13% of gross domestic product, so the income to a country could be increased by 3-13%, probably 3% for more developed economies and 13% more towards that end of the spectrum for emerging economies. So in terms of income into a country, which is beneficial for everyone involved in every type of organisation and individuals, if we included a more inclusive in our identity service creation then we would all be richer essentially.</p>
<p>So this is very much something that is very commercially important but it’s also extremely important to people’s lives and livelihoods on an individual basis.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely. I see that everybody benefits with more inclusion.</p>
<p>Sarah: Absolutely, yes.</p>
<p>Oscar: So I think one of the products of the project that you just mentioned is the Women in Identity’s Code of Conduct. So could you tell us more about this and how it aims to support identity inclusion?</p>
<p>Sarah: Absolutely. There are a number of phases to this piece of work. It’s an international code of conduct for the identity industry and I would stress that it’s international and we have very much a fragmented approach at the moment in different regions but also, within those regions, irrelevant of whether it’s a government–owned or a government-assured or private identity system.</p>
<p>So the ID Code of Conduct work is aiming to create a set of guiding principles that will ensure that all users of identity systems have a consistent and high quality end-user experience because what we found in our first phase, which is the human impact of ID exclusion that I just mentioned, is that users – irrelevant of what type of economy they come from – have a lack of knowledge of how the process works. So if we could at least make this consistent then people will have a certain set of expectations and then they can learn one approach and then know that approach will apply wherever, whatever products or services they are accessing. And also, that there are alternative ways for those people to access those services. And the work that we’ve done so far, it has emerged that there are 5 key principles that will be foundational to the creation of an ID Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>So the first one, it’s pretty obvious to any product design, designer, and design team, but very important that the user is at the centre of the ID ecosystem, and there are many ID ecosystems. So, we always need to come back to this user-centric approach.</p>
<p>Secondly, that social norms are changing. So we need to acknowledge that one size doesn’t fit all and we need to move towards proportionality so vouching, tiered KYC, e-KYC and drawing on other forms of government data – so other datasets may help reduce the burden of identity for the user. And it’s essential to build diversity into ID for the reasons that I mentioned earlier because it has a commercial and a human impact benefit.</p>
<p>And also, the identification may be individual but that we live in networks of people that already know us, so we need to account better for delegated authorities and intermediaries so we can leverage those networks effectively. So what we will be aiming to do is take these key principles and then develop probably about 5-10 principles that will be useful for ID creation teams, ID development teams.</p>
<p>We also have another piece of work called the Implementation Framework and that will be a way of helping, the kind of how-to guide to look at how these Code of Conduct principles can be applied in practice in a practical setting via an ID team. And we will create a fictional ID product or service to show at each phase of the design and development process, in an agile process of development, how these principles would be applied coherently and in a practical way within the ID development team.</p>
<p>And our sponsors who I’ll just mention and with a big thank you, GBG Group, Mastercard, RBC, and Omidyar Network are sponsors for the human impact work, some of whom will be coming with us on the journey and new sponsors are joining all the time. We will also be using some of our sponsors’ products and services to demonstrate how they provide in practice this ID Code of Conduct set of principles in order to create an easy to use, accessible ID service as an end product for the user.</p>
<p>And I would just also like to say Oscar if I can that we are looking for new sponsors as well. More sponsors are coming on board all the time, but please do contact us because we are in the process of raising the funds for those last two elements that I mentioned, the ID Code of Conduct principles and the implementation framework and we’d very much like some new sponsors to come and join us – not just in terms of funding but also with their knowledge from their ID teams because the more widely we go with this, the more diversity we have in our development process for the ID Code of Conduct, the more relevant it’s going to be and useful it’s going to be for organisations and standards bodies and government entities around the world. All of whom are extremely interested and see this as a very useful potentially alternative solution if we can get adoption to the creation of legislation, because legislation is expensive and some organisations have been very keen to look at this piece of work in more of a standards-type frame, as a potential alternative in some countries to legislation potentially.</p>
<p>So it’s being taken very seriously by lots of different types of organisations but we are looking for more sponsorship – please do get in contact.</p>
<p>Oscar: Absolutely. Thank you very much, Dr. Sarah Walton for sharing your insights.</p>
<p>Sarah: You’re very welcome. It’s great to be with you. Thank you.</p>
<p>Francesca: Great insights there from Sarah on the impact of identity exclusion, and how service providers can mitigate against these critical issues.</p>
<p>The issue of individuals being excluded from identity systems is key to the future of many industries, such as financial services. But what about organisations? Organisation identity is a lesser-focused on aspect of identity inclusion, yet how organisations identify other organisations (for example, in transactions between financial institutions and maintaining trade relations) is also a critical factor in whether access, or a specific process, is authorised – thereby impacting the individuals that rely on a successful B2B identity verification.</p>
<p>To investigate this area, I spoke to Amit Sharma, Founder and CEO of FinClusive – a hybrid FinTech and RegTech company dedicated to financial inclusion.</p>
<p>Thanks Amit for joining us, for the second time, on the Let’s Talk About Digital Identity podcast. So let’s dive right in. How can inadequate organisation identity systems exclude organisations—and individuals— unintentionally?</p>
<p>Amit: So in the financial services domain, there are obligations by financial services providers to do the requisite Know Your Customer or Know Your Business due diligence. And so when an organisation has run through that due diligence, by rule, one has to not only test the validity and verify the authenticity of the organisation but they also have to cover what’s called beneficial ownership coverage. So individuals that may have an equity or ownership stake or other, what we call ‘control persons’ that control, say fiduciary or economic activities of that organisation.</p>
<p>And if there are not adequate identity systems to verify and validate either the organisation or their beneficial owners, they get rejected by financial services organisations. And this can happen in a number of ways. Corporate enterprises, they may be large and very easy from a legitimacy perspective but because of how large they can be and their ownership structures, the complexity of their org structures can vary globally, it’s hard to actually do the beneficial ownership and controlled person verification because those org structures are pretty complex.</p>
<p>But also small businesses, small businesses are very challenged because often there’s very little information on the backgrounds of those small businesses that are often start-ups, etc. They are not available in mainstream databases and corporate registries. And so, ensuring that the organisation’s identity can be verified and validated can be very difficult if they’re a small start-up with a registration in a local town but don’t have a state, province, municipality, or federal registration.</p>
<p>And then non-profits are a great example too, critical for global humanitarian and development needs. But many are seen by financial services operators as operating without adequate documentation. And these all come back to organisational identity systems failing many of these organisations‘ ability to access basic financial services.</p>
<p>So, it’s quite a complex challenge. It’s very solvable but these are some of the issues that we see.</p>
<p>Francesca: This is really a lesser talked about aspect of identity and how it impacts inclusion. And as an industry, we do need to be more proactive on solving the kinds of things that you’ve spoken about. So, how can we do that? How is FinClusive supporting organisation identity in order to enable better financial inclusion?</p>
<p>Amit: Well, we have the tools now to be able to assign digital credentials or verifiable credentials for individuals and entities – and entities of all types, from small businesses and micro businesses to non-profits to global corporate, and any other kind of legal entity out there. And so what we do at FinClusive in partnership with organisations like the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation is to be able to run the associated compliance checks, the background due diligence of the validity of the organisation itself and the beneficial owners associated with it.</p>
<p>And with those full compliance checks, we are able to issue a credential that other business entities, other financial services organisations can be sure that the organisation is not only a legitimate registered organisation with a legitimate set of activities but also the individuals associated with that organisation have been equally checked. And by providing that, you create a veil of legitimacy associated with that organisation’s set of activities. So its business counterparts, its financial services providers can all understand and verify and validate in an efficient and cheap way the validity of that organisation. And that’s hugely important.</p>
<p>Now, from a macroeconomic perspective, it’s important to note that identity challenges are often seen as just at the individual level, but these at the institutional or entity level are equally important. And they are important I’ll say by many standards, but one really stands out, that the global job creation space is small businesses. So we have to be able to ensure the validity of small businesses worldwide so that they can access capital to start and grow their businesses so they can interact with other organisations financially and economically. So this is a huge challenge. And when 90 plus percent of job creation and business growth is small businesses, this makes this very important.</p>
<p>Francesca: Thanks to Amit for that summary of the many issues and implications around organisation identity and financial inclusion.</p>
<p>So there we have it – three perspectives on the state of identity inclusion as it is today, and how they’re personally taking strides towards making identity solutions more inclusive. Thank you so much to Schehrezade Davidson, Sarah Walton and Amit Sharma, for sharing your expertise with us. To find out more about this episode’s guests, and links to their work – take a look at the show notes.</p>
<p>This topic isn’t going away any time soon. These challenges and solutions that are facing the identity industry aren’t simple. The more we raise awareness of these issues, the more initiatives and innovation we work towards, and share as a community, the faster we can build more inclusive identity systems – that work for everyone. We hope to provide one of those awareness platforms on the Let’s Talk About Digital Identity podcast – so make sure you subscribe. Until next time.</p>

  <p>.NET 6 is here and many of us are making preparations to update .NET 5 codebases to .NET 6. As part of this review, today you will learn how to implement the client credentials flow in ASP.NET Core Web API.</p>

 What is the client credentials flow 

<p>The <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/clientcreds/main/">client credentials flow</a> is a server-to-server flow that allows applications to request resources on behalf of itself rather than a user. The client credentials flow requires the client id and the client secret, and exchanges those for an access token.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In this tutorial, you will use Okta to implement the client credentials flow in your .NET 6 API. To do this, you will set up your application in Okta’s admin portal. You will then learn how to retrieve the token from your authorization server. I will use an Advanced Rest Client to obtain the token, but you can use Postman or even write your own client. You will then write a JWT verifier in your .NET 6 application to protect your resource server. Finally, you will call your API using the JWT you obtained from your authorization server to access the resource requested.</p>

<p>If you wish you can follow along using the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-dotnet6-webapi-example">repository on Github</a>.</p>

 Prerequisites 

 
   <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio 2022</a> 
   <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0">.NET 6</a> 
   A free <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup">Okta Developer Account</a> (to handle your OAuth needs) 
   <a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a>, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-rest-client/hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo?hl=en-US">Advanced Rest Client</a>, or any other API Testing tool 
 

 Set up your Okta authorization server 

<p>The first thing you’ll need to do is set up your authorization server. Typically in a production environment, you would want to create a new authorization server, but the default server that comes with your Okta developer account should be sufficient for this demo. Navigate to the API section on the Security menu in your Okta admin portal.</p>

<p>Note the Audience and Issuer URI of the <code>default</code> authorization server. You will need these in your application. Next, click on default and navigate to the Scopes tab. Add a new custom scope by clicking on Add Scope and give it the name <code>api</code>. Your <code>Display phrase</code> and <code>Description</code> can be anything you like.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, navigate to the Applications page under the Applications menu. Click Create App Integration and then select API Services. Give your application a meaningful name; I named mine ``. Make a note of your <code>Client ID</code> and your <code>Client secret</code>. You will need these to obtain the access code from your authorization server.</p>

 Create your web API 

<p>Next, you can begin work on your resource API. Open Visual Studio 2022 and select Create a new project. Find the option for <code>ASP.NET Core Web API</code> and press Next.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Name your application <code>Okta_ClientFlowDotNetSix</code> and click Next. Finally, under Additional Information select <code>.NET 6.0 (Long-term support)</code> as your framework. Click on Create and give VS a moment to scaffold your application.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once Visual Studio has completed this process you will be presented with some boilerplate code, along with a brief sample for <code>WeatherForecast</code>. This <code>WeatherForecastController</code> serves as a demonstration for setting up your .NET 6 Web API. You are going to borrow this demo application and expand on it to properly implement the client credentials flow.</p>

 Install your dependencies 

<p>You’ll need three dependencies to make your JWT verification code work properly.</p>

   <code>Install-Package Microsoft.IdentityModel.Protocols -Version 6.16.0
Install-Package Microsoft.IdentityModel.Protocols.OpenIdConnect -Version 6.16.0
</code>   

<p>At this time, Okta does not provide a JWT Verification library for .NET, but .NET itself does via the <code>JwtSecurityTokenHandler</code> object. To access the libraries required to make the <code>JwtSecurityTokenHandler</code> work, you will need the packages from Microsoft listed above.</p>

 Set up your appsettings.json files 

<p>Next, you’ll want to set up your configuration files. If you’ve pulled this code from GitHub you should have a file called <code>appsettings.json</code> with the code below in it.</p>

 <code>{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "Okta": {
    "Issuer": ""
  }
}
</code> 

<p>This serves as a template for the <code>appsettings.Development.json</code> you will add shortly. If you started coding this program from scratch then <code>appsettings.Development.json</code> should already exist and you can replace the code with the following.</p>

 <code>{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "Okta": {
    "Issuer": "{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default"
  }
}
</code> 

<p>The <code>default</code> endpoint in this URI refers to the authorization server. Assuming you used the <code>default</code> authorization server this should work. However, if you are using a custom authorization server you will want to obtain the <code>Issuer</code> from your Okta admin portal.</p>

 Add your API code 

<p>Start by adding a new folder to your solution called <code>Okta</code> and add the file <code>IJwtValidator.cs</code> to it. Replace the boilerplate code with the code below.</p>

   <code>using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt;

namespace Okta_ClientFlowDotNetSix.Okta
{
    public interface IJwtValidator
    {
        Task&lt;JwtSecurityToken&gt; ValidateToken(string token, CancellationToken ct = default(CancellationToken));
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Next, add the implementation for this interface in the same folder, but name it <code>OktaJwtvalidation.cs</code>. The code in this file is below.</p>

   <code>using System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Options;
using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Protocols;
using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Protocols.OpenIdConnect;
using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens;

namespace Okta_ClientFlowDotNetSix.Okta
{
    public class OktaJwtValidation : IJwtValidator
    {
        private readonly string _issuer;
        private readonly ConfigurationManager&lt;OpenIdConnectConfiguration&gt; _configurationManager;

        public OktaJwtValidation(IOptions&lt;OktaJwtVerificationOptions&gt; options)
        {
            _issuer = options.Value.Issuer;

            _configurationManager = new ConfigurationManager&lt;OpenIdConnectConfiguration&gt;(
                _issuer + "/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server",
                new OpenIdConnectConfigurationRetriever(),
                new HttpDocumentRetriever());
        }

        public async Task&lt;JwtSecurityToken&gt; ValidateToken(string token, CancellationToken ct = default(CancellationToken))
        {
            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(token))
            {
                throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(token));
            }

            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(_issuer))
            {
                throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(_issuer));
            }

            var discoveryDocument = await _configurationManager.GetConfigurationAsync(ct);
            var signingKeys = discoveryDocument.SigningKeys;

            var validationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
            {
                RequireExpirationTime = true,
                RequireSignedTokens = true,
                ValidateIssuer = true,
                ValidIssuer = _issuer,
                ValidateIssuerSigningKey = true,
                IssuerSigningKeys = signingKeys,
                ValidateLifetime = true,
                ClockSkew = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(2),
                ValidateAudience = false,
            };

            try
            {
                var principal = new JwtSecurityTokenHandler()
                    .ValidateToken(token, validationParameters, out var rawValidatedToken);

                return (JwtSecurityToken)rawValidatedToken;
            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {
                // Logging, etc.

                return null;
            }
        }

    }
}
</code>   

<p>This implementation uses the <code>ConfigurationManager</code> to obtain the rotating signing keys from your Okta authorization server. With those keys, it can use the <code>JwtSecurityTokenHandler</code> provided by .NET to validate the token. If the token is invalid, the method will throw an exception and return <code>null</code> to the calling code.</p>

<p>The last piece you’ll need for the validation is the <code>OktaJwtVerificationOptions</code> you passed into this class using the <code>IOptions</code> pattern. Add a file for <code>OktaJwtVerificationOptions.cs</code> in the <code>Okta</code> folder and replace the code in there with the code below.</p>

   <code>namespace Okta_ClientFlowDotNetSix.Okta
{
    public class OktaJwtVerificationOptions
    {
        public string Issuer { get; set; }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Later, you will bind this class to your configuration to pass the <code>Issuer</code> from your <code>appsettings.Development.json</code> file to your <code>OktaJwtValidation</code> class.</p>

<p>Next, replace the code in <code>Controllers.WeatherForecaseController.cs</code> with the following.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

namespace Okta_ClientFlowDotNetSix.Controllers
{
    [ApiController]
    [Route("[controller]")]
    public class WeatherForecastController : ControllerBase
    {
        private static readonly string[] Summaries = new[]
        {
        "Freezing", "Bracing", "Chilly", "Cool", "Mild", "Warm", "Balmy", "Hot", "Sweltering", "Scorching"
        };

        private readonly ILogger&lt;WeatherForecastController&gt; _logger;
        private readonly Okta.IJwtValidator _validationService;

        public WeatherForecastController(ILogger&lt;WeatherForecastController&gt; logger, Okta.IJwtValidator validationService)
        {
            _logger = logger;
            _validationService = validationService;
        }

        [HttpGet(Name = "GetWeatherForecast")]
        public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Get()
        {
            var authToken = this.HttpContext.Request.Headers["Authorization"].ToString();

            if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(authToken))
            {
                return Unauthorized();
            }

            var validatedToken = await _validationService.ValidateToken(authToken.Split(" ")[1]);

            if(validatedToken == null)
            {
                return Unauthorized();
            }

            return new JsonResult(Enumerable.Range(1, 5).Select(index =&gt; new WeatherForecast
            {
                Date = DateTime.Now.AddDays(index),
                TemperatureC = Random.Shared.Next(-20, 55),
                Summary = Summaries[Random.Shared.Next(Summaries.Length)]
            })
            .ToArray());
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>As stated above, you are borrowing the <code>WeatherForecast</code> code that Microsoft provides as a demo. However, you are modifying the <code>Get</code> call to read the token from the authorization header and pass it to the <code>_validationService</code> you just wrote. If the token isn’t present, the controller will return an <code>Unauthorized</code> result. If the token is there, the controller will pass it to the <code>_validationService</code>. If that result is <code>null</code>, which is a product of the token being invalid, then you will return the <code>Unauthorized</code> result. Otherwise, you will return the weather data.</p>

<p>This implementation is a bit crude and not exactly fit for production. But using the <code>OktaJwtValidation</code> code you could wrap this in some middleware or create an attribute that uses the <code>ValidateToken</code> method if you wish to refine it.</p>

<p>Finally, replace the code in <code>Program.cs</code> with the following.</p>

   <code>var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add services to the container.

builder.Services.AddControllers();
// Learn more about configuring Swagger/OpenAPI at https://aka.ms/aspnetcore/swashbuckle
builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();
builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();

builder.Services.Configure&lt;Okta_ClientFlowDotNetSix.Okta.OktaJwtVerificationOptions&gt;(
    builder.Configuration.GetSection("Okta"));

builder.Services.AddTransient&lt;Okta_ClientFlowDotNetSix.Okta.IJwtValidator, Okta_ClientFlowDotNetSix.Okta.OktaJwtValidation&gt;();

var app = builder.Build();

// Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseSwagger();
    app.UseSwaggerUI();
}

app.UseHttpsRedirection();

app.UseAuthorization();

app.MapControllers();

app.Run();
</code>   

<p>In addition to the boilerplate code from Visual Studio, this class also configures your <code>OktaJwtVerificationOptions</code> and the dependency injection for the <code>IJwtValidator</code>.</p>

 Test your .NET 6 API 

<p>Now you are ready to see the flow come together. First, start your Web API in Visual Studio.</p>

<p>Next, open your API test tool of choice (such as <a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a>, or using the built in Swagger test page) and set up your request to the Okta authorization server.</p>

 
   {yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/token POST 
   headers - Accept: <code>application/json</code> Authorization: <code>Basic {yourBase64EncodedCredentials}</code> Content-Type: <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> 
   body - grant_type: <code>client_credentials</code> scope: <code>api</code> 
 

<p>{yourBase64EncodedCredentials} is a base64 encoded string of the format <code>{yourClientId}:{yourClientSecret}</code>. You can also write a small C# application to this or follow along in our <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/clientcreds/main/#flow-specifics">documentation on how to apply Base64 encoding</a>.</p>

<p>You’ll remember that <code>api</code> was the custom scope you added to your authorization server above.</p>

<p>Send your request and you should receive a response that includes the <code>access_token</code>.</p>

<p>Create a new request in your API test tool and use the following setup.</p>

 
   {yourWebAPIDomain}/weatherforecast GET 
   headers - Authorization: <code>Bearer {yourAccessToken}</code> 
 

<p>Send your request and you should be greeted with a weather forecast for the upcoming few days.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You can test the authorization functionality fully by replacing {yourAccessToken} with any random string or an empty string. You should see the web API return a <code>401</code> error.</p>

 Learn more about .NET and the client credentials flow 

<p>In this tutorial, you learned how to build an API with .NET 6 and secure that application using the client credentials flow in Okta. You learned how to implement your custom JWT validation class. Finally, you set up an authorization server on Okta to produce an access_token using the client credentials flow and how to pass that token to your web API.</p>

<p>For innovative financial services apps to work effectively, they need to meet the needs of their customers. One of the core ingredients of next-gen apps is accurate, up-to-the-minute financial data. With this data, apps can transform user financial service experiences, enabling consumers to direct payments and gain insights into savings and spending. Apps can even remove the friction of applying for loans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The challenge is coming up with a secure way to enable access to this all-important data.</p>
<p>According to Mastercard’s <a href="https://www.finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwr-SSBhC9ARIsANhzu16CqvMC2K90KgD1q2SWQsV4WNRFzjLenqs9dx6H-FrfBsoN9XQ86JgaAvPIEALw_wcB">Rise of Open Banking</a> survey, nine out of 10 consumers already use technology to manage their money. Apps like <a href="https://www.experian.com/consumer-products/score-boost.html?pc=sem_exp_google&amp;cc=sem_exp_google_ad_1651407997_65972645920_379826966571_kwd-585063777506_e___k_Cj0KCQjwr-SSBhC9ARIsANhzu166juHm7g9Wduh_6DYFFA54gXuATBvL_4wyOdzb13bF44ury23j4fAaAl3-EALw_wcB_k_&amp;ref=brand&amp;awsearchcpc=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwr-SSBhC9ARIsANhzu166juHm7g9Wduh_6DYFFA54gXuATBvL_4wyOdzb13bF44ury23j4fAaAl3-EALw_wcB">Experian Boost</a>, which helps consumers improve their credit score, or <a href="https://www.quicken.com/ppc/brand?utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=brand_exact_usa&amp;adgroup=quicken&amp;utm_term=quicken&amp;utm_targetid=kwd-23985491&amp;utm_matchtype=e&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwr-SSBhC9ARIsANhzu17swWGLkqRmjeJIDeuYquyYPHrEdAUXj7cEvvWlcRJoovq3xeD0NVsaAmSBEALw_wcB">Quicken</a>, which provides a 360-degree view of finances, save consumers time and add convenience to their lives. Open banking platforms, which allow users to grant third parties access to their banking data, provide the data that makes the functionality of these apps possible.</p>
<p>The backbone of open banking is empowering consumers and small and midsize businesses to securely share data. Legacy technologies have played an important role in this. However, this data sharing experience increasingly is enabled through an API connectivity model that will further increase security and improve data access.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mastercard.us/en-us.html">Mastercard</a> has partnered with <a href="https://www.fiserv.com/en.html">Fiserv</a> to move this open banking model forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fiserv enables thousands of banks to easily and readily deploy digital capabilities and services. <a href="https://www.fiserv.com/en/solutions/customer-and-channel-management/account-aggregation-services/alldata-connect.html">AllData® Connect </a>from Fiserv enables consumers to grant permission through their bank to share their data with the apps they want to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bank then issues a token that can be used to authenticate the sharing of the consumer’s financial information with the apps they use through the Mastercard open banking platform. This permission is transparent to the consumer and can be managed and revoked easily.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With nearly 40% of US banks using Fiserv core technology, the partnership with Mastercard expands consumer access to secure and convenient tokenization capabilities, and is set to fast-forward the growth of new financial experiences through this secure, direct API access.&nbsp;</p>
 Expanding Secure, Tokenized API Access to Upgrade the Open Banking Ecosystem 
<p>The partnership between both companies represents a significant leap forward toward the goal of fully tokenized, direct API access and the retirement of legacy technologies. Mastercard, through its Finicity acquisition, has long taken a leadership role in the adoption of API connectivity and has moved the majority of its traffic to these connections.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The primary goal of this agreement is to remove the need for consumers to have to share their banking usernames and passwords with third parties in order to access their financial information,” says Paul Diegelman, vice president of Digital Payments and Data Aggregation at Fiserv. “The ability of fintech apps to access information via direct APIs also reduces the need for screen scraping, while improving the consumer’s user experience.”</p>
<p>AllData Connect from Fiserv makes it easy for banks to facilitate data sharing on behalf of their customers. Fiserv manages technology integration for the banks, saving them time and the costs related to implementing and maintaining the technology on their own. AllData Connect also provides banks more insight into the apps their customers are using, to simultaneously protect the data and provide services that create loyal bonds between the customer and the bank.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Mastercard has provided credit and debit solutions to the Fiserv ecosystem for years,” says Ryan Christiansen, Mastercard’s senior vice president of data access partnerships. “Now through this agreement, we deepen our relationship by providing trusted data-sharing capabilities that fuel next-gen financial service experiences, such as expanding payment choices, budgeting and lending options to consumers and small businesses through the&nbsp; financial institutions supported by Fiserv.”</p>

 Earlier this month in Ireland, Dogpatch and FCAT hosted Future Horizons, a new TED Talk style event designed to ignite emerging ideas and propel Fidelity into the future. The <a href="http://www.verus.io/">Verus Protocol</a> was selected as 1 of 7 finalists invited to present at the event after Fidelity and Dogpatch conducted a deep analysis of over 200 disruptors from every corner of Europe under the themes ‘Future Money &amp; Assets’, ‘Web3’, ‘Post-Pandemic Impacts’ and ‘Zero Interfaces’. Michael Toutonghi receives the Inspiration Award<p>Michael Toutonghi, the lead developer of the Verus Protocol, presented an overview of the Verus Protocol and how it creates an opportunity for people to collaborate worldwide in ways that haven’t been possible before. He outlined the founding purpose of The Verus Protocol and how it’s designed to enable a truly decentralized, people-powered protocol that can be used by any person, community, organization, or government to power their economy as part of a much larger worldwide network of economies.</p>Michael Toutonghi presents the Verus&nbsp;Protocol<p>The growing <a href="https://discord.com/invite/VRKMP2S">Verus community</a> was excited to have Fidelity and Dogpatch recognize the innovation of these efforts, which have been fully functional on the Verus testnet and are being prepared by contributors across the community for our imminent mainnet&nbsp;upgrade.</p><p>The Verus Protocol, currently testing and preparing its Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) upgrade for mainnet release, emerged as the only community-driven, public infrastructure protocol to appear in the final seven finalists for the Future Horizons event. The Verus PBaaS upgrade will extend the Verus mainnet protocol, which currently features the first and only core primitive of a revocable, recoverable and provable yet private identity and peer to peer marketplace technology adding a decentralized, multi-chain, multi-currency protocol for launching currencies, independent and connected blockchains, and performing fully decentralized, on chain exchanges of currencies, IDs, legal contracts, and&nbsp;more.</p>Michael Toutonghi presents the Verus&nbsp;Protocol History of The Verus&nbsp;Protocol <p>The Verus Protocol went live on its mainnet, which is a public, decentralized blockchain,<a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/announcing-formation-of-the-verus-coin-foundation-with-a-vision-of-public-blockchains-as-a-service-fb5470143fff"> in 2018</a> with a vision of Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) powering scalable, autochains and applications through staking and mining, as outlined in the <a href="http://veruscoin.io/downloads/papers/VerusVision.pdf">Verus Vision paper</a>. The Protocol launched with no ICO, no preallocation of funds, and no development fee, or middlemen built into the protocol. The worldwide community built the Verus Protocol to offer both transparent and zero knowledge privacy, and as an improvement to the Bitcoin consensus algorithm, a more ecologically efficient consensus protocol. Verus was the first and is still the only blockchain protocol with self-sovereign, revocable, recoverable, and interoperable addresses and privacy enhanced identities built into the&nbsp;core.</p><p>Any individual, project, organization or community needing an easy to use, reliable, decentralized, rent-free currency or fundraising platform, voting network, automated accounting system, self-sovereign, revocable/recoverable identity, or governance model can connect to the Verus Internet of Value and get started without programming. Solutions that used to take weeks or longer to design and code with programmers can now be done by domain experts, better, faster and more securely than&nbsp;before.</p><p>With the Verus’s Protocol, challenges of today can be naturally solved by scaling-out as needed, whether requirements call for centralized corporate, open government, or fully decentralized applications. In addition to this new solution, disruptive even among modern blockchains, the open, community-driven model enables Verus to be the first and only credibly neutral, rent-free, decentralized financial network.</p> Consensus 2022 <p>The Verus Protocol will be on <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-showcases-scalable-decentralized-currency-launch-and-anti-mev-defi-technology-for-ethereum-96c165e94c1">display in booth 242 at the upcoming Consensus 2022</a> that takes place in Austin, Texas June 9 — June 12.

  <p>Whether you’re coding, using a search engine, searching and replacing text in a text editor, or using the command-line utilities <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code>, and <code>awk</code> in Linux, you’re using regular expressions (also known as “regex” or “regexp”). Yes, they’re everywhere.</p>

<p>A regular expression is a sequence of characters used to describe a text pattern. Working with regular expressions is rarely described as fun, but they are useful for various problems while coding a feature, such as finding and replacing operations with strings.</p>

<p>When coding a solution using regular expressions, you typically use the built-in libraries provided by the programming language you’re using. Java is no exception. It includes support for regular expressions using classes in the <code>java.util.regex</code> package.</p>

<p>In this article, you’ll learn how to use regular expressions to define a pattern for searching or manipulating strings in Java. You can find <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/java-regex-examples">the code in this article on GitHub</a>.</p>

 The what and why of regular expressions 

<p>So, what are regular expressions? Wikipedia defines a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular expression</a> as “a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern in text.”</p>

<p>For example, if you use the regular expression <code>ab*</code>, you’re issuing an instruction to match a string that has an <code>a</code> followed by zero or more <code>b</code>’s. So strings like <code>ab</code>, <code>abc</code>, <code>abbc</code>, etc. will match our regular expression. The asterisk symbol, <code>*</code>, denotes the number of times a character or a sequence of characters may occur.</p>

<p>Regular expressions make finding patterns in text much easier. Some high-level use cases include:</p>
 
   Email validation 
   Phone number validation 
   Credit card number validation 
   Password pattern matching 
   String replacement 
 

<p>Regular expressions are also well-supported in many programming languages.</p>

 How to use regular expressions in Java 

<p>Supporting classes for regular expressions in Java are available in the <code>java.util.regex</code> package. As per <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html">Java’s documentation</a>, the package primarily consists of the three classes below.</p>

<p><code>Pattern</code>: The object of this class is a compiled representation of a regular expression. There are no public constructors available in this class, so you need to call the <code>compile()</code> static method to create an object.</p>

<p>Here are the different implementation details and method signature of the <code>compile()</code> method available in the <code>Pattern</code> class as per Java’s documentation.</p>

   <code>/**
* Compiles the given regular expression into a pattern.
*
* @param  regex
*         The expression to be compiled
* @return the given regular expression compiled into a pattern
* @throws  PatternSyntaxException
*          If the expression's syntax is invalid
*/
public static Pattern compile(String regex) {
    return new Pattern(regex, 0);
}

/**
* Compiles the given regular expression into a pattern with the given
* flags.
* @param  regex
*         The expression to be compiled
*
* @param  flags
*         Match flags, a bit mask that may include
*         {@link #CASE_INSENSITIVE}, {@link #MULTILINE}, {@link #DOTALL},
*         {@link #UNICODE_CASE}, {@link #CANON_EQ}, {@link #UNIX_LINES},
*         {@link #LITERAL}, {@link #UNICODE_CHARACTER_CLASS}
*         and {@link #COMMENTS}
*
* @return the given regular expression compiled into a pattern with the given flags
*/
public static Pattern compile(String regex, int flags) {
    return new Pattern(regex, flags);
}
</code>   

<p><code>Matcher</code>: This class also has no public constructor, and the object of this class is constructed by invoking the <code>matcher()</code> method on a <code>Pattern</code> class object. The <code>Matcher</code> object will match the given input against a given pattern.</p>

<p><code>PatternSyntaxException</code>: This class throws an unchecked exception to indicate a syntax error in a regular-expression pattern.</p>

<p>The typical code flow of working with a regular expression in Java is shown below.</p>

<p>We first create a <code>Pattern</code> object by invoking its static <code>compile()</code> method, and then we pass it a pattern, i.e., string literal Java, as the first input parameter. The second input parameter, <code>Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE</code>, enables case-insensitive matching.</p>

<p>Next, we create an object of the <code>Matcher</code> class by calling the <code>Pattern</code> object’s <code>matcher()</code> method. We are also passing the text we want to check for matches: if there is a match, the program prints <code>true</code>, and <code>false</code> if there isn’t.</p>

   <code>public class TestRegularExpressions {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("Java", Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE);
        System.out.println(pattern.matcher("java").matches()); // prints true
        System.out.println(pattern.matcher("JAVA").matches()); // prints true
        System.out.println(pattern.matcher("javascript").matches()); // prints false
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Moreover, in Java, <code>String</code> class has methods for string manipulation using regular expressions. Here are some coding examples:</p>

   <code>public class StringRegexOperations {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str1 = "J A V A";
        System.out.println(str1.replaceAll("\\s", "")); // prints "JAVA"
        String str2 = "J,AVA";
        System.out.println(str2.replaceFirst(",", "")); // prints "JAVA"
        String str3 = "C,Java,Kotlin,C++";
        System.out.println(Arrays.stream(str3.split(","))
            .filter(s -&gt; s.equals("Java")).findFirst().get()); // prints "Java"
        String str4 = "jane@okta.com";
        System.out.println(str4.matches("^[a-zA-Z0-9_!#$%&amp;'*+/=?`{|}~^.-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+$")); // prints true
    }
}
</code>   

<p>While the preceding coding example is self-explanatory, here is a summary of methods available in the <code>String</code> class that accepts regex as one of its input parameters:</p>


  
    
      Method Name
      What it does
    
  
  
    
      <code>replaceAll()</code>
      Replaces each substring of this string that matches the given regular expression with the given replacement.
    
    
      <code>replaceFirst()</code>
      Replaces the first substring of this string that matches the given regular expression with the given replacement.
    
    
      <code>split()</code>
      Splits this string around matches of the given regular expression.
    
    
      <code>matches()</code>
      Tells whether or not this string matches the given regular expression.
    
  


 How to use regular expressions to validate email addresses and phone numbers 

<p>A common use case for regular expressions is to validate email addresses and phone numbers, which you’ll learn to do here.</p>

   <code>import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import java.util.regex.Matcher;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertFalse;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertTrue;

class DemoApplicationTests {
    /**
     * We will use the following test method `setUp()` that accepts two inputs, i.e. the regex pattern and the string to be searched in the given pattern.
     * @param inputRegex
     * @param searchString
     */
    boolean setUp(String inputRegex, String searchString) {
        Pattern p = Pattern.compile(inputRegex, Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE);
        Matcher m = p.matcher(searchString);
        return m.matches();
    }

    /**
     * The following test shows how to do email validation using classes available in the `java.util.regex` Java package against the valid input.
     * This test should pass.
     */
    @Test
    void when_email_is_valid() {
        assertTrue(setUp("[a-zA-Z0-9_+&amp;*-]*@" + "okta.com$", "julia@okta.com"));
    }

    /**
     * And this test shows how to do so against the invalid input. This test should result in a failure.
     */
    @Test
    void when_email_is_invalid() {
        assertFalse(setUp("[a-zA-Z0-9_+&amp;*-]*@" + "okta.com$", "julia@okta"));
    }

    /**
     * The following tests show how to do phone validation using classes available in the `java.util.regex` Java package.
     * It uses a basic regular expression to check if the number is a valid ten digit. Advanced use cases could also handle country codes and so forth.
     */
    @Test
    void when_phone_number_is_valid() {
        String regex = "^[0-9]{10}$";
        assertTrue(setUp("^[0-9]{10}$", "1234567890"));
    }

    /**
     * And this test shows how to do so against the invalid input. This test should result in a failure.
     */
    @Test
    void when_phone_number_is_invalid() {
        String regex = "^[0-9]{10}$";
        assertFalse(setUp("^[0-9]{10}$", "123456789"));
    }
}
</code>   

 Alternative resources for building and validating regular expressions 

<p>Several resources are available to help you with using regular expressions. Here are three relevant for Java.</p>

 Regexr 

<p><a href="https://regexr.com/">Regexr</a> is an HTML/JS-based tool for creating, testing, and learning about regular expressions. It’s a good resource for building and validating patterns in the browser. One of the best features of Regexr is its Community Patterns feature, where you can search for patterns submitted by other users.</p>

<p>To use a community pattern, you must first select a pattern, click on its URL, or double-click the list to load the full pattern. You can also use the right arrow icon to load the expression or text. In the screenshot below, we have picked an existing community pattern for password validation. We have run some tests to ensure that it does proper password validation as per the regex.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://copilot.github.com/">GitHub Copilot</a>, an AI tool developed by GitHub, you no longer have to write your own regular expressions.</p>

<p>The following screenshot shows Copilot suggesting a regex for email validation. In the IntelliJ Idea IDE, we can press <code>TAB</code> to accept the suggestion.</p>

 JavaVerbalExpressions 

<p><a href="https://github.com/VerbalExpressions/JavaVerbalExpressions">JavaVerbalExpressions</a> is a library written in Java that helps to construct difficult regular expressions. You can add the following Maven dependency to add support for this library to your project.</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;ru.lanwen.verbalregex&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;java-verbal-expressions&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;1.8&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>JavaVerbalExpressions uses a builder pattern to construct regex. Below is an example showing how to use it to play with regular expressions.</p>

   <code>VerbalExpression testRegex = VerbalExpression.regex()
  .startOfLine().then("abc").or("def")
  .build();

String testString = "defzzz";

// Use VerbalExpression's test() method to test if parts of the string match the regex
testRegex.test(testString);       // true
testRegex.testExact(testString);  // false
testRegex.getText(testString);    // returns: def
</code>

 Following the launch of Veriscope on the Shyft Network blockchain and integration from the world’s leading crypto exchanges, we break down how Veriscope’s solution to the “Sunrise Issue” solves one of the biggest regulatory challenges facing the industry and regulators alike. <p>Imagine for a moment: you head outside, stare up into the sky, and see a beautiful mix of red, orange, and blue above as the sunrise slowly takes&nbsp;form.</p><p>You ask yourself: is anyone else seeing&nbsp;this?</p><p>The answer? Well, it’s complicated. While the sun rises for everyone on Earth, it doesn’t happen for us all at the same time. Time zones exist to acknowledge this fact of life, establishing set (albeit changing) times each day when the sun comes up over the horizon in different parts of the&nbsp;world.</p><blockquote>Read: <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/were-live-veriscope-launches-on-mainnet-with-binance-bitfinex-tether-huobi-moonpay-deribit-58cfa6ec65ef">We’re Live: Veriscope Launches on Mainnet with Binance, Bitfinex, Tether, Huobi, Moonpay, Deribit, Gate.io and&nbsp;more</a></blockquote><p>Ok, so now you’re probably wondering: why am I getting an Astronomy 101 lesson in a Shyft Network blog? As with the rising sun, global crypto regulation, specifically anti-money laundering (AML) takes shape and is implemented in different ways and at different times depending on what country, or jurisdiction, you are in. When the real question is not whether regulation is coming or not, but when and how; the tricky part is, how do we prepare ourselves for the inevitable?</p><p>Enter the Sunrise&nbsp;Issue.</p> FATF &amp; The Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>In 2019, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental organization focused on preventing money laundering and other malicious financial activities, set its sights on crypto. The FATF proposed that the Travel Rule, a requirement for regulated firms to collect and share the personal data of participants in financial transactions, should now apply to what they defined as VASPs (Virtual Asset Service Providers). Broadly speaking, a VASP is a cryptocurrency exchange, liquidity provider or custodian; whether centralized or decentralized. According to the FATF’s pseudo-binding Recommendations, VASPs are required to collect personal data on participants in financial exchanges exceeding 1,000 USD/EUR. Some countries have lowered the threshold to&nbsp;zero.</p><p>For the VASPs subject to FATF’s latest Recommendations and the Travel Rule, identifying info such as names and account numbers of transacting parties (senders, recipients) is now required to be “in compliance” as these Recommendations are implemented into local regulations on a country-by-country basis.</p><p>Veriscope, Shyft Network’s Travel Rule solution, was developed to grant VASPs a decentralized solution for complying with global regulations, such as the FATF’s Travel Rule. Veriscope allows VASPs to be Travel Rule-compliant by enabling them to automatically discover which VASP (an exchange, liquidity provider or custodial wallet) is the recipient of crypto assets sent by their customers. Then, Veriscope enables VASPs to transmit the required customer data to each other to ensure that their customers are not involved in money laundering, sanctions evasion, or other illicit activity. Veriscope automates the discovery of VASP details on-chain and the secure and authenticated exchange of customers’ private&nbsp;data.</p><p>Veriscope’s seamless approach protects customers and empowers local and global VASPs to be compliant when processing transactions regardless of when their counterparty VASPs agree to start using a Travel Rule solution (Veriscope) or where they operate across the&nbsp;world.</p><p>So why is the last part so important? Because just like the sunrise takes place at different times around the world, so does the implementation of the FATF’s Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p> Setting up the&nbsp;Sunrise <p>So let’s break it&nbsp;down:</p>  VASP “A” operates in a jurisdiction where Travel Rule compliance is required. VASP A can see the sunrise in their location and wants the ability to talk about it without someone else who lives in a different place, where the sun hasn’t yet gone up (VASP&nbsp;B).  VASP “B” is located somewhere where the Travel Rule isn’t yet a regulatory obligation.  VASP A sends an information request to VASP B. In layman’s terms, this means that VASP A simply wants to talk to VASP B about their experience watching the sunrise. They ask (or post a request) for this information from VASP B, who will respond once the sun has risen wherever they are, enabling them to successfully answer VASP’s A question, regardless of how much time has passed between the question and&nbsp;answer.  However, this isn’t always the case. Does VASP B really need to answer VASP A’s request for information about the sunrise? So if the sender needs information that the recipient is not (yet) obligated to provide, how can the sender be compliant? Alas, the Sunrise&nbsp;Issue.  <p>The Sunrise Issue has become a challenging roadblock to global Travel Rule compliance because, as said above, different countries adopt Travel Rule laws at different times. The result — and issue — is that certain VASPs who comply with FATF Travel Rule today might want to share customer details with their VASP counterparties who have not implemented a Travel Rule solution (even though they might tomorrow).</p> Shyft, Veriscope, and a Sunrise&nbsp;Solution <p>Veriscope, Shyft Network’s Travel Rule solution, was developed to solve this very issue. Due to an innovative technology called “historic look back,” Veriscope allows VASPs to obtain information on any transaction regardless of when the transaction happened, even if it happened before the receiving VASP signed on with Veriscope or another Travel Rule solution. To obtain these details, originator VASPs post information requests that will be responded to when the beneficiary VASP joins the network. As a new VASP joins, they receive these historical requests and can respond with the necessary information. No other Travel Rule solution can do&nbsp;this.</p><p>So let’s return to where we started, looking up at the sky as the sun begins to appear from over the horizon. If regulation requires us to only transact with those who, like us, see the sun rising (i.e. are compliant with the Travel Rule), how do we help those who are still living in darkness (i.e. don’t have the requirement to support Travel Rule)? We don’t leave them behind. Veriscope allows them to transact when the sun rises for them, but based on a time when the sun rose for us, generate the supporting material that shows that they are compliant, and enable a globalized network of VASPs to remain at the vanguard of this technological movement.</p><p>How do we do this? Veriscope achieves historic lookback through immutable on-chain records, providing an open, permanent audit trail of every request for information submitted by VASPs. Additionally, Veriscope’s interoperability permits ultra-secure VASP-to-VASP communication and can enable the broadest VASP network reach by integrating with other Travel Rule protocols. We should say, whilst we use Blockchain technology to drive Veriscope and to power this feature, no customer private information is stored on there; instead, this information is exchanged over a direct peer-to-peer communication between&nbsp;VASPs.</p> Looking Forward <p>We are living (and transacting) in a time where regulation in crypto is experiencing more significant complexities than ever before. As of late March 2022, we even learned that the European Parliament <a href="https://decrypt.co/96539/eu-parliament-votes-impose-kyc-private-crypto-wallets">had voted on implementing new sanctions</a> that would require KYC (know-your-customer) on private, unhosted crypto wallets. So how can we adhere to growing regulation and a need for more identifying information on crypto customers without giving up our identity completely? It’s for this very reason that Veriscope was&nbsp;created.</p><p>We know that compliant solutions like Veriscope and its ability to solve regulatory problems like the Sunrise Issue will benefit everyone. Regulators we work with every day are impressed by our solution’s unique feature and how it can help bridge the gap between compliant and non-compliant VASPs and the jurisdictions they operate in. Ultimately, we all share the dream of mass adoption of cryptocurrency as a better path forward for financial markets and&nbsp;society.</p><blockquote>Read: <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/8-reasons-to-choose-veriscope-cryptos-most-frictionless-secure-travel-rule-solution-d714b8056d08">8 Reasons to Choose Veriscope, Crypto’s Most Frictionless &amp; Secure Travel Rule&nbsp;Solution</a></blockquote><p>Regulation and compliance are no longer requirements we should consider a “bad word” or roadblock to circumnavigate. Through solutions like Veriscope, we can bring everyone from this incredible world together to move forward as one, not merely around obstacles that have long hindered our progress.</p><p>Like the beautiful morning light from the sun, we should all be able to share in the innovative power of crypto transactions safely and securely. Finally, we can all see the sunrise together — and be ready when the light&nbsp;hits.</p><p>Visit our new Veriscope website to learn more and implement our Travel Rule solution. <a href="https://veriscope.network/">https://veriscope.network/</a></p><p>— Shyft&nbsp;Network</p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/">Website</a> / <a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">Telegram</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/">Medium</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/JGac8fqk">Discord</a></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/04/03/now-that-q1-is-over-is-the-bull-market-back/">first quarter of 2022</a> in crypto markets was relatively steady with Bitcoin experiencing modest gains at the quarter’s end. Notably, several <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/15/bitcoin-breakout-elusive-as-traders-price-in-7-fed-rate-hikes-for-2022/">Fed rate hikes</a> were announced, and the Biden administration issued sweeping executive orders for <a href="https://news.bloombergtax.com/daily-tax-report/biden-pushes-for-more-coordinated-approach-to-crypto-oversight">plans to address crypto regulation</a>. The industry also saw a <a href="https://blockworks.co/bored-ape-yacht-club-creator-secures-whopping-450m-seed/">$4B valuation for Yuga Labs</a>.</p>



<p>Key Milestones</p>



<p>Our Q1 of 2022 was about expanding our reach into permissioned market spaces. In January, we <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/liquid-meta-partners-civic-technologies-123000872.html">announced a partnership</a> with a leading DeFi infrastructure company, Liquid Meta Capital Holdings Ltd. The purpose of our partnership is to bring trusted, secure permissioned identity services to DeFi and enable Liquid Meta to provide capital liquidity to permissioned dApps. Ultimately, the goal will be to promote the overall adoption of DeFi.</p>



<p>We also continued to build traction in the DeFi space through an integration with Credix Finance. Credix is building a decentralized marketplace to give borrowers in emerging countries access to previously untapped capital. Furthering the impact of this partnership was <a href="https://twitter.com/ProjectSerum/status/1493617065596489735">Credix’s receipt of a hackathon prize</a> for the Project Serum Convergence Hackathon. Their entry was a fully permissioned protocol transfer of assets, using Civic Pass.</p>



<p>As NFT marketplaces continued to implement and refine permissioning in their marketplaces, we took steps to improve the Civic Pass experience, starting with improving the minting process on Candy Machine. We tightened up our infrastructure, migrated Captcha providers and fixed bugs on the minting code. The result is a Civic Pass Captcha experience that’s <a href="https://twitter.com/civickey/status/1504561369776996370">noticeably faster and smoother</a>.</p>



<p>Together with our partner, Snowcrash, a new NFT marketplace from Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group, we <a href="https://decrypt.co/95959/solana-nft-platform-snowcrash-taps-civic-combat-bots">announced an integration</a> of our identity verification protocol in order to curb bot manipulation on the Snowcrash platform. Civic brought seasoned experience to the integration, having protected more than 200 mints, helped nearly 100,000 buyers successfully mint NFTs, and blocked a staggering 1,000,000+ bots from attempting purchases.</p>



<p>Finally, we expanded our reach by integrating with other blockchains. Casper Labs is a network designed to accelerate enterprise and developer adoption of its proof-of-stake blockchain technology built off the Casper CBC specification. We’ve <a href="https://twitter.com/Casper_Labs">partnered with Casper</a> to give dApps the ability to meet permissioning requirements.<a href="https://twitter.com/metacask"> </a>Our partner, Metacask, is the first dApp to <a href="https://twitter.com/metacask/status/1511642792388349957">showcase the integration</a>.</p>



<p>Civic in the News</p>



<p>In the fourth quarter, Civic accumulated a total online readership of more than 77 million viewers, as a result of press releases and news media coverage. Our partnership announcement with Snowcrash was covered by <a href="https://decrypt.co/95959/solana-nft-platform-snowcrash-taps-civic-combat-bots">Decrypt</a>, <a href="https://www.cryptotimes.io/snowcrash-teams-up-with-civic-to-prevent-bots-for-sony-and-universal/">The Crypto Times</a>, <a href="https://www.aliens.com/livenews/latest/solana-nft-platform-snowcrash-will-integrate-civic-to-curb-robot-operation-issues">Aliens</a> and <a href="https://www.dcforecasts.com/blockchain-news/snowcrash-solana-nft-platform-tapped-civic-to-fight-bots/">DC Forecasts</a>. Our Liquid Meta announcement was picked up by <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/liquid-meta-partners-civic-technologies-123000872.html">Yahoo</a>, Authority, Street Insider and Crypto News BTC. And, Cryptopedia <a href="https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/civic-identity-cvc-crypto-civic-crypto-cvc-token">published an overview</a> of our company.</p>



<p>We also participated in events. Our CEO, Chris Hart, spoke at the Digital Currency Summit. We sponsored and participated in Solana Hacker houses in <a href="https://twitter.com/civickey/status/1498834872177074178?">Prague</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/redacted_j/status/1483129798323015681">Chicago</a> and Seattle. We closed out the quarter by announcing our Snowcrash partnership at NFT LA.</p>



<p>Coming Soon</p>



<p>As the market for NFTs continues to develop, we’ve been building out opportunities for dApps to have permissioned spaces. This work will result in an improved framework for Civic Pass in the market by fostering easier adoption, integration and usage. You can expect to see the initial stages of this revised framework come to life in Q2.</p>



<p>Additionally, we are very excited about the tools we are currently building to enable the ultimate owners of identity, the individual, manage their web3 identities cross wallet, cross-chain and in a self sovereign model.</p>



<p>We are already speeding ahead in Q2 and are looking forward to making announcements in the coming months. Stay tuned!</p>

<p>As you know, personal&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>&nbsp;is simultaneously being supported and attacked —&nbsp;supported&nbsp;by privacy-enhancing regulations and&nbsp;attacked&nbsp;via loopholes and by those simply ignoring privacy laws.</p>



<p>Big Tech companies are capturing, abstracting, aggregating, packaging, analyzing and selling every user interaction. Knowledge about user behavior is the&nbsp;product&nbsp;— and it’s fair to say, we are in the midst of a&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/how-bad-is-the-global-data-privacy-crisis/">privacy crisis</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So,&nbsp;how should we respond to this crisis? We say through a new type of technology built with strong cryptographic security at its base.</p>



 The Sudo solution 



<p></p>



<p>Today, enterprises are urgently seeking ways to meet customer demands for safer and more private interactions with their services and the digital world. We believe the solution lies in empowering people to determine what information they share, and how, when and with whom they share it. We do this through the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo</a>&nbsp;digital identity that users can take into the world and use in place of their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal information</a>&nbsp;in many different scenarios in their daily physical and digital lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through our&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>, enterprise developers can rapidly integrate digital identities into their applications and build a deeper level of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">trust</a>&nbsp;with their users. The platform provides extensive privacy capabilities, from communications to secure browsing to payments, all centered around digital identities.&nbsp;<br><br>We’re also enhancing these digital identities with&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/decentralized-identity-key-concepts-explained/">decentralized identity</a>&nbsp;technologies. Built on blockchain technology, decentralized identity provides a strong foundation for a much improved privacy experience for the user. Indeed, decentralization is being called the most important privacy innovation for the coming decade.&nbsp;</p>



 Definitions of decentralized identity vary, but this definition works well:&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>… an approach to identity and access management (IAM) that seeks ways to allow individuals to manage their own personally identifiable information (PII) instead of using a central authority. An important goal of decentralized identity is to create standards that will allow internet users to control which applications and services can have access to specific types of PII.</p>



<p>The two most common IAM models on the internet are centralized (e.g.&nbsp;I create an account on a system) or federated (e.g.&nbsp;I use my Facebook account to sign on to systems). Decentralized identity removes the control from these centralized systems and gives it to the user to control their own identity data and how it’s used.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Decentralized identity is built on a set of industry standards and technology implementations that allow identities to be secure and user-controlled, while still being interoperable with numerous services at the user’s discretion. This standardized approach maintains the flexibility that users have come to expect from today’s internet while creating a higher level of privacy protections that they require to be privacy protected in the current digital landscape. That has motivated Anonyome Labs to focus on empowering enterprises with decentralized identity tools and capabilities.&nbsp;(Read&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/decentralized-identity-key-concepts-explained/">Decentralized Identity: Key Concepts Explained</a>.)</p>



<p>Beyond Sudo Platform, Anonyome Labs supports the ongoing development of decentralized identity by:</p>



  helping to run three decentralized identity-focused blockchains  being an active contributor to the decentralized identity standards organizations  contributing source code back to the decentralized identity open source community.&nbsp;  



 <br>Decentralized identity is the future of privacy and identity management on the internet. In this article series, we’ll outline the opportunity. Next week we’ll look at the full-scale attack on privacy and how the Sudo digital identity can help users reclaim control over their personal information.<br>

<p>On April 7th, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued a<a href="https://www.fdic.gov/news/financial-institution-letters/2022/fil22016.html#letter"> letter</a> to its supervised financial institutions asking them to disclose any current and future cryptoasset-related activities they intend to engage in. The FDIC – being one of the more risk-averse regulators in the United States – outlines its concerns regarding the overall “safety and soundness risks, as well as financial stability and consumer protection” risks of cryptoasset products and service offerings from banks. This letter from the FDIC does not come as a surprise, especially when the FDIC’s new Acting Chair – Martin Gruenberg – named crypto as one of the agency’s top priorities for 2022.&nbsp;</p>

 The Underlying Logic of Building for Web3 with&nbsp;Ontology <p>Ontology and Dorahacks are hosting a <a href="https://dorahacks.io/grant/ontology/">virtual hackathon</a> as part of our Ontology EVM Fund initiative to support the development of Web3 dApps on the Ontology EVM. The virtual hackathon runs from 1st-30th April and supports Web3 innovation on Ontology, particularly in privacy and decentralized identity. We have made a $100K developer prize pool available.</p><p>To support interested developers, we ran an Ontology Grant Hackathon Workshop, where Li Jun and Humpty Calderon covered some of the key reasons for building on the Ontology public blockchain. Here, we summarise some of the most important points, and hope that they are useful guidelines as to why developing for Web3 makes sense with Ontology.</p><p>Since inception, Ontology has had a singular focus on building the decentralized infrastructure to support privacy applications. As such, the Ontology public blockchain is not only fast, accessible and secure, but it incorporates important protocols to optimize the development process for&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>Currently, public blockchains are mainly focused on digital asset management. However, Web3 is set to change this. Identity, personal data, credit scores, and all kinds of public information will need to be stored on public blockchains to make Web3 a reality. This is where Ontology is focused; Building the fundamental architecture to support Web3 dApps. As such, you can think of Ontology as a public blockchain with built in Web3 protocols for management of such things like decentralized identity, personal data and credit&nbsp;scores.</p><p>Ontology also supports multi-virtual machines (VM), which makes it the most VM supported blockchain. We offer the NeoVM, WasmVM, and now the Ontology EVM. This provides developers with a host of familiar tools with which to build, whether that’s more traditional programming environments, or more blockchain specific environments such as the building tools around Ethereum.</p><p>This multi-VM approach means that we support 4 types of smart contracts. These can be used individually, or you can easily build interactions between different VMs. This means you could build different parts of a dApp using different smart contracts, and they integrate across multiple-VMs to optimize&nbsp;results.</p><p>An important question to ask is, why build on the Ontology EVM? The answer, in part, is because of all the things we’ve already spoken about. It’s easy and efficient to launch existing projects on Ontology at the same time as Ethereum and other EVM supporting chains. If you’re an EVM based dApp developer, then you have access to all of the tools you are comfortable with. The Ontology EVM supports Ethereum addresses, provides a safe and secure bridge to move between formats, and supports the majority of Web3 JSON-RPC&nbsp;APIs.</p><p>Beyond this, it provides you with access to the fundamental tools and protocols that we have already built to provide the necessary Web3 infrastructure. This saves time and resources, as you don’t need to build your own protocols for every dApp you develop, we provide modular functionality.</p><p>The core products for this functionality are <a href="http://ont.id">ONT ID</a>, a multi-chain decentralized identity framework, bringing fundamental functionality for Web3, and <a href="http://onto.app">ONTO Wallet</a>, which provides ease of access to the Web3 environment and natively integrates ONT&nbsp;ID.</p><p>Finally, we bring an active and engaged community, spanning several languages and incorporating existing partnerships and <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/over-1-5-million-users-now-managing-their-digital-identity-using-ont-id-ontologys-decentralized-7f696a5af98d">over 1.5million</a> created ONT IDs.

<p>Impact of the Digital Markets Act (DMA) on eIDAS and digital identity in Europe.</p>



 The Digital Markets Act (DMA) is on the finish line. 



<p>On March 24th, 2022, <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/de/TXT/?qid=1608116887159&amp;uri=COM%3A2020%3A842%3AFIN">the European Parliament and Council reached an agreement on the final version of the Digital Markets Act (DMA)</a>. According to the European Commission, the DMA regulation is expected to be reviewed and enacted by October 2022. The important fact to note is the DMA would be completed in less than two years from the first draft in December 2020. This underscores how important this regulation is for the European Union and its member states.</p>



 What is the Digital Markets Act (DMA)? 



<p>The DMA aims to control dominant online platforms and ensure that they behave fairly. Together with the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/digital-service-act-dsa/">Digital Services Act (DSA)</a>, the DMA is one of the centerpieces of the European digital strategy. The objective of the DMA is to foster innovation, growth, fair competition, and facilitate the scaling up of smaller platforms, SMEs and start-ups. Furthermore, the DMA aims to rebalance and protect the European users, companies, and public authorities according to European values, which place citizens at the center.</p>



 What is the Digital Services Act (DSA)? 



<p>The Digital Services Act (DSA), in addition to the DMA, introduces a new set of rules to control intermediary services. These services include internet infrastructure, hosting services as well as online platforms. While the DMA is focused on regulating market dominance to ensure fair competition, the DSA is focused on the operational obligations, which focus on data handling, data privacy, filtering fake news, and illegal content. The DSA was developed in parallel to the DMA, and the final version is expected to be agreed to shortly.</p>



 Who are the gatekeepers? 



<p>The DMA establishes a set of narrowly defined objective criteria for qualifying a large online platform as a so-called “gatekeeper”.</p>



<p>The European Commission uses the following high-level criteria to define a gatekeeper company:</p>



  has a strong economic position, significant impact on the internal market and is active in multiple EU countries  has a strong intermediation position, meaning that it links a large user base to a large number of businesses  has (or is about to have) an entrenched and durable position in the market, meaning that it is stable over time  



<p>In practice, the DMA classifies companies with a market capitalization of at least 75 billion euros or a turnover in the European economic area of at least 7.5 billion euros is a gatekeeper. The platforms concerned further must have 45 million monthly users in the EU and 10,000 active business users per year. Given the high requirements, mostly the largest tech giants, such as Alphabet (Google), Meta (Facebook), Amazon, Apple, or the travel platform Booking.com, among others, fall under the scrutiny of the DMA. The high bars were chosen to not put any burden on the smaller platforms but target the characteristics of dominant tech giants that tip the market.</p>



 What makes the DMA different from existing antitrust laws? 



<p>What makes the DMA special compared to existing antitrust laws is its proactive approach. While existing antitrust laws have been designed to maintain healthy markets, their countermeasures came under criticism as being too slow and reactive to cope with monopolistic markets driven by certain digital tech giants, specifically the gatekeepers. The DMA is looking to change that by proactively approaching unfair competition and market practices to prevent such platform providers in the future.</p>



<p>Further, the DMA includes the right to carry out investigations and sanction non-compliant behavior. The sanctions introduce a new level of penalties, such as periodic penalty payments of up to 5% of the average daily turnover and fines of up to 10% of the company’s total worldwide annual turnover. In the event of a repeat offense, the European Commission can impose a fine of up to 20% of its total worldwide turnover. In the past, penalties often have been too low to hurt the tech giants, given their enormous size and billions in revenues. The new penalties are meant to make a relevant impact that enable the European Union to enforce their market regulations.</p>



 What are the implications for eIDAS and digital identity in Europe? 



<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas/">eIDAS regulation</a> is one of the key pillars of digitalization of the European Union. Therefore, the DMA and DSA coming into force will also influence the realization of digital identity in Europe.<br><br>In practice, the DMA will further emphasize and enforce “interoperability,” a key theme of the eIDAS regulation including the proposal for a European digital identity framework (EUID). The DMA will function as a means to not only keep the gatekeepers in check, but also foster competition and innovation. This will allow smaller providers the ability to access and offer new ancillary services.</p>



<p>Such services now focus on the EUID and forthcoming e-Wallet proposal. After the success of mobile payment wallets, the tech giants, Apple and Google, are now expanding wallet’s functionality into the digital identity space. Apple recently introduced support for ISO 13018-5 mobile driver’s licenses in the USA, with the states Arizona and Georgia to first implement it and further states to follow. eIDAS and the DMA, on the other hand, go beyond collaborations with individual platform providers. The EUID Wallet initiative will support interactions with European Qualified Trust Service Providers (QTSPs), access to public administration, and enable the remote/local creation of Qualified Electronic Signatures (QES).</p>



<blockquote><p>IDnow welcomes the objectives of the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/digital-markets-act-dma/">Digital Markets Act (DMA)</a> as it will strengthen choice and offer better quality service through a competitive playing field not only for the European economy, but also the digital identity ecosystem. We believe that digital identity and the related personal information is highly sensitive and therefore needs to stay within control of the European community, both on the oversight and the operational level. Further, we believe that the DMA in hand with eIDAS will foster the digital identity market and support us with building European market leaders that will serve the European citizens in their best interest.</p>Armin Bauer, CTO &amp; Founder IDnow</blockquote>



 



<p>While the exact implications of the DMA and DSA on eIDAS 2.0, the next version of eIDAS, are yet to be defined, both regulations will support the general objective of eIDAS to protect European users, their identities, and data sovereignty. Further, they will protect and strengthen the European trust service and digital identity ecosystem.</p>

 Covid-19 has highlighted the systemic vulnerabilities in the Swedish and planetary food systems, while creating the political economy for deep transformation. This paper seeks to outline the increasingly critical relationship between food and the healthy development of our minds and bodies, and therefore the future prosperity of our economies and societies. <p>Covid-19 is increasingly forcing us to recognise that food plays a central role in the human health defense systems <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213453020301890">[1]</a>. Yet our health treatment systems are trailing behind, with nutrition left out of governments’ key recommendations announced during the Covid-19 pandemic [image&nbsp;1].</p>Image 1: general recommendations by the public health authority during&nbsp;Covid-19<p>For society as a whole to become resilient and healthy, it appears crucial to recognise the effects of food’s regenerative potential and its capacity for systemic prevention of illness and the avoidance of societal harm. However, to enable this, government officials, food systems actors, health care workers, marketing offices, researchers and civil society need to actively start redesigning the systems and institutional infrastructures around our food systems and address deep societal lock-ins.</p><p>We recognise these are easy sentences to write and that a true transformation will require fundamental new models of change and innovations at the systemic level. Even if the evidence for the necessity of a shift is clear, what is needed to address its deep rooted challenges, currently preventing a shift to happen, is less&nbsp;clear.</p> Evidence for the relationship between food and the human mind and&nbsp;body <p>Evidence exists for the multiple ways in which food and health are interconnected.</p><p>Today there is evidence for the negative human and financial impact of health-depriving foods. For example, today’s obesity epidemic cost Sweden SEK70 billion every year <a href="https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/livsvillkor-levnadsvanor/fysisk-aktivitet-och-matvanor/overvikt-och-fetma/#:~:text=Baserat%20p%C3%A5%20att%20drygt%20en,f%C3%B6r%20individen%20och%20f%C3%B6r%20samh%C3%A4llet.">[2]</a>, type 2 diabetes cost SEK18 billion <a href="https://ihe.se/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IHE-Rapport_2015_1.pdf">[3]</a> and heart and lung diseases cost SEK60 billion<a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/e8gvzq1fwq00/412SVQCzTi6JmXv6rmY15y/336a3ff35c595fe9f9a816aaebeff06b/IHE_Rapport_2021.pdf">[4]</a> (these costs have significant overlap and can not be directly added together as one sum), compared to the total budget for health care, which 2020 was SEK102 billion <a href="https://www.regeringen.se/sveriges-regering/finansdepartementet/statens-budget/statens-budget-i-siffror/">[5]</a>. At the same time it is clear in the literature that eating behaviours greatly impact these health conditions <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/lifestyle-changes-to-lower-heart-disease-risk-2019110218125">[6]</a>,<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19927146/#:~:text=The%20diabetes%20epidemic%20is%20associated,development%20of%20overweight%20and%20obesity.">[7]</a>.</p><p>Today there is evidence for food’s role in treating illness.

Combined this prevents illness and disease to break out in the body, which cumulatively supports society’s preventative capacity.</p><p>Today there is evidence for diets impacting the severity of a Covid-19 infection.

Therefore, enabling the availability of healthy foods and the conscious consumption of it, across the whole spectrum of society, is a burden that can not be put on the individual alone.</p> Identifying the root causes to why change is not happening <p>With the availability of evidence and the crystallisation of damage, the open question is why we are not addressing these challenges. There is no single answer or magic bullet, rather there are multiple factors as to why this is not not yet happening at the scale and speed necessary. It is crucial to take a systems perspective in analysis of this challenge and consider the root causes of the symptoms made visible in society by the Covid-19 pandemic. These root causes impact both physical infrastructures and the metabolic flows of food systems e.g. the logistics of water, energy, nutrients, fertilizers, seeds, waste,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Interventions to address these root causes would need to sit across multiple layers such&nbsp;as:</p><p>Based on interviews conducted in the Rapid Transition Lab (including a doctor focused on functional medicine, a nurse at a cancer treatment clinic, a nutritionist and two health coaches) and additional desk-top research, there appears to be three critical challenges to consider:</p>  Pricing and accounting of food is struggling to consider its regenerative potential nor the negative externalities created through its production and consumption,  Food lobbying (e.g. around what can be called milk <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/8384/sweden-milk-war-oatly">[30]</a>), misleading marketing campaigns and labelling of food <a href="https://annfernholm.se/2022/01/07/hemmakvall-inleder-aret-med-vilseledande-reklam/">[31]</a> is making it hard for consumers to navigate the impact of the items displayed on the supermarket shelves and online stores’ interfaces,  Disconnect between the food and pharmaceutical industries. Food companies are trying to make money through the system challenged by what is described above and pharmaceutical companies by selling patented drugs. This is minimizing the funds available for research into diet’s role in medical treatment, prevention and regeneration.  <p>When looking closer at the food system’s incentive structures it becomes clear that ingredients triggering the brain to want more <a href="https://www.bokus.com/bok/9789113116389/halsosegrar-den-vetenskapliga-vagen-till-ett-friskare-liv/">[32]</a>, for example sugar, salt, saturated fats, or all three combined <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0117959">[33]</a>, becomes a desirable for anyone trying to make a quick profit from food. Unfortunately, these items tend to give no or minimal support to the five health defense systems, and over time, large consumption of such products can even harm them [<a href="https://2heal.se/om-oss/">34</a> interview]. Today this reality is not being reflected in the cost of the production nor the price for the consumers. It seems to be that the pricing and the accounting systems are not designed for people’s, nor the planet’s, regenerative health.</p><p>If consumes like to make better choices by themselves, the words, colours, and symbols on the wrapping of ingredients are often misleading <a href="https://foodpharmacyco.com/category/ann-fernholm-en/">[35]</a>; creating cascading effects at societal scale. What is more, people are bombarded with commercials about cheap prices on traditional and social media channels, putting the focus on price over quality [<a href="https://www.johannescullberg.com/">36</a> interview]. It appears, therefore, that the negative freedom enjoyed by food companies to use certain language and imagery when marketing food is actually diminishing people’s positive freedom to enjoy healthy lives and consequently creating increased liabilities for future generations <a href="https://obgyn.duke.edu/about/our-faculty/susan-kay-murphy-phd">[37]</a>.</p><p>The last structural challenge (mentioned in this blog) is the lack of high-quality and large-scale research into the relationship between diet, healing, prevention, and regeneration. Today, large clinical studies, necessary to change treatment recommendations <a href="https://www.kostfonden.se/varfor/#starkt_forksning">[38]</a>, are almost always sponsored or entirely paid for by pharmaceutical companies <a href="https://www.tidningencurie.se/nyheter/2016/03/02/trovardigheten-hotas-av-bestallda-studier/#:~:text=L%C3%A4kemedelsbranschen%20i%20Sverige%20satsar%20%C3%A5rligen,samarbete%20med%20akademi%20och%20sjukv%C3%A5rd.">[39]</a>. They have little reason to prove that for example, cranberries can be used in cancer treatment <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5039576/">[40]</a>, as they can not write a patent for cranberries. Therefore, there are very few large and high-quality clinical studies made to show foods’ regenerative role in society <a href="https://www.kostfonden.se/varfor/#starkt_forksning">[41]</a>. In Sweden, this means that governments and doctors have too little evidence to back up detailed recommendations about using food in prevention and treatment. Without the necessary investment into this area of research, the necessary change will be very difficult to accomplish.</p><p>To ensure resilience in society it is therefore critical to create the incentives for researchers, government officials, food systems actors, health care workers, marketing offices, and individuals to become a part of a new transitional system that enables food to play a regenerative role in building society’s capacity to&nbsp;heal.</p> Enabling the transformation <p>Multiple entangled interventions will be necessary to transform the current scenario, requiring the involvement of actors from across the food and health care systems, national, regional, and municipal governments, research institutions, and civil society. To start a conversation with these actor groups, four propositions, addressing the three main challenge areas (described above), have been made and outlined as ‘what if…’ statements below. We invite you to engage with them together with us, exploring why or why not these could help to drive the change necessary.</p> (1) Pricing not just the production but the externalities of&nbsp;foods <p>Increasingly food and our food systems have been optimized from a production costs and supply side optimisation perspective. This reality has supported the massive reduction in the cost of food and calories over the last 18 years <a href="https://www.fao.org/worldfoodsituation/foodpricesindex/en/">[42]</a>, while off loading increasingly significant societal costs. These liabilities include, as earlier described, the impacts of sugary, fatty and salty food items and the loss of nutrition dense foods on 1) sick leave costs, 2) life style driven health care costs and 3) opportunity costs; in terms of the cognitive capacity of society as whole. This is not including the food systems’ impact on the environment, such as GHG emissions <a href="https://essd.copernicus.org/preprints/essd-2021-389/">[43]</a>, biodiversity loss <a href="https://report.ipcc.ch/ar6wg2/pdf/IPCC_AR6_WGII_FinalDraft_Chapter05.pdf">[44]</a>and soil erosion <a href="https://report.ipcc.ch/ar6wg2/pdf/IPCC_AR6_WGII_FinalDraft_Chapter05.pdf">[45]</a> — to name a few. Today these outcomes are almost always ignored when food is being&nbsp;priced.</p><p>What if the societal and environmental costs generated throughout the supply chain of food had to be considered and paid into an autonomous self-balancing system, held by a public good trust, which simultaneously cross finances and balances different parts of the food economy that create societal value? The externalities that are generated throughout the food value chain would be considered at each level, from farmers to producers to distributors, to create a true value market inclusive of future societal liabilities and assets. The cost of negative externalities, and the value of positive externalities, would be standardised and decided collectively yet self determined by the actors involved when pricing their products — for example a farmer when selling their cabbage, a manufacturer when selling their cabbage&nbsp;crisps.</p><p>What if this balancing system even considered how different people are impacted by different foods?</p>Image 2: Pricing not just the production but the externalities of&nbsp;foods<p>Such a system would seek to shift the incentives in the current food system and encourage consumers to buy those foods that are benefiting their health defense systems and the&nbsp;planet.</p><p>As farmers and producers would need to evidence their self-set prices (through verifying externalities generated) they are incentivized to both continuously self-evaluate their practices and continuously improve them as means to reduce liability costs and increase competitiveness under the new market and price&nbsp;logics.</p><p>This systemic realignment of our food system and incentives to societal outcomes as opposed to capital optimisation is&nbsp;vital.</p><p>Some actors are already testing new logics to pricing food. Felix Climate Store <a href="https://webershandwick.eu/our-work/felix-the-climate-store/">[46]</a> is one example and in our interview with them, we understood that when they based their prices on a product’s CO2 emissions, items that usually never get left on the shelves became harder to sell, for example, their classic frozen meatballs.</p><p>In order to increase the complexity of the pricing beyond CO2 emissions and look at multiple outcomes at the same time (suggested by the what if… statement above) would require highly-complex information infrastructures. Companies would need to be able to combine different types of data (public, private, sometimes personal) in order to build real-time and context based pricing models. This might not be a 1st horizon scenario, however, with the technology at hand today, this could become possible over&nbsp;time.</p><p>Still there are multiple important questions to ask before moving forward with such an idea. For example, who decides what positive and negative outcomes are and for who? Considering the development of accuracy in measurement, how would the system tackle discrepancies in externalities estimated and measured e.g. would there be retrospective adjustments, if so who would hold the risk for that, would bespoke insurance products be needed? What would be required in terms of labelling, displaying and packaging of foods? What would be asked of the individual to navigate this system? What research would be needed to cover current knowledge gaps about how different food impacts people differently? recommendations? And the list could go&nbsp;on.</p> (2) Accounting for the re-generative potential of&nbsp;food <p>Many decisions in today’s economy are informed by the reports created by accountants. Still, the existing accounting systems are struggling, similar to the pricing models, to account for the spillover liabilities and assets created in the wider system. Instead accountants are concentrated on the economic costs and revenues of one specific entity, in order to put a number at the end of the balance sheet. This is creating a simplified picture of the complex value flows generated by the supply chain of food and the systemic discounting of externalities (this is not only an issue within the food system&nbsp;<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/a-smart-commons-528f4e53cec2">[47]</a>).</p><p>What if the accounting systems and accountability structures were able to account for the entangled values and liabilities created by food and include the many co-beneficiaries impacted? By combining new accounting practices and monitoring systems (making sense of the outcomes created) new lines could be added to the balance sheet. Maybe even items that do not directly impact the entity concerned? This would paint a different picture for companies to consider when making decisions.</p>Image 3: Accounting for the re-generative potential of&nbsp;food<p>Such a shift would create incentives to consider the entangled values and liabilities generated throughout the supply chain when choosing, for example, what crops to grow, as well as how to grow&nbsp;them.</p><p>The new sustainability reporting requirements <a href="https://www.icaew.com/insights/viewpoints-on-the-news/2021/nov-2021/new-sustainability-standards-board-targets-globally-comparable-reporting">[48]</a> are an important step in this direction, as companies are being asked to report their social and environmental impact. However, until these impacts are visible on the balance sheet, we may not see enough change as urgently necessary [49]. Visibility would influence a companies’ ability to raise capital, and the cost of that capital, it would also influence the insurance premiums needed. Equally, it would make it more transparent for customers how a certain company operates.</p><p>At the same time as this shift seems important, it can not be discussed without mentioning the risk of trying to put a number on social and environmental impacts. What sort of design decisions would be needed to be taken in order to calculate this, for example what impacts, over what time-span — and who would take these decisions? For example, how would the interests of non-human actors and future generations be taken into account, and what would happen in situations where a balancing between interests would be needed? What new capabilities, skills and professional training would be needed in order to develop this system? And, as this would also require highly-complex information infrastructures, when could this be made possible?</p> (3) Taxonomy for regenerative food <p>Today the marketing and labeling of food is often done through culturally associated claims, such as clean, all natural, real fruit, happy cows, independent family farmers, humane and environmentally responsible products, naturally sweet and the list could go on. The ambition is to create a cultural wrapper around food which overwhelms its actual nutritional value and associated regulatory requirements, to enable us to believe a product is good and healthy for us/or the planet, without the associative evidence or&nbsp;reality.</p><p>It is becoming clear that this cultural taxonomy of food has been massively exploited for the intentional or the unintentional misdirection of informed&nbsp;choices.</p><p>What if there was a new evidence-based-claims requirement for the taxonomy for regenerative food? Instead of only addressing the words regenerative and food, this could include a whole series of different words and sentences. Let us walk through an&nbsp;example.</p><p>Imagine a new food product is being placed into the market. The producer would in this case be required to make a self-declarative impact model of the product’s impact on different people, society and the environment. Based on this open model, they would be permitted (or not) to make a portfolio of self-declarative claims, such as this product will improve your immune system or the local soil quality. The portfolio of claims could then be structured as a sign that this is a regenerative food, if, for example, the model shows sustainable input, positive societal outcomes and low externality/positive externality process.</p><p>These claims would need to acknowledge the situational variance, i.e different foods have differential impacts on different people, at different times and different foods have different impacts on soils and ecosystems in different climates. This would mean that the portfolio of claims shifts depending on who the buyer is and when the purchase is being&nbsp;made</p><p>Similarly, what if products which are systemically degenerative would be required to label their regressive impacts similar to cigarettes?</p>Image 4: Taxonomy for regenerative food<p>Such a taxonomy would, beyond helping customers navigate different options, create the incentives for food actors to monitor the impact of their businesses. This would increase the awareness of externalities created in the system and potentially encourage improvements to be made. The evidence would need to consider the entire supply chain and could further inform new collaborations across the&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Äkta Vara is an existing customer owned organisation trying to address issues with food labeling and marketing using campaigns and their Ä-mark <a href="https://www.aktavara.org/">[50]</a>. They are making it more transparent what a product contains, or maybe rather what it does not contain. Another example is kliMAT, allowing customers to scan items and find out their climate footprint <a href="https://klimatappen.se/">[51]</a>. While both of these examples help the customer to navigate the shelves of a food store, neither creates a framework for how to name and market. Currently this is regulated by the EU-taxonomy <a href="https://www.livsmedelsverket.se/foretagande-regler-kontroll/regler-for-livsmedelsforetag/information-markning-och-pastaenden">[52]</a>, which is not able to address the complexity of impacts in the&nbsp;system.</p><p>While this “EU Taxonomy 2.0” for regenerative food could improve the current situation, it is important to note that the marketing of food is still likely to be miss-leading; mostly due to the difficulty of ensuring quality of evidence, and therefore verifying, claims. This is not necessarily due to intentional misleading of customers, but rather because a food item’s impact is dependant on the entire supply chain, which is entangled with many other systems. Any generalization, therefore, becomes hard to make, without an over simplification. This requires us to ask how to create the necessary information infrastructures to evidence claims uniformly and while allowing actors to make sense of their specific&nbsp;impacts?</p> (4) Invest in evidencing <p>Today there is a funding gap for research about food’s impact on the body <a href="https://www.kostfonden.se/varfor/#starkt_forksning">[53]</a>. As stated earlier in this article, the main root cause of this is the disconnect between the food and pharma industries and the lack of incentives to prove that food can be regenerative.</p><p>What if the self-balancing pricing system was used as a seed fund, matching public and private investment into research to evidence food’s impact on the body and mind? This research would be necessary to make the earlier suggested pricing, accounting and taxonomy models work and could encourage private and public bodies to raise their investments.</p>Image 5: Invest in evidencing<p>Once there is enough evidence to make the new models function, there would be clear incentives for private companies and public bodies to keep investing in this area of research (as it would help them prove what their impact on society and environment is).</p><p>The increased understanding of food’s impact on mind and body would not only enable the new incentive models, it would further help the health care system navigate how to use food in prevention and treatment. When a next pandemic arrives, governments may even know what diet to recommend populations to eat in order to help their health defence systems to stand up against the&nbsp;disease.</p><p>Kostfonden is a fund that is already trying to address the current funding issue. They are particularly targeting food’s role in treatment <a href="https://www.kostfonden.se/">[54]</a>. However, it is not enough and it will be important to better understand diets’ role in personalised prevention and regeneration (personalised food is a growing area within the food sector and will need to be explored by&nbsp;itself).</p><p>However, before the investments are pooled, the suggested funding model would need to carefully consider its governance structures. What is the decision-making architecture for deciding who, or what, gets funding? There are already issues with food lobbying in research related to food <a href="https://www.adlibris.com/se/bok/fejkmaten-9789127173583?affId=2939453&amp;utm_source=tradedoubler&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=annfernholm.se&amp;tduid=bccf80942c42f1cd13ce74f0a5b55ac9">[55]</a>, how can this be an opportunity to ensure that the research is done for public good? Equally, how can the fund ensure long-term sustainability for researchers while leaving space for the inherited uncertainty in the process? What would the Intellectual property requirements be for research to avoid recreating many of the ills and perverse incentives of our current food&nbsp;system?</p><p>Lastly, how can the insights and results generated from the research become radically legible for people across food and health care systems, different layers of governments as well as individuals? And who is responsible for these translations?</p><p>Combined, these four “what if…” statements, could, if realised with careful consideration, have transformative potential and ensure that food’s regenerative ability is seriously considered throughout its supply chains. However, these suggestions are not enough and it will be crucial to identify additional intervention points moving&nbsp;forward.</p>Image 6: Provocation ecosystem<p>Therefore, in the coming months, we will continue exploring the questions and ideas raised in this blog together with different stakeholders.

<p>This is a very short Dev Pulse; I just want to cover the changes in this week’s Holochain release. (Note: there were no public 0.0.133 or 0.0.134 releases due to automation issues; these have been fixed (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1336">#1336</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1342">#1342</a>).)</p> Holochain 0.0.135: External links, HDK stabilisation <p>Breaking changes: HDK<br>Compatible HDK versions: 0.0.129</p> External links <p>Links have gotten some more changes (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1298">#1298</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1308">#1308</a>), bringing us closer to the Holochain Resource Locators <a href="https://www.holochain.org/roadmap/">milestone</a>. Now you can use headers as your link base or target, without having to re-type them to entry hashes (which worked but felt kinda hacky to me). But not only that — you can now use external hashes as well! Hashes now come in one extra flavour, <a href="https://docs.rs/holo_hash/0.0.23/holo_hash/hash_type/enum.AnyLinkable.html"><code>AnyLinkable</code></a>, and all link manipulation functions now expect a new type called <a href="https://docs.rs/holo_hash/0.0.23/holo_hash/type.AnyLinkableHash.html"><code>AnyLinkableHash</code></a>, which can be converted from an <a href="https://docs.rs/holo_hash/0.0.23/holo_hash/type.EntryHash.html">entry</a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/holo_hash/0.0.23/holo_hash/type.HeaderHash.html">header</a>, or <a href="https://docs.rs/holo_hash/0.0.23/holo_hash/type.ExternalHash.html">external</a> hash (note: the DNA hash is still not linkable, by design). That makes this a breaking change for the HDK. All you need to do for existing code, though, is put <code>.into()</code> at the end of an entry or agent hash value to convert it into <code>AnyLinkableHash</code>.</p><p>You can learn more about how Holochain uses and formats hashes by reading through the excellent <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.126/hdk/hash/index.html">HDK documentation update</a> from two weeks ago.</p> Integrity/coordination split begins <p>The other change is that we’ve started to split the HDK in two. You’ll recall two Dev Pulses ago that one of our upcoming <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-roadmap-online/#holochain-roadmap-is-now-live">milestones</a> is Stable Validation, which means that we are promising a stable core to the HDK so you can write stable hApps with stable DHTs. (See the pattern? Stability!)</p><p>This core, called Holochain Deterministic Integrity (HDI), is a subset of the current HDK’s functionality — only the types and host functions needed to define and validate data. In the future, zomes built with HDI will be the only zomes that contribute to the DNA’s hash, which will let you update business logic written with the less-stable full HDK without causing a network fork.</p><p>This release marks the beginning of the split. It moves all the features needed for deterministic integrity into two new crates — <code><a href="https://crates.io/crates/holochain_integrity_types/0.0.2">holochain_integrity_types</a></code> for the types and &nbsp;<code><a href="https://crates.io/crates/holochain_deterministic_integrity/0.0.2">holochain_deterministic_integrity</a></code> for the host functions (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1305">#1305</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1324">#1324</a>). (In the process, the HDK no longer depends on rusqlite!) At this point, you don’t need to do any code edits, as these crates get imported into the HDK for you. But your zomes will need to be recompiled in order to be compatible with this week’s Holochain release.</p><p>Next up will be a way of specifying whether a zome is an integrity or coordination zome in your DNA manifest (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1325">#1325</a>, likely to be in next week’s release). When this is introduced in a later release, you will likely need to split your code into integrity and coordination zomes. I promise I’ll write more about it when the changes solidify and make it into a release.</p> Various fixes and updates   The codebase is getting cleaned up with an eye to further stabilise the HDK. Types which require a membrane proof now require the <code>SerializedBytes</code> of the proof to be put into an <code>Arc</code>, so as to prevent the need to internally clone this potentially large amount of data. For instance, the <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.129/hdk/prelude/struct.AgentValidationPkg.html">AgentValidationPkg</a></code> type now refers to the <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.129/hdk/prelude/type.MembraneProof.html">MembraneProof</a></code> type, which is simply an alias for <code>Option&lt;SerializedBytes&gt;</code>. This change will require some minor refactoring if you’re using membrane proofs. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1311">#1311</a>)  Internal tests and compilation issues are being fixed (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1319">#1319</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1304">#1304</a>).  WASM error messages now contain their line numbers for better debuggability (holochain-wasmer <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-wasmer/pull/81">#81</a>).  The admin API couldn’t install hApp bundles that were more than 16 MB in size; this is now fixed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1322">#1322</a>)  Missing validation dependencies are now fetched asynchronously. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1268">#1268</a>)  <p>That’s all for this week! Expect big changes in the next few weeks — as mentioned, though, these changes are intended to ultimately lighten your code maintenance burden, making DHT forks a rare event.</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@basvde?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Bas van den Eijkhof</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/links?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

With products often in different states of implementing our design system, part of our job is to find inconsistencies, suggest the use of available components, or offer better uses for <a href="https://medium.com/@lukasoppermann/design-tokens-what-are-they-how-will-they-help-you-b73f80f602ab">design&nbsp;tokens</a>.</p><p>While working on <a href="https://github.com/onfido/castor">Castor</a> (Onfido’s in-house design system), we often ask ourselves: “Is that a Castor select component or a custom component that‘s been *styled* similar to a Castor select?”. We squint at various shades of dark-grey text to try and discern whether they are consistent. We try to recall if that media icon was part of our official icon set or&nbsp;not?</p><p>We have many tools and metrics to help us answer questions like: which products are using which components, what % of colors in a product are RGB or Hex values instead of using our design tokens (we call these values orphans)? We also use Figma’s analytics and asset management tools for the design side. The problem with these is they’re either high level or are non-visual. To get the information we need, we frequently have to open a web inspector on a page and hunt for clues (classes, values, CSS variables).</p><p>There must be a better&nbsp;way.</p> The power of&nbsp;systems <p>Luckily for us, one of the best things about well-built design systems is consistency. When digging in the web inspector, we would look for signs of usage by looking for common patterns in the&nbsp;code.</p><p>All the components in Castor have CSS classes which are all prefixed with ods- (which stands for Onfido Design&nbsp;System):</p> class="ods-button" <br>class="ods-select" <br>class="ods-tooltip" <p>Similarly, our color tokens are centrally managed in two layers, Theme aliases, and Base&nbsp;colors.</p> --ods-color-content-main: var(--ods-color-neutral-800), 1;  --ods-color-neutral-800: 59, 167, 32; <p>The rules to identify these things were relatively simple, so what if we could visualize these things based on those&nbsp;rules?</p> User style sheets to the&nbsp;rescue <p>User style sheets are local CSS styles that override existing styles on a page. You write them yourself and typically manage them with a browser extension. I chose <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-style-script/ecjfaoeopefafjpdgnfcjnhinpbldjij">Custom Style Script</a> due to its ability to toggle each style on or off using the icon in the “State” column. If you’re not very familiar with CSS/HTML, you may need to bring in a helpful front-end developer to help at this&nbsp;point.</p><p>(I wish I had some magic bits of code that you could just copy/paste, and off you go, but each system will be different, and the approaches here may not apply to&nbsp;yours.)</p> Visualizing components <p>First, we wanted to see if we could make any components with Castor class prefixes visually obvious. Thanks to some advanced CSS selectors, we can do something like&nbsp;this:</p> [class^='ods-'], [class*=' ods-'] {<br> outline: 3px dashed red !important;<br>} <p>This rule selects any element that starts with our ods- (Onfido design system) class prefix and puts a big outline you absolutely can not miss on&nbsp;them.</p><p>So this relatively consistent looking&nbsp;UI:</p><p>Becomes this:</p><p>We can now immediately see that the Creation date filter, the Search field, and the Sandbox toggle are not using our Castor components.</p><p>You can add or tweak any selectors as you wish to give you confidence that all your components are visible (we ran this on our <a href="https://castor.vercel.app/">Storybook instance</a> to&nbsp;check).</p> Design Tokens <p>Components are only one part of a design system. <a href="https://lukasoppermann.medium.com/design-tokens-what-are-they-how-will-they-help-you-b73f80f602ab">Design tokens</a> for us are equally important, so how do we visualize token use? We’ve focused on color tokens for now, and we want to visualize Theme colors and Base colors independently. To do this, we override the default palettes for these colors with colors well outside our brand&nbsp;palette.</p><p>Our theme tokens have content&nbsp;, border&nbsp;, and background variants, so we picked three shades of purple to indicate&nbsp;these.</p><p>Our base palettes have up to 11 shades of each color, which we can override with this new green shade. It doesn’t matter if there’s no differentiation between palette colors for our purposes.</p> Visualizing theme&nbsp;colors <p>Because our theme colors are defined in a single CSS file, we can copy the CSS rules directly from the web inspector panel.</p> :root {<br>    --ods-color-content-main: var(--ods-color-neutral-800), 1;<br>    ... <p>In a code editor (I used <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a>) we replace the var() value with hard-coded RGB values of our purple shades. Darkest for content, middle for borders, lightest for backgrounds.</p> :root {<br>    --ods-color-content-main: 172, 9, 199, 1;<br>    ... <p>When we paste these rules into a new user style and refresh the page, we get&nbsp;this:</p><p>We can now easily see that while Castor’s Field Label components aren’t in use, all the Field Labels use semantic theme colors, which is excellent. However, our “Checks” heading and our search component are not. We can also see that the Creation date component partially uses theme colors, but not for the text content inside. These are all problems we can add to the team’s&nbsp;backlog.</p><p>While we strongly encourage theme colors, as they enable dynamic theme switching and are just semantically easy to use, they aren’t required. Designers and engineers are free to use base palette colors if they choose. So let’s visualize those and see what slips through the cracks before we write our&nbsp;tickets.</p> Visualizing base&nbsp;colors <p>Base colors are stored in a similar format, except that they just contain straight RGB values. We take our tone scale which ranges from -100 to -900 and simply replace the RGB values with the values of our green shades, from light to&nbsp;dark.</p> :root {<br>    --ods-color-neutral-900: 40, 160, 10;<br>    --ods-color-neutral-800: 59, 167, 32;<br>    --ods-color-neutral-700: 78, 174, 54;<br>    ... <p>Again, when we paste this into Custom Style Script (as a separate row), and refresh our page, we get&nbsp;this:</p><p>We can now see that we have pretty good base color coverage over the UI. However, the Search placeholder text and icon colors are not shades of green, so these are our orphan (RGB/Hex) colors.</p> Digital superpowers! <p>We now have a set of 3 style sheets that we can toggle on/off on any web-based product that uses Castor and get similar insights. You could probably do more here with user JS scripts or different combinations of CSS selectors.</p><p>I’d love to see what you all come up with to improve these techniques for your design&nbsp;systems.</p><p>The immediate work we would suggest for the team’s backlog is now a lot&nbsp;clearer:</p>  Update the search field to use the Castor search component  Update the sandbox toggle to the newly developed Castor component  Update the filter field labels to use Castor components (low priority, as they work OK and are using theme&nbsp;colors)  Update the checks heading color to content-main for consistency with the rest of the text on the&nbsp;page  <p>Remember that it’s definitely worth using the web inspector once you spot anomalies visually, as sometimes it can just be your CSS rules misbehaving.</p><p>That’s it; thanks so much for reading.

A main element of digital experience is the registration, authentication and authorization flow. Instead of developing this per service, organizations are well-advised to rely on standards and services provided via APIs. This also helps in reducing the complexity in implementing standards support, such as for OAuth and OpenID Connect (OIDC). Authlete provides a platform that supports simplified integration of OAuth and OIDC capabilities as well as Financial-grade API (FAPI) support into digital services, while shielding the complexity of the protocols by handling these in a backend service.

For too long access control has been based on static entitlements, but this is changing. Organizations are now increasingly demanding dynamic access control, with decisions made in real-time. They want support for an agile IT approach with dynamic workloads across multiple cloud environments. They want support for their DevOps staff for containerized cloud developments and cloud-native deployments. Course-grained authentication is no longer sufficient, applications and protected resources require fine grained authorization services that can also supply identity attributes and context variables. Policy-based Access Management can satisfy these requirements.

<p>This blog article is part of our blog series “Pushing fintech regulation forward”.</p>



<p>Fintechs have to respond to a rapidly changing environment. They need to adopt new technologies to offer innovative products and services while also staying compliant with evolving regulations.</p>



<p>For many years, regulation has developed to meet the operations of larger, traditional financial institutions. However, even if a fintech is smaller, it still needs to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/regulatory-risks-fintechs/">manage similar risks and protect against criminal or fraudulent behavior</a>. This is now reflected in fintechs being subject to the same regulatory oversight.</p>



<p>There have been calls for an overhaul of the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/finance/what-is-fintech-regulation/">fintech regulation market</a> to better respond to this need to grow and innovate quickly while also keeping markets safe. </p>



<p>Whatever changes may happen in the future, complying with KYC and AML regulations will remain key. These regulations are well defined in most countries and have evolved to meet new criminal methods over the past decades. In Europe, this includes the AMLD (now in its sixth iteration) and eIDAS regulations.</p>



 Artificial Intelligence (AI) and KYC 



<p>Artificial Intelligence and machine learning techniques now form an important part of KYC and AML implementation. </p>



<p>AI offers improved accuracy and speed of customer onboarding. It can be used in many areas, including automated identity verification, biometric matching, and ongoing transaction monitoring. Read more: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/leveraging-ai-fintech-id-verification/">Leveraging AI as a fintech for ID verification</a></p>



<p>The acceptance of such technologies is rapidly increasing. The general AML regulations in most countries (such as AMLD in Europe) do not include technology specifics, but many regulators have confirmed the acceptability of AI and machine learning techniques. </p>



<p>The trend is set for this acceptance to expand, giving many fintechs the confidence to adopt such techniques.</p>



<p>AI and machine learning offer many benefits. Such techniques are lower cost than traditional manual processes and much faster. They are also safer, with more accurate predictions/matches and a lower chance of human error. </p>



<p>Accurate and near real-time verification also have advantages for customers. The overall user experience is improved – and, with it, customer conversion rates.</p>



 







 Challenges of AI and machine learning technology 



<p>As with any major change, or adoption of new technology, there are also challenges and difficulties with AI and machine learning. Staying aware of these is key to minimizing the impact. Working with a reliable technology provider will also help. </p>



<p>The first set of challenges relates to the use of AI techniques and machine learning algorithms in general.</p>



 Poor data quality or preparation 



<p>AI and machine learning algorithms rely on data for training. Access to historical or training data is needed, and results must be checked. Plus, both quality and quantity of data are needed too. This is more of a concern at the start of using a new system or algorithm, since data is limited. But over time, this situation improves as more data becomes available.</p>



 Avoiding AI bias 



<p>Training needs to be carefully managed and checked to avoid AI bias leading to poor results. AI bias refers to the situation where the AI is wrongly trained to reflect human biases. This could be due to human trainers or poor data. Facial recognition as part of KYC is one area that is particularly susceptible to this.</p>



<p>Such biases are not intentional, of course, and they can be hard to pick up. Methods to avoid bias include preparing truly representative data sets, considering outputs rationally, and reviewing AI results against real data.</p>



 Human involvement is still needed 



<p>AI can only do so much. Human involvement is needed in both the training phase and in real-time usage. During training, human input guides machine learning in identifying failures such as non-matches or fraud cases. These could be real failures or false positives, and algorithms need to learn from this. Also, remember that KYC and AML constantly evolve to meet new challenges and fraud methods. This means that ongoing updates and training for machine learning algorithms are common.</p>



<p>AI is largely automated when implemented, but human oversight is still needed. </p>



<p>To stay safe and compliant with regulations, adopters of AI need to realize when it does not work. In identity verification, this includes cases where the AI cannot be sure of an identity. Such cases must be identified and flagged for human review.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/id-verification-meeting-uae-regulations/">IDnow’s AutoIdent</a> handles this using specialist staff. Cases can be sent for video-based manual review, completed in real-time, and at minimal disturbance to the user. Read on: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/consumer-choice-identity-verification/">Consumer choice for Identity Verification</a></p>



 Managing additional risks introduced by AI and machine learning 



<p>Any new method or process introduces risks, which is undoubtedly the case with AI and machine learning in financial services. These could be in any area, and the unknown element is part of the challenge.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/market-studies/ms19-1-credit-information-market-study">UK FCA carried out a study of this in 2019</a>, involving close to 300 financial institutions. This identified several risk areas, but also highlighted that organizations were well aware of how to address them.</p>



<p>Rather than introducing entirely new risks, the FCA felt that machine learning instead re-enforced already existing risks. These can be managed through appropriate staff training and data validation frameworks.</p>



<p>The risk areas identified included:</p>



  Insufficient training of staff to use systems.  Risks introduced by the complexity of an AI system and challenges in validating and governance of systems.  Issues with data quality leading to inaccurate results.

 Challenges of integrating AI into fintech and KYC solutions 



<p>Integrating AI into the onboarding process is not necessarily straightforward. There are further challenges that are specific to KYC, verification, and onboarding that adopters of AI should be aware of.</p>



 Managing customer expectations and experience 



<p>People are used to human interaction. The switch to automation needs to be managed against different experiences and expectations in different markets. This is more likely to cause customer frustration in other AI applications, such as chatbots, but fintechs should still be aware of this possibility with AML and KYC.</p>



 Integrating KYC into the onboarding process 



<p>AI and machine learning algorithms may be invisible to the end-user, but their effect certainly is not. This includes detecting security features in identity documents and performing live biometric facial comparisons.</p>



<p>Done right, this should be seamless to the end customer. Errors or problems could lead to a lack of confidence in security. Failures or slow processes as part of onboarding could lead to customers abandoning sign up. These situations are clearly not good for brand, reputation, or for customer conversion rates. Problems here could worsen as AI becomes more widespread and customer expectations increase.</p>



 Staying up to date with regulations. 



<p>This is a major consideration for RegTech companies. KYC and AML regulations are well defined by FAFT and national regulators. However, these regulations are largely technology neutral. Fintech companies, just like banks, need to stay aware of this and be prepared to justify the technologies used.</p>



<p>More and more national regulators are permitting the use of AI techniques. Countries that allow <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/id-verification-autoident-meeting-eu-regulations/">full AI usage currently include the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Belgium, and Finland</a>. Other European countries permit video-based KYC. Germany has long been the most regulated market, and it has now accepted an element of automation combined with a manual review.</p>



<p>The acceptance of full AI is increasing and will eventually pave the way for much easier expansion for fintechs. Until it is fully accepted, though, fintechs will need to stay aware of differences and be able to adapt methods and offerings for different markets. The use of manual live video reviews is a major part of this for KYC, allowing hybrid verification to be used in place of full automation.</p>

<p>200,000 OCEAN available for Web3 data economy projects!</p><p>Hello, Ocean Community!</p><p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/dao">OceanDAO</a> is a grants DAO to help fund Ocean community projects, curated by the Ocean community. Anyone can apply for a grant. The community votes at the beginning of the month. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">The Ocean ecosystem becomes self-sustainable</a> as the builders of the Web3 data economy leverage Ocean Protocol to create products, services, and resources that the community finds valuable and fosters value creation for the Ecosystem.</p><p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/dao">The OceanDAO website</a> has up-to-date information on getting started with OceanDAO.</p><p>OceanDAO’s next funding round — Round 17 — has 200,000 OCEAN available.</p><p>Submissions are due May 3rd&nbsp;2022</p><p>We encourage you to submit early — more time to advocate for your proposal, it’s gonna be live by submission — and to reach out to the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-oceandao-working-groups-db920b14a5d8">Project-Guiding Work Group</a> right <a href="https://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/908016658239610920">here</a> for feedback and guidance.</p><p>The rest of this post has details about Round&nbsp;17.</p><p>Thank you to all of the OceanDAO participants, voters, and proposers!</p> OceanDAO Round 17&nbsp;Outline <p>Funding Amount</p><p>There is 200,000 OCEAN in grant funding available in Round&nbsp;17.</p><p>Grant Funding Categories</p>  Building / improving applications or integrations to&nbsp;Ocean  Community or developer outreach (grants don’t need to be technical in&nbsp;nature)  Unleashing data  Building or improving core Ocean&nbsp;software  Improvements to OceanDAO&nbsp;itself  <p>Proposal Portal</p><p>To submit proposals teams can now use the new <a href="https://seed.oceandao.org/">Proposal Portal</a> and all participants are required to create their projects and proposals via this website. Participants can visit the <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/dao">OceanDAO home page</a> to learn more about the grants&nbsp;program.</p><p>All projects, proposals and discussions take place inside <a href="https://port.oceanprotocol.com/c/oceandao/round-16/76">Port</a>. As a voter, Port is where you can see all proposal details, engage with teams, and ask questions, just like in <a href="https://oceanpearl.io/dao-proposals">Oceanpearl</a>, for a higher level / beginner&nbsp;view.</p><p>All proposals that meet the basic criteria are then submitted to Snapshot.</p><p>Proposals that receive support from the DAO receive funding in&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>Project Standing</p><p>If you have previously received a grant, you must update your Grant Deliverables inside each proposal to remain in Good Standing. This enables eligibility in upcoming Funding Rounds. Follow the instructions on the <a href="https://www.notion.so/Project-Standing-a26be0e2054e4927ab5ab8e7bde8558f">Project Standing Dashboard</a> to learn&nbsp;more.</p><p>Funding Tiers</p><p>To continue incentivizing completion and outcomes we are continuing Funding Tiers, which can be achieved by Teams delivering on their grant promises.</p><p>In Round 16, the maximum funding projects apply for will be $20,000 USD. The Veteran Funding Tier is therefore being&nbsp;removed.</p><p>The Funding Tiers&nbsp;are:</p>  New Project    Funding Ceiling: $3,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: No one in your project has ever received a grant from OceanDAO. Open to&nbsp;all.  Benefits: Earmarked. Receive feedback during the application process. Introduced to related projects. Receive support during&nbsp;voting.  <p>2. Existing&nbsp;Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: $10,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: You have completed 1 or more&nbsp;grants.  Benefits: Same as above. Receive promotion via Newsletter, Twitter, and other channels. Receive support during&nbsp;voting.  <p>3. Experienced Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: $20,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: You have completed 2 or more&nbsp;grants.  <p>Above are the Funding Tiers accessible by projects in OceanDAO. The amount requested is in USD; the amount paid is in OCEAN token. The conversion rate is the market price when the voting period&nbsp;ends.</p><p>Earmarks</p><p>“Earmarks” means that there are funds available exclusively to the first three groups listed below, without having to compete. For example, New Teams (Outreach) have 12,000 OCEAN available without having to compete against other projects. Beyond that amount, they have to&nbsp;compete.</p>  15,000 OCEAN for New Teams (non-outreach category)  9,000 OCEAN for New Teams (outreach category)  35,000 OCEAN for 2nd/3rd Time&nbsp;Teams  26,000 OCEAN for Core Tech Initiatives (listed&nbsp;below)  115,000 OCEAN for remaining General&nbsp;Grants  <p>A total of 200k OCEAN is available.</p><p>Core Tech Earmark &amp; Initiatives</p><p>If you are interested in contributing to Ocean Protocol there are earmarked Core Tech Initiatives that are being continuously expanded upon. You can <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Proposal-Ideas#4-build--improve-core-ocean-software-core-tech-initiatives-earmark">view them inside our&nbsp;wiki</a>.</p><p>You can find us in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/908016816029319178">Core-Tech Working Group discord&nbsp;channel</a>.</p> New Features&nbsp;include: <p>Quadratic Funding</p><p>In Round 17, we ship Quadratic Funding, for a more even distribution!</p><p>This means that instead of projects receiving a binary grant (either 100% or 0% of what you asked for), all proposals will receive grant amounts relative to how much engagement they received, while still abiding by other rules such as Earmarks and Funding Ceilings.</p><p>Projects can set a minimum they are willing to accept, and return the funds if they are insufficient.</p><p>Minimum USD&nbsp;Funding</p><p>Min USD Funding has been pre-live in Round 16, going officially live in Round&nbsp;17.</p><p>By defining a significantly lower amount that you would accept as minimum funding, you increase the probability of you getting funded with (some) $OCEAN significantly.</p><p>$20k Ceiling</p><p>From Round 17 on, there will be a general ceiling for funds requested for a proposal, allowing more projects to be (re-)funded.</p><p>New Earmark 2nd/3rd Time&nbsp;Entrants</p><p>In Round 17, we introduce a new earmark, basically shielding young projects for the 2nd and 3rd time proposal, to be able to compete with our big, established projects with an already established follower base a little better, until they created their own relevant audience!</p><p>Voting Boosts</p><p>Quadratic Voting is live since Round&nbsp;14.</p><p>You can now visit the <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/web3Tools">Web3 Portal</a>, register yourself with BrightID and receive a 400% voting&nbsp;boost.</p><p>Voter Delegation</p><p>In Round 15, we have introduced <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/delegate">Voter Delegation</a> to our grants&nbsp;program.</p><p>Participants will be able delegate decision making, and easily assign their voting power to other addresses.</p><p>You can <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceandao-voting-improvements-qv-delegation-multi-chain-c393afc7f5e6">learn more about Voter Delegation and other voting improvements in our latest blog post</a>. We look forward to having more votes unlocked inside OceanDAO, and contributors acting as delegates while stewarding positive outcomes in the ecosystem.</p><p>Burning becomes Recycling</p><p>Starting Round 13, any funds remaining inside an Earmark will be recycled into General Grants rather than burned. If there are any funds available at the end, they will be moved back into the Treasury.</p><p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-voting-in-oceandao-8f7e07d40e9d">For intuition on how burning relates to voting in OceanDAO</a>.</p><p>You can find all the steps&nbsp;below:</p>  [Earmarked Grants] winners are counted&nbsp;first.  Projects that do not win an [Earmarked Grant] are then considered for funding under the [General Grant] category.  Any remaining funds inside an Earmark, are then moved towards [General&nbsp;Grants]  [New &amp; Core Tech] teams are thus eligible to be funded from both [Grant Categories].  Returning teams are eligible to be funded from [General&nbsp;Grants].  50% or more “Yes” Votes receive a&nbsp;grant.  Any remaining funds inside the [General Grants] Category are moved back to the treasury.  <p>Working Groups</p><p>Head to the <a href="https://discord.gg/TnXjkR5">Ocean Discord</a> and dive into each Working Group.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Andrea Beskers</a></p><p>Web and the metaverse is a trendy topic, so it is even nicer to enjoy a more nuanced view of the subject. An optimistic but still realistic sneek peak of our digital future. Katryna Dow from Meeco will elaborate on the challenges of Web3 in her Keynote <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5138">The Omniverse SWOT</a> on Thursday, May 12, at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2022">European Identity and Cloud Conference 2022</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a preview of what to expect, we asked Katryna some questions about her presentation.</p>
<p> </p>
 What is the Omniverse and why the title? 
<p>To be honest, I was trying to avoid the word metaverse. And also because I think this new paradigm that we're moving into, it's not like we're going to leave the physical world or our surroundings behind and only move to the digital, I think what it is, we're starting to see the fusion of both. And so what I was trying to do is capture the idea of everyone's talking about the metaverse, but actually it is more than that. It's this connection between the physical and the digital.</p>
<p></p>
 Why do you think Web3 is going to be so different from where we are now? 
<p>Why was Web2 different from Web1? Why was the pre-Internet different from Internet? Why were fire and wheel different from, you know, fire and wheel? And I think what we're looking at is an evolutionary process. And if you're born into a web3 world or you're growing up in a web3 world, it's normal, right? But for those of us that are moving from one paradigm to another, we want to hold on to the things that we were used to, the things that worked, we're challenged by the new. And I think we're on the cusp of another evolution. And it will probably be in hindsight that we will say, okay, they were the major differences. But I think it'll be the new capabilities that we probably can't even imagine right now that over the next decade will just be mainstream.</p>
<p></p>
 You often talk about this fusing of the physical and digital, and you describe a more immersive world - what impact does that have on identity and security? 
<p>I think the immersive part is really what we've got to get our heads around. And I think if you want to understand who's doing this really well, is kids in the gaming worlds. You know, whether or not that's headsets or something in their ear or their whole sort of being in the game or playing with somebody that they, you know, may not ever know who they are in the physical world. And so what does that mean? Well, that means there are issues of trust that means there are issues of safety. That means there are issues of, you know, is this a person or a bot? Is this secure? But that generation right now that are growing up in this immersive world that is already every day in a virtual world, in a gaming world, in making connections where there is a sort of proxy for trust, there's lots of great things about that, breaks down many barriers. But as we know, coming from having been trying to build that trust from an enterprise point of view around privacy and security as the perimeter in enterprise has been expanding. Now, imagine wrapping that around your home and wrapping that around your wearables imagine wrapping that around yourself. And imagine technology from a medical point of view starts to move inside the body. So that perimeter is really hard to see. Where that perimeter even is in the future is becoming immersive. It's becoming blurred and with that blurring, we're going to have a whole range of new challenges from an identity point of view, a trust point of view, and really importantly, from a security point of view.</p>
<p></p>
 Is privacy still achievable in such a world? 
<p>Look, I want to think so, but I'm being pragmatic and realistic. I think as we move into this combination of physical and digital and even if that is done in a very respectful and trusted way, for us to have an open digital world, a digital economy, a trusted digital space, probably the ability to be completely separate and completely private is going to become more of a challenge. However, I am concerned that privacy may be something that will be only available to people with the means. They may be the financial means or the means to control. So I have hope, but I also see that it's going to be hard though. However, I think as these concerns around privacy are mounting, I think the opportunity to win the trust battle. So if we do lose ground on privacy, I think the opportunity to win ground in terms of trust and transparency and agency is probably going to be the biggest enablers of that. And then as a result of that, it may help to underpin what we want to achieve from a privacy rights point of view.</p>
<p></p>
 You mentioned the next wave of identity and security innovation - why would someone come to this session? 
<p>I think it's all of the things we've just talked about over the last 15 years. EIC has been the place where these challenges around identity, enterprise identity, the move to the cloud, the embracing of AI the move to distributed, blockchain. Each time we've had these evolutions, it's raised a whole range of new opportunities, threats, of weaknesses, and so we've worked through that over the last decade and a half, each time these new technologies have emerged. How do you apply them? And I think the reason I would hope people would enjoy this session and why is that we look to Web3, we look to the Omniverse, we look to this environment without perimeters. And what we have to build in is security and trust. And that is going to provide a whole range of new opportunities and some new threats, which means there'll be the chance to solve problems in new ways. And I hope this helps to spark that conversation.</p>

<p>For 44 million Americans, the weight of unyielding student loan debt is a major cause of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/select/how-to-cope-with-stress-of-student-loans/">stress and anxiety</a>, a barrier to homeownership and can be a lifelong impediment to building wealth. Nationwide, the total student debt level stands at a staggering <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/17/student-debt-is-a-main-obstacle-for-millennials-wanting-to-buy-a-house.html">$1.7 trillion</a>. Managing that debt has proven to be complicated and inefficient for borrowers and lenders alike.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Access to consumer-permissioned student loan data presents a unique opportunity. Innovators can step in and create apps and build better services that leverage student loan data through Finicity’s open banking platform, to help consumers with student loan debt.</p>
 Introducing Normalized Student Loan Data 
<p>For fintech innovators, lenders, refinancers, employers and institutions of higher education, working with student loan data has been challenging. Until now, the data hasn’t been normalized. Higher learning institutions have used different naming conventions for data fields, making documentation harder to read, compare or translate. Lenders and servicers have to navigate a forest of screenshots, phone calls with lengthy hold times and unsecure paper documents in their efforts to verify loan information.</p>
<p>These time-consuming manual processes incur labor costs to lenders and servicers. This can cause stress, revenue loss, time loss and negatively impact the lender’s operational efficiency.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finicity has normalized the data across data fields, vocabulary, naming conventions and applications of rules, resulting in a modernized ecosystem for all stakeholders through its open banking platform. This significantly reduces the time to market for your student loan solutions.</p>
 Innovation Platform Using Student Loan Data 
<p>Student loan data doesn’t have to be confusing or complicated. With Finicity open banking, an optimized API call can help reduce costs, and is delivered in a formation that doesn’t require additional coding. Our API endpoint can yield the complete loan details, and the full payment details of a student loan account, including up to 24 months of transaction history.</p>
<p></p>
 Data Coverage&nbsp; 
 
 Normalized, comprehensive data covering most student loan accounts. It’s delivered through our open banking platform, with connections to student loan accounts that include federal Direct Loans, FFEL &amp; Perkins, and some of the largest private lenders and servicers (e.g. Navient, Nelnet, Aidvantage, Sallie Mae, Discover, Firstmark, Commonbond, LendKey, etc). 
 
 Quality of Data 
 
 Extensive Loan Account Details:&nbsp; An API call to the Fincity open banking platform can yield a primary account, transactions by account, loan payment details, statements, account owner and much more. Data is aggregated at the three largest levels of the student loan hierarchy; student loan, student loan group and student loan account, while also being able to provide customer &amp; institution-level details. 
 Transaction lookback period has been extended to more accurately capture transaction additions or changes. Up to twenty-four months of transactions can be offered in one API call for an extended view of account history. 
 Complementary data insight solutions with analytics of a borrower’s credits, debits and balances to deliver smarter credit decisioning. 
 Reliable Uptime Data Monitoring: Multi-tier data integrity and student loan-specific data monitoring. 
 
 Create Winning Borrower Experiences 
<p>Innovators can quickly develop and scale new and improved financial services with Finicity’s open banking platform. Student loans are the second-largest debt sector in the United States. There is a massive opportunity to develop new apps and services to help individuals with student loan debt. Through partnering with our clients, Finicity’s open banking platform is powering solutions to help the 44 million Americans who carry student loan balances.&nbsp;</p>
 Some of the ways innovators can upgrade the borrower experience, using permissioned student loan data: 
 
 Create frictionless onboarding and account setup for borrowers to apply for loans, set up accounts, manage repayment and distribute funding to students. 
 Better data for better credit decisioning. It’s pretty simple. Student loan borrowers want a better experience. Lenders want the most accurate and real-time data for better credit decisioning. So we’ve combined the best data with smart insights to transform the lending experience. 
 Finicity data powers leading personal finance management (PFM) apps. These tools allow borrowers to view, monitor and manage their debt in near real time by pulling smart, categorized and permissioned loan data into the app. If borrowers can easily understand their financial position and repayment options, they may reduce stress and more effectively manage their debt.&nbsp; 
 Attracting and retaining the best talent in today’s job market is a challenge for any company. Leveraging permissioned student loan data, some employers are creating benefits like 401k accounts that match student loan payments and direct matching of student loan payments back to the student loan. 
 By using the account details endpoint, it’s possible to verify that a student is enrolled in at least half-time coursework by the National Student Loan Data System. Using this data, a rich field of possibility opens up for student-specific benefits. Discounts, rewards and loyalty programs can be built specifically for current students. 
 Even the more administrative aspects of student loans can be modernized by open banking technology. Student borrowers can be offered the ability to easily and securely apply for federal programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness or an Income-Driven Repayment plan. No wading through W2s, paystubs and long, frustrating calls to student loan servicers. Quick and secure. 
 
 Step Into the Future 
<p>Break out of the spider web of paper documents, screenshots, phone calls and mismatched data. Replace countless lost hours of productivity with optimized API calls that offer the comprehensive, relevant, normalized data to build solutions on.</p>
<p>Innovate with us to create knowledge-based services that empower students, so they can manage, consolidate, refinance and repay their obligations with the level of transparency that they deserve.&nbsp;</p>

   What is DevOps? 

<p>DevOps is one of those buzzwords. Ask three DevOps professionals what it means, and you might get four different answers. Most will agree that DevOps usually describes a mix of tools and techniques combining aspects of systems administration, software development, IT, release engineering, security, and often QA. At its best, DevOps synergizes the strengths of these fields to reduce toil through automation and improve software quality through continuous testing and deployment, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code">infrastructure as code</a>. At its worst, DevOps is used as an excuse to ask a single under-resourced team to do the work of several groups, in an ever-increasing spiral of tech debt. Most DevOps roles fall somewhere on the spectrum between these extremes.</p>

<p>While many tech professionals know Okta and its competitors as the way they access their corporate email and chat, there are actually four main areas where Okta’s product family interfaces with the DevOps skillset.</p>

 Accessing SaaS services and tooling 

<p>In 2022, it’s vanishingly rare for a tech company to host every software product that they use on-premises. Although there are open or <a href="https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted">self-hosted versions</a> of every major tool in the modern workflow, maintaining separate services gets prohibitively expensive. Instead of hosting physical servers, most organizations rent cloud resources. Instead of running email (<a href="https://list.org/">Mailman</a>), chat (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1459">IRC</a>, <a href="https://xmpp.org/about/technology-overview/">XMPP</a>), user account management (<a href="https://ldap.com/">LDAP</a>), and more in-house, companies instead rent services providing these features from specialist providers.</p>

<p>Before the pattern of using a central identity provider and protocols like OAuth became commonplace, users would have to manage a separate login and password to every software-as-a-service vendor that their company used. This created security and administrative headaches for everyone involved. But thanks to widespread adoption of the underlying protocols, a company can now use a single identity provider like Okta to allow everyone in the organization to access all of the software that it buys for them.</p>

<p>As well as the obvious workplace services like Slack and email, DevOps engineers might use their Okta accounts to sign in to cloud service providers like <a href="https://www.okta.com/aws/">AWS</a>, <a href="https://www.okta.com/%20partners/google/">GCP</a>, or <a href="https://www.okta.com/integrations/azure-portal-login/#overview">Azure</a>.</p>

<p>In a CI/CD pipeline, one might use Okta to log in to <a href="https://www.okta.com/integrations/jenkins/#overview">Jenkins</a>, <a href="https://docs.armory.io/armory-enterprise/armory-admin/auth-okta-configure/">Spinnaker</a>, or even <a href="https://www.okta.com/integrations/circleci/#overview">CircleCI</a>. If an organization uses <a href="https://saml-doc.okta.com/Provisioning_Docs/GitHub_Enterprise_Provisioning.html">GitHub Enterprise</a>, DevOps personnel can use Okta to sign in there too. Okta can even help ensure that the right people can update infrastructure code by managing access to <a href="https://www.okta.com/integrations/docker-hub/#overview">Docker Hub</a> or <a href="https://www.okta.com/integrations/terraform-cloud/#overview">Terraform Cloud</a>!</p>

 Automating Okta administration tasks 
<p>Just as sysadmins and IT managed identity for small to medium organizations in the olden days, DevOps engineers may be responsible for some administrative tasks in their company’s Okta instance.</p>

<p>Software and infrastructure administration and management tasks can be automated using a plethora of tools, including HashiCorp’s Terraform. Terraform allows users to describe the desired state of their resources, and then changes the resources to match that description.  Using <a href="https://github.com/okta/terraform-provider-okta">Okta’s Terraform provider</a>, users can manage their Okta resources and track their changes with version control. This is particularly useful for those whose business needs have them managing many different Okta accounts and trying to keep the settings consistent across all of them.</p>

 Managing server access 

<p>Modern code and infrastructure best practices recommend architecting systems to require minimal human access and intervention. But production-readiness is always a balancing act between aspirations and real-world limitations, and many successful codebases were architected before modern tooling made these hands-off design patterns feasible. Updating production code and infrastructure is often likened to repairing a jet engine while in flight: it has to keep working after every change that you make. When logging into servers is an important part of existing workflows, streamlining that process can be an essential step toward moving past the need to fix things by hand at all.</p>

<p>One way to improve the security and user experience of SSHing or RDPing to servers is to stop asking users to manage their own keys, and stop asking servers to keep track of who’s allowed to access them. In an organization whose identity provider already tracks which team members should have infrastructure access, <a href="https://www.okta.com/demo/okta-advanced-server-access/">Okta’s ASA</a> (formerly ScaleFT) provides a great way to reduce the value of SSH and RDP credentials by making them ephemeral.</p>

<p>Additionally, Okta is working on <a href="https://www.okta.com/press-room/press-releases/okta-introduces-new-okta-privileged-access-product-to-strengthen-security/">more new products</a> for privileged access management, which will be interesting in the DevOps use case.</p>

 Introspecting Okta 

<p>When DevOps refers to a catch-all role focused on the care and feeding of infrastructure, monitoring and alerting fall under its purview.</p>

<p>So far, we’ve talked about information flowing from Okta to your software and services, answering questions like “is this login request legitimate?” Automating Okta administration tasks with Terraform pushes configuration from the user to Okta. There’s one more direction that information can move relative to your identity provider, however: a stream of metadata about what the identity provider is doing can flow out of the provider and into your monitoring and alerting tools.</p>

<p>Okta supports a variety of <a href="https://support.okta.com/help/s/article/Exporting-Okta-Log-Data">integrations</a> for monitoring its various moving parts. For instance, integrations can be set up to exfiltrate Okta logs to <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/okta/">DataDog</a>, <a href="https://www.okta.com/integrations/splunk-add-on-for-okta/">Splunk</a>, or <a href="https://www.okta.com/integrations/sumologic/">SumoLogic</a>. These solutions can combine information about your Okta account with information from your other systems in ways limited only by your imagination: Would you like to get an alert when a user who has recently changed their password accesses a particular resource? How about if the total login failures involving a particular account, across Okta and your other systems, exceed a particular threshold? Would postmortems be easier if every user action logged by Okta showed up alongside the other data in your favorite monitoring tool?</p>

 In Conclusion 

<p>Although the field itself is ambiguously defined, DevOps tools and practices constantly interface with identity. DevOps done right ensures that the people can access the resources they should, and not the ones they shouldn’t. DevOps practitioners can use Okta to control identity-related behavior of their infrastructure through its many integrations, and can in turn customize and manage their Okta instances by using Terraform and Okta’s metrics and monitoring APIs.</p>

<p>If you work in DevOps, you can’t escape the responsibility of managing identity as it relates to your infrastructure. But you can choose how to manage it: Will your organization support you in delegating these tasks to specialists? Do you have a use case where it’s better to attempt to reinvent these wheels yourself?</p>

<p>A few weeks ago a developer named <a href="https://github.com/felri">Felipe</a> joined the <a href="https://discord.gg/GsSxDvq9wW">DEV.HC Discord</a>, where devs get together to mentor each other and build hApps. I was amazed when, in the course of just one week, he managed to put together a proof-of-concept for a peer-to-peer video chat hApp!</p><p>He’s calling it Doom (no, not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)">that</a> Doom, but ‘decentralised Zoom’), and you can check out the source code at the <a href="https://github.com/felri/doom">felri/doom GitHub repository</a>.</p><p>Doom mashes together two peer-to-peer technologies. Holochain handles the ‘signalling’, or the ‘making the connection’ part. If Doom were the phone system, signalling would involve me pulling a phone book off my wall, looking your number up, dialing your number, and letting the phone network connect my phone to yours. But while the phone network is largely centralised, Holochain is <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/its-aliiiiiive/#elemental-chat-on-holoports-passing-real-world-tests-with-flying-colours">almost</a> entirely P2P.</p><p>The other P2P component is called <a href="https://webrtc.org/">WebRTC</a>, and your computer already supports it — it’s built right into your browser. So once Holochain handles signalling and makes the introduction between my computer and yours, our web browsers take over and stream our video directly to each other.</p><blockquote>What really excited me is that he put this together in only four evenings’ worth of work!</blockquote><p>It is just a proof-of-concept, and will likely take more work to develop into a production-level product if Felipe chooses to do that. But this story opened my eyes to how quickly a developer can put together a fully P2P application with Holochain.</p><p>Here’s Felipe’s feedback on the development process:</p><blockquote>80% of the time was in the frontend, the holochain part was pretty easy with a bunch of examples you guys sent me<br><br>everything took 4 nights of work<br><br>yeah, holochain is absurdly easy to play</blockquote><p>And finally, here’s a demo video showing Felipe meeting with himself over a local network :)</p>

				  Valuable benefit packages offered for free to deliver training, technical, and business support to drive Node Operator success.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Sumiran Agarwal</p>
<p>The companies that run nodes on the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-mainnet/">Indicio Network</a> are the tip of the spear in decentralized identity innovation: They support a decentralized network on five continents that delivers the performance and reliability needed for enterprise grade products and services. This is open-source collaboration at its best.</p>
<p>But what do the companies get for their service?</p>
<p>One view is that the end result is the reward. We all will, ultimately, benefit from the technology, so we should all contribute to advancing the technology. While most companies in the decentralized identity space are values driven, time and effort are required to host and maintain a copy of the ledger. Looking at doing this as a civic or purely altruistic gesture didn’t strike us as the right model for building a service that mission-critical transactions depend on.</p>
<p>Indicio’s mission is to advance decentralized identity technologies, and if we were going to create and inspire a community to do this through creating and running a decentralized identity network, we had to encourage and reward the work done by Node Operators with tangible, valuable benefits.</p>
<p>Thus began our Node Operator Benefit program 1.0, which began the learning exercise to determine what these benefits might be, and which was followed by 2.0, which advanced co-marketing activities and engagement with our node operators through better communication.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, as the Indicio Network has grown to 28 Node Operators, we’re announcing a substantial upgrade.</p>
<p>Node Operator Community Program 3.0 adds five benefit packages that each provide education, technical, and business development support to meet the needs of a growing business. Each Node Operator, after three months of hosting a node, can take one free package per year. The monetary value of each package ranges from $2,000 to $4,000.</p>
<p>Package 1: Introductory Training</p>
<p>Indicio has emerged as the leading provider of <a href="https://indicio.tech/training-workshops/">education and training</a> in decentralized identity technologies, with hands-on workshops to companies and to the wider community through the Hyperledger Foundation.</p>
<p>The Introductory Training Package provides two, 4-hour sessions on the basics of digital identity for groups of up to five people. It is an ideal option for companies, teams, and organizations that are only becoming familiar with decentralized identity, and want to understand the fundamental technologies powering it.</p>
<p>Package 2: Advanced Training</p>
<p>This package provides groups up to five people with two, 4-hour training sessions. The first covers the basics of digital identity and the second covers advanced decentralized identity technologies, such as Transaction Endorsement, DIDComm, DID:Indy methods.</p>
<p>Package 3: Architectural and Technical Exploration</p>
<p>This package is ideal for companies that need technical and/or architectural guidance to convert their business ideas into deliverable projects. Indicio’s senior staff will provide personal architectural and technical guidance based on the business needs of the Node Operator over two, 1-hour sessions supplemented with four hours of offline work by Indicio.</p>
<p>Package 4: Business Consulting&nbsp;</p>
<p>This package is ideal for companies who are just starting out in this space or have new ideas and need a sounding board with industry experts. It consists of quarterly&nbsp; one-hour business consulting sessions (four sessions per year) based on market deployments and trends. It will focus on navigating the complexities in building a successful use case and eventually a business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Package 5: Technical Support</p>
<p>This consists of ten hours of advanced technical guidance from Indicio’s senior staff. This is an ideal option for organizations that may require support as it works through a blocker or embarks on an update or the addition of an advanced feature.</p>
<p>Indicio has made advancing decentralized identity a core part of its Public Benefit Mission, and we believe that the way to do this is to nurture community success. We all benefit when our Node Operators succeed—and we will continue to identify and innovate ways to drive their, and our, collective success.</p>

 Computers that intuitively understand and respond to your body language? The idea is pretty out there but it’s not new. You might have heard it called ubiquitous or ambient computing. 



<p></p>



<p>This functionality means a device would read the user’s body language to pick up&nbsp;intent, and then respond accordingly, just as a human would with another human. Good&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90725730/google-is-designing-computers-that-respect-your-personal-space">examples</a>&nbsp;are your device automatically pausing the movie you’re watching when you leave the couch, or bringing up your emails for you as you come near. Spooky, right?&nbsp;</p>



<p>It might come as no surprise then that the company leading the charge in ubiquitous or ambient computing is the all-seeing, all-knowing Google. Who else?</p>



 Google is&nbsp;using the science of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/proxemics">proxemics</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;understand personal space and how humans respect and interact within in it, and advancing its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3046876/control-your-next-smartwatch-with-a-wave-of-your-hand?_ga=2.36264416.1779289167.1645818431-546908249.1637247784">Soli radar sensor</a>&nbsp;which we’ve seen in Nest Hub for sleep tracking, for example. The goal is to interact with our devices without touching them.&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>According to an article in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90725730/google-is-designing-computers-that-respect-your-personal-space">Fast Company</a>, “Soli sees your body as nothing more than a blob. But through the right lens, this blob has inertia, posture, and a gaze—all of the things we constantly size up when we interact with other people.”</p>



<p>Leonardo Giusti, Head of Design at Google’s Advanced Technology &amp; Projects (ATAP) Lab says,&nbsp;“As this technology gets more present in our life, it’s fair to ask tech to take a few more cues from us,” says Giusti. “The same way a partner would tell you to grab an umbrella on the way out [the door on a rainy day], a thermostat by the door could do the same thing.”</p>



<p>We find the idea of computers reading body language intriguing and have no doubt it will come to fruition. But we also find the idea that Google is designing computers that respect&nbsp;personal space&nbsp;highly amusing when we all know the tech giant doesn’t even respect&nbsp;personal data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As privacy commentator Techni-Calli&nbsp;(@Iwillleavenow)&nbsp;said on Twitter: “Google is designing computers that respect* your personal space”</p>



<p>*by completely invading your personal space, obliterating your privacy, and tracking your every move.</p>



<p>As the old saying goes, what will they think of next?</p>



<p>If the tech fascinates you, read&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90725730/google-is-designing-computers-that-respect-your-personal-space">this</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3046876/control-your-next-smartwatch-with-a-wave-of-your-hand?_ga=2.36264416.1779289167.1645818431-546908249.1637247784">this</a>&nbsp;from Fast Company.</p>

<p>Web3Auth is excited to present a fruitful collaboration with StarkWare which coincides with the announcement of The Auth Network, a permissionless key management infrastructure that powers Web3Auth’s plug and play SDK that provides self-custodial social logins to dApps and&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>StarkNet, a STARK-powered L2 ZK-Rollup, enables applications to achieve unlimited scale for their computation, without compromising Ethereum’s composability and security.</p> Why are we&nbsp;excited? <blockquote>“Collaborating with StarkWare is a natural extension of our vision to quickly onboard the next billion into Web3. Any developer building on StarkNet can now easily onboard users into their wallet or dApp in the most intuitive way possible in just under a few&nbsp;seconds”</blockquote><blockquote>— Zhen, co-founder of&nbsp;Web3Auth</blockquote><blockquote>“We are excited to see another important piece of our ecosystem’s infrastructure being developed. Our collaboration with Web3Auth’s Key Management Infrastructure further strengthens our foundational infrastructure for StarkNet and StarkEx to onboard the next wave of users into&nbsp;crypto”</blockquote><blockquote>— Uri Kolodny, co-founder of StarkWare</blockquote> How Web3Auth helps builders on StartkNet and&nbsp;StarkEx? <p>Web3Auth is an open-source non-custodial Auth SDK that couples Passwordless Social Logins with non-custodial MPC key management. Developers can now integrate the SDK to any dApp/wallet on StarkNet and StarkEx with a few lines of code and provide a login experience that both mainstream users and crypto native users are already familiar with. Users can log in to dApps through emails, linked OAuth via Google, Twitter, Discord, and Reddit, or with a wallet of their choice, be it such as Metamask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, or the many others, without worrying about cumbersome seed&nbsp;phrases.</p> What’s in it for&nbsp;users? <p>The SDK, powered by The Auth Network, uses MPC, TSS, and threshold cryptography to manage a user’s key securely. It enables users to split their keys into multiple factors. It then secures these factors with different access points available to users, such as their social login, device, and social&nbsp;network.</p><p>This immediately improves on the existing key management standard (i.e., “seed phrases”). The user moves away from the risk of losing the key because even losing a single factor won’t compromise the entire key and factors stay revocable.</p> Get started&nbsp;now   Head over to<a href="https://docs.web3auth.io/guides/openlogin-starkkey"> Web3Auth + StarkNet integration guide</a> for a detailed How-to tutorial.

About Starkware <p>StarkWare invented, and continually develops, STARK-based Layer-2 Validity Proof scaling solutions over Ethereum. StarkWare’s solutions, which rely on Ethereum’s security, have settled over $500B, and over 150M transactions, serving hundreds of thousands of users. StarkNet, StarkWare’s permissionless general-purpose scaling solution, is live (Alpha) on Ethereum Mainnet. StarkEx, a custom standalone scaling service, has been powering applications since June 2020, including dYdX, Immutable X, Sorare, and DeversiFi.</p> About Web3Auth <p>Web3Auth is the simplest and most secure auth infrastructure for Web3 apps and wallets. By aggregating OAuth (Google, Twitter, Discord) logins, different wallets, and existing key management solutions, Web3Auth provides a familiar login experience to every user on dApp and&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>Web3Auth is powered by the Auth Network, an open-source, non-custodial, distributed key management network maintained by the Auth Foundation.</p><p><a href="http://web3auth.io">Website</a> | <a href="https://docs.web3auth.io/">Docs</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/web3auth">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://t.me/web3authdev">Telegram</a> | <a href="http://discord.gg/web3auth">Discord</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/web3auth">Linkedin</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/starkware-and-web3auth-collaborate-to-eliminate-seed-phrases-for-starknet-wallets-dapps-ee06bdd01275">StarkWare and Web3Auth collaborate to eliminate seed phrases for StarkNet wallets &amp; dApps</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Instead, the focus was on measuring the effectiveness of digital identity proofing.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2022/pr22030.html">Fincen and the FDIC</a>, digital identity proofing is defined as “the process used to collect, validate, and verify information about a&nbsp;person.”</p><p>Here’s how they <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/fditech/techsprints/measuring-effectiveness.html">described the purpose of the&nbsp;sprint</a>:</p><blockquote>Digital identity proofing is a foundational element to enable digital financial services to function properly. This element is challenged by the proliferation of compromised personally identifiable information (PII), the increasing use of synthetic identities, and the presence of multiple, varied approaches to identity proofing. Simultaneously, technological developments are enabling dynamic identity evidence such as state mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs) or other identity credentials that are frequently updatable and interoperable, as well as behavioral analytics.</blockquote><blockquote>After three weeks of brainstorming and meeting with FDIC and FinCEN, eight participating teams developed solutions addressing the problem statement:</blockquote><blockquote>“What is a scalable, cost-efficient, risk-based solution to measure the effectiveness of digital identity proofing to ensure that individuals who remotely (i.e., not in person) present themselves for financial activities are who they claim to&nbsp;be?”</blockquote><p>In short, the U.S. government wanted to know how to compare one solution, process, or program to another. For example, if we were to compare the sign-up process for Coinbase and Bank of America, we needed to determine which onboarding flow was “better.”</p> Our approach <p>Everyone on team ConfIDence Labs had unique views on the subject, naturally bringing learnings from their own company’s approaches. We decided that we needed an objective scoring criteria that reflected adherence to principles of identity assurance levels such as the ones <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63a.html">spelled out by NIST</a> and risk scoring tactics such as the one <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/identity-proofing-and-verification-of-an-individual">suggested by the UK government</a>.</p><p>Additionally, we wanted to bring to light other attributes of identity proofing that we felt were just as important — inclusion, compliance, adoptability, and, of course, security.</p><p>The end result was a worksheet — not unlike the one required for assessing SOC2 compliance — where each of the above 5 rubrics are scored independently and objectively.</p>An example of an assessment based on our proposed scoring&nbsp;rubrics<p>Of our proposed scoring rubrics, Assurance was the most fleshed out. We envisioned a scoring mechanism that would reward cross-referencing verifications of each attribute of a user’s profile. In other words, there is higher assurance in someone’s identity if multiple sources of evidence were used to verify the same information — such as a customer’s name, email, or government ID.</p><p>Taking all of this one step further, we pitched a sandbox environment where financial institutions could offer their identity proofing programs for objective evaluation using our scoring framework. Not only that, they would be able to mix and match different third-party verification service providers to get to a better score. You could imagine a future where multiple service providers compete based on their evaluation scores.</p>Our proposed sandbox environment<p>For our efforts, three awards were given across three categories — Creativity, Effectiveness / Impact, Market Readiness.</p><p>For the Creativity category, which Team ConfIDence Labs (my team) <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2022/pr22030.html">ultimately won</a>, the U.S. government provided the following requirements:</p>  How substantively new or different is the Tech Sprint Team’s approach from those currently considered in the marketplace?  To what degree does the approach introduce a potential paradigm shift in how financial institutions and regulators can measure the effectiveness of digital identity proofing?  Does the approach present an innovative way of encouraging small to midsize financial institutions to deploy or more effectively deploy digital identity proofing technologies?   Final thoughts <p>First, I’d like to thank all of my teammates. It was a pleasure learning from them and working together toward the common goal of improving digital identity&nbsp;systems.</p><p>As a team, we also applaud FinCEN and the FDIC for these continued engagement efforts with the industry. The purpose of this latest digital identity tech sprint was to get the conversation started, seed new ideas, and nudge us toward industry cooperation.</p><p>Mission accomplished, I’d&nbsp;say.</p><p>Martin Henning, FDIC’s Deputy Director Operational Risk, <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2022/pr22030.html">echoed these sentiments</a>:</p><blockquote>“We brought together a diverse collection of innovative and energetic minds to think deeply about how we can ensure bank customers are who they claim to be in our increasingly digital age. Helping financial institutions to stop identity fraud will help us to continue to have confidence in the safety and soundness of our banks and the integrity of the U.S. banking&nbsp;system.”</blockquote><blockquote>“We are grateful for the partnership of the FDIC and the participation of all the Tech Sprint teams. It is critical that financial institutions have reliable ways to identify their customers, particularly in our increasingly digital world,” said Him Das, the Acting Director of FinCEN. “Identity is a fundamental cornerstone of financial integrity, and identity proofing is precisely the type of complex issue that benefits from public–private collaborations like this Tech&nbsp;Sprint.”</blockquote><p>We look forward to the next&nbsp;one!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/how-my-team-won-fincen-fdics-digital-identity-tech-sprint-3af744b818a5">How my team won FinCEN/FDIC’s Digital Identity Tech Sprint</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 We’re Live: Veriscope Launches on Mainnet with Binance, Bitfinex, Tether, Huobi, Moonpay, Deribit, Gate.io and&nbsp;more  Veriscope, our decentralized, open-sourced Travel Rule solution, goes live on the Shyft Network mainnet with a unique ability to solve the “Sunrise&nbsp;Issue”. <p>After many months of testing, we’re proud to announce today the launch of Veriscope on the Shyft Network&nbsp;Mainnet.</p><p>Veriscope, a fully decentralized, open-source tool that offers crypto exchanges a comprehensive solution to the so-called “Sunrise Issue” — addressing what has until now been a vexing, unsolvable challenge for crypto exchanges as they come into compliance with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Anti-money laundering (AML) Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>The “Sunrise Issue” arose in recent years as crypto exchanges across the globe began work to adopt the Travel Rule at different times, resulting in some exchanges coming into compliance with the requirement at different times than their counterparties. The Travel Rule requirements can only be met if all (both) counterparties are in compliance. Regulators have demanded a solution to the&nbsp;issue,</p><blockquote>“The ‘Sunrise Issue’ is a complex problem, and only Veriscope has been able to solve it,” said Malcolm Wright, Head of Veriscope. “Governments are deeply concerned about crypto’s use in illicit finance, and sanctions evasion in particular — as they should be — and with Veriscope, we are able to offer an efficient, elegant compliance solution for the entire industry.”</blockquote><p>The industry acclaimed feature comes as major exchanges and liquidity providers including Binance, Deribit, Nexo, Tether, Huobi, Moonpay, Gate.io, Bitfinex, Local Bitcoins, GSR, Galaxy Digital, Coinshares, Coinhako, BTSE Nogle, and more adopt Veriscope as their Travel Rule solution.</p><p>The FATF Travel Rule requires collection and exchange of customer details to adhere to international rules against money laundering, sanctions evasion and other malicious activities.</p><p>Veriscope enables Travel Rule compliance while protecting customer data through a peer-to-peer data connection that does not store any personally identifiable information (PII), uses encrypted communication, and is the only solution to provide for user consent for data sharing and storage to comply with GDPR regulations.</p><p><a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/8-reasons-to-choose-veriscope-cryptos-most-frictionless-secure-travel-rule-solution-d714b8056d08">Read: 8 Reasons to Choose Veriscope, Crypto’s Most Frictionless &amp; Secure Travel Rule&nbsp;Solution</a></p><p>The launch of Veriscope, and with it the solution to the “sunrise problem”, includes an all-star list of leading industry names concluding that Veriscope met their regulatory needs for Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><blockquote>“Veriscope is already scaling globally as more and more exchanges understand the comprehensive benefits of the tool,” said Joseph Weinberg, co-founder of Shyft Network and veteran of crypto security and regulatory solutions. “The tool takes a unique, decentralized approach to identifying counterparty exchanges solely from the crypto address. Because we don’t require any additional information from an exchange’s customers, we can rebuild Travel Rule data on historic transactions. The result is that our client is in full compliance with the Travel Rule, and the customer experience is absolutely seamless, with no interruption to transactions, but offering bulletproof assurances of privacy and security of customer&nbsp;data.”</blockquote><p>The entire Shyft Core and Veriscope team would like to thank all of our exchange partners and the global compliance community for supporting Veriscope’s journey to launch over the last year. We believe that together we are stronger and that having the most frictionless and secure access to data and cross-jurisdictional communication is what will help our industry achieve new heights amidst growing regulation.</p><p>This came on the back of our recent partnership announcements with FIS <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/03/02/payments-giant-fis-worldpay-joins-shyfts-crypto-compliance-network/">Worldpay</a> and <a href="https://www.dlapiper.com/cs/czech/news/2022/02/dla-piper-partners-with-shyft-network/">DLA&nbsp;Piper</a>.</p><p>The future is looking bright with Veriscope leading the&nbsp;way.</p><p>Visit our new <a href="https://veriscope.network/">Veriscope website</a> to learn more, and contact us if you are interested in implementing our Travel Rule solution!

<p>InfoCert, la più grande Certification Authority in Europa, è tra le prime aziende private ad essere stata accredita come Service Provider CIE, confermandosi in prima linea nel processo di digitalizzazione del Paese.</p>



<p>Già protagonista in ambito SPID in qualità sia di Identity che di Service Provider privato, grazie all’accreditamento anche come Service Provider CIE, InfoCert offrirà ai propri clienti e partner commerciali un nuovo importante strumento per l’identificazione e l’autenticazione certificata.</p>



 Cos’è la Carta di Identità Elettronica e come funziona? 



<p>La&nbsp;Carta di Identità Elettronica&nbsp;(CIE) è l’evoluzione della carta di identità in versione cartacea ma, a differenza di quest’ultima, consente anche l’accesso ai&nbsp;servizi online delle Pubbliche Amministrazioni&nbsp;abilitate, così come già avviene con SPID.</p>



<p>La CIE può essere utilizzata per identificarsi sia da PC che da smartphone: nel primo caso occorre installare un software dedicato e avere un lettore compatibile, mentre nel secondo caso è sufficiente scaricare l’App “<a href="https://www.cartaidentita.interno.gov.it/cittadini/entra-con-cie/">CIE ID”</a>, disponibile sia per iOS che per Android.</p>



<p>Grazie alla CIE i cittadini hanno a disposizione uno strumento di identificazione fisica e digitale per accedere ai servizi in rete, pubblici e privati, in Italia e in Europa.</p>



<p>Infatti, con la realizzazione del&nbsp;<a href="https://www.agid.gov.it/it/piattaforme/nodo-eidas-italiano">nodo eIDAS italiano</a>&nbsp;si completa il progetto di&nbsp;cittadinanza digitale europea, che permette ai&nbsp;titolari di una CIE&nbsp;di accedere anche ai&nbsp;servizi online di altri Paesi dell’Unione Europea.</p>



<p>È infine importante sapere che per utilizzare la CIE come strumento di identificazione sui portali online, occorre essere in possesso dei codici PIN&nbsp;(la prima metà rilasciata al momento della richiesta e la seconda al momento della consegna del documento). </p>



 Quali benefici per clienti e Partner InfoCert? 



<p>Con l’accreditamento di InfoCert, gli oltre 27,5 milioni di cittadini in possesso di una CIE potranno ora beneficiare di nuovi potenziali casi d’uso. Potranno interagire potenzialmente con tutte le aziende private con cui dialogano quotidianamente quali banche, assicurazioni, operatori telefonici e altre grandi imprese; d’altro canto, le grandi imprese potranno sfruttare questa vantaggiosa opportunità per i propri clienti attraverso due modalità:</p>



  Identificazione: per tutti i casi d’uso in cui si vuole far sottoscrivere un contratto per l’acquisto di prodotti o servizi, l’azienda – grazie alla partnership con InfoCert – non dovrà effettuare alcuna procedura di accreditamento: è InfoCert infatti, in qualità di Service Provider CIE e al contempo Certification Authority, a servirsi dell’autenticazione CIE per l’identificazione degli utenti online e rilasciare loro un certificato di firma con cui sottoscrivere la richiesta di un prodotto o un servizio, come quelli sopra menzionati.  Autenticazione: laddove l’azienda volesse dotarsi della soluzione “Entra con CIE” per l’accesso ai propri servizi online, potrà affidarsi ad InfoCert come partner tecnologico, senza dover effettuare particolari investimenti nell’integrazione dei servizi di autenticazione.

 Compatibility: Towards a New World of Unified, Trusted&nbsp;Web3 <p>An explosive era of public blockchains is upon us, with EVMs and cross-chain communication gradually becoming the infrastructure to realize the potential of Web3. However, there remain challenges. How to best exploit the underlying support and technical strength to achieve compatibility, unity, and credibility in a Web3 age? How to effectively deal with the challenges of security and efficiency? These are familiar problems that both builders of blockchain infrastructure and Web3 developers continue to&nbsp;face.</p><p>On April 7th, Blocklike held the Blocklike Binance Panel round-table discussion with the theme of, “Compatibility: Towards a New World of Unified, Trusted Web3”, and invited Cabin VC, Ontology, Unifi, Rocki, and other institutions to discuss the path to implementation of a Web3 decentralized system. The event was viewed by nearly 20,000 people. Below are some excerpts from the highlights of the panelists' speeches during the round-table discussion.</p><p>1. We are in the era of the explosion of public chains. There is much competition in solutions about chain expansion, cross-chain and lower gas fees. Users have more choices for dApps which reflect the chain they belong to. EVM, as an important environment for developers, has deployed a large number of mainstream projects on it. So, what makes the public chains choose EVM? And what impact/influence does the EVM integration have on the projects?</p><p>LI JUN, founder of Ontology: The EVM is an important environment because Ethereum is one of the major platforms, with a lot of dApps and applications based on the EVM and the Solidity programming language. The EVM infrastructure can help developers. They can build a product only once, and it can be used everywhere, deployed everywhere. You can think of public blockchains as being stage 1, but stage 2 will see dApps as the major application. In the future, dApps will be built and deployed across all kinds of platforms. Today, EVM is an important smart contract, maybe in the future other kinds like WasmVM will become more important, but I think EVM-based infrastructure is important for all development teams.</p><p>JULIUN BRABON, Unifi CEO and Co-Founder: In our opinion, EVM acts like a bridge, connecting resources. It allows us to do a lot of things and build them uniformly on multiple chains. Through EVM, we can reduce development costs and improve efficiency, which attracts developers. Users often have many platforms, and we need to develop various tools and apply cutting-edge technologies such as zero-knowledge proofs, the focus of which is to create a decentralized identity. I think this is the start of the boom of the blockchain industry.</p><p>BJORN NICLAS, Rocki CEO &amp; Co-Founder: There are many copyright infringements on music and artwork platforms, which affects the development of the industry and reduces the income space of musicians. For us, this is an important issue for the music industry, we want to confirm the music copyright. By deploying and running EVM, we can facilitate the music distribution business. With NFT, copyright can be assigned to music creators, the identity of the musician can be verified, and users are more interested in purchasing NFT and the copyright behind&nbsp;it.</p><p>GLORIA WU, Chief Ecological Partner of Ontology: At present, many project teams are applying zero-knowledge technology for application development. It emphasizes a method of information disclosure and the inherent right to utilize structural certificates. Developers can build blocks through SDK. chain foundation. By strengthening community awareness, the blockchain infrastructure will be further utilized. In terms of regulation and privacy protection, in the Web3 world, we can use technical models to accurately verify user identities to help people protect their privacy, which requires building a unified decentralized identity&nbsp;system.</p><p>2. At present, the industry has not reached the stage of application explosion yet, but in the future, the application on-chain of Ethereum, a mature ecosystem, is bound to drive the booming of the overall blockchain industry. However, Ethereum isn’t perfect in user experience, especially with too much traffic and inefficient processing. What else needs to be done for the public chains to allow Web3 users to truly enjoy richer on-chain ecosystem services, in addition to EVM integration and interoperability? For the projects or platforms that need to make multi-chain deployment, how to unify the user experience across different platforms in&nbsp;effect?</p><p>LI JUN: Some people think you can develop scenarios and applications of various types on one platform, but it is impossible for all solutions to be built on the same underlying infrastructure, because different platforms support different scenarios. The ideal state of Web3 in the future is that the multi-chain architecture is built under the application layer, and users do not have to care whether the application uses blockchain technology or which blockchain is used, and the user experiences the product itself. I think the development team’s scenarios should depend on different blockchains, not just integrating EVM and building on the same application platform, it can have different versions and still interact.</p><p>HUMPTY CALDERON, Ontology Community Lead: Our focus is on the infrastructure of applications and how applications can be developed within these ecosystems. In addition, we also need to think about how to create a better user experience, attract more users, and provide them with an interconnected ecosystem.</p><p>GLORIA WU: In the future, Web3 will be built on a multi-chain basis. We can have a variety of solutions. Developers can create diverse applications on the platform. Users are not necessarily familiar with cryptocurrencies, but they can enjoy the value of blockchain.</p><p>BJORN NICLAS: For ordinary users of music platforms, user experience is very important. By establishing a unified authentication solution on the chain, users can easily upload music without complicated verification links.</p><p>JULIUN BRABON: Developers can build systems on multiple blockchains, develop adaptive solutions and public-facing APIs for users, and create a decentralized system. At present, people’s understanding of the on-chain solution system is insufficient, and there is still great development potential for the decentralized system in the future, which makes the user experience and operation easier.</p><p>3. In the future, what benefits will the development trend of trusted identity bring to users? Why do some people think that DID is the key technology for realizing Web3 native applications? How does it help the&nbsp;project?</p><p>LI JUN: I think the DID protocol is not only a function, but also a mechanism, especially in the case of network pressure, it will derive different mechanisms based on data identity and privacy management, and can also be used to measure users’ digital assets. credit, education, and almost all decentralized information. So, this use case is not just for wallets or some app plug-ins.</p><p>JULIUN BRABON: In the future, with the development of DID technology and trusted identities, users may no longer need wallets to interact. Anyone can interact without currency, and the data of this financial transaction technology is secure, irreplaceable, immutable, and of great&nbsp;value.</p><p>HUMPTY CALDERON: DID can bring new opportunities, it allows users to control their own identity and reputation. Users can interact with the various networks and ecological applications of the blockchain, and these interactions help users create unique identities. Each identity in the system is unique and can bring new opportunities. In addition, the DID use case also facilitates the active participation of user groups in community governance. Regarding the relationship between DID and NFT, in the on-chain ecosystem, the NFT platform authenticates market users to identify their authenticity in the real world. The platform can verify the user’s identity through DID, check the user’s experience and information in a certain period of time, and thus create a trusted purchase.</p><p>4. Recently, there have been many incidents of code loopholes, system security, and asset theft in cross-chain protocols. How do you view the security issues of cross-chain bridges? Will EVM integration, DID establishment, help solve security problems across the industry?</p><p>LI JUN: I think the key issue is cross-chain. At present, blockchain security problems emerge in an endless stream, including many cases of remote theft. Because the cross-chain bridge is in its infancy and the decentralization is not very good, this is a difficult task for most cross-chain bridges. Therefore, in the next step of technological upgrading, we will face more information processing in the public chain environment.</p><p>However, the industry already has sufficient coping mechanisms. For cross-chain bridges, we still need to collect more effective data to establish a decentralized response mechanism and secure processing process, which is the task of most cross-chain bridges. Another solution is that a centralized service model can be established. For some important organizations, building a strong security technology team is also an effective way. It can also ensure a certain degree of security by controlling cross-chain costs. In short, we should improve our risk response capabilities in different scenarios as soon as possible.</p><p>JULIUN BRABON: The role of cross-chain is often considered to be unreliable, but this is largely related to the application of technology and marketing practices in the industry, because for one network to be interconnected with another network, it must be cross-chain.</p><p>So, “trust” is one of the cross-chain topics, and many people don’t know it. In fact, this is the value of the application ecology of decentralized identity. Excellent smart contract deployment requires developers to try many times, and its value is reflected in the fact that it has not been attacked for many years after deployment, which is different from deploying 350 different smart contracts at one time. Therefore, safety is a very important value.</p><p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

Community Growth   We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1511259849476218881?s=20&amp;t=Qmq-IXis91ExpgNnTNv9Vw">weekly Discord Community Call</a>, with the theme “Why we need DID”. Setting up a decentralized identity can reduce data leakage in Web2, prevent others from using or even abusing personal data, and independently control data sharing to protect&nbsp;privacy.  We held our Telegram weekly Community Discussion, led by Benny, an Ontology Harbinger from our Asian community. He shared the rules of participation and the latest progress of “Ontology × DoraHacks Grant Hackathon”. Community members have expressed their expectation to experience more Ontology EVM applications, and to work with global developers to jointly promote breakthroughs in the Web3&nbsp;field.  As always, we’re active on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a>, where you can keep up with our latest developments and community updates.

Ontology announced a jointly held global online hackathon with DoraHacks on April 1, and provided an incentive of $100,000 for the competition and follow-up project support. At present, the hackathon is in the recruitment stage, and many developers around the world have actively signed up. In order to provide better development support and experience, Ontology recently held two workshops in <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1512067681083703296?s=20&amp;t=Qmq-IXis91ExpgNnTNv9Vw">English</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyCN/status/1512456457450848258?s=20&amp;t=Qmq-IXis91ExpgNnTNv9Vw">Chinese</a> to provide developers with clearer guidance on application development directions and deployment approaches.   Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>Info security — “<a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/half-security-incidents-insiders?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Over Half of Data Security Incidents Caused by Insiders</a>”</p><p>“It found that insider threats caused 59% of incidents impacting sensitive data in the past 12 months. Insider threats are hard to detect because internal users have legitimate access to critical systems, making them invisible to traditional security solutions like firewalls and intrusion detection systems. The lack of visibility into insider threats is creating a significant risk to the security of organization’s data. An effective insider threat detection system needs to be diverse, combining several tools to not only monitor insider behavior, but also filter through the large number of alerts and eliminate false positives.”</p><p>The Ontology DID solution can not only help users to prove their identity, but also can effectively monitor accounts with limited permissions through decentralized technologies, such as distributed ledgers, public-private key pairing, etc. For example, if the account’s public key is handed over to the operator for community management, employees can and only manage community management. Once the employee leaves, the public key can also be replaced in time to ensure account security.</p><p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>As one of the founders of KuppingerCole Analysts, I’m also an EIC (European Identity &amp; Cloud Conference) veteran. Looking back to the start in 2007, a lot has changed since then, but the core of EIC is what it has been from the very beginning: A conference that provides both thought leadership and best practices from the field. A conference that brings together end users, vendors, analysts, and other experts, for close interaction and exchange. A conference that, I dare to say (and I’m proud of), is the most relevant gathering on identity topics globally.</p>
<p></p>
 Time to make a change 
<p>When counting the years and the number of editions, you will observe that there is a small mismatch. Without the pandemic, we would already run the 16th edition this year. 2020, we had to cancel due to the Covid restrictions. But we were back last year in September, and in 2022, we are back at our established date in the first half of May. <br><br>One news this year is our location. We are in Berlin, for the first time, after being in the center of Munich (in the “Deutsches Museum”) for the first three years, and then in Munich-Unterschleißheim for another 11 editions. Time to make a change. <br><br>While the 2007 event was fairly small compared to now, it was a great start. Many sponsors and already back then attendees from half of the DAX 30 organizations, amongst many others. The ones that attended the first EIC will remember that our caterer seemed to be overwhelmed by the number of participants. Food was a little short, which never happened to us again.</p>
<p></p>
 700 slides, trailblazers, and total disagreement 
<p>I still remember some interesting sessions from then. Dick Hardt impressed with a presentation with 700 slides. Dave Kearns already talked about the need for adaptive, risk-aware and context-aware authentication. And I needed a moment to contemplate again as Paul Heiden of Bhold responded to my question “Do you agree?” following my intro statement of the closing keynote bluntly with “No, I totally disagree”. The conversation in that closing keynote session, following that moment, was really enlightening. <br><br>Over all these years, I remember all the talks with attendees. Hundreds of great presentations. Many insightful panels. Excellent jokes by Mike Neuenschwander. Fantastic evening events. Winners of the European Identity Award beaming with pride. Being nervous, year by year, ahead of the opening keynote. Being pushed to new limits by my colleague, co-founder, and brain behind the EIC, Jörg Resch, when he came up with his topic suggestions for that opening keynote and I had to deliver.</p>
<p></p>
 Only one month to go 
<p>EIC to me is also the event every year where I learn most. Being a moderator and listening to many sessions, and spending every day from early morning to late evening in talking with attendees, I gain many insights that foster our research. I’m also proud that the foundation for OIDC (OpenID Connect) has been laid at EIC, when some of the industry experts sat together in the hotel lobby and started discussing what became OIDC. <br><br>With EIC 2022, the 15th edition, only being four weeks away, I’m in the process of preparing another opening keynote and some other talks. And I’m looking forward curiously to a new location and the first EIC in Berlin, slowly coming back to normal after two years of pandemic. I’m looking forward meeting you in Berlin.</p>

<p>We are delighted to introduce web3name, a way to create a unique name to represent your digital identity. This name can be linked to your addresses on KILT and across the Polkadot ecosystem. You can also link your SocialKYC credentials such as your GitHub, Twitter, Discord, Twitch and email address to this identity, adding extra layers of verification. Get yours now for&nbsp;free!</p> Your digital identity for the Web3&nbsp;world <p><a href="https://www.kilt.io/">KILT</a> is a decentralized blockchain identity protocol. On KILT, digital identity is built around a decentralized identifier (DID) — a unique string of numbers and letters specific to you — and any credentials you choose to add to this identity. An identifier can also be given to a machine, service, IoT use case, or anything that needs an identity.</p><p>With web3name, you can now replace a DID string like&nbsp;this:</p><p>did:kilt:4s8kEBWV9nwU5znxmfR7DVA31DdBoqYGr49SAiAPzzigwJDm</p><p>with this:</p><p>w3n:ingo</p><p>web3name provides a personal and recognizable way to represent your digital identity, and is another step forward in making Web3 easier to use and more accessible to&nbsp;all.</p> Uniquely yours <p>Once you have your name, it’s yours forever and no one else can claim it (unless you later decide to give it up, returning it to the web3name universe.) There are no added costs or renewal&nbsp;fees.</p><p>This identity can be linked to your KILT address and any or all of your addresses across the Polkadot ecosystem, making it easier for others to reference you. In the future, this will be extended to chains beyond the Polkadot ecosystem, too.</p><p>Using <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/announcing-socialkyc-built-on-kilt-65a29a974d07">SocialKYC</a>, an attestation service built on KILT, users can also create credentials confirming ownership of their email address or accounts such as GitHub, Discord, or Twitter, and link them to their DID and web3name, adding an extra trust&nbsp;layer.</p> Collators and Validators <p>Although the web3name is anchored on the KILT blockchain, it can be easily linked to any number of addresses on any blockchain in the Polkadot ecosystem using the KILT Sporran wallet (or via any wallet supporting the polkadot.js extension api).</p><p>This is especially useful for collators and validators in the ecosystem, allowing them to link their web3name to any of their addresses they choose. web3name allows them to be easily recognized, which increases transparency and brand&nbsp;impact:</p><p>Collators and validators may also choose to link their <a href="https://socialkyc.io/">SocialKYC</a> credentials to a service endpoint such as a URL in GitHub or IPFS and make them public. This is a way to provide contact details and more information for nominators and delegators, increasing trust.</p> Enhancing Identity <p>web3name is designed to enhance identity. Therefore it is a supplement to an address rather than a replacement for it. Although web3name may be linked to an address, it is not recommended as a full replacement for an address&nbsp;since:</p>  Any user may decide to give up their web3name, which could then be adopted by another user with a different address,&nbsp;and  One name/identity could be linked to several addresses  <p>While you can only have one web3name per identity, you may create several identities with a different web3name for each, for example your work identity, your collator identity, your gaming identity, etc.</p> DIDsign <p>web3name also adds an extra layer of verification when using <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/announcing-didsign-a-new-application-built-on-kilt-e4896ffffb44">DIDsign</a>, an application built on KILT that provides a decentralized way for users to sign and verify files. Any type of digital file — PDFs, Word, audio, video, software — can be signed directly in your browser, downloaded, and sent by any method that supports zip&nbsp;files.</p><p>In addition to seeing that the file has not been tampered with, the recipient has the extra security of seeing your web3name and any credentials you choose to link with&nbsp;it.</p> Getting Started <p>Claim your name before it&nbsp;goes!</p><p>For the duration of this promotion, creating your on-chain DID and web3name is free. (Normally, it requires a deposit of around 2 KILT Coins and small transaction fees.)</p><p>In order to claim your name, you need a Sporran wallet and a KILT on-chain&nbsp;DID.</p><p>You can use this <a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/How-to-Set-Up-Sporran_22-Nov.pdf">guide to set up your&nbsp;Sporran</a>.</p><p>Then create your free on-chain DID following the instructions <a href="https://www.trusted-entity.io/assets/pdf/w3n_Promo_On-Chain-DID.pdf">here</a>.</p><p>Once you have your Sporran and on-chain DID, you’re ready to go. Just follow the steps&nbsp;below.</p> Claim your&nbsp;name   Open your Sporran extension  <p>2. Click “Create web3name”</p><p>3. Click and read the Terms. If you agree, check the box “Use web3name Promo and accept Terms”. This will create a signed package that is sent to the web3name promo server for payment and submission to the blockchain.</p><p>4. Click “Next&nbsp;Step”</p><p>5. Enter the name you wish to claim. This must have a minimum of three characters using lowercase letters a-z, numbers 0–9, hyphen ( — ) or underscore ( _ )&nbsp;symbols.</p><p>6. When you have chosen an available name, click “Next&nbsp;Step”</p><p>7. Enter your Sporran password and click “Sign”. This will start the process of anchoring your name on the KILT blockchain.</p><p>The next pop-up will confirm that the name has been&nbsp;created.</p><p>Congratulations, you now have your unique web3name!</p> Link your web3name to your KILT&nbsp;address <p>Once you have your web3name you may also link it via your on-chain DID to your addresses across the Polkadot ecosystem. In this way, people with your address will also be able to see your DID and your web3name and, vice versa, those with your web3name can see your public&nbsp;address.</p><p>Note, don’t link addresses that you don’t want connected to your name! If you want to keep an address private, don’t link&nbsp;it.</p><p>To connect your name to your address, follow the instructions on the <a href="https://web3name-promo.trusted-entity.io/">web3name Promo website</a> or follow the guide&nbsp;<a href="https://www.trusted-entity.io/assets/pdf/How_To_Guide_web3name_Promo.pdf">here</a>.</p> The web3name directory <p>The <a href="http://w3n.id/">web3name directory</a> is a service that provides an easy way to look up KILT DIDs and their associated web3names and credentials. It also allows you to see if your preferred name is still available — just enter it in the search bar. If there is no DID associated with it, it’s all yours to&nbsp;claim!</p><p>The web3name directory, along with the linking website, was built on KILT by B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH (BTE), a subsidiary of BOTLabs GmbH, the initial developer of KILT Protocol. The web3name directory was launched in order to make using web3name&nbsp;easier.</p><p>Users can be searched by DID or web3name&nbsp;by:</p><p>1. Entering the web3name in the search&nbsp;field</p><p>2. Entering the DID in the search&nbsp;field:</p><p>Both ways show the web3name, associated DID, and any credentials publicly linked to&nbsp;it.</p><p>The credentials can be read by clicking “Fetch”, as the data is stored in the service endpoint and not on the blockchain itself.</p> Creating a shareable link <p>To create a URL to make sharing your web3name easier, just enter your web3name or DID in the search bar and copy the URL it generates. This URL can then be shared and will lead directly to your digital identity via the <a href="http://w3n.id/">web3name directory</a> website.</p><p>That’s it!</p> About KILT&nbsp;Protocol <p><a href="http://kilt.io/">KILT</a> is a decentralized blockchain identity protocol for issuing self-sovereign, anonymous and verifiable credentials.

The FRAX stablecoin now has a market cap of over $2.6 billion, and the protocol’s FXS governance token is up 300% in the last year.&nbsp;</p> <p>In this episode, we explore the Stablecoin Wars, in which different protocols compete for liquidity and composability in DeFi. Sam brings a 1st-person perspective into the developments surrounding UST and the recently launched 4pool on Curve, which consists of stablecoins UST, FRAX, USDT, and USDC.</p> <p>A highlight of this conversation is Sam’s parable of an archetypal central bank, in which he cruises through a number of salient takes on money markets and macroeconomics. There is a lot to learn about this Cambrian explosion of financial technology, and Sam is a great teacher.

 Growing the Community 

<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/www.blockchaincommons.com/master/images/2022-Q1-community.png">
    
</a></p>

<p>The first goal of Blockchain Commons is to create a community: an actual commons. We saw notable advancement on that objective this quarter, a positive sign that the commons is truly gelling.</p>

<p>New Patrons. We want to offer a welcome to our newest sustaining patrons, <a href="https://www.crossbar-inc.com/">CrossBar</a> and <a href="https://www.proxy.com/">Proxy</a>. Each of them brings exciting new opportunities to the commons: CrossBar with silicon solutions and Proxy with a long-time focus on identity. Continued thanks also to our existing sustaining sponsors such as <a href="https://bitmark.com/">Bitmark</a>, <a href="https://github.com/blockchainbird/bird">Blockchainbird</a>, <a href="https://foundationdevices.com/">Foundation Devices</a>, and <a href="https://unchained.com/">Unchained Capital</a> and to our <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">other supporters on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>New Possibilities. The variety of expertises within the commons is creating synergy for all of our patrons and other participants, as Blockchain Commons is able to introduce members to each other and work with everyone to develop use cases and specifications that meet all of their needs. In particular, as a result of CrossBar joining our community we’ve been hosting dialogues about the future of secure silicon: what features it can support, and what other possibilities the future holds. We’ll be expanding on that in the near future with a virtual salon.</p>

<p>New Contributions. Q1 also saw an entirely independent software contribution. <a href="https://github.com/Sjlver">Jonas Wagner</a> created <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/seedtool.info">seedtool.info</a>, a version of our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/seedtool-cli">seedtool-cli</a> that is accessible <a href="http://seedtool.info/">via the web</a> and built using WebAssembly (as opposed to less secure JavaScript implementations). We appreciate the contribution and how it improves the accessibility of seed usage, but even more we appreciate Jonas’ interest in becoming part of our open-source community. (Thanks Jonas!) We look forward to more contributions of this sort.</p>

 Developing Specifications 

<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/www.blockchaincommons.com/master/images/2022-Q1-vectors.png">
    
</a></p>

<p>By working with the commons community, we’re able to not just discover the needs of our members, but also develop specifications that both serve those needs and help our members to interoperate.</p>

<p>New Specifications. We have begun work on two new specifications. <code>crypto-msg</code> is a simple encoding of ciphertext that we’ve specced out in a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2022-001-secure-message.md">first draft</a>. We’ll be seeking CBOR registration via IANA for it once we’ve finalized. <code>crypto-envelope</code> is a more complex specification that can contain <code>crypto-msgs</code>, decryption methodologies, and more; it’s still being sketched out based on community needs.</p>

<p>Test Vectors. Of course creating specification is just the first step. We also create reference libraries and reference apps that demonstrate their use — and ultimately test vectors, so that our community can test their own code. Our <code>crypto-request</code>/<code>crypto-responses</code> communication specification is now mature enough that the community needs test vectors, so we created <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/crypto-request-test-vectors.md">more than a dozen</a>, allowing for easy testing of requests and responses.</p>

 Progressing on Reference Apps 

<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/master/images/st-listing.jpeg">
    
</a></p>

<p>Reference apps are where specifications interface with the real-world, as we demonstrate their actual usage.</p>

<p>Gordian Seed Tool v1.4. Gordian Seed Tool, our iOS and MacOS seed vault, continues to be our prime reference app for demonstrating the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles">Gordian Principles</a> and for exemplifying best practices of seed management. Our new <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/releases/tag/releases%2Funiversal%2F1.4">v1.4</a> features usability and data display improvements, but its biggest advancements were in I/O.</p>

<p>Seed Tool can now write to MicroSD cards, supporting a safe and secure way of exporting seeds without going to a network. This release also supports the <code>ur:</code> scheme for the native camera app and for reading NFCs cards. Our open test-flight beta also includes proof of concept of writing URs to NFCs if you want to experiment. (Beware: this functionality might change!)</p>

<p>Altough you can compile Gordian Seed Tool from code, it’s also available through the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229">Apple App Store</a>.</p>

<p>Spotbit. <a href="https://spotbit.info/spotbit/">Spotbit</a>, our tor-gapped currency pricing lookup tool, was one of our biggest successes from our 2020 intern program, but we’ve long wanted to improve its stability to make it usable not just as a reference but also as a real service. Work on refactoring has just begun, courtesy of one of our former interns (which also demonstrates another of our goals: increasing the number of designers and developers in our industry).</p>

 Releasing Services 

<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/www.blockchaincommons.com/master/images/2022-Q1-esplora.png">
    
</a></p>

<p>Though one of the largest goals of Blockchain Commons is working with developers to craft the open, interoperable, secure, and compassionate digital infrastructure of the future, we’ve also constructed a bit of that infrastructure ourself by providing public services.</p>

<p>Esplora. We now have our own copy of Esplora, the blockchain explorer, available at <a href="http://esplora.blockchaincommons.com/">esplora.blockchaincommons.com</a> or <a href="http://pf4awrbzt3ohrtukpq6xx6y73gxqlnon4zh35ik7ald3kwfb5iedogad.onion/">http://pf4awrbzt3ohrtukpq6xx6y73gxqlnon4zh35ik7ald3kwfb5iedogad.onion/ on Tor</a>. This is meant to be a stable, publicly accessible blockchain explorer, so that Blockstream’s <a href="https://blockstream.info/">original esplora</a> isn’t a single-point-of-failure for blockchain explorations of that sort. We’d love for more people to run their own Esplora services as well, to offer distributed sources of blockchain truth.</p>

 Advocating for Smart Custody 

<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/master/Images/smartcustody-overview.jpg">
    
</a></p>

<p>One of Blockchain Commons’ first projects was advocating for the Smart Custody of digital assets by outlining best practices that could equally be adopted by individuals or incorporated by developers into their works. This quarter has seen some large advances in our smart custody work.</p>

<p>Smart Custody for Multisigs. When we designed our original <a href="https://bit.ly/SmartCustodyBookV101">Smart Custody scenario</a>, we were already thinking about multisigs, but the technology wasn’t yet accessible to anyone but the most sophisticated user. So, our original scenario focused on cold storage. Fortunately, three years later, multisig is much more easily available through a number of transaction coordinators, some of them self-sovereign, such as <a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/">Sparrow Wallet</a>. We’ve thus been thrilled to put together a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Scenario-Multisig.md">raw draft</a> of a complete scenario focused on using a multisig to protect your digital assets. It allows for control of digital assets that’s less prone to failure, less prone to compromise, and easier to use: everything that a SmartCustody scenario requires. The draft is still undergoing review, so this is just a preview. We expect to release it fully in the coming quarter.</p>

<p>Smart Custody Case Studies. We’ve also been thrilled to see an increasing number of hardware and software releases that embody Smart Custody best practices. To discuss them, we’ve begun producing case studies that talk about how each fulfills the Gordian Principles and battles against Smart Custody adversaries; in the process, we’re also coming to better understand the needs of our community members. Our initial case studies cover <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Case-Study-Passport.md">the Foundation Devices Passport</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Case-Study-Sparrow.md">Sparrow Wallet</a>. We also published discussions of how our own <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Case-Study-SeedTool.md">Gordian Seed Tool</a> acts as a reference for Gordian principles. We’ve got  one more case study in process for the Keystone Pro wallet. If you’d like us to consider other products, or even better if you want to draft a case study yourself, please contact us at <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">team@blockchaincommons.com</a>.</p>

<p>Proof of Personhood Support. Smart Custody, and its adversaries, goes beyond just the ownership of cryptocurrency. We recently hosted a discussion with the proof-of-personhood community, who we’ve long worked with at <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web of Trust</a>, and came up with one new adversary, a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustodyBook/blob/master/TODO.md#identity-adversaries">boundary breaker</a>, which can likely be applied to #SmartCustody proper. There are no easy answers to the problem of proving whether an entity is a real person, but we think the problem is solvable, and we look forward to working more with this community.</p>

 Looking Forward 

<p>Looking torward the future, there’s lots more on the horizon.</p>

<p>Rebooting the Web of Trust. We are thrilled to see the return of the <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web Design Workshops</a> this Fall, after a break of three years due to the COVID pandemic! They’ve recently announced a <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/next-event-page.html">save-the-date for September 26-30</a>, when the next workshop is planned for The Hague in Netherlands. RWOT was in many ways the foundation of Blockchain Commons, so we’re looking forward to returning this year to learn more about everyone’s current interests and needs.</p>

<p>Self-Sovereign Identity. Working with governments to support self-sovereign identity has long been a goal at Blockchain Commons, with much of our focus on Wyoming. However, the ideas are spreading far and wide. Recently we talked with the <a href="https://twitter.com/christophera/status/1510123736342491138?s=21&amp;t=tGStayJVFkXc-NkOEo6Esg">Buenos Aires Mayor’s office</a> about creating identities that benefit the people, not corporations. This is part of a real effort, as they’ve already produced a <a href="https://github.com/gcba/Identidad-digital/blob/main/Whitepaper%20Tango.md">white paper</a> on the topic, which is available <a href="https://github-com.translate.goog/gcba/Identidad-digital/blob/main/Whitepaper%20Tango.md?_x_tr_sl=es&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp#whitepaper-tango1">in translation</a>.</p>

<p>Ethereum &amp; NFTs. At this point we’ve written three different unpublished documents on creating Smart Custody for Ethereum, for NFTs, and for treasuries. We’re still deciding how to advance this work, as it’s a big job that would require serious support, but if any our patrons want to see our initial notes, please contact us.</p>

<p>2022 Interns. Blockchain Commons has announced its <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions/74">2022 intern program</a>, to run this summer from May 23, 2022 to August 15, 2022. We’ve also produced a list of <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions/76">potential projects</a> that includes many of our own ideas. If you’re interested in dedicating 40 hours of work this summer as an intern, <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions/74">please apply</a>! The deadline is April 22nd. Even if you don’t want to become an intern, take a look at our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions/76">projects list</a>, as we’d be happy to work with independent open-source developers on anything there.</p>

<p>The Silicon Salon. This May we’ll be working with <a href="https://www.crossbar-inc.com/">CrossBar</a> to host The Silicon Salon, a 90-minute virtual discussion on the future of secure silicon. We’ll be talking about the possibility for support of <code>secp256k1</code> and other curves as well as what other features could be included in silicon designs, from hashes and key derivations to ideas about more advanced functionality. Watch <a href="https://twitter.com/BlockchainComns">@BlockchainComns</a> for our official announcement.</p>

<p>What’s Coming Up? We’ve got lots of big plans for things that we’d love to advance in the new year, but which will ultimately depend on the needs of the community (and our own resources).</p>

<p>Our future educational work includes expansion of our two biggest projects in that category. <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line">Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line</a> should be updated for <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-taproot-explainer">Taproot and Schnorr</a>, and we’re looking even more forward with <a href="https://github.com/jonasnick/bips/blob/musig2/bip-musig2.mediawiki">MuSig</a> and both the benefits and challenges it’ll bring. We’d similarly like to bring our Smart Custody work to the next level, not just incorporating our last year’s work on <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Multisig.md">multisigs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/SSKR-Sharing.md">SSKR</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Timelocks.md">timelocks</a> (as well as our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Scenario-Multisig.md">new scenario</a>), but also expanding Smart Custody to support Ethereum, Tezos, and other blockchains.</p>

<p>Beyond our educational work, we’ve also been considering the design of a Gordian Recovery reference app and need to finalize our work on new specifications such as <code>crypto-msg</code> and <code>crypto-envelope</code>. Of course, we expect the year to be further defined by the needs of the blockchain community! So, there’s plenty to look forward to!</p>

<p>As always, if you are interested in the work of Blockchain Commons and want to see it continue forward, the three best things you can do are <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">become a sponsor</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community/discussions">become a community member</a>, and offer your own contributions as Issues, PRs, or even entirely new projects.</p>

<p>Thank you for your support!</p>

   As companies shift to cloud-native applications, the complexity of a microservices framework can be daunting. When applications are built in a cloud-native stack, authorization is also infinitely more complex. Crucially, Open Policy Agent (OPA) decouples policy from code, enabling the release, analysis, and review of policies without impacting availability or performance.

Crucially, Open Policy Agent (OPA) decouples policy from code, enabling the release, analysis, and review of policies without impacting availability or performance.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/policy-based-access-control-for-cloud-native-applications"></a>

<p>Creating and issuing verifiable credentials is fast becoming the norm for many SMEs and large organizations. Dock Certs was released for beta testing in early February 2022 as a no-code solution to creating and issuing verifiable credentials. Thanks to user feedback, we’ve created a better user interface and experience through continuous updates and upgrades. One of our most recent updates was the introduction of bulk issuance. </p><p>Bulk Issuance supports high customer volumes by bulk issuing verifiable credentials in batches of 100+. Simply import a CSV file and issue verifiable credentials within minutes, averaging 1 credential being issued every second. </p><p>Head to <a href="https://certs.dock.io/">Dock Certs</a> and test out this feature. There’s even a sample CSV file you can use.</p><p>You’ll need a DID to create a verifiable credential. When creating a DID, there are a few key types to choose from. Key types are cryptographic keys that will be used to sign the credentials you create, the key type of sr25519 is the default choice.</p><p>Step 1</p><p>Head back to the dashboard and click ‘Create Verifiable Credentials’. This will lead to a screen where you can choose between issuing a basic credential or a university degree credential. On the right-hand side, you’ll be able to see a mock-up design of the credential you are issuing. After selecting the issuer, click continue where you’ll be prompted to import a CSV file.</p><p>Step 2</p><p>This CSV file requires 3 fields: the recipient's name, their unique identifier (like a DID or email address for example), and the date of issuance. Simply assign attributes to each field and finish importing.</p><p>Once all credential holders are listed, it’s time to define the terms of your credentials; opting for persistent credentials, allowing revoking of these credentials, and anchoring the credentials. </p><p>Persistent credentials can be accessed with a URL for the holder and verifier, its contents are encrypted and stored with Dock until you decide to delete them. This also allows credentials to be scanned with a QR code for verification. By opting to issue persistent credentials, a password is needed to store and retrieve the credentials. This password should be shared with the holder so that they can retrieve the contents. </p><p>Opting to revoke the credentials means you, the issuer, can revoke/un-revoke the credentials in the future. And finally, anchoring the credentials will publish a hash on the Dock blockchain which can be referenced in the future to verify when and who created it.</p><p>The design mock-up of the credentials remains embedded on the right side of your screen.</p><p>Step 3</p><p>After accessing the attributes match and the terms are defined, it’s time to issue your credentials. A pop-up will appear as your credentials are being issued and will notify you when the process is complete. </p><p>Now, issuers have the option to download the credentials that have just been issued. A file containing a PDF format and JSON file of each credential (just as the holders will receive) will be downloaded for issuers to store and reference. </p><p>On the Credentials page in Dock Certs, a full list of issued credentials are available to view. Under status, you’ll see an option to ‘View the credential’ of each holder, ‘revoke the credential’ (providing this option was selected earlier in the terms) and delete the metadata. </p><p>Trial the Dock Certs Bulk Issuance Feature</p><p>Issue verifiable credentials to 100+ recipients in minutes with the new bulk issuance feature on Dock Certs. Save time from manually creating and sending credentials the old-fashioned way and introduce verifiable credentials into your workflows. </p><p>With Dock Certs, anyone can take advantage of the many benefits of verifiable credentials without the need for coding or complex integrations.

 Announcing decentralization roadmap, AUTH token and inviting Guardians to join the incentivized testnet <p>For years, we have been eliminating seed phrases and replacing them with user-friendly wallets and authentication tools powered by multi-party computation (MPC) and threshold-key cryptography. Today, Web3Auth powers over 400 dapps and wallets, and secures more than 9 million users worldwide. It’s grown to become one of the most trusted authentication suites in Web3, and has become a favorite of developers seeking to onboard users in a familiar yet secure and non-custodial way.</p><p>In January, we rebranded our authentication SDK, formerly known as Torus, to Web3Auth. Today, we’re excited to share that we’re formally rebranding the Torus Network, the MPC infrastructure that powers Web3Auth, to The Auth Network. After today, the Torus brand will cease to exist; instead, our developer tooling and the network that powers it will live on under the Auth&nbsp;brand.</p><p>In addition to re-branding, we’ve been busy developing an ambitious new roadmap for the Auth Network. We’re excited to share that today, and more — the complete vision for the Auth Network, its near-term roadmap, and a new token that will power it all. Collectively, the contents below represent our current ambitions and the path we see to onboard a billion people into&nbsp;Web3.</p> Auth Network: The Future of Web3 Authentication <p>In crypto there is a saying that goes, ”Not your keys, not your crypto.’ This phrase, more than most, exemplifies the importance of self-custodial software, — However, as important as self-custodial software has become, it’s still far from mainstream. We have yet to hit the inflection point where self-custody applications are the default. This is both the problem and the opportunity we seek to address with Web3Auth.</p><p>The Auth Network today is a permissioned network that consists of 9 nodes run by some of the most trusted and credible companies and projects in crypto, including Binance, ENS, Etherscan, Zilliqa and <a href="https://docs.web3auth.io/overview/key-management">others</a>. However, in order to build an infrastructure worthy of the trust of developers and billions of users, we recognize that the Auth Network must be fully decentralized. And so, the first step in our plan is to transition the network from being permissioned to permissionless, which will allow anyone to participate as a Network Guardian.</p><p>In addition to improving network integrity and trustworthiness, decentralization will also help the network scale. Right now, the Auth Network scales to comfortably support around 200 million users. The next iteration will be built off Parity Substrate’s scaffolding, payment channels and various TSS/MPC schemes in preparation for the next wave of crypto users coming online — be that billions of&nbsp;users.</p><p>Decentralization also improves load times. Right now, depending on where you are in the world, it can take up to two seconds to authenticate and login to an application. That’s far too long. Decentralizing the network will enable us to improve geo-latency and hopefully reduce loading times into the milliseconds. Similarly, all of the network’s metadata is currently stored on a mixture of cached servers and IPFS. In the process of decentralizing, we plan to create a new incentivized data availability layer that will also help accelerate load&nbsp;times.</p><p>The Auth Network will only succeed if it’s the most decentralized and performant authentication network in the world. These values are baked deeply into our roadmap, and, as we begin our decentralization process, we invite the community to join us on this journey and comment on our&nbsp;plans.</p> The Decentralization Roadmap <p>Decentralization is a spectrum, but our path is clear. We have exciting milestones approaching, including testnets and feature upgrades that the Auth Network will enable. Below is our decentralization sequence, starting with the launch of the Guardian Program, which kicks off&nbsp;today.</p> The Auth&nbsp;Token <p>In the process of decentralizing the Auth Network we’ll be introducing a new token — the AUTH token — to help coordinate the MPC that enables keys to be stored in a distributed, self-custodial fashion and reconstructed on demand with a series of shards. The token will be used to coordinate Network Guardians, incentivize network participation and uptime, and secure the integrity of the&nbsp;keybase.</p><p>Much like the network itself, the tokenomics for AUTH token will be unique and be used to incentivize and distribute resources across the different stakeholders in the network. It will enable wallets, apps and their users to leverage on the security of the node providers as well as guarantee consensus of the&nbsp;network.</p><p>We will announce more details about the token and the economics of the Auth Network in a future post. In the meantime, we plan to expand our Guardian base set through a new membership program and incentivized testnet.</p> Join The Guardian&nbsp;Program <p>The Guardian Partner Program is an incentivized testnet program. It is most suitable for&nbsp;:</p><p>- Wallets and applications already using&nbsp;Web3Auth</p><p>- Affiliate or distribution partners who are keen on the Auth&nbsp;Network</p><p>- Large entities in the crypto ecosystem</p><p>Guardians are network participants who commit to running a full node in the Auth Network testnet and mainnet. So far, some of the largest ecosystem stakeholders, such as <a href="https://polygon.technology/">Polygon</a>, <a href="https://www.skyweaver.net/">Skyweaver</a>, <a href="https://www.gooddollar.org/">GoodDollar</a>, <a href="http://chainsafe.io">Chainsafe</a>, <a href="https://www.socol.io/">SOCOL</a>, <a href="http://p2p.org">P2P Validators</a> have joined the Guardian Partner&nbsp;Program.</p><p>Guardians who participate in the testnet will be compensated as will be determined in the network economics.</p> Join us to create the non-custodial world. <p>If you too share our vision of onboarding a billion people into Web3, sign-up for the incentivized testnet and become a Guardian by filling in the form&nbsp;<a href="https://www.web3auth.io/guardians">here</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/introducing-the-auth-network-b8fab1b5e1f6">Introducing the Auth Network</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Nitish Deshpande</a></p><p>DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks are no longer top of mind; however, today DDoS attacks are an even bigger threat than ever before.</p>
<p>The pandemic has accelerated digital transformation due to growth in digital services. The ever-increasing number of devices being exposed to the internet, the ever-growing dependency of organizations on these digital services as a virtual interface to customers, consumers, and citizens, the shift to remote work/work from home and the growth in importance of cryptocurrencies. All these factors have led to a continuous increase in the number and sophistication of cyber-attacks. According to <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-ddos-protection-2021-q3-and-q4-ddos-attack-trends/">Microsoft</a>’s report, one of the main threats to organizations in 2021 was the rise in Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.</p>
<p>Unlike a DoS attack where a single source is used to target a system, a DDoS attack floods the organization’s servers with thousands of requests from multiple sources through botnets. These attacks are also used as a decoy for infiltrating with ransomware or phishing for corporate disruption. Moreover, it is not possible to defend against a DDoS attack by blocking a single identified attack source.&nbsp; While the attackers are overloading the victim’s systems with illegitimate requests using botnets, their system such as VPN, websites, VoIP services, etc. can at times fail to fulfill the legitimate requests. This impacts on the organization’s activities.</p>
 Factors responsible for rise in DDoS attacks 
<p>The recent rise in DDoS attacks can be explained by the following factors:</p>
 
 Online services dependency: Organizations are undergoing digital transformation and since the pandemic there has been a shift towards working from home. This has created a higher risk of the remote working devices becoming infected with malware and being available for use in the botnets used for DDoS attacks. There are several examples over the last 2 years where work from home devices were infected resulting in an impact on the organization which lasted for days and even weeks. At the same time almost, every organization is moving its services online. As more businesses make their way online, the potential number of victims for the cyber criminals increase 
 Political instability: Political tensions between geographical regions have resulted in an increase in state sponsored cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure. Every country now needs to defend against these attacks.&nbsp; DDoS attacks have become a way for countries to engage in cyber warfare. &nbsp;Potential targets for this include defense and aeronautics companies as well to civil infrastructure to disrupt crucial public services. 
 Cryptocurrency: Recently the crypto currency market has seen exponential growth with a large number of investors engaging in crypto financial activities. Cyber attackers have now shifted focus to target blockchain miners and cryptocurrency trade platforms using DDoS attacks. At the same time crypto currencies have equipped the cyber attackers with a way to receive ransom payments anonymously. As this industry continues to grow, we can expect to see a growth in the cyber-attacks in this space. 
 
 Recommendations to mitigate DDoS attacks 
<p>DDoS attacks cannot be avoided but specialized cybersecurity companies and Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) can bring down botnets.&nbsp; Organizations can use advanced analytics to track and assess the risk of attacks. Organization can take a few straightforward measures to control the disruption to their critical business services. Following are examples of some of these:</p>
 
 Content Delivery Networks (CDN): In the past users have been unable to access websites simply due to an increase in traffic overloading the centralized systems. &nbsp;CDN provides a &nbsp;globally distributed server network that can help the business to maintain its services during peak load as well as to mitigate the effect of DDoS. A CDN allows you to isolate the affected services from a DDoS attack and keep the business functioning. 
 Outsourcing to Cloud services: Running business services in the large cloud services has the benefit of the countermeasures that these providers take against DDoS as well as the additional anti-DDoS services that they provide. &nbsp;They also provide massive scalability making it harder to bring down their service by DDoS attacks. 
 Monitoring network traffic: DDoS attacks increase network traffic to overload your service. &nbsp;Monitoring your network to identify the normal traffic patterns is important to help you to spot when something unusual is occurring.&nbsp; However, well-planned attacks often start without any warning. Thus, monitoring is important for detecting attacks rather than for mitigating their effects.&nbsp; Another approach is rate limiting, this helps to limit attempted DDoS attacks by restricting the number of specific types of requests accepted. 
 Using Professional tools: There are many trusted DDoS prevention tools in the market. Leveraging these is a straightforward way to protect against and mitigate the effects of these attack 
 
<p>DDoS attacks have not gone away but in fact are increasing. DDoS attacks cannot be avoided but law enforcement and the large cyber security organizations are working to identify and disable them. KuppingerCole recommends that organizations take action to protect against these attacks by using the right tools.

<p>This blog article is part of our blog series “Pushing fintech regulation forward”.</p>



<p>Fintechs have brought many changes to the financial services industry. The rapid introduction of new technology and increasing competition have improved services and customer experience in many ways. However, increasing regulation goes along with this rise in innovation.</p>



<p>As fintechs expand the services they offer and the licenses they need, they can quickly become exposed to increased regulation. This is especially challenging as it can include new technology areas where regulation is not well established. </p>



<p>Fintechs also need to be aware of regulatory differences between countries where they operate.</p>



<p>There has been much discussion in the industry about the challenges of regulation keeping pace with fintech’s speed of innovation. As one example, UK-based <a href="https://www.cityam.com/exclusive-fintech-bosses-call-on-government-to-ramp-up-efforts-to-overhaul-regulation/">City AM reported in February 2022</a> that many leading UK fintechs have called on the government to overhaul the regulation of fintechs. This is needed to keep pace with innovation and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/regulatory-risks-fintechs/">allow fintechs to continue to grow while keeping the market safe</a>.</p>



<p>Whatever the changes are going forward, KYC and AML will remain key amongst the regulations. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/finance/what-is-fintech-regulation/">Fintechs are subject to the same well-defined requirements</a> to protect themselves, customers, and the wider financial markets from financial crime as other financial institutions. In Europe, this includes the AMLD and eIDAS regulations.</p>



 Fintech regulation and Artificial Intelligence  



<p>An <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/why-future-kyc-belongs-ekyc/">eKYC solution</a>, such as&nbsp;AI-driven ID verification is one way fintechs can ensure they are mitigating regulatory risks&nbsp;at almost any stage of their growth plans. Automation offers faster and more accurate verification and customer onboarding. </p>



<p>Done right, it can improve overall customer experience and conversion. Regulators are increasingly supporting AI technologies for automated identity verification. As long as fintechs stay aware of regulatory changes, there is plenty of potential for growth and service improvement.</p>



 What is RegTech within financial services? 



<p>RegTech refers to regulatory compliance management with the help of technical innovations. It is a subset of the fintech market, which refers to the wider idea of using technology (regulatory technology) within the financial services industry.</p>



<p>The RegTech sector is growing rapidly. According to <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/regtech-market-63447434.html">Markets and Markets</a>, its market size is set to grow to $16 billion by 2025 (from $6.3 billion in 2020).</p>



<p>RegTech utilizes many different technologies to meet the growing challenge of compliance. This includes cloud computing, live video, predictive analytics, and voice recognition. </p>



<p>The use of artificial intelligence and machine learning is key among these technologies. It can support the vital AML and KYC regulations in place in almost all countries with automated identity verification, biometric verification, and transaction monitoring.</p>



<blockquote><p>Artificial Intelligence and machine learning techniques have been well adopted by fintechs and RegTechs in improving KYC and AML. </p>Francisco Martins, Senior Identity Consultant, Financial Sector UK/I at IDnow</blockquote>



 Automated Identity Verification for fintech and RegTech companies 



<p>Fintechs leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technologies in many different ways. They allow for automated information processing, unlimited monitoring of transactions, trend analysis, and fraud identification.</p>



<p>Applications include loan processing and credit evaluation, credit card fraud detection, and even algorithm-based trading.</p>



<p>Automated identity verification has risen to be one of the most important uses of AI, bringing huge benefits in safety, cost, and customer experience. </p>



<p>As more customer interaction has moved online in recent years, the need and possibilities for this have exploded. </p>



<p>More and more people are accessing services online, replacing traditional branch interactions and even ATM use (one of the first fintech growth areas in the 1980s).</p>



<p>The COVID pandemic has seen this trend accelerate even faster – <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/how-covid-19-has-pushed-companies-over-the-technology-tipping-point-and-transformed-business-forever">a study by consultancy McKinsey</a> suggests that companies are up to seven years ahead in digital transformation. And with increasing acceptance from regulators, the trend is well set for the continued expansion of automated identity verification.</p>







 How is Artificial Intelligence (AI) used in Identity Verification? 



<p>AI has changed the identity verification and onboarding processes for financial institutions. Not long ago, these were entirely manual processes. Customers would visit a branch to verify physical identity documents. This is time-consuming, costly, and frustrating for customers.</p>



<p>Artificial intelligence is the technical simulation of human intelligence by computers. AI is trained using data sets to think and draw conclusions like a human (this process is referred to as machine learning).</p>



<p>This has obvious applications in automated verification, and AI solutions are now well advanced in this area. </p>



<p>For example, Artificial Intelligence can be used in several ways:</p>



  Checking identity document authenticity. AI can automatically detect and verify security features contained in identity documents.  Live video biometrics. Personal identity can be checked using live photos or videos and comparing biometrics with identity photographs. With training data and human oversight, machine learning algorithms can be trained (and continually improved) in detecting matches.  Transaction monitoring. KYC and AML are not just one-off checks that need to be carried out when onboarding a customer. Ongoing monitoring of customer states and transactions is required. AI can assist here as well.  



 







 The benefits of using Artificial Intelligence for Identity Verification 



<p>AI is transforming KYC procedures, customer onboarding, and identity verification. </p>



 



<p>When implemented right, AI brings many advantages for fintechs, financial institutions, and their customers, such as the following:</p>



 



 
 
<p>Fast results.</p>
 



 
<p>Automated processes are, as you would expect, much faster. AI-based verification can check documents and identity within minutes. Even if manual intervention is needed, this can be built-in and handled quickly.</p>
 
 



 
 
<p>Lower cost.</p>
 



 
<p>Manual KYC verification has high costs – in both time and money. Expensive third-party services are often used, staff are involved in repeated manual tasks, and delays and backlogs can lose customers.</p>
 
 



 
 
<p>Improved accuracy. </p>
 



 
<p>Part of the reasoning for increasing regulatory acceptance is the realization that automated AI verification is safer in many ways. Automated processing limits the possibility of human error or oversight. AI is also trained on datasets, and accuracy improves as more data is created.</p>
 
 



 
 
<p>Meets regulatory requirements.</p>
 



 
<p>Staying compliant is vital in the heavily regulated financial services sector. AI is permitted by many regulators (including in the UK and parts of the EU), and its acceptance is increasing. Non-compliance can be very expensive. You just have to look at some huge fines handed out to banks to see this – including £102 million for Standard Chartered in the UK in 2019.</p>
 
 



 
 
<p>Allows for true ongoing monitoring.</p>
 



 
<p>AI can monitor activity and transactions continuously and in real time. This would be a vast effort to achieve manually without the use of AI.</p>
 
 



 
 
<p>Improved customer experience. </p>
 



 
<p>Customers want to know their interactions are secure, while also having a fast and friction free experience.</p>
 
 



 
 
<p>Increased conversion rates. </p>
 



 
<p>Customer conversion rates are critical in online financial services. This is improved with faster onboarding and verification, with customers less likely to abandon the process.</p>
 
 



 
 
<p>Allows for global expansion. </p>
 



 
<p>Having an automated solution that meets appropriate regulatory requirements makes it simpler to expand service into other countries. More and more countries are accepting automated AI solutions as part of KYC.</p>
 
 



 The challenges of integrating AI into KYC procedures 



<p>There are also challenges and difficulties with the implementation of AI and machine learning. For a fuller discussion of these, see <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/challenges-fintechs-ai-kyc-id-verification/">IDnow’s blog on the challenges of fintech AI integration</a>.</p>



<p>When AI is used as part of customer onboarding, adopters need to consider customer expectations and experience. Users need to feel that interactions are secure. They also want fast results without errors or delays – this will become more pronounced as AI use expands.</p>



<p>As well as these KYC issues, fintechs need to be aware of standard problems with AI techniques. This includes having access to sufficient data for training. </p>



<p>AI and machine learning algorithms rely on data for training, and this should be complete, thorough, and representative. Sufficient human input and oversight are needed and should be managed to avoid introducing hard-to-detect bias.</p>



 Increasing global acceptance by regulators 



<p>Of course, any technology used in the financial services sector needs to comply with strict regulations. This is sometimes a challenge in the fintech sector, where technology use often advances faster than regulations.</p>



<p>KYC and AML regulations in most countries do not directly discuss technical implementation details. </p>



<p>Nevertheless, more and more national regulators are permitting the full use of AI techniques. These include the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Belgium, and Finland. </p>



<p>Other European countries permit video-based KYC. Germany is a tightly regulated market, and it now accepts an element of automation combined with a manual review.</p>



<p>The trend is set for the acceptance of full AI to increase, and this is giving fintechs and financial institutions the confidence to adopt AI for expansion.</p>



 Final thoughts 



<p>Regulation of fintechs is a complex area and one that is still developing. As fintechs and their technology use continue to advance, regulations and oversight ensure its safe long-term growth.</p>



<p>There have been big improvements, and many areas are now well regulated. The use of AI and automated identity verification is certainly one of these. </p>



<p>Regulation is now well established for the use of AI with KYC and AML. This can lead the way for fintechs to comfortably adopt new technologies that are faster, cheaper, and safer, and help them grow.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the right implementation provides a much-improved user experience. </p>



<p>Going forward, more users in more locations will come to expect a reliable, safe, and fast onboarding experience. With the right technology in use, fintechs can easily offer this.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Raj Hegde</a></p><p>The decentralized identity paradigm disrupts traditional identity and access management ecosystems and requires a more democratic collaboration and competition among several identity and credential issuers.&nbsp;Dr. Michele Nati from&nbsp;IOTA Foundation will elaborate on this challenge in his Combined Session&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5081/1">Making SSI accessible: IOTA technology, solutions and projects</a> on Thursday, May 12, at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2022">European Identity and Cloud Conference 2022</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Michele some questions about his presentation.</p>
<p> </p>
 How important is SSI in healthcare? 
<p>First of all, just a very quick intro to SSI, SSI is Self-Sovereign Identity. So this means that people are the owner of their own identity, so they can create their identity, which is basically an identifier. And they can control where these identities share. So but identity in itself is not enough, identity is meaning when to our identity, we attach attributes and these attributes come from so-called credential issuance. And so those that can issue this attribute in form of verified information, information that can be verified. Again, is this done in a self-sovereign way means that the user, that the subject can control who gets access to this account with these credentials. Especially in healthcare, this is very important because healthcare is now a collection of information spread everywhere, to my doctor, my GP, my dentist, the emergency room, when I have to go to the hospital, and so on and so forth. All of this is very, very difficult to recombine together. So they need a unique identity that represents me that can be the aggregator of all of this information. All of these pieces of information are basically different attributes, a different credential that belongs to my identity. So with the SSI, we really have now the power to make a much more coherent story. This story is about the health of a person, about different kinds of pieces of information about a person and access to them. Access that is controlled by the individual. And this is not only in my country because if I move and I go to another country, and the identity comes with me, it's self-sovereign. I don't need to register again with another health system in another country. That country, with my self-sovereign identity, can find this information about my GP, my dentist, and so on and so forth. So there are two advantages, much more and better-controlled flow of information that I always oversee as a patient, but as a user of health systems in different ways and forms, and of course saving of cost and better care for me because when it's possible to give you the right service for the right information about my health, all of it would be beneficial for me and also saving for whoever I have to provide this is health service that doesn't need to have the step of every time to go and finding the information to provide you the better service. So all of this will change very much and bring a lot of new, let's say, ways of delivering health care in different countries and across countries.</p>
<p></p>
 Do we need SSI only for patients or also for medical devices? What are the challenges in both cases? 
<p>Well, that's a very good point. So yeah, there are two dimensions. One, it's again, like you said, my information, information about me with the subject health information. And that's very well controlled and defined with self-sovereign identity. But it's true that most of the information comes also from the device that I'm wearing, either for medical prescription or for pleasure. So if I wear a smart garment that can collect additional information about my health, lifestyle, how healthy and how much physical activity I do, this can be also information that will be useful to link as additional, maybe nonqualified credential. But still, credentials come from a trusted source like the provider of the service, of the monitoring device that can be solved by this device with an identity that then this linked in a unique way to me and to my identity and all the information again that's linked as a part of my profile, that would be beneficial. But there are also other devices like I am prescribed by the doctor to wear some insulin pump or so on and so forth for my condition and all of these devices need to be traced in that supply chain. So I need to be sure that I get the right device. I get the device that it's not creating a threat for me because these devices now are all connected, devices that can be also the target of some threat, some attack. So every device that all along the supply chain, has one identity, and this identity is used to collect information about how good is this device, how much this firmware is updated, how much that manufacturer gives me assurance that what I'm wearing, it's certified and a safety device so this doesn't endanger my health but improve and give me more information and give me a safe way to manage my health so all of this will be needed. So that's one of the reasons to stop all this sort of criticism that we see that is told about an IoT device. So an IoT device that is well-identified along the supply chain with a self-sovereign identity that the user at some point when they register to get the device, can control it, can collect all the information that the device carries with it, and then share and then verify. That's also the value in the health ecosystem for self-sovereign identity.</p>
<p></p>
 What about GDPR compliance? What projects are you working on this topic? 
<p>GDPR compliance is very important. The major topic to consider when you talk about self-sovereign identity. On the one side, self-sovereign identity, it's probably the best expression of GDPR and data protection where the user is empowered to control and protect his own data. But GDPR and SSI have also a few other things that have to align because as SSI if you want to go back very quickly to the technology behind SSI, it's only possible thanks to blockchain so the concept emerged in the blockchain. So and the idea of having a blockchain where people or manufacturers for the use of a health care device in this context that they produce, store a unique identity on the ledger. This allowed to basically when presented information that this identity collects in terms of verifiable credential attributes either for me or my device for a third party or line party. This information can be verified immediately. So there is no need to complex integration that requires a centralized setup there where information is stored about the device, about the patient, and so on and so forth, which can also bring at least an attack from a GDPR point of view this information can be accessed. It can be stolen and can create a single point of failure denial of service attack. So when we remove all of this with blockchain, it is possible then to verify this information immediately because the identity is written in the ledger, and by verifying the identity, basically by issuing that credential from the ledger, I can verify the authenticity of this convention, this attribute about me or my device. But we need to be careful that the only information is on the ledger is an identity. So because otherwise, with the GDPR we'll face issues about personal data being on the ledger, being stored on a blockchain, and this will conflict with, let's say, GDPR, let's say, rights like that could be forgotten. Need to guarantee that user that his data can be updated, erased, and so on and so forth. We'll conflict with that. This system can be the sign-in that GDPR compliant way where credentials sit off-chain, sits in that user wallet, a wallet the user control maybe as running on his mobile phone, stored on his mobile phone with his credentials that can automatically be presented when a party requests and verified using the blockchain. So this is the way we have to implement GDPR compliance in SSI systems, putting a lot of emphasis on where the information would actually store beyond the identity identifier and create a secure, and from a user experience point of view as well, easy to use wallet for storing credentials.</p>
<p></p>
 &nbsp; 
 What is the relevance of EU work and the digital wallet initiative? 
<p>Probably coming back quickly to the previous question. We are doing this actually, all of this, thinking and all of these designing GDPR compliant SSI solutions for people, identities and attributes, and their device in the medical sector, is part of our product. We are currently involved as part of the work we do with the IOTA foundation at the European level, which is called Second. And we are actually targeting working with the health institutions, research and medical device companies, and so on and so forth. Part of this large project that started this year, will run for the next three years with a pilot in a different domain for, let's say, safe assistance of people in case of emergency. So ambulance will know information about you immediately by accessing information from your digital wallet without delay, or any further assistance to you. So these are a few of the projects we are discussing and will work on with European partners. But we are not the only one on that, this is specific to the target innovation that the European Commission is funding and supporting. But of course, the European Commission is going further, establishing guidelines and requirements on how this crucial element of SSI and managing of identity, GDPR compliant, need to be developed, which is the European Digital Identity Wallet. So that's at the European level, we are also looking at, we are also trying to create a digital wallet that every user will have, will be issued by the Member States or an appointed issuer of the digital identity wallet by the Member States, and they will have to comply to different requirements. The original requirement in terms of security of the credentials stored on their mobile phone device, so that every person has its own identity and attributes within every time, everywhere it goes can present to [...] services how these can be securely stored. How can these securely be presented to a third party that can be first authenticated before we share information? All of this, it's part of what we follow very closely and for which we are also working with the IOTA foundation and other academic partners and experts in security that are helping us to design a wallet that will be new compliant thoughts in that domain. So are these are the two things that we are doing in different public projects.</p>

<p>Cybercrimes have become a much more significant threat than real-life crimes throughout the last few years, as they are so frequent nowadays. Stealing data from mobile phones and computers has become an enormously profitable business — robbing people of their identities, money, and personal information.</p><p>But luckily, one term flipped on the Internet over a decade ago — VPN. The first VPN (then named PPTP) dates back to&nbsp;1996.</p><p>This technology has let people control their online privacy and enjoy browsing without worrying about someone trying to use their data without permission.</p><p>What is VPN, how does it help people, and which are the best VPN deals today? Let’s find out in the&nbsp;article.</p> WHAT IS A&nbsp;VPN? <p>No one wants their data to be tracked. Whether it’s for ad purposes or malicious attacks, people prefer their searches to be encrypted.</p><p>A virtual private network (VPN in short) creates a private network across a public network and lets you send and securely receive data. It makes sure that your internet communication is safe from prying eyes and&nbsp;hackers.</p><p>A VPN also creates a “tunnel” between your computer and the remote servers, and it helps you use the Internet without restrictions or limitations.</p><p>In other words, the VPN is a “mask” that encrypts your information before you log it&nbsp;online.</p><p>Also another trend is Mobile VPNs. They allow businesses to extend their private network and private applications across public networks — by connecting a device or computer to a private network. They can gain access to a secure, high-speed, encrypted tunnel to move data securely between the two networks.</p><p>Across multiple devices and platforms, corporations can ensure that their employees have secure connections between their devices and their remote offices without sacrificing performance. And how big of a role VPNs played when the pandemic has hit and cyber crimes&nbsp;spiked!</p> HOW DO YOU PICK THE BEST VPN PROVIDER? <p>No matter what kind of software customers pick, they are always looking for an exclusive deal they can get from reputable VPN providers. But which are the criteria for identifying the best VPN deal you can make. Let’s&nbsp;see.</p> PRICE <p>If you’re tempted to find the cheapest VPN services or go for something “free,” you should know that nothing comes for free. If you go for the most affordable option available, you’ll sacrifice bandwidth speed and get bombarded with ads. And that’s a minor evil. Some unreliable VPN providers can even sell your data. Does it make sense to protect your data from person A to see it used by person&nbsp;B?</p> SECURITY <p>With the growing demand for VPN services, it’s no wonder that new companies are popping up left and right. Many of these have been started by individuals who might not have any experience in internet security. Before committing to a long-term subscription with a VPN provider, make sure the other side is secure&nbsp;enough.</p> REPUTATION <p>When looking for a VPN, it’s essential to do your research. There are countless VPN comparisons and reviews available on the web. Some of them are paid advertisements, and others are independent analyses. It can be extremely challenging to tell the difference between the two, so make sure you trust quality sources before purchasing. The “best deals” might be wannabes with bought&nbsp;reviews.</p> CHECK THE HOME COUNTRY OF YOUR&nbsp;PROVIDER <p>VPN providers must follow the laws of their home country. Although these laws can be confusing and are constantly changing, it is crucial to know where your VPN is from. Before you decide, check where your provider is located and the right to be served a warrant by authorities.</p><p>Unlimited data, unlimited devices, and all that sounds great — but if it is at the expense of data leaks, is it worth it? Try to find providers based in countries that are more liberal, and the governments won’t force them to spy on&nbsp;you.</p> ENSURE YOU HAVE READ THE PRIVACY&nbsp;POLICY <p>Many users tend to “check” everything without reading the blueprint. And that’s a&nbsp;mistake.</p><p>If you want to prevent your personal information from being shared with third parties, it’s crucial to look at the privacy policy and know what your VPN provider is sharing. Some providers may share customer data with third parties to track user trends and preferences or profit from their audience. Always research VPNs to ensure reliability before committing to a VPN subscription..</p> TOP VPN DEALS&nbsp;TODAY <p>Good VPN services offer a lot of value for your money. Let’s see some of the big names&nbsp;here.</p> NORDVPN <p>NordVPN is the first name that comes to our mind when we mention VPN. And rightfully so. Over the years, it has consistently delivered good results on all types of devices — mobile phones and computers.</p><p>With its presence in 59 countries and over 5400 servers, NordVPN is one of the best options for a VPN if you’re looking to access geo-restricted content. Because of its good speeds, it’s also great for streaming in HD. Best yet, NordVPN is highly secure thanks to military-grade encryption and an automatic kill switch that blocks all data in the event of a dropped connection.</p><p>It isn’t the fastest provider on the market, though. Some servers are running at 1GBps, but NordVPN is rapidly advancing, and soon all of their servers will have 10GBps capacity.</p><p>One huge update for NordVPN is that the company is heavily investing in its servers rather than renting, so it’s even a better situation now. On top of that, the company resides in Panama. As a result, NordVPN isn’t obliged to track and share your&nbsp;data.</p><p>NordVPN can work on Windows computers, Macs, iOS, and Android, meaning you can access it from any device. Speaking of gadgets, one account can access up to 6 devices simultaneously, which is a pretty fair deal for such a big name in the industry.</p><p>Unfortunately, there isn’t a free version, but the paid ones are not expensive at&nbsp;all.</p><p>Let’s see the pricing&nbsp;plans:</p>  €10.49 is their monthly cost if you pay month by&nbsp;month.  €10.49/month is the annual plan, too. However, for the first year, you can get it for €52.68 or €4.39/month.  The best deal is the biennial one which you can get for €69.36 or €2.89 per&nbsp;month!  <p>The interface is user-friendly and easy to navigate, its Windows client is pretty good, and all of its mobile apps are great for their ease of use. Its expansive network of servers provides users with unmatched flexibility. And did we mention that it comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee?</p><p>It’s worth giving it a shot. There is nothing to lose at the end of the&nbsp;day.</p><p><a href="https://www.monetha.io/rewards/nordvpn-25/">https://www.monetha.io/rewards/nordvpn-25/</a></p><p>Get up to 320 Monetha points per euro you spend on NordVPN with the Monetha&nbsp;app.</p> PUREVPN <p>PureVPN has been a leading provider of online security and privacy since 2007. To date, it’s built over 6,500 servers around the world (78 countries) — one of the most extensive server networks on the market. The company also has a very wide range of features: 256-bit encryption with OpenVPN and IKEv2/IPSec, DNS and IPv6 leak protection, no logs policy, an automatic kill switch, and port forwarding to bypass firewalls.</p><p>It used to cover more than 100 countries in 2021. However, the company policy changed to select only servers with higher speeds and security standards. Many servers are switching from 10GBps to 20GBps, which is a lovely sign for&nbsp;users.</p><p>On top of that, you can use PureVPN on all types of devices — it runs on Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android. It also supports Android TV, as well as Amazon Fire&nbsp;TV.</p><p>PureVPN can be used on up to 10 devices simultaneously, which is excellent news. It also moved from Hong Kong to the British Virgin Islands and now passed the strict no-logging policy&nbsp;test.</p><p>As for the price, it comes with three&nbsp;plans:</p>  The standard monthly plan costs $10.95 with a 31-day money-back guarantee  The annual plan is $3.24 per month with a 31-day money-back guarantee  A two-year plan costs $1.99 per month and then $4.49 per month. You also get 3 months free of&nbsp;charge.  <p><a href="https://www.monetha.io/rewards/purevpn-55/">https://www.monetha.io/rewards/purevpn-55/</a></p><p>Get up to 320 Monetha points per euro you spend on PureVPN with the Monetha&nbsp;app.</p> PRIVATE INTERNET ACCESS&nbsp;VPN <p>Private Internet access (or PIA in short) is a top-notch VPN provider. Currently, the company that owns ExpressVPN and ZenMate (Kape) is at the helm, so that’s good&nbsp;news.</p><p>It has over 35,000 servers in more than 80 countries worldwide, which is a staggering number! However, some slow 1GBps servers are gradually replaced with NextGen 10GBps serves and better RAM management hardware is in place to ensure sensitive information won’t get into the wrong hands if the servers lose&nbsp;power.</p><p>Private Internet Access VPN is available across all types of devices on all major operating systems — Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and Android TV. You can link up to 10&nbsp;devices.</p><p>PIA excels at bypassing VPN detection software, making it an excellent deal for accessing streaming services like Amazon Prime Video, Netflix,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Let’s see how it performs price-wise:</p>  The monthly plan is €9.29, which is not a bad deal, as typically, these plans are more expensive.  The annual plan is €37.19 per year or €3.10 per&nbsp;month.  The best deal is €70 for 3 years which equals less than €2 a month&nbsp;(€1.79).  <p>It is undoubtedly a very well-priced option and what we liked is that you can ask for a refund more than&nbsp;once.</p><p><a href="https://www.monetha.io/rewards/private-internet-access-vpn-105/">https://www.monetha.io/rewards/private-internet-access-vpn-105/</a></p><p>Get up to 480 Monetha points per euro you spend on Private Internet Access VPN with the Monetha&nbsp;app.</p> ATLAS VPN <p>Atlas VPN is a competent VPN provider that offers a decent all-around service for some of the lowest prices. It has support for WireGuard, for instance. You get iOS, Mac, Windows, and Android apps, a “kill switch” to protect you if the VPN drops, and a SafeSwap feature if you need to swap IP addresses while connected to a server. There are also ad and malware blocking and data breach monitoring alerts.</p><p>When it comes to servers, Atlas can’t be proud of what it offers — 750 servers across 48 locations, predominantly in Europe and USA, so it’s not a viable solution for global users but more than a good one for Europeans and North Americans. It was recently bought by Nord (the company that owns NordVPN), so it will benefit from development, and we can see progress in that direction.</p><p>Atlas VPN offers the essentials of privacy protection with AES-256 encryption. Atlas comes with a private DNS system to help keep your information safe.</p><p>But what sets this VPN among the best VPN services are the extras: like rotating IP addresses to help you avoid government tracking and the ad and tracker blocking system. I think any privacy concern is solved on this&nbsp;app.</p><p>Let’s see how this app does in terms of&nbsp;pricing.</p>  Free plan available — though it is capped at 400MB data consumption/day, it is still a decent&nbsp;option.  The monthly subscription is €9.69 per&nbsp;month.  The annual subscription is €2.90 per month for the first&nbsp;year.  For only €63.04, you can use AtlasVPN for 36 months(or €1.75/month). It’s one of the cheapest VPN deals on the market right&nbsp;now.  <p><a href="https://www.monetha.io/rewards/atlas-vpn-180/">https://www.monetha.io/rewards/atlas-vpn-180/</a></p><p>Get up to 480 Monetha points per euro you spend on Atlas VPN with the Monetha&nbsp;app.</p> BLUFVPN <p>BlufVPN is a new, simple VPN service provider established in 2020. It’s interesting to see how young it is and how well its functionality is working. Feature-wise, it has a lot of similarities with other VPNs; let’s take a closer&nbsp;look.</p><p>Firstly, it does perform exceptionally well on Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS, which is quite good. The servers are over 500 (which isn’t much by any means) in more than 70 locations. It allows 5 simultaneous connections — a bit underwhelming.</p><p>BlufVPN offers 256-bit AES encryption to operate your data and hide it from any hacker. They offer various tunneling protocols, including IKEv2, UDP, TCP, and OpenVPN. The Windows client automatically uses OpenVPN, whereas the Android app defaults to IKEv2. You’re free to change the protocol as you&nbsp;wish.</p><p>It can successfully stream Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and HBO Max and has an autorun option which means it will launch immediately after you turn on your&nbsp;PC.</p><p>Let’s see the pricing plans or&nbsp;BlufVPN.</p>  €9.99 is the monthly price if you pay month by&nbsp;month  €3.49/month is what you will pay if you subscribe yearly (€41.88).  The best deal is €2.00/month or a total of €72.00 for three&nbsp;years.  <p><a href="https://www.monetha.io/rewards/blufvpn-79/">https://www.monetha.io/rewards/blufvpn-79/</a></p><p>Get up to 240 Monetha points per euro you spend on BlufVPN with the Monetha&nbsp;app.</p> VUZEVPN <p>VuzeVPN is a fairly new VPN service. Its name might ring a bell with torrent maniacs because it’s related to the popular Vuze BitTorrent. However, this VPN service has the potential to be a strong competitor in the&nbsp;market.</p><p>There’s a zero-log policy, but the servers available are just over&nbsp;200.</p><p>It didn’t use to support devices other than Windows, but now we can see it’s much better now. You can access it on a Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Android &amp; Android TV, and other smart TVs. It supports up to 5 streaming devices simultaneously, which isn’t that much, but it compensates with a “kill switch” feature that’s a must-have to protect your online&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>VuzeVPN operates in US territory, which means citizens might have their online activity spied on because of the “Fourteen Eyes” intelligence-sharing program.</p><p>But how good is VuzeVPN when it comes to&nbsp;pricing?</p>  €10.99 is the monthly plan which is a bit expensive.  €7.99 is the 6-month plan which also isn’t that&nbsp;great.  €4.99 is the price if you get the annual subscription.  <p><a href="https://www.monetha.io/rewards/vuze-vpn-109/">https://www.monetha.io/rewards/vuze-vpn-109/</a></p><p>Get up to 400 Monetha points per every euro you spend on VuzeVPN with the Monetha&nbsp;app.</p><p>Download the Monetha app on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.monetha.identity&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=direct">iOS</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.monetha.identity&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=direct">Android</a>, build your profile, earn rewards and make the most out of your&nbsp;data.</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://www.monetha.io/best-vpn-deals/">https://www.monetha.io</a>. on April 11,&nbsp;2022.</p>

<p>WeChat: The Play-to-Earn model has been booming in the blockchain gaming industry for players to earn rewards and incentives while playing. However, developers are now exploring the Play-to-Own opportunities, boosting the game’s appeal to non-crypto audiences based on value creation and value distribution. Players need a solid gaming experience and engaging content to earn more, and developers can also build open economies to create self-sustaining blockchain games. Ardor blockchain has been covered in this article as the blockchain-as-a-service solution for developers leveraging the decentralized ecosystem, that is now moving to the Play-to-Own model. One example is Mythical Beings, a P2E card collection game on Ardor blockchain.</p>

<p>Read more about timestamping and its concepts at <a href="https://medium.com/finema/trusted-timestamping-part-1-scenarios-9bf4a7cc2364">Trusted Timestamping Part 1: Scenarios</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/finema/trusted-timestamping-part-2-process-and-safeguards-f75286a0c370">Trusted Timestamping Part 2: Process and Safeguards</a>.</p>Family of standards related to timestamping<p>Above is a diagram illustrating the family of standards for timestamping services. Below are brief explanations about them. Each yellow-colored arrow indicates that the standard on the terminal end makes use of the preceding one. Each gray-colored arrow indicates that the standard was updated from the previous one. Three lines indicate that the standards are pretty much equivalent.</p> Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #7: Cryptographic Message Syntax&nbsp;(CMS) <p>This standard is the forefather of all. It describes the general syntax of data to which encryption may be applied. It also allows arbitrary attributes, such as signing time, to be authenticated along with the content of a message, and provides for other attributes such as countersignatures to be associated with a signature.</p> RFC 3161: Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Time-Stamp Protocol&nbsp;(TSP) <p>This is the main standard for PKI-based timestamping. It describes the format of a request sent to a TSA and of the response that is returned. It also specifies some security-related requirements for TSA operations regarding the processing of requests to generate responses.</p><p>An identifier for a timestamping certificate has to be included in each timestamp. How it is computed (ESSCertID) was previously stipulated in RFC 2634: Enhanced Security Services for S/MIME, and currently RFC 5816, which contains an ESSCertIDv2 update for RFC&nbsp;3161.</p><p>(In the EU, RFC 3161 is adopted and constrained through <a href="https://portal.etsi.org/webapp/workprogram/Report_WorkItem.asp?WKI_ID=39366">ETSI EN 319&nbsp;421</a>.)</p> ETSI EN 319 1X2: Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI) <p>The use of electronic signatures combined with PKI-based timestamps by means of a CMS container is standardized by RFC 5126, which is then adopted by ETSI and modified for containers in other data formats, namely PDF, XML, and recently&nbsp;JSON.</p>  CAdES (CMS Advanced Electronic Signatures) is a set of extensions to Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) signed data making it suitable for advanced electronic signatures.  PAdES (PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures) is a set of restrictions and extensions to PDF and ISO 32000–1 making it suitable for advanced electronic signatures.  XAdES (XML Advanced Electronic Signatures) is a set of extensions to XML-DSig recommendation making it suitable for advanced electronic signatures.  JAdES (JSON Advanced Electronic Signatures) is based on JSON Web Signature and contains the features already defined in the related ETSI standards for AdES (advanced electronic signature/seal) applied to other data formats including XML, PDF, and&nbsp;binary.  <p>Whether PKI-based timestamps are used, and in what way, is differentiated into profiles, from basic (no timestamps) to long-term archival (with extra data embedded for long-term verifiability).</p> RFC 4998: Evidence Record Syntax&nbsp;(ERS) <p>This standard helps with long-term verifiability of timestamps by means of linked tokens. It specifies the syntax and processing of an evidence record, a structure designed to support long-term non-repudiation of existence of data. ERS extends and generalizes this approach to all formats of data to meet the needs of long-term archiving services.</p> RFC 3628: Policy Requirements for Time-Stamping Authorities <p>Similar to CAs, TSAs should establish its policy and practice statement, declaring what requirements it meets in order to operate in a way that users can trust. This standard defines the basic time stamp policy requirements of a TSA that issues timestamp tokens backed by public key certificates with an accuracy of 1 second or&nbsp;greater.</p><p>(In the EU, the equivalent of RFC 3628 is <a href="https://portal.etsi.org/webapp/workprogram/Report_WorkItem.asp?WKI_ID=39370">ETSI EN 319&nbsp;422</a>.)</p> ISO/IEC 18014: Information technology — Security techniques — Time-stamping <p>The ISO/IEC 18014 is divided into four parts. The first two parts talks about the overall process and indepedent timestamp tokens comparable to RFC 3161. The third part is about linked tokens comparable to RFC 4998. Lastly, the fourth part talks about the traceability of time sources for the TSA and how the TAA comes to play a role in continuously monitoring TSAs.</p>  Part 1: Framework  Part 2: Mechanisms producing independent tokens  Part 3: Mechanisms producing linked&nbsp;tokens  Part 4: Traceability of time&nbsp;sources  <p>Currently, only Japan’s JIS X standards about timestamping implement ISO/IEC 18014. Japan is known for its efforts in accurate timestamping. The use of independent tokens is standardized in JIS X 5063–1, whereas time source assessment is found in JIS X 5094. Information in ISO/IEC 18014 is used in JIS X with modifications, which are in turn also adopted by ISO/IEC 18014 in later revisions.</p><p>In the EU, Parts 3 and 4 are not comparable to any ETSI standards.</p><p>There are many standards about timestamping from around the world. Common ones are as mentioned in this blog article. Some standards are applicable across many different countries, and some become models for more countries to follow. Although there are no absolute standards or rules to determine how timestamping should be done (e.g. whether it should be PKI-based), it is always better to comply your timestamp implementation of choice with some international standards.</p><p>In conclusion, there is no standalone standard. Hence, there are always connections between different sets of standards. Timestamping standards also rely on cross-interactions between different standard bodies and communities from different countries, many of which contribute to the international standards of timestamping we have nowadays.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/trusted-timestamping-part-3-family-of-standards-f0c89a5e97ab">Trusted Timestamping Part 3: Family of Standards</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/finema">Finema</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Entities involved in timestamping <p>Listed here are entities involved in the provision of timestamping services. All of them may not be present in actual implementation. It is up to each country to pick and choose what’s suitable for their assurance requirements.</p>  Timestamping Authority (TSA): a third party trusted to issue a timestamp  Time Assessment Authority (TAA): an entity which audits the ‘time’ aspect of timestamping services and may also disseminate time to the&nbsp;TSA  Timing Centre (TC): an organization with a means to disseminate the ‘UTC(k)’ time to a TSA with the required&nbsp;accuracy  Certification Body (CB): an entity which makes sure the TSA complies with standards and issues certificates as evidence of&nbsp;that  Accreditation Body (AB): an entity which designates certification bodies  Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS): a general term describing any satellite constellation that provides positioning, navigation, and timing services on a global or regional&nbsp;basis  Certificate Authority (CA): an entity which issues a certificate to attest to the TSA’s ownership of the public key associated with a PKI-based timestamp   Briefly about&nbsp;UTC(k) <p>UTC(k) is an approximation of UTC given by a time laboratory k that contributes to the precision of UTC itself, which the BIPM (the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures) maintains. The BIPM regularly publishes the difference between UTC(k) and UTC (so that a precise UTC value for any moment can be known retroactively).</p><p>What’s important here is that the role of a timing centre, if the issuance of timestamps is to comply to ISO/IEC 18014–4, can only be taken by those time laboratories in coordination with the BIPM. The list of them can be found in, for example, the <a href="https://www.bipm.org/en/time-ftp/circular-t">Circular T</a>. In case of Thailand, k is the National Institute of Metrology only.</p> Process: How timestamping works   The client computes a hash digest of the document to be timestamped and sends it as part of the request to the&nbsp;TSA.  The TSA adds a date and time to the hash digest, electronically signs* the combination, and sends back that timestamp to the requester.  After the client receives the signed timestamp, it can be recorded with/within the corresponding document, data, or&nbsp;code.  <p>(* Because an electronic signature is involved, the timestamp is PKI-based.)</p><p>The picture above showed the flow of a timestamp being requested and then processed for the client. Below is a more detailed picture of how a trusted timestamp is composed and how to verify&nbsp;one.</p>Getting a PKI-based timestamp from a trusted third&nbsp;partyChecking the correctness of a timestamp Timestamps and electronic signatures <p>For high-profile online transactions, even slight risks of data breaches are rather not overlooked. Aside from the risk that your account information might get hacked by unauthorized people over the internet, document integrity is also a major concern. Advancement in technology makes modifications to documents, photos, and videos more difficult to detect, and their authencity impossible to verify. PKI-based timestamping can elongate the verifiability of a document’s electronic signature and affirms the document’s integrity as long as the timestamp’s electronic signature remains verifiable.</p><p>Using digital signatures for both the timestamp and associated document is part of what makes Advanced Electronic Signature (AdES), specified by ETSI standards, robust. AdES not only uniquely links the signature and time of signing to the signatory, but also provides for long-term validation and archival. Users can create an ETSI-standardized container to sign AdES for PDF, XML, and documents in other formats. Other advantages of AdES are that they are accepted as legally valid and enforceable in many countries, are proven fast and efficient, and reduce the production and consumption of paper documents.</p> Safeguards: How timestamping is ensured to be trustworthy General overview of timestamping oversight<p>Above is a diagram illustrating a general overview of how to ensure that a TSA can be trusted. The solid gray-colored lines indicate that the respective parts are mandatory, while the dashed lines indicate that the respective parts are optional (with at least one route selected). The blue-colored lines are about the dissemination of time. The green-colored lines are about&nbsp;audits.</p>European Union model for timestamping oversight<p>The European Union uses the eIDAS Regulation to establish trust-service standards in each member state. The AB (typically referred to as a national accreditation body) is responsible for designating entities competent as CBs (called ‘conformity assessment bodies’ in the EU). Upon passing certifications and audits, TSAs are put in a national trust list, which is established, maintained, and published by a supervisory body (which could be the same agency as the AB or a different one). Note that the EU model is not compliant with ISO/IEC 18014–4, as there are no TAAs to continuously monitor the&nbsp;TSAs.</p><p>Below is a diagram illustrating how Italy implements the EU model for timestamping oversight.</p>Entities involved in the quality assurance of timestamping services in Italy. The list of CBs are <a href="https://www.agid.gov.it/it/piattaforme/firma-elettronica-qualificata/organismi-valutazione-accreditati">here</a>. The list of Italian organizations capable of disseminating UTC(k) can be found in <a href="https://www.bipm.org/en/time-ftp/circular-t">BIPM’s Circular&nbsp;T</a>.<p>In contrast, below is a diagram illustrating Japan’s model for timestamping oversight.</p>Japan’s model for timestamping oversight<p><a href="https://www.nict.go.jp/en">NICT</a> offers information about GPS common-view measurements and UTC. <a href="https://www.dekyo.or.jp/tb/contents/english">JADAC</a> (the name written in Japanese on the top right) is the AB which operates, maintains, and manages the overall accreditation program, while also certifies TSAs. JADAC cooperates with NICT and members from private industries, academia, and the government in overseeing the timestamping services. Like the TSAs, the TAAs are also from the private and business&nbsp;sectors.</p><p>From physical to digital, timestamping provides document security and helps keep track of the creation and modification times of a document. It acts as protection which could also be used as proof in some contexts. The difference between a timestamp and a trusted timestamp is that the latter implements a data structure called timestamp token, issued by a trusted third party acting as a&nbsp;TSA.</p><p>Now that we understand how PKI-based timestamps are issued, and how to ensure TSAs can be trusted.

<p>About Episode</p>
 
 
 
 One of the desired outcomes of using standards-driven open source code projects is to avoid vendor lock-in. If your digital identity is a public good, then you shouldn’t be locked in to one specific company. If a company goes out of business, I may lose my identity data. If I find a better alternative, I’m unable to port my identity. Therefore, interoperability is a vital aspect of being able to provide sovereignty to individuals but also to governments. 
 
 
 
<p>Some of the key questions answered during this episode with Joachim are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 
 
 What are the different lenses of Interoperability outside of simply technological ones? 
 
 
 What is happening inside the EU’s digital identity governance frameworks? 
 
 
 How to go about preventing vendor/network lock-ins from the wallet perspective? 
 
 
 Does ID proofing impact the ability to achieve permissionless SSI models?

<p>È già possibile intravedere il futuro delle piattaforme di gestione dei consensi e sarà abbastanza differente rispetto a quello che ci hanno abituato a vivere le big tech, come Facebook e Google. L’alternativa è affidarsi a piattaforme disegnate per consentire l’empowerment giuridico dell’interessato, semplificando l’esercizio diretto dei diritti, attraverso una modalità di dialogo più ampia e flessibile con il titolare, che invece avrà dalla sua parte la possibilità di una gestione multi-livellare delle proprie funzioni.</p>



 Perché Yesnology 



<p>Non una semplice piattaforma di gestione dei consensi, come quelle di Facebook e Google, ma un servizio più ampio e più flessibile di interazione diretta tra interessato e titolare (dunque anche esercizio del diritto di opposizione, per esempio, o di consultazione di informative nella loro successione storica). Il punto decisivo è che si tratta di un servizio multi-titolare. L’idea, e in questo è visionaria, di YN è quella di creare uno one-stop-shop per l’interessato, che gli faciliti enormemente (anche in termini di tempo) il controllo sui suoi dati personali, rispetto cioè a più titolari. L’aspetto significativo è che non viene realizzato un trattamento accentrato, che sarebbe pericoloso, o un incrocio di dati, ma i vari titolari sono segregati tra loro.</p>



 L’evento, patrocinato da ANORC, sarà in diretta su DIGEAT PLUS

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Alejandro Leal</a></p> Managing business in today's geopolitical context 
<p>In the face of a geopolitical crisis, concerns are growing about the threat of cyber-attacks to global supply chains and private organizations, which are already in a precarious state due to the Covid-19 pandemic. When a crisis occurs, business continuity and corporate resilience are essential. Both require a company-wide response. In this context, geopolitical risk assessments are integral to a secure IT environment.</p>
<p>With the advent of cyberspace, state and non-state actors have been willing to challenge the political and economic order by using both conventional and unconventional means. Through the use of unconventional methods, in particular cyber-attacks, state-sponsored actors and hacktivists can achieve relative geopolitical and economic gains without the use of force. Data breaches, espionage, sabotage, misinformation, supply-chain disruptions, and cyber-attacks are some examples of unconventional means used by attackers. If cyberspace enables a new sphere for state and non-state actors to engage, are cyber-attacks the continuation of politics with other means?</p>
 Countering politically motivated cybercrime 
<p>Politically motivated cyber-attacks, however, are not easy to detect because the emergence of a “grey zone” makes it difficult to distinguish between a non-intentional failure or a malfunction from a cyber-attack. The emergence of private actors in cyberspace further complicates this issue because it is unclear if an attack on a private entity constitutes an attack against a state. If a mechanical failure or denial or service occurs during a period of geopolitical tension, the possibility of escalation and conflict could arise.</p>
<p>In addition, politically motivated hacktivists may pose a threat to corporate reputation by using social media to harm an organization and spread misinformation. Because of hacktivists' high visibility, organizations must increase their efforts in crisis communication and internal response. Although hacktivists do not have the same level of sophistication as nation-states, they are usually less concerned about hiding their online tracks and tend to be much more vocal.</p>
 A Shared Responsibility: Public/Private partnership in cyberspace 
<p>Given the current geopolitical climate, every organization must act with extreme urgency to secure its information technology infrastructures. As rogue nations continue to foster an environment for cybercriminals and ransomware attackers to thrive, organizations need to be prepared and build a strong security foundation while encouraging public-private sector cooperation regarding cyber threats.</p>
<p>To improve cybersecurity in key industries and critical infrastructure, organizations in the private sector need to be prepared for an unprecedented level of malicious cyber activities and work together with the public sector to protect critical assets. As we clearly saw in the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/understanding_solarwinds">SolarWind case</a>, a breach can result in a national security crisis regardless of how small the company is.</p>

			<p>Asset tokenization is the process to dematerialize financial instruments on blockchain, and many institutions have already taken actions: <a href="https://www.eib.org/en/press/all/2021-141-european-investment-bank-eib-issues-its-first-ever-digital-bond-on-a-public-blockchain">The European Investment Bank</a> and <a href="https://www.societegenerale.com/en/news/press-release/first-structured-product-public-blockchain">Société Générale</a> have tokenized 100 million euro bonds respectively in 2021; <a href="https://www.swift.com/news-events/news/exploring-tokenised-assets-collaborative-innovation-action">SWIFT</a> announced plans to explore tokenized assets this year. HSBC predicted that the market <a href="https://www.gbm.hsbc.com/-/media/gbm/insights/attachments/potential-of-tokenisation.pdf">could reach 24 trillion USD by 2027</a>. Not long ago, <a href="https://www.ashurst.com/en/news-and-insights/legal-updates/the-luxembourg-stock-exchanges-admits-distributed-ledger-financial-instruments-on-its-sol">Luxembourg Stock Exchange</a> admitted security tokens listing.</p>
<p>It is obvious that the institutional adoption of tokenized securities has begun. Decision-makers must act quickly to avoid losing market share. Suitable and secure tokenization platforms will be the catalyst for further growth of the adoption, as both compliance and security come down to coding on the blockchain.</p>
 Huge potential to save costs and improve liquidity 
<p>Traditional capital markets are underpinned by many fragmented and siloed networks with barely any interoperability between them. This leads to an industry that is slow, inaccurate, and costly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Over the past few years, most financial institutions have studied how tokenization can change this by using shared and distributed ledgers to create a fully digitized experience for investors, reduce compliance and administrative costs for themselves, and improve the liquidity of assets.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rolandberger.com/en/Insights/Publications/Tokenization-The-future-of-financial-markets.html">Roland Berger’s study</a> projects that tokenized equity could reduce €4.6 billion on the trading costs by 2030. It accounted for only one asset class, when all other asset classes are taken into account, the cost savings will be much higher.</p>
 The technology gap needs to be bridged 
<p>While financial professionals have a greater understanding of blockchain technology and its benefits, one question remains: how can they technically tokenize new or already existing securities and still comply with regulations?</p>
<p>As compliance rules are encoded into security tokens, eventually, it becomes a technical matter. Institutions can choose to build their own tokenization platforms, which will take years to develop; or decide instead to find a technology partner, who provides a complete infrastructure with user-friendly interfaces designed for non-blockchain users. The latter option may be preferable since institutions can benefit from the protection of the technical shields provided by experts, freeing financial actors to focus on what they do best: provide high-quality assets and services to investors.</p>
<p>Regardless of their choices, it is essential to ensure compliance rules are well written into security tokens and enforced throughout the lifecycle of asset-backed tokens, as securities regulatory rules must be followed. This can only be achieved by issuing assets as permissioned tokens to set rules and linking them to the digital identities of asset owners.</p>
 Code compliance rules through permissioned tokens&nbsp; 
<p>Permissioned tokens act as automated compliance validators, transactions can only be triggered when pre-written eligibility conditions are met. For example, <a href="https://tokeny.com/erc3643">ERC-3643</a>, an official smart contract standard for permissioned tokens, allows issuers to encode investor rules and offering rules into tokens. This assures that token transfers only occur when all conditions have been satisfied in both the primary market and the secondary market.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			 Guarantee ownership of tokenized assets with digital identities&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>While all the rules are well encoded into the permissioned tokens, the key to ensuring compliance is the digital representation of identity on the blockchain. There are many solutions in the market that whitelist wallets for compliance checks. However, a wallet is like a browser for blockchain, whoever knows the private key can access it, so who owns the assets in a wallet?</p>
<p>Furthermore, identifying wallet owners is a regulatory obligation for issuers, therefore, linking security tokens to holders’ identities is the solution to this legal requirement. An onchain identity is like a blockchain account for investors, and they can connect as many wallets as they want to it.</p>
 Complexity beyond using standard smart contracts 
<p>When an issuer creates a simple ERC-20 token, the smart contract is the key element because there is no lifecycle management per se. We can see some features, such as “burn in your own wallet” features used by Binance, or “address blacklisting” features in Tether, but that is mostly it.</p>
<p>However, when an issuer represents a financial instrument on the blockchain, all securities rules need to be followed to ensure compliance, requiring the issuer to be able to manage asset-based tokens at any time. Managing complex smart contracts functions, one-by-one or in batch, with blockchain addresses can quickly become a nightmare for users. Errors will keep popping up and the learning curve will be very difficult for the operational teams. Software, which scans the blockchain in real time, reconciles blockchain and investors’ data, and helps to prepare complex blockchain-based operations via user-friendly interfaces, is mandatory to truly benefit from this shared infrastructure.</p>
<p>Here are some highlighted functions a complete tokenization platform should provide:</p>
 
 Smart contract management: There are hundreds of functions in permissioned token smart contracts, the platform needs to ensure every action triggered by issuers in the system by simply clicking buttons or filling in human-readable information translates well into code and executes on the blockchain. 
 Useful data aggregation: The system needs to aggregate relevant data from blockchain to present them in an insightful format (e.g. real-time cap tables) for both issuers and investors. 
 Security: Security of the system is critical, but most importantly, extra security measures such as multi-sign or custody solutions should be integrated as the owner of smart contracts has full control over permissioned tokens. 
 Recoverability: Issuers have obligations to return tokenized assets to their owner in the event of wallet loss, a recovery process must be provided. 
 Permission delegation: Issuers need to delegate specific permissions to their trusted agents to improve efficiency or comply with regulations, therefore, a permissioned system is needed. (e.g., grant token recovery function to a custodian). 
 Confidentiality: As required by law (e.g., GDPR), investors’ privacy needs to be protected while compliance is enforced. 
 Cost and speed of transactions: The system must provide solutions to solve the gas fee issue to ensure low-cost and high-speed transfers of tokenized securities.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
 
 Cross-chain capability: As asset tokenization is becoming popular, the interoperability of tokenized assets needs to be provided to make sure assets are not locked in one single blockchain forever, paving the way for further improvements of asset liquidity. 
 …<br>
 
 
 Leave technical complexity to the expert and thrive in prosperity 
<p>The function list goes on, resulting in many technical obstacles. The speed of adoption, therefore, relies on the development of resilient and secure solutions that can provide all functions required while ensuring compliance. Fortunately, after years of development, mature technology platforms have emerged and are used by many asset issuers, such as <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-platform/">T-REX Platform</a>.</p>
<p>To stay competitive, institutions that want to modernize their assets using blockchain technology should work with existing reputational technology providers to quickly and securely provide cheaper, faster, and better financial services through tokenization to their existing and new clients, gaining a larger market share.</p>

 New innovations create new opportunities to make a&nbsp;profit <p>Exciting times — Ocean V4 is here and it’s bringing a whole host of new possibilities. We’re absolutely delighted to deliver this huge upgrade — we hope you’re as excited as we are! Now if you’re wondering about how you can profit from some of these innovations — you’re in the right place — in this article we will be looking at how the community can monetize various parts of the recent V4 developments.</p><p>Let’s face it, new innovative ways of making money is one of the most impressive things about all the advances in blockchain technology over recent years. You’ll be pleased to hear that Ocean V4 is no different — we’re delivering even more ways for you to monetise your&nbsp;data!</p> What’s New? <p>Broadly speaking, there are already three ways to generate income with&nbsp;Ocean:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/477b3decad51#bb75">Publishing &amp; Selling&nbsp;Data</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/477b3decad51#fe64">Providing Liquidity For Datatoken Pools</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/477b3decad51#692b">Running Your Own Data Marketplace</a>  <p>Each of these has received an upgrade in V4 for more revenue upside, and more flexibility in setting&nbsp;fees.</p><p>In addition, we have introduced a fourth way to make money with&nbsp;Ocean:</p><p>4. <a href="https://medium.com/p/477b3decad51#7922">Running Your Own&nbsp;Provider</a></p><p>In this article, we will briefly cover (1) and (2), then go into more detail on (3) and (4) as the fee structure has seen a big shake-up. Finally, we take a look at how the wider Ocean community benefits from all of&nbsp;this.</p><p>If you would like to know more details about the fees, we recommend reading the Ocean Developer documentation that lists the detailed fee schedule, <a href="http://documentation%20link">here</a>.</p> Publishing &amp; Selling&nbsp;Data <p>As always, the first question to ask when you’re thinking about making money through Ocean is — do you have data that you can monetise?</p><p>Ocean V3 introduced the new crypto primitives of “data on-ramp” and “data off-ramp” via datatokens. The publisher creates ERC20 datatokens for a dataset (on-ramp). Then, anyone can access that dataset by acquiring and sending datatokens to the publisher via Ocean handshaking (data off-ramp). Being useful assets, datatokens typically get priced via pools. As a publisher, it’s in your best interest to create and publish useful data — datasets that people want to consume — because the more they consume the more you can earn. This is the heart of Ocean utility: connecting data publishers with data consumers.</p><p>The datasets can take one of many shapes. For AI use cases, they may be raw datasets, cleaned-up datasets, feature-engineered data, AI models, AI model predictions, or otherwise. (They can even be other forms of copyright-style IP such as photos, videos, or music!) Algorithms themselves may be sold as part of Ocean’s Compute-to-Data feature.</p><p>Ocean V4 introduces data NFTs, which open up new opportunities. To get started, we recommend reading our article on d<a href="https://medium.com/p/5804a2d88671">ata NFTs</a> and all of the possibilities that they&nbsp;bring.</p><p>The first opportunity of data NFTs is the potential to sell the base intellectual property (IP) as an exclusive license to others. This is akin to EMI selling the Beatles’ master tapes to Universal Music: whoever owns the masters has the right to create records, CDs, and digital sub-licences. It’s the same for data: as the data NFT owner you have the exclusive right to create ERC20 datatoken sub-licenses. With Ocean V4, this right is now transferable as a data NFT. You can sell these data NFTs in OpenSea and other NFT marketplaces.</p><p>Data NFTs also open up new approaches for fractional ownership of your data asset’s base IP. Fractional ownership means that you can now sell “shards” of your data IP to investors or collaborators. This is especially suited to data DAOs (data unions,&nbsp;etc).</p><p>If you’re part of an established organization or a growing startup, you’ll also love the new role structure that comes with data NFTs. For example, you can specify a different address to collect revenue compared to the address that owns the NFT. It’s now possible to fully administer your project through these&nbsp;roles.</p><p>In short, if you have data to sell, then Ocean V4 gives you superpowers to scale up and manage your data project. We hope this enables you to bring your data to new audiences and increase your&nbsp;profits.</p> Providing Liquidity for Datatoken Pools <p>The second well-established way to profit from Ocean is by providing liquidity to datatoken pools (datapools). We introduced datapools as part of the dynamic pricing feature within Ocean V3. In providing liquidity, you get a cut of the swap fees for that pool. The more swaps there are and the more liquidity you’ve provided, the more fees you earn. You can try to predict which datasets will have the most trades via your own assessment of the dataset’s quality, and allocate your liquidity accordingly.</p><p>Pools were an instant hit, but we quickly realized there was room for improvement. One of the issues we noticed was how the pools were very susceptible to rug-pull attacks, which is obviously very concerning to anyone trying to make a&nbsp;profit.</p><p>Ocean V4 introduces one-sided staking to solve the issue of rug pulls from the Publisher (or any other whale in the pool). We’ve created a one-sided bot that matches your incoming OCEAN stake by minting datatokens into the pool. Similarly, when you un-stake OCEAN, it burns datatokens. Therefore, the ratio of basetokens (e.g. Ocean tokens) to datatokens is kept constant during staking or unstaking. It sounds like a simple solution but it works really well. The possibility of a rug-pull from a whale is completely removed.</p><p>We’re really proud of how we’ve managed to make staking in pools so much safer. If you’re interested in learning more about how it all works, we recommend reading our recent blog post on <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-v4-one-sided-staking-93988f65e378">safer&nbsp;staking</a>.</p> Running Your Own Data Marketplace. <p>Next up is the big one — all the new fees that can be implemented when you run your own marketplace. We have always been super encouraging of anyone who wishes to fork Ocean Market and make their own data marketplace. With the latest V4 release, we have taken this to the next level and introduced more opportunities for upside, and even more fee customisation options.</p><p>Upside opportunity: The main new upside opportunity is, unlike in Ocean V3, the marketplace owner can take a cut of swaps (in addition to a cut of consume). V3 showed 10x-100x or more swap volume than consume volume, so this could lead to a significant revenue bump for V4-powered marketplaces.</p><p>Another new upside opportunity is using your own ERC20 token in your marketplace, where it’s used as the unit-of-exchange and for staking in the datatoken pools. This is fully supported and can be a great way to ensure the sustainability of your&nbsp;project.</p><p>Fee customization options: In V4, the marketplace fees are now far more flexible and you have more options at your disposal. The fees can be split up based on the action within the marketplace that generates the fee: consuming, swapping, and publishing. Let’s explore each of&nbsp;them!</p> Consume Fees <p>Whenever anyone consumes an asset on any Ocean market it will generate fees. In Ocean V4 we have also opened up the possibility that you can make money from assets sold on another market if it was published on yours. The following fees apply to the consumption of data&nbsp;assets:</p><p>Consume Market Consumption Fee: This is simple enough — whenever someone buys a data asset they pay a fee to the marketplace where they consume the asset. The fee is set as an absolute value, so it will be the same for every purchase. This fee already existed in Ocean V3 but now we’re giving you complete flexibility to set your fees at any level and in the currency you prefer to receive them&nbsp;in.</p><p>Publisher Market Consumption Fee: This is a new way of making money from any asset published on your marketplace. No matter where the asset is consumed — via another marketplace or even directly via the smart contracts and ocean libraries — you will always receive this fee. This is pretty cool but to make it even better, you get to choose which token the fee is paid in. So if you’re if you want to receive your fees in USDC, consumers will have to send USDC to you even if they’re consuming the asset in a market that doesn’t use USDC. This fee is set as an absolute&nbsp;value.</p><p>Provider Consumption Fees: This is another new one for Ocean V4. On any consumption, a fee will now have to be paid to the provider that the asset is using to encrypt the&nbsp;URL.</p><p>Ocean Community: As before, we also have an Ocean community fee in place. This is here to fund projects that promote the long term growth of Ocean. For the moment, the fee has been set to zero but it can be increased in&nbsp;future.</p> Swap Fees <p>Swap fees are collected whenever someone swaps a datatoken for basetoken (e.g. OCEAN) or basetoken for datatoken. The swap could be inside a pool (using an automated market maker), or in a fixed-rate exchange. As with consume fees, swap fees can be charged by both the marketplace where the swap takes place and the marketplace where the asset was originally published. These are the fees that are applied whenever a user does a&nbsp;swap:</p><p>Publisher Market swap fee: The owner of the marketplace will define both the fee amount and the address where the fees should be sent. These fees can be applied to assets with dynamic pricing (sold via a pool) and assets with fixed pricing. For assets sold via a pool, the fee amount is set when the pool is created and cannot be changed later, while for fixed priced assets the fee amount can be changed. In both cases, you can update and change the address where the fees are sent at any&nbsp;point.</p><p>Consumer Market swap fee: The owner of the marketplace where the swap is taking place can define a swap fee for any swap that happens inside a pool. It is different, however, for swaps of fixed-priced assets — in this case, only assets that are using the Enterprise ERC20 template can apply swap fees in the consumer market. There are no consumer market swap fees for Datatokens that use the standard template. The Enterprise ERC20 token template isn’t only for use in enterprise marketplaces, it is also used within Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p><p>Liquidity Provider Fees: As with V3, we also have a fee that is shared among the liquidity providers. This revenue stream acts as an incentive for liquidity providers to join the pool and add liquidity. This fee is set by the pool creator when they create the pricing for the asset, the default fee is 0.1%. The pool creator may wish to increase this fee to incentivise more people to provide liquidity to the pool. The amount of liquidity in the pool is a useful indication of which assets the community considers to be the most valuable.</p><p>Ocean Community Fee: There is also a community fee applied to swaps. These fees are reinvested in community projects via Ocean DAO and other initiatives. It’s always important to consider how we ensure the long term sustainability of Ocean — funding community projects is one way for us to achieve that. This fee has been set to 0.1% (as long as either Ocean or H20 are used as the base token in the market), however, if you are using any other token as your base token (e.g. Ether or any other ERC20 etc) then a community fee of 0.2% is applied to all&nbsp;swaps.</p> Publish Fees <p>For the moment no fees are charged to a publisher when they publish an asset, so that’s nice and simple. However, we have left the potential for you to implement publisher fees in your own marketplace if you wish — you would have to add an extra transaction in the publish&nbsp;flow.</p><p>In many ways, it is better to leave publisher fees at zero to encourage as many people as possible to publish in your market. However, we recognise that every marketplace serves a completely different audience and publisher fees may be appropriate in your&nbsp;case.</p> Run Your Own&nbsp;Provider <p>Now this is a completely brand new opportunity to start generating revenue — running your own <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/provider">provider</a>. We have been aware for a while now that many of you haven’t taken up the opportunity to run your own provider, and the reason seems obvious — there aren’t strong enough incentives to do&nbsp;so.</p><p>For those that aren’t aware, Ocean Provider is the proxy service that’s responsible for encrypting/ decrypting the data and streaming it to the consumer. It also validates if the user is allowed to access a particular data asset or service. It’s a crucial component in Ocean’s architecture.</p><p>Now, as mentioned above, fees are now paid to the individual or organization running the provider whenever a user downloads a data asset. The fees for downloading an asset are set as a cost per MB. In addition, there is also a provider fee which is paid whenever a compute job is run, which is set as a price per&nbsp;minute.</p><p>The download and compute fees can both be set to any absolute amount and you can also decide which token you want to receive the fees in — they don’t have to be in the same currency used in the consuming market. So for example, the provider fee could be a fixed rate of 5 USDT per 1000 mb of data downloaded, and this fee remains fixed in USDT even if the marketplace is using a completely different currency. It also doesn’t matter if the pricing of the asset is fixed-rate, set dynamically, or free — the provider fee will still&nbsp;apply.</p><p>Additionally, provider fees are not limited to data consumption and swaps — they can also be used to charge for compute resources. So, for example, this means a provider can charge a fixed fee of 15 DAI to reserve compute resources for 1 hour. This has a huge upside for both the user and the provider host. From the user’s perspective, this means that they can now reserve the suitable amount of compute resources according to what they require. For the host of the provider, this presents another great opportunity to create an&nbsp;income.</p> Benefits to the Ocean Community <p>We’re always looking to give back to the Ocean community and collecting fees is an important part of that. As mentioned above, the Ocean Protocol Foundation retains the ability to implement community fees on both data consumption and datatoken swaps. The tokens that we receive will either be burned or invested in the community via projects that they are building. These investments will take place either through Ocean DAO, Ocean Shipyard, or Ocean Ventures.</p><p>Additionally, we will also be placing an additional 0.1% fee on projects that aren’t using either the Ocean token or H2O. We want to support marketplaces that use other tokens but we also recognise that they don’t bring the same wider benefit to the Ocean community, so we feel this small additional fee is proportionate. This fee is set at the contract level so you can be sure that it won’t increase in future. It will apply to any pool and the fee is taken in the basetoken of the&nbsp;pool.</p> Profitable &amp; Self-Sufficient Projects <p>Our intentions with all of these updates are to ensure that your project is able to become self-sufficient and profitable in the long run (if that’s your aim). We love projects that are built on top of Ocean and we want to ensure that you are able to generate enough income to keep your project running well into the&nbsp;future.</p><p>With this in mind, we have aimed to deliver improvements for you irrespective of the type of project you are&nbsp;running:</p>  If you’re selling data you can benefit from Data NFTs. This means you can sell your IP (or part of it) and benefit from all the new roles when managing your project with&nbsp;others.  If you’re contributing liquidity to datapools, you will benefit from the new and much improved safer staking. No more stress about rug-pulls!  If you’re running your own data marketplace you now have so many more options on how to raise revenue and charge your customers. And the fees can still apply if the asset is bought in a marketplace other than your&nbsp;own!  For the first time, you can now also create profit for yourself by running your own provider. This also means that you can charge for compute resources  <p>We also recommend reading about <a href="https://medium.com/p/5804a2d88671/">what data NFTs are and the benefits they bring</a> and all the details on our new <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-v4-one-sided-staking-93988f65e378">safer staking in&nbsp;pools</a>.</p><p>As always, if you’ve got any questions or want to give us feedback, don’t hesitate to head over to <a href="https://discord.gg/TnXjkR5">discord</a> or <a href="https://t.me/OceanProtocol_Community">Telegram</a>.

<p>Hi everyone and welcome to this SEO identity community meetup for January 2022. We are very excited to have Gabriel Rene with us today and our topic is how web 3.0 will connect humans, machines, and AI to transform the world. Before we get started we would like to have a few words from heather dahl, CEO of Indicio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heather</p>
<p>Hi Maya, thank you, welcome to everyone, I’m excited to kick off the first of our monthly meetups for 2022. We are moving into our just second year of providing this type of content to the community, and I think the topics that we tackle and the experts that we bring on bring really intriguing conversations. I want to give a special welcome to anyone who’s here and new to our community, it’s so cool to see in the chat where everyone’s coming from. Hamburg, I heard a shout out from Brussels, Dublin, go Fairfax, Virginia, we have Seattle, Canada, by all means if you’re new to the meetup or you’re returning, add your location to the conversation because I think it’s really interesting that we bring together this global community. For those of you who aren’t familiar with Indicio, we are a public benefit company, and our mission is to advance decentralized identity. A part of our mission is running educational events like this, and because we’re out there building ecosystems for trusted data, today’s topic we find really exciting, absolutely provocative, excited to see Gabe here, and to talk about the internet of everything, and what it means for people and digital objects and non-digital objects to provide identity and to communicate with each other in ways that are secure and trustworthy. Ken was supposed to be here today to lead the conversation but he couldn’t make it, so senior architect Sam Curren is here to lead the conversation and interview with our absolutely terrific guest, Gabrielle Rene, thank you all for being here and I’m gonna turn it over to you Sam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Thanks Heather, and and thanks Gabriel for being here, I guess we should start with an introduction, that’s appropriate, Gabriel is the architect of the spatial web, it’s a vision he’s described with his co-author Dan Mapes, in the international best-selling book titled the spatial web, how web 3.0 will connect hans machines and ai to transform the world. He’s the executive director at VERSUS lab and the spatial web foundation, and he and his team are bringing this vision to life. The groundbreaking hyperspatial markup language is currently being discussed at a new working group with the IEEE, both web 3 and the metaverse have been recent hot topics in the last couple of months but the spatial web is where the real becomes virtual and the virtual real. So welcome to Gabriel Rene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me Sam, thank you Heather, and Ken when you watch this hopefully we’re doing you proud, good work. on your behalf so Sam thank you, thanks for hosting me today, and it’s an honor to be here and have a chance to speak to everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Excellent, I’ve been stunt doubling for Ken in a few areas and I’m not as good looking as Ken is but I’ll do my best. So excellent all right, let’s dive into some questions here, and please answer with whatever you think is relevant, and we can take this discussion wherever we need to go. So you’ve described the spatial web as the internet of everything and you’ve thought a lot about what the internet of everything will look like, what do you see?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well the first thing I see is a more holistic approach to the concept of the application of network computing technologies, like the internet, and a lot of times what tends to occur is that perspectives on emerging technology are industry specific or technology specific. We talk about AI or we talk about XR, we talk about IOT or we talk about blockchain, and we talk about quant, or it’s by industry, this applies to the government or this applies to supply chain which applies to retail and this applies to healthcare. So these narratives are constantly emerging where we even have these themes: human 2.0, we have dialogues around web 3.0, industry 4.0, and the Japanese are talking about society 5.0. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all of those cases almost the exact same set of technologies are being discussed, and it’s the usual suspects I just rattled off. Some people started talking about the internet of things a handful of years ago, this idea that it wasn’t just the internet where we had sort of interconnected communications, but rather these physical connected smart devices would form this new network. That was very exciting, it remains exciting, we’ve yet to see a whole lot of it work. I can tell you that the smart home struggle is real, and interoperability is at the heart of every problem. So this idea that you can connect things is one level, then there’s another debate about things being smart. So at one level you’ve got the internet of things, and then there’s been spatial computing, which has really emerged around this idea and is now re being repackaged again into the metaverse narrative, which you might call the internet of non-things, or sort of virtual things, that are not things or “what are they” things. And then there’s been this idea that is the blockchain folks saying that the internet of money, or the internet of trust, it sort of starts to intersect with the work that your community is doing. And there’s the internet of intelligence thing, which is the AI folks attempt early on the semantic web again. Whether we use the internet, or the web, or some sort of talking variations of this kind of a network where the data is intelligent or smart in and of itself. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The term smart, which has taken over everything, so there’s a smartphone that was the first thing, it’s just a computer, but that’s fine it’s a smartphone. Why? Because it has some connected capability, and in the beginning smart meant connected. As machine learning and deep learning found its footing over the last decade. The idea of things becoming smart meant actually being intelligent to the feedback loops, adaptive smart home now means that your nest adjusts the temperature for you, and that the lights turn on and off based on some feedback loop or information. Then of course we’re talking about smart cities, and so we go from smartphones, smart things, smart cars, smart cities, the idea is that these cities become intelligent and adaptive. Your autonomous car is able to just drive. Because, traffic is this sort of amorphous thing, like a bunch of starlings moving through. Drones and automated functionality that the amazon go, vacation of everything, you walk into a store, you take what you want, you walk out. All these sort of smart functions that might be built into government services, and all this sort of future sci-fi smart city narratives, but when I spoke to a community of smart cities four years ago in Europe, cities that came together to explore this, their number one thing was well how do we connect with other smart cities? So how do we form a network of smart cities? Well smart cities with all these smart cars and smartphones and smart devices and smart things with these internet and web connections across these various sets of interests and industries forms what you might call a smart world. And that idea that you’ve got this global cyber physical network now that encompasses all of these things, and that the addressability of an object isn’t just that it’s connected, it might just be that it’s being viewed by a camera, it could be an object that has no internet connection in and of itself, but this network has its own, and it’s essentially showing up on the network, that network we call the spatial web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Really good explanation, so a natural follow-on to that, I realize that web 3.0 has become a loaded term. You used it first in the title of your book, obviously, so it’s recorded there, but it’s come to mean some different things in recent times. Using sort of your original meaning of web 3.0 why doesn’t web 2.0 already solve this? What is missing from what we’ve got today that we need to go where we need to go?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well there’s a handful of things, and I think that some of the architects of web 1.0 have lamented about some of the infrastructure decisions that were made at the time. Now there were technical limitations or practical limitations, hardly anyone actually cared, but there were debates around identity and privacy and security, there was a tendency, being academics and scientists, not to think too deeply into all of the societal implications of these technologies. So the anticipation that people would use this for good, and not for personal, selfish, or otherwise harmful ends was the default. “Oh it’s gonna be this awesome network and we’re gonna do information sharing” great, problem solved. Decades of work had gone into that, from the ARPAnet all the way up into the world wide web, where you have Tim Berners-lee pulling a bunch of threads together and stitching that into what became the backbone of this amazing communications network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identity was actually one of the real missing ingredients in my opinion, and that anonymity part, the thing that makes the web open is also the thing that makes the web dangerous. The hackers, trackers, and fakers that are permeating our lives from simple sort of issues around misrepresentation, all the way to identity theft, all the way to now ransomware, and we’re about one hop away from biotech, and people being able to hack devices that were what we’re wearing, or that are on our bodies, or that are in our bodies, and so the the openness of the web is a double-edged sword that seems to cut both ways. That allowed the web 2.0 era organizations and companies to maximize the capital potential of that structure, and so they essentially monetized that openness, that anonymity was a function of the sort of the fact that you didn’t have an identity, so we’ll rent you one. We’re google here’s ours, we’re Facebook here’s ours, apple here’s one for you as well, how about one for linkedin and facebook? Alright so we all run around with these sort of two-dimensional avatars, locked in these digital fighters where we serve certain functions. We get certain services from that, so i don’t think that a pure polarized view on this looking at web 2.0 is inherently negative is fair or accurate, but these are major holes in the architecture that allowed for this type of capitalism to thrive in a new dimension, and that thriving has compromised some of the inherent freedoms, and some might say human rights. Now It’s becoming part of the debate: what property do we own here with respect to our data? And I think that those holes have produced really horrific outcomes, like not just on the monetization side, but on how we are programmed into wanting or thinking certain things. One of those things are products and services, whether those things are our own ideas about ourselves and our identity and our self-image, or whether it’s our viewpoint on the effectiveness of vaccines and science, and what political representative we think is in our best interests. You can no longer separate the technical work that we’ve done here with the web and our societal implications, and that’s the real zeitgeist challenge that I think we face at this moment. It requires some new ways of thinking about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’ve talked about some architectural adjustments that would get that will help get us there, one of one of those pieces of architecture i think is the hyperspatial markup language, HSML, that is part of your work at the IEEE, can you describe what HSML will help us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah, so just one quick parenthetical, and it’s a function of a little bit of us copying something. It is HSML, but it’s hyperspatial modeling language instead of markup language, although there was quite a bit of debate internally about whether that was an accurate description. The function of a market language and a modern language are different, but depending on your perspective, in this case it is about modeling at the heart of it. How do we model the world digitally in a way that is coherent with the way that humans cognize the world? And I provide that caveat because there are other ways of cognizing the world that we’re unable to be aware of, and that is not what our concern is with respect to what we need to teach machines or AIs. We need to ensure that they can cognize the world in a way that is similar, or compatible, or at least incorporates our understanding of reality. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What HSML does is it functions in a sort of semIOTic structure of forming the core elements, in which there are 12, that act like a language. So just like nouns, verbs, prepositions, and adjectives are sufficient components with which to construct descriptions and representation of reality that predominantly is all we’re using today. Like today I’m just using magic mouth sounds to paint pictures in everyone’s heads, and if I had it with squiggly lines it would do nearly as well. But if i could just do what we’ve been able to see some whales and some dolphins do which is actually just project an entire three-dimensional holographic representation of this particular bay, and the position of all the fish, kind of like a sonar snapshot, and just send that to you 20 miles away, “like hey the party’s over here, here’s where the fish are guys” that might be another way to communicate. So HSML enables multiple IOT devices to do what’s called sensor fusion, or data fusion, even policy fusion. So you can take information from sensors, we take information from databases, and you can take policy related information laws, or instructions, or whatever, and you can fuse those together into a multi-layered scene graph, which is a way of representing the information about any set of activities in any given space. All of the objects in the space, all the users in the space, all the activities in space, all the permissions in the space, and at the end of the day that it is intended to enable you to construct descriptions of states of things, and then describe workflows for what needs to happen, so you could conceivably program all the smart things in your house to work in a very certain particular way, one could inform another one, and this could then extend all the way out into the city, and so forth and so forth to the world at large. So the idea of making a standard here in the in many of the same ways that HTML allows us to structure content and information on pages, HSML lets us structure context and information in spaces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So I like that the modeling of context is a sign of something that sort of begun to happen, but without much organization. So when the web was new it was a new location, we would visit websites and we would go there and it was all about this new world and this new place, and honestly web 2.0 was a lot of that too. IOT starts to get a little interesting because now there’s this internet of things, but the things generally exist in real life and also on the internet, so it’s blending now between there. Of course now we’ve got augmented reality, and virtual reality, and a lot of things that pull that together, so when we think about all this stuff that in the real life that’s sort of blending together with a digital life that means like a proliferation of cameras and sensors and objects that we can interact with etc. So this means identity for everything, which is great. But there’s some implications here that the tinfoil hat wears among us, and I occasionally wear one of a particular shape. What are the implications of all of this interconnectedness upon the privacy we have and maybe governance that can help us with that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, so that was the question we started to ask ourselves back in 2016, which was all of that connectedness, all of that capability, all of that monitoring was going to happen anyway. Like that was the clear thing that was happening, so then the question became okay can you ensure certain levels of interoperability? And you need that in order to enable governance, if things are not interoperable you can make as many rules as you like, and it doesn’t it doesn’t matter. So what there’s a bit of a logical cake here, coherence is the first requirement, if you have coherence then interoperability is a function of your description of coherence. What is or isn’t coherent, like if you can describe the physics of the environment, and you want to say how you navigate through it, you can’t do it until you’ve done the first part. And then governance is a function of saying well what you can or cannot do are the ways that you must then navigate that environment, or who can when and what time and all sorts of all the parameters of activity management or activity governance. Because governance at the end of the day is really about changing states in the world. It’s not a theoretical function, it’s a practical function, and so that was what we saw as being really the scariest thing I’ve ever noticed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this cyber stuff is going to get all interconnected, you’re going to end up with this internet of everything. Which there was no term spatial web in that sense, the GIS community had been using it for many years, but not in the sense that we saw this multi-dimensional, multimodal sort of thing, it was like okay this internet of everything is going to happen, there are a handful of real challenges with that, including the possibility for abuse and looking at how wonderfully we did the web 2.0. this was just going to cascade into essentially black mirror, that’s what we’re all concerned about. So it was at that time that identity became clear to me that it was a fundamental infrastructural architectural requirement. Having been in telecom before that, and looking at telemedicine services, that was when I started looking at blockchain and the idea that you might need to own these assets related to your medical history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> I wasn’t interested in crypto in the beginning, Bitcoin seemed interesting, but not enough for me to buy any or care, blockchain looked really interesting, and this idea that you would own your sort of property. At that point I started looking for what kind of new identity structure, or what would become like a spatial web url, some sort of key identifier, and that’s when I came across the work that many of you on this call were pioneering. You were working on it before that of course, but also like right around that time, and that was a real eye opener, and it frankly made it possible for us to focus on the other bits. Because it was like this community is completely dedicated to the identity, in our version of this the human is one of those entities, or one of those actors, but every single object, including conceptual objects, can have a DID in the spatial web, and all of these are sort of structured using HSML, and some of these other ontology and taxonomy structures you’re looking at to maintain that coherence. That then grants you this ability to do governance, which gives you the second portion of this of the standard, which is called HSTP, which is hyperspace transaction protocol. What that does is it basically says “okay cool world give me all the information of the states of all these objects, users, actors,” and again they could be holographic objects in that space that that you otherwise wouldn’t be aware of, the IOT device isn’t going to pick that up, but the space knows that it’s there. You sent me something to this room so I could present it on this call as an example. I wanted to get this exact “xyz” position and I knew it was coming. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today one challenge is that you can send anything you want to my email address, I can’t stop you, you can come to my website, I can’t stop you, in fact you can send money to my eth wallet, and I cannot prevent that. But in the spatial web those everything is sort of permission based, and so that ability to then transport objects users activities and the governance around those is described in HSML, and essentially activated using HSTP, which says what are those states, i would like this state to change this way, or if the state changes what is or isn’t allowed in this case in this space, and HSTP says that transaction has passed or failed. So if only Heather is allowed to enter this room, if the temperature is x, and the time of day is y, and her facial expression or other biometric information says she’s in a certain state, all of which are just inputs that would be happening with any modern technology, but now could coherently say okay Heather’s at the right state the door can open and if she’s not then then the door remains closed. So this becomes you are able to program cyber physical activities, and define the governance for those if you were an authority of that space, and so that is the key sort of requirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>I think that it’s important that this doesn’t invent some brand new type of authority, but rather gives existing authorities the ability to express the rules about what they have authority over. So our house still remains our house, and I posit that we’ll have even more control over what’s actually going on in it from a digital perspective than we do today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes and so you could ensure that nothing is installed in your house, if it doesn’t make a certain threshold of some privacy standard, or that requires some certificate, if it doesn’t have it, it can’t it can’t be there, or it can’t turn on. The city could say drones are only allowed to fly in the city in these specific flight lanes, and if they have cameras on them those cameras are allowed to be on, but the drone cannot fly within five miles of the airport. it can’t have its cameras on when it’s flying over schools, or certain private properties, or certain zones, and all this can be spatially defined as if it were a video game. But now you can do it in the physical world in any digitally mediated set of functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>And that’s an incredibly powerful piece of this, so to switch gears just a little bit, we’ve talked about the blending of the digital and the real life thing, but with it with better technology that we’ve got for for things like virtual reality, you can now sort of have a spatially aware virtual thing, instead of a website that we’re looking at as a docent on a screen. So how do these same concepts apply in a pure virtual space? Where I might be in a fictitious world rather than in real life, and what’s the blend between the real and the virtual?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I love that question, so if you’ll allow me to nerd out for a moment, if you’ve seen the original avengers series of movies that marvel put out, there’s a moment where you get the arc of bruce banner and the hulk. It’s like when he can or cannot become the hulk, and everyone’s afraid he’s going to do it, in the final scene of the first avengers movie they’re like “Bruce get angry”, and he goes “that’s my trick I’m always angry”. So the the parallel here is that it’s actually always virtual, in one instance it must map to the physical world, in all other instances it doesn’t need to. So a harry potter world or the death star rendered in a 3d engine somewhere can have all the exact same authorities, and policies, and functions that apply. Vader is allowed to apparently strangle people at the helm of the thing, and Dumbledore, if he does something wrong the ministry fires him for a couple weeks, he’s got to go into hiding. So there are actually policies and things that exist in these virtual spaces, as we look at things like decentraland, and ownership, and NFTs, and assets and rights around this we’re going to need certain guarantees around what we can trust in these environments. How these authority structures are set up what is transparent, and and what we can investigate, what we can audit and so building property in a virtual world that you don’t ultimately have ownership of, or you can’t take those assets somewhere else, for example you don’t have any rights in roblox or fortnite they can do whatever they want, it’s a corporation they own it they can just change it, and change all your assets, change your skins, they can just flip the whole thing they can sell it, they can take the company public, there’s all kinds of other functions and interests at play. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if we expect and of course it seems natural that we’re going to want digital assets, they are becoming increasingly valuable, they’re also becoming increasingly more realistic, and to that degree at some point even experiences themselves will be indistinguishable from reality. Our senses are not that sophisticated, and you have people like Elon and others working on neural link, and others working on neural dust, that at some point are not going to require any sort of ocular interface. There’s not just a singularity of AI, there’s a singularity of reality that is a whole consideration that’s coming, so having certain guarantees around these environments will become increasingly important. This whole move with cryptocurrency, which is native internet money, and now NFTs, which are really smart assets, well not yet, they’re smart receipts to a virtual asset. I think DID’s really get you all the way across the line there, and HSML by the way would allow you to describe the asset in such a way that it would match up. So with the IDs in HSML I would know all these attributes down to color, texture, size or whatever is that version of that thing, and not just a receipt that says that I own something which could be copied a thousand times. A bit wondering of an answer but hopefully that hit a couple of notes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>No, that’s fantastic, so I want to draw something out a little bit. You sort of talked about how the same applies when I brought up this virtual versus real thing. You said real is the only instance where it actually needs to line up with reality and all these other things can exist virtually as well, that sounds like the metaverse has been talked about by a lot of folks and facebook audaciously renamed themselves to sort of try and own the space. What’s the difference here between the hyperspatial web that you see and the vision of the metaverse that facebook or other companies might be interested in offering?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Okay great question, so i think that i’ll try and provide a nuanced answer. I actually think everyone is making their best attempt to describe the same thing, which is an open and interoperable network. I think the battle right now is not for Facebook to become AOL, everyone’s seen this we’ve all seen this game before, like you don’t you don’t ultimately win with a closed version of this thing. In fact facebook thrives on an open web so that’s not a requirement that they sort of close their borders and they’re going to defend those borders, i think the battle right now is who’s the wordpress of the metaverse. Where are you going to go to build your sites, your stuff, who’s going to provide all the services, all the plugins, all that. So it’s not about Facebook changing their name to Meta and then saying we’re all about the metaverse, even though they’ve been the least arguably the least trustworthy brand in the modern era since I don’t know, Exxon. We go towards well they want to keep doing the same thing and making money the same way and that’s what Meta is for. I don’t actually think that, I think this is a massive pivot for the company, and that they’re doomed. I talk about this in the book. I don’t think that surveillance capitalism will be a profitable business in 10 years. I think it completely comes apart, look at GDPR right now saying google analytics is not going to work here anymore. That’s his web 2.0 getting smashed, these pillars are already coming down, and I think Mark Zuckerberg has seen this coming since the day he walked in to lucky palmers and put on something that was a space and realized that he had a company about a book. He must have said “oh it’s no longer about pages it’s about spaces” and we’re just seeing the arc of that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark wants an economy, he wants to build the largest economy with the largest amount of services to capture the most. Now people will willingly give over their data in order to optimize and maximize all kinds of inputs and data services around that. He doesn’t have to stay in that same game, and if he doesn’t get out of that game, while building hardware that’s capturing biometric information, the regulators are just going to keep squeezing and squeezing, and the laws and the walls are going to close in. So I don’t see a way out of this for surveillance capitalism-centered businesses, and I think actually that they’re smart enough to know that. This is why they already just announced last week, “hey we’re Twitter, everyone NFTs we have NFTs now” you can take them and move things around. You can build assets as well, say the asset I would like to move around is everything that you have about me, so let me NFT my data, and then I want to move it around, okay that’s what i would like. So I think that everyone’s still pointing in the same direction, and if you’re not, and you think that you’re gonna be the prodigy in aol, it didn’t work last time, but we’re gonna really give it a shot this time. So I just I think everyone’s smart enough not to repeat that play, but just like the oil companies and the automobile companies drag their feet as long as possible squeezing every dollar out of something that was causing arguable harm to the world, they still need to maximize the lens that they operate on, which is a fundamentally, their corporations with capital based goals. So now everyone ever wants an electric car, but it took someone like Elon and Tesla to just come in and change the whole game. So think that that’s what’s happening here, is that the battles for the wordpress of the spatial web or the wordpress of the metaverse, no one’s going to win being the siloed version of the metaverse where you don’t own any of your stuff. It’s going to be a wasteland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a fantastic answer, so we’ve talked about this vision and i think we all have a vision in our minds of what this looks like, we see even films depict this like Ready Player One for example does a really great job like laying out this universe of what it could possibly be like in the future. What’s less clear is how we get from today to there. What does this roll out actually look like? Is there a cut over? Is there a gradual way we get there? What’s this like?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well I mean I can only guess like the rest, but the hardware is the problem. So that’s why you’re seeing billions and billions of dollars being poured into that space, and more or less everyone is going there, so everyone wanted a smartphone. Does everyone remember the facebook smartphone that came out? That lasted like an hour. So Mark was very smart in jumping in on the VR thing when everyone thought that was just whatever, and Google said we’re going to play around in the AR space and their commitment has been soft. Two steps forward, one step back, and a lot of people in that community have not been happy about it, then Magic Leap emerged and said we’re gonna we’re gonna be the new Apple of this space. They said we only need a few billion dollars, and then “oh we spent it all” because it’s hardware and it’s absolutely the worst possible thing to work on, and it’s super hard. So you’re talking about innovation in battery life, innovation in optics, innovation in computing, and it’s just there’s so many pieces. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s like that smartphone moment again, which is why Apple just takes their time, and does the exact same thing they always do, waiting in the background so a lot of the froth is squeezed out and some of the core problems are solved, then they find their own path in. They’re like we don’t care about the metaverse, we’re not talking about the metaverse and they’re gonna come out with something different. But you’re gonna see four or five of these all start to really hit the market in a meaningful way, variations on AR and VR or hybrid sort of mixed reality devices or glasses. Then you’ve got Qualcomm, and others that are building chips now that have so much capability in them, AI powered chips with powerful spatial computing capabilities on it. So you’re gonna get 25 chinese companies that are making essentially the android versions of these things. I think by next year we’re going to see sort of that “iPhone 1” moment, and then that’s going to kick off the party. By the end of the decade, for some that can afford it, because the prices will go down you will have those early “Ready Player One” moments. Halfway into the next decade it seems like that’s the dominant thing so that’s the arc. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course one of the places we’re looking at, because we always tend to look at this through the consumer market lens, really where a lot of this is needed is in industrial spaces. In warehouses and ports, mining and agriculture, and that’s where the holographic part of this is only one layer, like you could think of the metaverse as sort of being the internet of experience. It’s a human-like interface layer of the spatial web while the internet of things is a machine interface. You having an experience where you go into a store, you grab some stuff, a bunch of cameras identify you and the object, and your account, and your wallet, and you walk out and it just charges you, that’s not a metaverse experience. That’s that you’re embedded in a mesh network of the internet of things, but from our lens that’s still the spatial web, and if then something popped up in front of you that gave you a holographic receipt and that was maybe that’s part of the metaverse. But if as you’re walking into the environment you’re seeing information displayed on top of all of the items saying “hey you’re gluten-free this week how about 10 off that”, that’s a metaversal layer on top of an IOT mediated experience. So you have to consider that component, that sort of digitization of the physical, and physicalization of the digital. These things are intersecting, and one sort of abstract point here is that, that’s what language is. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The experience that a deer has of the physics of a space is almost identical. The deer is in my living room. It can navigate that room better than I can, it understands the objects, but it doesn’t know what they are. But I’ve embedded the meaning, “oh that’s my couch, that’s my tv, that this is a picture of my family” it can see all those things, but it doesn’t know what they are. So I’ve embedded this virtual layer of meaning into the world, all these objects have terms, functions, and ideas. I know what they’re supposed to do. A monkey can still tell that it can sit on a couch, it understands the basic physics, it understands gravity, it can even understand the function of a couch, in that manner, but it doesn’t know whether that it might be meaningful socially to me whether it’s from Ikea or it’s from some fancy italian store. That’s a social virtual layer that humans, the human monkey has embedded into the world around us. We both configured it physically, like we shaped all this stuff, all these objects, but we’ve also added this whole virtual layer. Now we’re just doing it in a completely multi-dimensional way, so that the sort of digital twinification is putting those data sets onto the objects, and into the environment, and then we’re going into those sort of imaginary spaces that we put in our brains that we put into books we put in pictures we put into paintings we put into films. Now we’re just making them fully experiential. I think that’s that big shift, is moving from the information based web, to this experiential based web, whether that’s in the physical world or the digital world. Those blurred lines really create some new kind of digital environment and digital era. I don’t have a good word for it, that’s not a good word, forget it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a good start though. So you’ve implied that the roll out of the spatial web is not tied to the success in the hardware of augmented reality or virtual virtual reality hardware, meaning it can start sooner. So what does the rollout of the spatial web technologies look like as opposed to things that are tied to a VR or AR experience?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah what a good question. So well one of the things we just spoke about was it’s really the IOT first perspective. So in a warehouse you’ve got workers that essentially spend eight hours a day walking around 100,000 square feet trying to locate an item in a box. So what you do is you you build a three-dimensional map in your head, because some things are high, and something’s low, and some things are on the second floor, and then you get an order on your android phone it says go to row 17, isle 12 section l and grab item xj4-92. Okay where am I? You do all this three-dimensional triangulation, and then you route yourself. What we found is if you build a digital twin of that entire environment, and you map the inventory into every single location, so you now embedded the information into the space, you can take that same android phone and route that person to that location, and the cognitive load drops in half, and they basically speed up by 30 percent. The productivity, and performance, and actually the mental cost, the tax, we think about “oh people working hard for eight hours and now you’re making them more productive” there are some societal concerns about optimizing human activity in these environments, and there’s been some real concerns about how amazon is doing it, at the same time if you can reduce the cognitive load that’s actually the most expensive part for them, and so that’s one of the functions. So you’re building a three-dimensional twin you’re embedding the information into the environment, and you’re routing the human worker through that, now ultimately that human worker is hands and feet, because you’re no longer relying on the brain to do that much so the ability to then have humans and robots working in that same space or having humans in the day and robots at night or any combination thereof is a function of creating that shared model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> If there’s a shared model, whether it’s in the city and how how drones then decide are the certain flight lanes that they have, or or government policy that says in europe maybe the eu wants to say that the total flight height for all drones of a certain class is 120 meters, but in the netherlands they might want to say that it’s 100, and brussels maybe they say it’s 80, and as a drone passes through, it cannot ever go higher than 120, but as it goes through the netherlands and over the brussels it has to go down and then down. This is the machine’s view of the spatial web, and all of those capabilities and things are necessary right now, look at the supply chain, we had 500,000 cargo containers sitting off the coast here over christmas, and that’s because the ability for these systems to be able to communicate to each other is really poor, and our understanding of supply and demand globally is really bad. You have something like the pandemic hit and the butterfly fly effect is just happening all over the place and we’re not resilient enough to be able to adapt at this scale.&nbsp;So that’s really what the ultimate value of something like the spatial web means, adaptation. So it’s about the internet of experience over here on the metaverse side, the internet of things, this industry 4.0 narrative is about automation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s really the goal. Can we use machines and algorithms to automate physical functions in the system, and if you did that the impact on climate and the amount of carbon we’d be using would be hyper optimized, and we could set thresholds and regulations and the machines could adapt and adjust this. Instead something like the pandemic hits, we all go to Amazon and buy everything we ever wanted to buy because we can’t go anywhere, and then we just log jam every port in the world. This allows us to start to get a more holistic view, and the way that we start to look at the function of monitoring is not so much monitoring and surveillance, because those capabilities will be there, but if you use things like verifiable credentials, you use things like the IDs, and these get built into law and regulation, then we have we can have the ability to share this kind of information with each other. So you can set up a relay race of an adaptive supply chain, don’t send the automated truck until the thing arrives at the port, minimizing the total amount of carbon output. This adaptive thing is very much what organic systems do, this is how the body manages, you’ve got the autonomic nervous system, we need autonomous supply chains. These are the kind of functions that you can have in the spatial web which are absolutely critical, that are not about having an awesome virtual experience or or trying to sell a jpeg for a million bucks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’re claiming then that the world yesterday needs the spatial web, and that the visualization can currently be done, maybe in a 2d factor, or something like on a smartphone, or other flat screens that we have, and then as soon as the AR and VR get ready it’ll slide right into to that function for visualization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>That’s a really important point in this, in the warehouse we have an application that is multi-modal, and some people prefer just the audio, like with turn-by-turn instructions. Some people want to look at the map, some people prefer to hear it, some people want both, in our cases a lot of the workers are spanish so they want spanish audio. Generally they don’t want 3d, we started with 3d holograms, people were like “this is awesome, but i just need this” this is what’s most useful for me. So even this idea that “oh yeah 3d information is better and holograms are better”, we started doing that four years ago, and everyone was impressed and it was faster and easier, but it hurt to wear the headset for eight hours and the battery would only last three hours. So the hardware isn’t ready on that front, but cameras, AI, algorithms, and computer vision are ready to go, and so that’s a place where this is able to start. It’s really quite useful in some of these really critical environments that are far more relevant to our day-to-day lives and not so much in the entertainment or gaming or space. There’ll be education, we won’t be doing zooms like this, we’ll all be awkwardly sitting around a very large table, but there are functions today that are super meaningful for deploying the capabilities and use of the spatial web, and this is without even getting into any of the the broader needs around how DIDs can permeate, and self-sovereign identity is relevant in and of itself. Just like land title ownership by the dimensions this is going to end up being the domains of the spatial web, we will essentially be bound like boundaries. Your home is a domain, your property is a domain, the city’s a domain, today we think of domains as urls but domains in the spatial web are spaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Absolutely, so you’ve hinted at this a little already, which is really powerful. What do governments and companies do now to prepare for the coming spatial web?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I mean I think that there are a few groups that governments and researchers and regulators need to start becoming aware of. Predominantly that’s the work that’s being done around DIDs and DIDcomm, verifiable credentials, and the spatial web foundations working group at the IEEE. I think those are the critical components that you need to understand. I think that there is a more provocative branch off of this question, which is what role do governments play in virtual worlds? So it’s outside your jurisdiction, so what is legal or not not legal, and who says and how? So thinking about your geopolitical domain is one thing, thinking about people physically in your dimension that are experiencing something in another dimension that you have no jurisdictional power or authority over is a question. This ties into larger questions of governance, i mean Minecraft i think is eight times the size of earth. That’s big, that’s a big space, okay that’s one little world, you’re talking there’ll be thousands and then hundreds of thousands. There’s 300 million websites today, there’ll be billions and billions of these environments and spaces, at some point AIs will just auto generate whatever experience you want. Just start choosing adventure in real time based on biometric feedback, so the possibilities here are going to get really weird, really interesting. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chinese quote may you live in interesting times is sort of a double-edged sword. These are interesting times and so these are the kinds of questions. The last question I want to leave you with on this point is if Disney land or H&amp;M or whoever builds a store in decentraland, can I build a Disney store right next to the Disney store in decentraland? Who’s preventing it? Are they respecting the trademark and IP agreements of the United States? We will need treaties between organizations, countries on earth, and in these virtual worlds as if they were other planets. In the same way that we had to look at these challenges when we formed the league of nations or the united nations, we’re going to have other dimensions that we need to interact with that have entire economies that we trade in where the jurisdictions don’t apply. Then again who do you trust in those environments relative to what authorities? And so what prevents me from doing that in decentraland? Why can’t I sell Disney merch? or modify it with marvel or warner brothers stuff or whatever i like? So i think this is where trusts and guarantees around verifiability and credentialing of authorities becomes really critical, and if we’re going to digitize all of this, all of our reality in this next age, and all this money is flowing into the space, these are the kinds of big questions that we’re constantly thinking about and working on with respect to the standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, we are unfortunately out of time, but this has been great to hear your vision and thoughts around these things. Is there anything you’d like to leave us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, I think that the the role of identity is a fundamental pillar, and i think that in the the arc of history when we look at the role of property, and property rights, physical property rights, i just talked about intellectual property rights, data property rights, and digital asset property rights are are the next challenge. This is not a purely philosophical question, this is going to come down to law. So we need to start thinking of what does digital law mean in the 21st century? And making sure that the work we’re doing is addressing some of those questions, or hosting some of those conversations, I’d like to see more constitutional lawyers involved in these conversations. I’d like to see people that are really working through this sort of lens of data rights and ethics having these dialogues. That’s why I think that the next battleground is property rights, with respect to the function of data and the things that data form, which become these new hyperspatial objects in this next era.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, Gabriel, thank you for spending this time with us we’re we’re grateful for your willingness to be here. I hope everyone enjoyed this conversation and we’ll look forward to seeing you all in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me, take care everybody&nbsp;</p>

<p>UK positions itself to become the Web3 leader for the world’s digital&nbsp;commerce</p>Image a composition of photos by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@johnangelnyc?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">John Angel</a> and <a href="https://unsplash.com/@rsture?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Reinaldo Sture</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/uk-flag?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a><p>Several weeks ago, the second most senior judge in England and Wales, Master of the Rolls Sir Geoffrey Vos, made one of the most bullish speeches on the <a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/announcements/the-chancellor-of-the-high-court-sir-geoffrey-vos-launches-legal-statement-on-the-status-of-cryptoassets-and-smart-contracts/">inevitability of blockchain as a tool of global commerce and the necessity for the UK</a> (and more specifically England and Wales) to become the jurisdiction of choice in this bold new future. And on Monday 4 April, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury John Glen MP, standing in for the Chancellor, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/keynote-speech-by-john-glen-economic-secretary-to-the-treasury-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit">announced a raft of measures</a> that many anticipate will make Britain a global fintech Web3 and blockchain leader.</p><p>The pioneer of much of this work is the UK Jurisdiction Taskforce (UKJT), which was convened under the watchful eye of Sir Geoffrey and is supported in its work by <a href="https://technation.io/lawtechukpanel/">Lawtech UK</a>. Last year, it published the new <a href="https://35z8e83m1ih83drye280o9d1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Lawtech_DDRR_Final.pdf">Digital Dispute Resolution Rules (DDRR)</a> which are an invaluable legislative tool for companies and individuals engaging in Web3 trade. They create a clear, transparent and relevant framework for dealing with disputes with regard to digitally represented assets (including <a href="https://resources.lawtechuk.io/files/digital_representation_ownership_physical_assets.pdf">physical assets represented by digital receipts</a> such as&nbsp;NFTs).</p><p>Mattereum was delighted to see the new Rules published: in our view, they go a long way toward enabling vital global commerce in the Web3 setting. In terms of improving fairness and equity, they level the playing field by ensuring affordable access to justice for smaller players including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and more specialised companies in the circular economy space. Lawtech UK’s conference on <a href="https://lawtechuk.io/programmes/smarter-contracts">smart contracts</a> featured keynote speeches by <a href="https://twitter.com/lawtech_uk/status/1501148236802895874?s=21&amp;t=DtlycCMUnk9ehNFBDOEhsQ">Sir Geoffrey</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/technation/status/1499344827804180482?s=21&amp;t=DtlycCMUnk9ehNFBDOEhsQ">industry leaders</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=91&amp;v=kC7ZpltDwHU&amp;feature=emb_logo">a presentation by Vinay&nbsp;Gupta</a>.</p><p>Mattereum is one of the most mature companies in the Web3&nbsp;space.</p><blockquote>Since 2017, Mattereum has been at the cutting edge of technical and legal innovation concerned with the impact of Web3 technologies on national and international trade in physical&nbsp;goods.</blockquote><p>In 2021, Mattereum was the first company to incorporate the UKJT’s <a href="https://resources.lawtechuk.io/files/report_smarter_contracts.pdf">new Digital Dispute Resolution Rules into our smart contracts</a> [1], because we believe that Mattereum’s customers ought to benefit from the most advanced legal instruments in the world when it comes to ensuring that their commercial interests are protected.</p><p>This is important to us because we know that the rule of law and access to justice should not be reserved for the largest companies or the wealthiest individuals. The right to effective remedy enshrined in international treaties should be accessible to everyone and it is the responsible thing to ensure that this is true for our customers. For example, a smallholder producing coffee in Kenya should have as much recourse to justice as a tech company in the USA, a computer hardware manufacturer in India, a fashion house in Italy or a furniture maker in Brazil. Mattereum’s ecosystem, drawing on the best of international law, treats all of those actors&nbsp;equally.</p><p>Britain is not alone in working towards better recognition of Web3 technologies. President Biden’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/09/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-sign-executive-order-on-ensuring-responsible-innovation-in-digital-assets/">Executive Order issued in March of this year (2022)</a> sought to recognise the benefits of crypto assets whilst also leaning on perceived downsides. It was broadly welcomed: most blockchain businesses look forward to being regulated and having a clear, fair and transparent framework within which to operate. When it comes to public policy, acknowledgement can often be the first or the most significant step towards mainstreaming a new way of doing things. And as far as governments are concerned, acceptance of new technologies or processes means regulation — and hopefully regulation that is fair to both businesses and consumers.</p><p>Nonetheless, when it comes to leading OECD countries, the sharpest minds in the British government and the judiciary are several steps ahead of the US and some others. They recognise the direction of travel in global markets, and they are adamant that Britain must lead and not be left behind. Master of the Rolls Sir Geoffrey Vos has said: “We should not allow the tail, however waggy, to wag the huge dispute resolution dog.” As we often observe, British judges are some of the most intelligent public servants in the world with vast analytical skills. Sir Geoffrey can see very clearly the way the future will develop; he and his team are doing all they can to ensure that UK jurisdictions continue to lead when it comes to global commercial dispute resolution — be it around the bricks and mortar of a skyscraper in the City of London; an NFT acting as a digital receipt for a 100g gold bar <a href="https://lohkowallet.com/">owned by one of Matteruem’s customers</a>, or a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-sets-out-plan-to-make-uk-a-global-cryptoasset-technology-hub">commemorative coin produced by the Royal Mint on the Chancellor’s instruction</a>.</p><p>Matterum’s vision and capabilities go further. Mattereum Asset Passports, attached to every asset which enters our ecosystem, have the capacity to add value and accountability by enhancing the record of that asset’s provenance, its utility, its composition and even data such as its carbon footprint or the labour conditions in which it was produced. Mattereum ensures that those seeking to own, collect, trade or invest in assets are able to access information that is fully accurate and transparent — and ensures that an asset’s veracity is legally enforceable in over 160 jurisdictions worldwide.</p><p>At Mattereum we are at the forefront of building and implementing these tools, alongside <a href="https://unn.finance/">our</a> <a href="https://opensea.io/">partners</a>. We want to see frictionless global commerce for players of all sizes, and in as many jurisdictions as possible. We want to ensure that access to justice and to the principles which underpin it (such as effective remedy) is universal and accessible to everyone — including independent traders, social enterprises working to enable the circular economy, and global conglomerates. Transparency, accountability, due process, fairness and procedural justice are great enablers of a functional system of commerce, and a functional society focused on improving outcomes, wealth and success for all citizens.</p><p>Speaking on behalf of The UK Government, Economy Minister John Glen MP said that “…part of the way we become that pre-eminent financial centre that [the Chancellor] describes is by having the technology here to do things better”. Mattereum is enabling the ecosystem to realise that&nbsp;vision.</p><p>Can the UK become the Web3 leader for the world’s digital commerce? With the appropriate legislation, legal framework — and with the right leadership among civil servants, judges, lawyers and business leaders — unequivocally yes. Mattereum is proud to be part of that journey and building that&nbsp;future.</p><p>[1] <a href="https://passport.mattereum.com/Alexander_Screenprint_Warhol_01/">https://passport.mattereum.com/Alexander_Screenprint_Warhol_01/</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/global-britain-bullish-on-blockchain-a29899bc325b">Global Britain Bullish on Blockchain</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
