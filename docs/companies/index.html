<blockquote><p>“We learn who we are in practice, not in theory.”</p><br>David Epstein, Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World</blockquote>



<p>I love when different spaces come together. There are so many opportunities to challenge assumptions, learn from each other, and find common ground. And if you happen to be sitting right in the middle at the time, suddenly you have the opportunity to unify and bridge seemingly unbridgeable gaps.</p>



<p>It’s been a busy month for decentralized identity. Led by Vitalik Buterin, the Web3 community joined the party with a <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763">proposal on Soulbound Tokens</a> (SBTs), culminating in an excellent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbyVyVNsyys">debate</a> on Bankless between Vitalik and Evin McMullen from <a href="https://disco.xyz/">disco.xyz</a>, about the risks and rewards of the “public by default” identity tokens over the “private by default” Verifiable Credential (VC) standard recommended by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C</a> and <a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/">TBD</a> and Jack Dorsey published their equally tongue-in-cheekily-named <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/projects/web5/">Web5 proposal</a>, essentially coming down firmly in the VC camp, stating that nothing should be put on chain, and if it should, then it should be on bitcoin (because who needs smart contracts anyway)?</p>



<p>We at Civic find ourselves sitting in the middle of a debate that we are extremely familiar with. We’ve been negotiating this dichotomy since our inception. In 2017 we published <a href="https://vinnylingham.com/civic-enabling-the-future-of-privacy-digital-security-with-chainauth-b79d61904d4c">Chainauth</a>, a mechanism for anchoring verifiable credentials on Bitcoin, and in 2021 we released <a href="https://www.civic.com/solutions/">Civic Pass</a>, a multi-chain token protocol, in conjunction with <a href="https://identity.com/">identity.com</a>.</p>



<p>I, for one, feel like a Berlin resident in 1990 tapping away at the Berlin Wall as others on each side pick up pick-axes around me, suddenly realising that a wall that shouldn’t exist anyway can, in fact, be toppled.</p>



<p>Why, if we had Chainauth, based on verifiable credentials, did we release Civic Pass, a token protocol very similar to SBTs? Why do we, at Civic, think that, all in all, SBTs are a good thing? After all, we share the privacy concerns of SBTs that were eloquently enumerated by Evin McMullen. Alongside the benefits of shared state for revocability and “negative reputation” listed by Vitalik, the main driver for us is flexible and uncomplicated integration into smart contracts, be they <a href="http://dex.solrise.com/">DeFi</a>, <a href="https://realms.today/">DAOs</a>,<a href="https://docs.civic.com/integrations/adding-captcha-to-candy-machine-v2"> NFT mints</a>, or others. Essentially we believe that there is benefit for an individual in circumspectly registering aspects of their identity on-chain.</p>



<p>There are right ways and wrong ways to achieve this (and watch this space for an upcoming post about the four pillars of identity-based tokens), but what Civic is doing is building the bridge between SBTs and VCs. Civic strongly believes that the future of decentralized, reusable identity is verifiable credentials. We issue VCs behind the scenes. We have an identity wallet that allows users to store and present those credentials, and we are building a web portal to replace it (keep an eye on <a href="http://civic.me/">civic.me</a>). However, smart contracts never see them, because we allow users to “tokenize” them on whatever chain they are using. In this way, an SBT is really more of a decentralized access-control layer, which is why we decided to call it Civic Pass. Combining these two concepts, off-chain verifiable credentials and on-chain passes, is immensely powerful, allowing seamless integration with on-chain projects, an identity that is portable across multiple chains, while still allowing users to provide their credentials off-chain to organizations that need them for regulatory, or other, purposes.</p>



<p>Vitalik opened the debate with Evin by stating that the two sides have more they agree with than they disagree with, and we at Civic certainly agree with that. We have been operating in both worlds for several years now, and have lived the debate internally several times. Essentially it comes down to figuring out a common language, so that the Decentralized Identity world can integrate into Web3, their biggest ally to wide-scale adoption, and the Web3 world can truly kick-off with a robust, secure and self-sovereign identity model.</p>

 Stakers can claim DF1 rewards. DF2 counting has&nbsp;begun  1. Overview <p>The <a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean</a> <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">Data Farming</a> program incentivizes for growth of data consume volume in the Ocean ecosystem. It rewards OCEAN to pool liquidity providers (LPs / stakers) for higher data consume volume (DCV) and&nbsp;stake.</p><p>DF Round 1 (DF1) is part of DF Alpha phase. DF1 counting started 12:01am Thu Jun 16, 2022, and ended 11:59pm Wed Jun 22, 2022 (one week later). 10K OCEAN worth of rewards were computed and sent to the claims contracts. LPs can now claim rewards at the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">DF&nbsp;webapp</a>.</p><p>DF Round 2 (DF2) is also part of DF Alpha phase. DF2 counting started 12:01am Thu Jun 16, 2022, and will end on 11:59pm Wed Jun 22, 2022. 10K OCEAN worth of rewards is available.</p><p>The rest of this post describes how to claim rewards, then details on DF1 and&nbsp;DF2.</p> 2. How To Claim&nbsp;Rewards <p>As an LP (staker), here’s how to claim&nbsp;rewards:</p>  Go to <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">DF webapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal  Connect your&nbsp;wallet  For each network with rewards (where you staked): select network, click “Claim”, sign the tx, get rewards:)  <p>In DF1, only Polygon and EWC had nonzero DCV, therefore rewards only went to those networks.</p><p>Rewards will accumulate over weeks, so you can claim rewards at your leisure. If you claim weekly, you can re-stake your rewards for compound&nbsp;gains.</p> 3. DF1 Input Parameters <p>DF1 is the first week of DF overall 🥳. This also makes it the first week of the the DF Alpha phase. DF Alpha runs 4 weeks, with 10K OCEAN rewards budgeted per week. DF Alpha’s aim is to test technology, learn, and onboard data publishers.</p><p>The DF launch post “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-is-launching-f633532d831c">Ocean Data Farming is Launching</a>” included DF1’s parameters. Then, “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-examples-c2d67a17b5f5">Ocean Data Farming Examples: DF1</a>” provided examples to better understand earnings, against the DF1 rewards formula and related settings.</p> 4. DF2 Input Parameters <p>The rewards formula and related settings for DF2 are the same as for&nbsp;DF1.</p><p>This may not always be the case: we can expect round-to-round evolution of the Reward Function and related settings, based on learnings.</p> 5. DF1 Output&nbsp;Stats <p>OceanONDA V4 <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/">supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet (chainid 1), Polygon (137), Binance Smart Chain (BSC: 56), Energy Web Chain (EWC: 246), and Moonriver (1285).</p><p>Only Polygon and EWC had nonzero DCV in DF1, so we focus on&nbsp;those.</p><p>Exchange rate was 0.180514 OCEAN/USD, taken from Binance&nbsp;API.</p>  Total Stake (averaged across 7 days). Polygon 656633.20 OCEAN, EWC 3926.94 OCEAN, total 660560.14 OCEAN (119240.35 USD). Stake grew through the week, from about 100K OCEAN to &gt;1M&nbsp;OCEAN.  Total DCV (total across 7 days). Polygon 750.51 OCEAN, EWC 2.30 OCEAN, total 752.81 OCEAN (135.89&nbsp;USD).  OCEAN rewarded to LPs. Polygon 9998.11, EWC 1.89, total 10000&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Rewards Stats. Rewards were dispensed to 103 LPs. The largest reward was 2715.05 OCEAN, the smallest 0.0058 OCEAN, average 97.09 OCEAN, median 6.89 OCEAN. The images below visualize this, where the y-axis is amount distributed in linear or log&nbsp;scale.</p> 6. Max APY means active&nbsp;work <p>Data Farming is not a wholly passive activity. The name of the game is to drive data consume volume (DCV). High APYs happen only when there is sufficiently high DCV. High DCV means publishing and consuming truly useful datasets (or algorithms).</p><p>Thus, if you really want to max out your&nbsp;APY:</p>  create &amp; publish datasets — or work with people who&nbsp;can  consume them — or work with people who&nbsp;can  go stake on them, and finally claim the&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Driving DCV for publishing &amp; consuming is your challenge. It will take real work. And then the reward is APY. It’s incentives all the way&nbsp;down:)</p> 7. Conclusion <p>DF1 has completed! DF2 counting has begun. To claim DF1 rewards, go to <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">DF webapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p> Further Reading <p>The post <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45">Ocean Data Farming Series</a> collects together key articles, and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a> for project announcements.

Image: <a href="http://Cortizo%20veta%20parcialmente%20el%20proyecto%20de%20ley%20que%20regula%20los%20criptoactivos">Revista&nbsp;Summa</a> President of Panama Rejects to Sign the Crypto Bill, Sends it Back for Further Discussion Over “AML-related” Concerns  The most pressing concern that the President had was the lack of Anti-Money laundering provisions in the&nbsp;Bill.  Key Highlights <blockquote>- Panama’s President Laurentino Cortizo vetoed the crypto bill due to a lack of robust anti-money laundering provisions.</blockquote><blockquote>- President Cortizo previously called the crypto bill “innovative law.”</blockquote><blockquote>- Once signed by the President, it will enable local businesses to accept payments in digital currencies, legally recognize DAOs, and create a framework for the government to use blockchain technology for record-keeping.</blockquote><p>Recently, a Panamanian media outlet, La Prenda, <a href="https://www.prensa.com/economia/cortizo-veta-parcialmente-el-proyecto-de-ley-que-regula-los-criptoactivos/">reported</a> that Bill №697, informally known as the “Crypto Bill,” was vetoed by Panama’s President Laurentino Cortizo.</p><p>The President said that the proposed bills need further improvements to meet the standards of Panama’s banking regulations. The most pressing concern that the President had was the lack of Anti-Money laundering provisions in the&nbsp;Bill.</p><p>In May 2022, while giving a speech during a Bloomberg event, President Cortizo was very upfront about his view that he wouldn’t sign the bill if it failed to incorporate FATF’s AML regulations.</p> Partially Rejected <p>That said, President Cortizo hasn’t rejected the bill in its entirety, as he appreciated specific segments of the bill. In fact, previously, he has also called the bill an “innovative law.” But he demanded strong measures to prevent the illicit use of digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>President Cortizo is heavily stressing the need for a robust AML mechanism because the country has been campaigning to improve its reputation among global financial regulators, which has been dented due to its popularity as a tax haven. For instance, the Financial Task Force (FATF) categorized Panama under the “<a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/high-risk-and-other-monitored-jurisdictions/documents/increased-monitoring-june-2022.html">Jurisdictions Under Increased Monitoring</a>.”</p> Reactions <p>Gabriel Silva, a Panamanian Congressman who played a vital role in introducing the said Bill, wasn’t enthused about the President’s vetoing the bill. He tweeted that the President’s decision to reject the bill resulted in “a lost opportunity to generate jobs, attract investment and incorporate technology and innovation in the public&nbsp;sector.”</p><p>He further stated that Congress would make further changes to the bill after going through the Veto and then re-submit it to the President for consideration.</p> What the Bill has to&nbsp;Offer? <p>If the bill comes into force, it will enable local businesses to accept payments in digital currencies of all sorts. Thus, Panama’s crypto adoption will be different from El Salvador, which has only legalized the use of Bitcoin as a means of payment in the country by approving it as a legal&nbsp;tender.</p><p>Besides, the Bill will also pave the way for using blockchain technology for government record-keeping purposes and give legal recognition to the Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).</p><p>__________</p><p>Considering the pseudo-anonymous nature of crypto transactions, countries worldwide are tightening their AML-related rules to prevent its use by sanctioned individuals and entities. The first such global push for the digital assets space came in the form of FATF’s Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>Although not all countries have started enforcing the FATF’s Travel Rule yet, sooner or later, they all will. Thus, all Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) will have to begin complying with the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>The first thing that a VASP will need to start complying with the Travel Rule is a Travel Rule Solution Provider (TRSP). And Veriscope is second to none when it comes to TRSPs.

				 <p>Indicio a Finalist in CRN Awards for Social Impact&nbsp;</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>The CRN Tech Impact awards are given to IT vendors, distributors, and resellers for their social and environmental impact. This year, Indicio is a finalist in the Social Impact Project Category for its work with SITA, the world’s leading provider of IT to the air transport sector,&nbsp; on verifiable credentials for travel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio worked with SITA and the Aruban government to develop a decentralized identity solution for managing Covid testing and vaccination for travelers to the tourism-dependent island. The goal was to avoid the need for airlines or governments to directly integrate with health care providers, while providing travelers with a tamper-and-fraud proof, privacy-preserving way to prove their health data (and thereby comply with health data privacy requirements).</p>
<p>After successful trials, the code was donated to Linux Foundation Public Health as a privacy-preserving way for public health authorities to share health data. Known as the <a href="https://cardea.app/">Cardea Project</a>, the codebase continues to be developed to address other health data sharing needs.</p>
<p>As a Public Benefit Corporation, Indicio has made the advancement of decentralized identity its public benefit mission. The social impact of Cardea is enormous. There is now a complete open source decentralized ecosystem for issuing, holding, and sharing health data in a privacy-preserving way. At the same time, SITA’s application of the same digital technology promises to transform our experience of travel from check in to border control.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To read more about some of the work that was done you can read the original press release <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/sita-indicio-pave-way-to-safer-travel-experience-with-launch-of-aruba-health-app/">here</a> or read the <a href="https://cardea.app/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cardea-White-Paper-V1.0.pdf">Cardea white paper.</a></p>
<p>Other finalists in the social impact category are Epson UK and Clevertouch Technologies and Interactive AV Solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the full list of categories and finalists, visit <a href="https://event.channelweb.co.uk/crntechimpactawards2022/en/page/2022-finalists">CRN.</a></p>
<p>Indicio is honored to be nominated and looks forward to the announcement of the winners in September.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This week’s Holochain release brings a large and anticipated change, what will become the foundation for the 0.1.0 release of the HDK and the Stable Validation milestone. I <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-roadmap-online/#holochain-roadmap-is-now-live">hinted at it</a> a few months ago, and now the time is finally upon us.</p> Holochain 0.0.143: Maintenance release <p>HDK compatibility: 0.0.129 to 0.0.136</p><p>This release brought more documentation updates to a couple packages, and that’s about it.</p> Holochain 0.0.144: Integrity/coordination split <p>HDI compatibility: 0.0.9<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.137</p><p>This release sees a number of changes to the HDK in preparation for the next release. You’ll note that I’m now listing the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/external-links/#integritycoordination-split-begins">previously announced</a> HDI (Holochain Deterministic Integrity) crate as a separate thing — this library has only existed as part of the HDK before this release, but it becomes a separate thing from now on.</p><p>I have to admit that the title of this Dev Pulse is not exactly true. As you may know, data integrity is critical when groups of people want to coordinate their actions. If you can’t trust what your peers are saying and doing, you can’t move forward safely with them.</p><p>Also, when I say ‘coordination’ I’m not even talking about that kind of coordination. I’m talking about something more low-level and programmer-ish: one application instance coordinating the flow of its own processing and data, nothing more.</p><p>And finally, they’re not really parting ways — it’s just that the pieces of your hApp’s code that are responsible for data integrity will be split from the pieces that are responsible for application execution. They’ll exist in separate zomes in your DNA. If you’re familiar with the MVC (model, view, controller) programming pattern, you could look at it this way:</p><p>Your application’s integrity zomes comprise its model layer — everything that defines the shape of the data. In practice, this means three things: entry type definitions, link type definitions, and a validation callback that constrains the kinds of data that can validly be called entries and links of those types.</p><p>And the coordination zomes comprise its controller layer — the code that actually commits data, retrieves it, handles countersigning sessions, and sends and receives messages between peers or between a cell and its UI. In other words, all your zome functions, your `init` functions, your remote signal receivers, and your scheduler callbacks will all live in coordination zomes.</p><p>To repeat what I described a few months ago, the intention is to let you split the core integrity components of your application, which define the unalterable rules of the game, from the business logic. That way, your DHT can last a long time yet still receive upgrades and bug fixes — as long as you don’t need to change your integrity components.</p><p>And we’re making the same promise for the reduced library that your integrity components are built on — the HDI (Holochain Deterministic Integrity) crate. Once it reaches its 0.1.0 release, we plan to keep HDI stable for a while between minor releases.</p><p>You’re probably wondering how to refactor your hApp given this substantial change. Here are the most important things to know:</p><p>Your DNA manifest file is broken into <code>integrity</code> and <code>coordinator</code> sections. <code>integrity</code> holds everything that affects the DNA’s hash: the list of integrity zomes, the DNA properties, the UID, and a new <code>origin_time</code> field that indicates the earliest possible timestamp for a source chain entry, which is used to prevent time-travel attacks. Only the <code>integrity</code> section affects your DNA hash.</p><p><code>coordinator</code> holds the list of coordination zomes. Coordination zomes must explicitly list their dependencies; that is, the integrity zomes that contain definitions for the entry and link types they intend to write. (If you have only one integrity zome, however, you don’t need to list it as a dependency in any of the coordination zomes.) Here’s a complex example with multiple zomes of both kinds:</p> <code>manifest_version: "1"
name: multi integrity dna
integrity:
  uid: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
  properties: ~
  origin_time: 2022-02-11T23:05:19.470323Z
  zomes:
    - name: zome1
      bundled: ../dna1/zomes/zome1.wasm
    - name: zome2
      bundled: ../dna2/zomes/zome1.wasm
coordinator:
  zomes:
    - name: zome3
      bundled: ../dna1/zomes/zome2.wasm
      dependencies:
        - name: zome1
    - name: zome4
      bundled: ../dna2/zomes/zome2.wasm
      dependencies:
        - name: zome1
        - name: zome2
</code> 
<p>As mentioned, your entry/link definitions, membrane proof self-checks, and validation callbacks will need to be moved into integrity zomes with only one core dependency on the HDI crate <a href="https://crates.io/crates/holochain_deterministic_integrity"><code>holochain_deterministic_integrity</code></a>. This crate has been around for a while, but you haven’t needed to worry about it until now because it was just part of the HDK. (It still is, but it now is meant to exist independently of the HDK.) integrity zomes should not depend on the full HDK — it’s not going to remain stable over time like HDI is. There are new macro helpers for defining entry and link types. The test suite has examples of an integrity zome with <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.144/crates/test_utils/wasm/wasm_workspace/integrity_zome/src/lib.rs">entry types</a> and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.144/crates/test_utils/wasm/wasm_workspace/link/src/integrity.rs">link types</a>.</p><p>All of your zome functions, init callbacks, remote signal receivers, and scheduler callbacks should go into coordination zomes. They can (and likely should) depend on the full HDK, which still includes <code>holochain_deterministic_integrity</code> as a dependency.</p><p>Only the coordination zomes can use non-deterministic host functions in the full HDK such as source chain commits and queries, DHT gets, agent activity queries, signal emitters, remote calls, and complex crypto functions. Integrity zomes can only use deterministic functions such as <code>must_get_*</code>, <code>dna_info</code>, <code>zome_info</code>, and simple crypto functions such as hashing. This makes sense, because the only functions available to your validation callback are the deterministic ones; this just becomes explicit with the separation between HDI and the rest of the HDK.</p><p>There are some changes that remove <code>zome_id</code> from the headers of entry and link creation elements. These changes are temporary and will be <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1453">reverted</a> in a future release. In fact, before the 0.1.0 release of HDI there will likely be more changes, although they will mostly be hidden behind macros and other conveniences. If you want to have a say in the usability of the hApp development experience, please jump in now and tell us what you think. But if you desire stability, it’s probably best to wait until 0.1.0.</p><p>You can also look at the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.144/CHANGELOG.md#20220616084359">full changelog</a> or the integrity PR (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1325">#1325</a>) for the fine details.</p><p>There are a lot of other changes in this release, some related to the integrity/coordinator split and some not:</p>  New: <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.137/hdk/prelude/macro.wasm_error.html"><code>wasm_error!</code></a> macro in the HDK, which captures line numbers. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1380">#1380</a>)  New: Stubs for libsodium Salsa20-Poly1305 <a href="https://doc.libsodium.org/secret-key_cryptography/secretbox">secret box</a> encryption in the HDK. It’s not yet supported by the Lair keystore, so it will currently throw unimplemented errors. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1410">#1410</a>)  New: Updated to newest Wasmer, which allows us to implement metering. Zome calls are now limited to a generous 10 giga-operations, which should prevent infinite loops from overwhelming an agent’s machine. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1386">#1386</a>)  Breaking: When using <code>get_links</code>, the <code>link_type</code> parameter now takes <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.137/hdk/link/fn.get_links.html">more than one</a> link type at a time. And because a coordination zome can depend on more than one integrity zome, you can even specify link types from multiple integrity zomes. Any link types not defined in a coordination zome’s dependencies will be filtered out.  Breaking: <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.137/hdk/p2p/fn.call.html"><code>call</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.137/hdk/p2p/fn.call_remote.html"><code>call_remote</code></a> can now take anything that implements the <code>Into&lt;ZomeName&gt;</code> trait.  Breaking: <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.137/hdk/entry/fn.create_entry.html"><code>create_entry</code></a> takes anything that implements both the <code>TryInto&lt;<a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.137/hdk/prelude/struct.EntryDefIndex.html">EntryDefIndex</a>&gt;</code> and <code>TryInto&lt;<a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.137/hdk/prelude/enum.EntryVisibility.html">EntryVisibility</a>&gt;</code> traits rather than <code>EntryDefRegistration</code>.  Breaking: <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.137/hdk/entry/fn.update.html"><code>update</code></a> now takes an <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.137/hdk/prelude/struct.UpdateInput.html"><code>UpdateInput</code></a> struct to make it align more closely with other host functions, and <code>UpdateInput</code> now has separate <code>entry</code> and <code>chain_top_ordering</code> params rather than wrapping a <code>CreateInput</code>.  Breaking: <code>update_entry</code> takes anything that implements <code>TryInto&lt;Entry&gt;</code> rather than <code>EntryDefRegistration</code>.  Breaking: <code>Path</code> now must be <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.137/hdk/hash_path/path/struct.Path.html#method.typed">typed to a specific <code>LinkType</code></a>.  Breaking: <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.136/hdk/prelude/struct.CreateInput.html#structfield.entry_location"><code>CreateInput</code></a>, used in <code>create_entry</code>, replaces <code>entry_def_id</code> with <code>entry_location</code> which allows you to specify that the entry is either an app entry (with entry def ID) or a capability grant/claim. In practice, you don’t need to worry about this if you’re using the entry def helper macro, because it will create a type that can be converted into a <code>CreateInput</code>.  Breaking: The <code>register_entry!</code> macro has been replaced by an <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.137/hdk/entry/attr.hdk_entry_defs.html"><code>#[hdk_entry_defs]</code></a> helper.  Breaking: The <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.137/hdk/prelude/info/struct.ZomeInfo.html">struct returned by <code>zome_info</code></a> now has a <code>zome_types</code> field that lists all the global IDs of the zome’s entry and link types.  Breaking: <code>EntryDefs::entry_def_index_from_id()</code>, <code>ZomeInfo::matches_entry_def_id()</code>, <code>CreateLink::zome_id</code>, and <code>AppEntryType::zome_ID</code> have been removed because there is no way to go from a local ID to a global ID. This may change again in the future.  Breaking: <code>EntryDef::required_validation_type</code> has been removed because validation packages are not going to be implemented.  Breaking: <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.137/hdk/prelude/struct.ZomeName.html"><code>ZomeName</code></a> is now a <code>Cow&lt;’static, string&gt;</code> instead of a <code>String</code>.  <p>Read the changelog for all the details.</p> Holochain 0.0.145: Source chain name change, countersigning updates <p>HDI compatibility: 0.0.10<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.138<br>Lair compatibility: 0.2.0</p><p>There are three important changes in this release:</p>  Breaking: <code>Element</code> and <code>Header</code>, two structures that make up the source chain, have been renamed to <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.138/hdk/prelude/struct.Record.html"><code>Record</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.138/hdk/prelude/action/enum.Action.html"><code>Action</code></a>, along with changes to related types. We believe these language changes will make it easier for new developers to understand what these structures are about. Every source chain commit is a record of a particular type of action (publishing an agent key, creating data, deleting a link, etc), so this language aligns with that reality. <code>Entry</code> is remaining the same. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1441">#1441</a>)  Breaking: When you’re using an ‘enzyme’ in countersigning (a trusted agent who collects all the signatures, rather than waiting for signatures to get published to the DHT and broadcast to all signers), you now specify that a session <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.138/hdk/prelude/countersigning/struct.PreflightRequest.html#structfield.enzymatic">is enzymatic</a>, and the enzyme agent will be the first countersigner by convention. Previously the enzyme's agent ID was specified explicitly and separately from the other counterparties. (Note: the API is fully fleshed out, but the network plumbing to support enzymes is not functional yet.) (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1394">#1394</a>)  Breaking: In a countersigning session, you can now specify a number of <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.138/hdk/prelude/countersigning/struct.PreflightRequest.html#structfield.optional_signing_agents">optional signers</a>. You can specify how many of them <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.138/hdk/prelude/countersigning/struct.PreflightRequest.html#structfield.minimum_optional_signing_agents">must sign</a> in order for the session to complete; that number must be equal to or greater than a majority of the optional signers. This is useful for reaching ‘micro-consensus’ over rivalrous data such as usernames, in a way that tolerates downtime among trusted authorities. Note: When using optional witnesses, the session must use an enzyme, who must be the first agent in both the list of signing agents and the list of optional signers. This allows the process to be more efficient and less ambiguous than waiting for the DHT to reach consistency.

 Identity Platform 2022.1 is released today, including SSO 9.0 and CustomerID 6.0 
<p>Across this release cycle we have covered deep technical improvements and modernisations of the Identity Platform, as well as making progress in a new key development area. For all the details, please head over to our <a href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20221/pages/8907554826/Identity+Server+2022.1+Release+Notes">Release Notes</a>.</p>
<p>Due to the structural changes found in this release, OpenLDAP MDB (regarding memory and disk space), the move to Java 11 and some third-party libraries, we felt there were sufficient changes to make this release a major version update. As such, SSO is moving from 8.9 to 9.0 and CustomerID is moving from 5.9 to 6.0 during this 2022.1 release cycle.</p>
 Features 
<p>Sign in with BYOI: Within the Identity Platform we have added another ‘essential’ BYOI (bring your own identity) provider into full support – Apple. Now you can easily configure sign-in functions with Google, Microsoft, and Apple identities. They enable you to support most consumers or external users and offer an already existing, easy to use identity method to empower your digitisation. You no longer have to maintain internal identity and password management services if you do not require them. Adding in “Sign in with Apple” continues our journey towards offering you a passwordless future, where users can be allowed access based on their existing credentials and authenticated with a glance at their phone. It may take some time for the entire world to transition to this easy-to-use feature, but just like the gradual transition to electric cars, the FIDO alliance will help enable a passwordless future for everyone. For more details on the FIDO backed, passwordless future check out this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/05/apple-google-and-microsoft-commit-to-expanded-support-for-fido-standard/">Apple blog</a>.</p>
<p>Risk-Based Authentication (RBA):&nbsp;We have continued our development of risk-based authentication features over the past several months, with ongoing developments to be continued. For this release, we have added the ability to offer SMS OTP (one time password) and SMTP OTP for unregistered users. Utilising either OpenID Connect or SAML, you can now both securely integrate an external IdP, as well as require a second authentication factor (MFA (Multi Factor Authentication)) to highly assure external users from that IdP. The external user signs into your application via OpenID Connect (or SAML) and after returning to SSO will query the external IdP for the user’s phone number. From there, a six-digit OTP code is sent as an SMS to the user. When the user enters the OTP code on your application login screen, the external MFA is completed, and the user will be allowed to access your application.</p>
<p>Risk-Based Authentication is an area that we will continue to develop over the next two to three release cycles. We are excited to expand our Identity Platform into this dynamic security space and believe we will deliver many useful enhancements to the platform. Ask your Sales Team/Account Manager for more information on upcoming development plans.</p>
 Improved Security 
<p>We are all aware that security is a continual process, not a one-time destination. For the Identity Platform, this process of continually ensuring our security posture is paramount. We have been investing development cycles to ensure we can respond to unforeseen security events, like Log4j v2 at the end of last year, as well as making systematic improvements to the core functioning and performance of the Identity Platform. During this release we have published several further improvements to the platform.</p>
<p>OpenLDAP MDB: We’ve updated the directory (OpenLDAP) which underlies our SSO application to OpenLDAP MDB (Memory-Mapped Database), which has proven to give a responsive and ready-to-scale datastore to our Identity Platform. We have been operating MDB for one of our cloud customers for six months now and it has proven capable of handling upwards of a million active user sessions. An updated session manager (which is also used with Redis deployments) further improves session management on the platform. Read the release notes for more details as there are environment updates needed to migrate from the existing OpenLDAP BDB to MDB.</p>
<p>Java11: We have recompiled the Identity Platform with Java 11. This fundamental improvement brings all the enhancements of Java 11, as well as the security improvements permitted by enabling updates in third-party libraries and services (like WildFly) used throughout the Identity Platform. For many of us, Java 8 has been a mainstay for a number of years. Java 11 will not be as long lived as Java 8 was – please see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-support-roadmap.html">Oracle’s page</a>&nbsp;over Java SE life cycles. We will review Java 17 vs Java 21 in late 2023, so please anticipate your environment needs as we move forward.</p>
<p>Third-party libraries: The Identity Platform follows open standards, like OIDC (OpenID Connect), and uses many third-party libraries. The standards and libraries help to ensure that the code is reviewed by a global community, with the community offering patches against security vulnerabilities and bugs. For each and every release, we continue to patch the third-party libraries used and as needed update the libraries to more modern or better functioning libraries and code bases. Within the 2022.1 release, we’ve continued this updating. As with prior releases we encourage every customer to update their environment as soon as possible, to benefit from these latest updates.</p>
 Looking Forward 
<p>As we head into the summer months, we are aiming to finalise another section of Risk-Based Authentication (directory mapped users will gain the ability to use TOTP as their MFA), complete the modernisation of logging libraries within the platform, and complete some updates to make premises-based installations easier. We have some exiting mid-term goals that we hope to announce at the end of summer, that will bring IDaaS into sharp view and consideration for all&nbsp; future customer projects. We expect to have a two-year roadmap laid out to discuss with all of you at the end of summer. Until then, please have a look at the 2022.1 Release Notes. Feel free to engage with us via the Operations team or your account team – we are always happy for your input to help shape our future developments.</p>

   Account creation fraud–also referred to as new account fraud (NAF) or fake accounts fraud–is the act of fraudsters creating accounts on online services with malicious intent. 
 &nbsp; 
 There are many variations in how and why fraudsters engage in this activity (and we will cover these below in detail), but the general ideas are the same:

<p>Account creation fraud–also referred to as new account fraud (NAF) or fake accounts fraud–is the act of fraudsters creating accounts on online services with malicious intent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many variations in how and why fraudsters engage in this activity (and we will cover these below in detail), but the general ideas are the same:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <p>A fraudster creates accounts on an online service with malicious intent using fake or stolen identity information.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A fraudster uses fake accounts to conduct fraudulent activity for the purpose of monetization (directly or indirectly).</p>
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tactics of account creation fraud vary between different online services depending on the information required for account creation, the information verification processes, and eventually the ways that accounts can be used for illegitimate activity. Some examples of these differences between services are as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <p>Online gaming platforms: A valid email address alone is sometimes sufficient to create an account. Once created, a fake account may be used, for example, to spam other players or to gain in-game assets that can then be transferred.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Online retail and e-commerce: An email address and basic details such as gender and name are usually sufficient for account creation. A fake account may be used, for example, for credit card testing (i.e., simply verifying that account details and credit card details are valid) or as part of accounts referral chaining to collect referral bonuses.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Financial services: Account creation usually requires highly detailed account information such as an address, phone number, and social security number. A fake account may be used, for example, to access credit.</p>

<p>Small-to-midsize business (SMB) owners have had to pivot and adjust to the new realities of the economy, throughout the pandemic and beyond. Implementing new business models, investing in PPE and managing employees all come with additional costs, in a business environment that’s already rife with inflationary pressures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Managing these challenges takes every available resource, and owner-permissioned SMB open banking data is powering the financial management apps and services that owners are embracing to improve their business operations. According to Mastercard’s <a href="https://www.finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking-sme/">Rise of Open Banking Small Business report</a>, connecting accounts is the main driver that provides the insights and analytics that owners are looking for to help tackle critical business tasks. Ninety-six percent of owners are currently linking their business financial accounts, taking advantage of fintech apps and services that leverage open banking data to generate crucial information and insights for their businesses, helping to improve decision-making. The top reasons for connecting accounts are:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Receiving payments from customers (75%) 
 Banking (73%) 
 Billing/invoicing (73%) 
 Paying bills/expenses (73%) 
 Accounting (73%) 
 Cash flow management (72%) 
 
<p>With all the benefits of linking accounts, fintech innovators have a window of opportunity in the SMB space to improve the connection process:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 Reducing time for cross-platform verification 
 Making it intuitive for SMB owners to link their accounts, or communicating how to link accounts 
 Utilizing UI that auto-populates routing and accounting numbers 
 Utilizing account owner verification to mitigate fraudulent accounts 
 
<p>Even with the understandable adjustments that it takes to press forward into a new era of digital business and financial management, the desire to adopt is strong in the SMB sector. Owners want to digitize their businesses to help prevent fraud, automate processes and share data and insights across apps.&nbsp;</p>
 Linking Accounts Generates Real-Time Financial Insights 
<p>Despite rising fintech use, 94% of small business owners still encounter financial pain points. Many of them cite financial management as a major source of stress.</p>
<p>Owners are seeking solutions that can help them with financial management to address these pain points. They’re looking for better ways to harness their business’s data to get a holistic view, optimize financial management and inform business strategy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is where SMB fintech services providers can step in and provide solutions, partnering with SMBs as they push forward into the new digital economy. Owners are open to receiving help. Sixty-three percent are looking for help with financial planning for their business, and 85% want the kind of custom financial recommendations that come from linking accounts and sharing open banking data.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The top driver for owners linking accounts is improvement in business decision-making. This comes directly from financial management apps and services. Real-time data paired with AI, machine learning and analytics can have a powerful impact on an owner’s speed of decision-making and action, allowing them to either take advantage of opportunities or avoid costly mistakes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Better data and better decisions naturally feed into the rest of the top-three SMB owners’ concerns: saving time and improving financial health.&nbsp;</p>
 How Small Businesses are Using Open Banking Fintech Apps and Services 
<p>According to Mastercard’s <a href="https://www.finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking-sme/">report</a>, banking is the top use case for small businesses, once they link their accounts. Depositing checks, paying bills and transferring funds are core, everyday needs that SMB owners are currently using fintech to accomplish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Billing and invoicing can be streamlined and automated with fintech, and small businesses want this. Sixty-one percent of small businesses are already using fintech to do so. When routine tasks can be handled in the background by apps, owners can move more pressing concerns to the forefront. Growing, scaling and developing products or services can be given the bandwidth they deserve.</p>
<p>Sixty percent are using digital apps and services for cash flow management. With real-time data from linked accounts, owners can pay bills strategically, while making sure they can pay vendors, employees and themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the number of SMBs leveraging fintech apps is currently in the 50-60% range, the Rise of Open Banking study found that the number who want to use digital apps and services powered by open banking is over 90% for the majority of use cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The <a href="https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/05122043/Small-Business-FAQ-2020.pdf">31.7 million small businesses</a> in the US are looking for more choice in financial services. They’re willing and ready to adapt to the digital future, and are looking for innovators that provide solutions to help them make better decisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mastercard’s “always on” platform means maximum connection uptime and the highest quality data for insights into the financial health of a small business. Read the full report <a href="https://www.finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking-sme/">here</a> to see details on the solutions small businesses are looking for from financial service technology.</p>

<p>A bipartisan group of legislators in the US House and Senate has proposed a bill that could result in a long-awaited national data privacy law. This is big news that could allow internet users to opt out of targeted advertisements and sue companies that improperly sell their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 This is the biggest breakthrough to date for a national privacy law 



<p></p>



<p>While it’s too soon to say whether the bill will pass, whether its protections will be diluted before it passes, and how rigorously the law will be enforced, this is the biggest breakthrough to date for a national data privacy law.&nbsp;The US is one of the only major global economies without&nbsp;strong&nbsp;national privacy laws&nbsp;<a href="https://insights.comforte.com/12-countries-with-gdpr-like-data-privacy-laws">akin to the GDPR</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 Some say this bill offers a compromise position 



<p></p>



<p>Until now, partisan disagreements and privacy actives fighting for their version of a perfect bill have hampered efforts and distracted from the benefits of passing a reasonable, decent bill. Democrats argue for a private right of action that will give consumers legal rights if government fails to enforce the federal law, while Republicans want a federal law to preempt state laws to end the patchwork of compliance obligations on business.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/06/03/internet-privacy-congress-compromise-proposal/">Observers</a>&nbsp;say this current bipartisan bill represents a compromise on these two big sticking points, in that it limits when and how users could sue internet companies for privacy violations and contains measures that would supersede most state data privacy laws.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under the proposed bill:</p>



  Companies would have to restrict their data collection to only data that is necessary for their business to function.  Companies couldn’t charge users to access data privacy measures except in some limited circumstances.  The Federal Trade Commission would have to maintain a public registry of data brokers and present a way for users to opt out of targeted advertisements and other data sharing practices.  Consumers could access, correct and delete their own data and companies would have to tell third parties to change user data where users request it.  Companies would have to annually prove their compliance.  The FTC would be tasked with enforcing the law via a new purpose-built bureau for consumer data privacy.&nbsp;  Individual users could sue companies after a four-year waiting period from the date this new bill is enacted. There are some caveats on individual powers to sue.  The new federal law would supersede most state data privacy laws with some exceptions.  



<p>The proposed bill needs more members’ support and is in a race against time to be passed before the midterm elections. So while this proposed bill is generally good news, a bill is only as good as the funding and capabilities of the agencies responsible for enforcing it. And if it doesn’t pass before the midterms, what then?</p>

<p>Last month we were asked to give a talk in Korea on the design principles for a new personal data economy. We’ve turned this talk into a White Paper, <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/">published here</a>.</p><p>It’s important because, in our view, most current debate about personal data is based on a philosophical category error that inevitably leads to a dead&nbsp;end.</p><p>If you want to solve a problem you need to know what’s causing it. If you’ve got a heart problem, no matter how many pills you take for gastric wind you won’t solve it. When it comes to personal data, most discussion assumes that our problems are caused by how organisations handle the data they collect and use. They are not. They are caused by the design of the system these organisations are operating within.</p><p>‘System design’? That sounds rather abstract and airy-fairy. Not for practical people. But it’s not abstract or airy-fairy at all. Birds are living systems designed to fly in the air. Fish are designed to swim in water. If you ask a fish to fly you won’t get very far because that’s not what its system is designed to&nbsp;do.</p><p>Today’s personal data system is designed to help organisations collect and use data to further their particular purposes. It is not designed to help citizens get the benefits of their data, to use data to address social ills, or even to help economy-wide innovation and growth (which may involve the creation of new and different organisations).</p><p>In fact, with the way our current system works citizens have little or no control over their own data and are not benefiting as they should from it. Service providers often lack access to the data they need and face high costs in accessing and using it. And the system as a whole experiences high costs along with low levels of trust and restricted innovation.</p><p>But these problems are not created by the behaviours of individual organisations in isolation. They are created by the way the system itself works. Its design: the fact that it is organised solely around organisations collecting and using data for their own particular purposes. We simply won’t solve the problems we now face by asking organisations to behave differently; by asking fish to fly. We can only solve them by introducing a different system&nbsp;design.</p> Fitness for&nbsp;purpose <p>We need a system for personal data that unleashes its full personal, social and economic potential; that goes beyond only helping organisations achieve their purposes. To achieve this we need to design a new system that’s fit for a broader range of purposes; that’s designed to fly rather than&nbsp;swim.</p><p>These design principles are not random, plucked from the air because we think they might be nice. It’s no accident that all fish are sleek and that birds have wings. These designs fit what they need to do. So what fit-for-purpose design principles do we need to&nbsp;adopt?</p><p>For a start, we need to build on the fact that unlike other commodities, when data gets used it doesn’t get used up. It can be used again and again, for many different purposes. We expand on this <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/from-ouou-to-mumu-why-the-real-information-age-hasnt-even-started-yet-6ebf7b871184">theme here</a>. This being the case, it makes no sense to restrict access to data to just one organisation with one set of purposes. We need to break out of the confines of organisation-centricity, to enable data&nbsp;sharing.</p><p>However, if you try to create a system where all organisations try to share data with all other organisations, you quickly create <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-perils-of-pre-copernican-data-strategy-974827845585">a complexity catastrophe</a>. To solve this problem you need fit-for-purpose design. If data about each individual is deposited in the individual’s personal data store, then these personal data stores can act as hubs for the safe, efficient sharing of personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>This is effectively a new layer of data infrastructure that transforms the design of the system. It turns multiple separate, independent, exclusive and excluding silos of data collection and use (today’s organisations) into a networked data sharing ecosystem with three core functional layers:</p>  Service providers collecting and generating personal data (acting as ‘data factories’ if you&nbsp;like)  A new exchange layer made up of personal data stores where data is stored and distributed under the individual’s control (data warehouses holding what the factories have produced)  The same and other service providers accessing and using this data to produce specific services.  <p>This means that our system’s current operating principle — that ‘the organisations that use data always store the data in question in their own systems’ — increasingly makes way for a different operational principle: the increasing separation of data storage and use, where personal data stores store individuals’ data and specialist users access this data when they need it. (Like to going to a shop when you need bread rather than baking it yourself.)</p><p>A key element of this new system design is that it is now largely citizen- or person-centric. Personal data stores a) give each individual control over the collection, sharing and use of their own data, and b) act as the natural point where all information about them is aggregated — information that was previously dispersed across hundreds of different, separate organisations collecting data about&nbsp;them.</p><p>This new structure not only empowers citizens with their own data (thereby shifting balances of power and reward within the data economy), it also creates new person-centric data assets that are impossible to create under the old structure and which are natural sources of future innovation and&nbsp;growth.</p><p>The economics of all this is another question which we will return to shortly. Right now, our focus is the design principles themselves which fall into four main areas of system architecture, infrastructure, governance and economic/business model. The following tables summarise their key points. The <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/">White Paper itself</a> explains their logic in further&nbsp;detail.</p> Architecture <p>Today’s data economy is organised exclusively around organisations, disperses citizens’ data across many different organisations, excludes citizens from its workings (with organisations collecting and using data about them), operates via separate data silos that act like moated castles of data control, and integrate the collection and use of data behind these castle&nbsp;walls.</p><p>The new data economy will enable citizens to collect and use their own data (as well as organisations), make individuals the point at which data about themselves is integrated, and place this new data asset directly under the citizen’s control. It will connect today’s data silos via a new ‘exchange layer’ of personal data stores that enable citizen-controlled data sharing and increasingly separates the storage of data from&nbsp;use.</p>Table 1: Architecture of the new personal data ecosystem Infrastructure <p>Today’s organisation-centric approach to personal data use creates multiple separate data silos where data is concentrated in a small number of centralised databases. Citizens’ control over their data is restricted to (often only formal) rights to consent to data collection and use. By the very way it operates it is privacy invading: organisations get to know a lot about the individuals they hold data&nbsp;on.</p><p>The new infrastructure is distributed, with multiple nodes (personal data stores) where individuals can exert real, direct control over their data. Because each personal data store is individually encrypted, with only the individual holding the key, it operates on a zero knowledge (rather than privacy invading) basis. It has a technology agnostic, cloud- based approach where PDS providers ensure key functions such as interoperability.</p>Table 2: Infrastructure of the new personal data ecosystem Governance <p>The critical governance challenge is that trustworthiness cannot be reduced to an organisation’s policy or promise: a policy that may change at any time or a promise that may be broken at any time. Commitments to ensure data security, privacy etc need to be permanent and legally enforceable, embedded in the constitutions of the institutions providing the data infrastructure. (This relates to the ‘built to last’ principle — see&nbsp;below).</p><p>In today’s data ecosystem, many organisations seek to gather and use personal data for the purposes of competitive advantage. To achieve this, they restrict who has access to the data.. For infrastructure designed to empower and include citizens and to enable data sharing of wider, improved data use, while competition between different service providers can be as intense as ever, the data infrastructure needs to be neutral: it must be designed to enable all legitimate users, without&nbsp;favour.</p>Table 3: Infrastructure governance in the new personal data ecosystem Economic logic and business&nbsp;models <p>To sustain themselves in a way that maintains and fulfils their function, personal data store providers need to be able to cover their costs. This ensures their independence from external parties who may wish to use control over the purse strings to exercise control over purposes. Because the purpose of this infrastructure is to enable others’ actions rather than to make and sell a specific ‘product’, its prime economic logic and benefit is ‘cost out’ rather than ‘added margin’. All its financial and economic incentives need to be designed to ensure this sustainability, neutrality and mission alignment.</p><p>A key part of this is continuity and longevity: a personal data store is for life, so the institutions providing personal data stores should be designed for decades (centuries, even). Whatever particular corporate form they take, legal safeguards relating to continuity and longevity of purpose need to be built into how they&nbsp;operate.</p>Table 4: Economic and business models underlying the new personal data ecosystem <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/design-principles-for-the-personal-data-economy-f63ffa93e382">Design Principles for the Personal Data Economy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: In the recent years, there have been organisations across the world creating, for instance, mobile credentials, and specifically mobile driving licenses. So, we’re going to discuss about this topic, and also the privacy side of this super interesting system that has been around. So, for that, we have an expert who is joining us today. My guest today is John Wunderlich. He is an information privacy and security expert with extensive experience in information privacy, identity management, and data security.</p>
<p>He has designed, built, operated, and assessed system for operations and compliance in the private and public sectors for over 25 years. These includes working or consulting for Fortune 500 corporations, government ministries, small companies, volunteer organisations, regulators, and health system organisations of all sizes.</p>
<p>Hello, John.</p>
<p>John Wunderlich: Hi, Oscar, how are you doing?</p>
<p>Oscar: Very good. It’s a pleasure talking with you.</p>
<p>John: Likewise.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic. That’s a super interesting topic we’re going to discuss today about mobile credentials, so yeah, let’s talk about digital identity. But first, of course, we want to hear something a bit more about you as a guest. So please tell us your journey to the world of digital identity.</p>
<p>John: Long story short, I used to be Corporate Systems Administrator, Network Administrator, Operations Manager, and the Federal Privacy Law in Canada was introduced, I took that as a project at my company, and it turned into a career. When I moved from the corporate side to working for a regulator, I first met Kim Cameron, a name that most of your listeners will know, working with the Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, shortly after he introduced the Seven Laws of Identity. And around the same time, my former boss introduced the idea of Privacy by Design.</p>
<p>So, for me going back 15, 16 years privacy and identity have been in lockstep. There’s a very large Venn diagram overlap between the two. And I’ve been consulting and working on standards and volunteer areas in that joint area since then.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Yes, just a few years ago, maybe almost two, a bit more than two years ago, we met in Kantara Initiative, in one of the working groups, and you are super involved there. And I know that recently, you and other authors have released one document called <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/download/pimdl-v1-final/">Privacy and Identity Protection in Mobile Driving License Ecosystem</a>. So first of all, kudos for that very good report.</p>
<p>John: Gracias!</p>
<p>Oscar: I read at least partly that and definitely I want to hear more about that today. So going into that specific mobile credentials, mobile driving licenses, I would like to hear, to start, a simple definition. So, what are mobile credentials?</p>
<p>John: Well, at the very highest level, a mobile credential is a bundle of attributes about an entity that sits on a mobile phone, or a mobile device. That’s at a very high level. And it then sort of branches down from there. You look at wallets or you can look at flash passes, or you can look at mobile driving licenses which have a specific ISO standard. You can talk about the W3C mobile credentials data model. You can talk about decentralised IDs, the W3C DIDs. So, it branches out into a whole grouping of things, but it ends up being bundles of attributes on a mobile phone.</p>
<p>Oscar: In practice, that replaces holding a driving license, the physical driving license.</p>
<p>John: I think in any substantive way, it doesn’t replace it yet. I mean, we’re talking about in-person presentation on the phone. In the workgroup that I lead that’s working on a recommendation report at Kantara, we’ve kind of matched the scope of ISO 18013-5, sorry for the ISO number reference, which is mobile driving licenses on the phone. It’s not the online presentation, which helps reduce the problem space significantly. But I think it is the case that most credentials like that are issued on the phone still have physical analogues.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes.</p>
<p>John: So that people have a choice of presenting, for example, in Canada, health is a provincial matter so depending on the province, you would be issued a QR code for your COVID vaccination status and you could print that out on paper, or there were apps that you could present it on the phone, so people did both. So, I think in the space of the mobile credential, mass adoption is still sort of dual track, not replacing but supplementing.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. So yeah, whichever is available or convenient for the individual. And tell me, because I know it’s in some countries, you mentioned in Canada, this type of mobile credentials, more specifically, the mobile driving licenses are already being issued, not everywhere in world. Normally, who are these mobile credentials issued by and how do they work in practice?</p>
<p>John: Well, anybody can issue a credential. The analogue is weak, but I still think of a bundle of credentials, a bunch of attributes as the digital equivalent of a business card. I can print my own business card. But the level of assurance and level of authority is pretty weak on a business card, as opposed to a laminated plastic with a hologram issued by a government for a driving license or a proof of citizenship or a medical card or an in between, something that might be issued by a university or a company. So, you have different levels of assurance in the physical world, just as you do in the digital world. So, anybody can issue a credential, the question is what level of authority you give to the credential.</p>
<p>Oscar: And we can say the right now the most, the mobile credential that has the highest level of assurance are done by governments today.</p>
<p>John: Yeah, I don’t think that’s going to change. The government, possibly financial institutions, possibly health institutions, but they are institutionally issued by institutions that have the capability of doing identity verification on initial issuance to provide a very high level of assurance that this credential is associated with this entity.</p>
<p>Oscar: Sure. Tell me a bit of the practicalities because I have never used, at least a mobile driving license, how it works in practice, when people who drive want to present the credential?</p>
<p>John: Well, let’s talk about two use cases for a mobile driving license. One is proof of authority that you’re, in fact, a licensed driver. So, you’re pulled over by the police and asked to present your driver’s license. Right now, you present a plastic laminate card, they look at it, look at the picture, may go back to their squad car, and do a check to make sure that there’s no problems with that license, that there’s no warrants. Once a warrant is issued against your name, all that good stuff. We’re presuming here that this is a legitimate traffic stop. I have a lead foot, they pull me over for going 80 in a 60, or whatever. And all of that is authorised by law. So, they get a full set of the credentials that are on the card and are able to access their backend system to get further information about me. So that’s fairly intrusive. But that’s what you would expect when you are a potential violator of the law.</p>
<p>As opposed to the more common use case for driving license, which is age verification. So, it’s long past the age where I get checked when I go into an establishment where I could buy alcohol or cannabis. But that’s the joke, driving licenses get used much more for drinking than they do for driving because people need them to buy alcohol. So right now, if I’m a just barely legal age young woman, because this is the edge case that causes real difficulties, and I’m trying to enter a club, I have to show the doorman or the bouncer at the front of the club my entire driving license. Now, what he should be doing is looking at the driving license, looking at the picture to make sure that I’m actually the person I purport to be. And then looking at the date of birth and making sure that I’m old enough in that jurisdiction to enter the club. That’s it. That’s all and no retention of information.</p>
<p>The problem, the dual edged nature of the digital driving license is this. If you do it right, you end up with all that shows up on the device that the doorman is using to verify your digital license. So, you present a QR code or there’s an NFC, you wave your phone near their receiver, the same way you do a tap to pay or a Bluetooth off in the MDL specification. All of those are allowable, the Bluetooth and the NFC are preferable. And what shows up on the doorman’s verifying device is a picture of the person whose license it is so that they can do the proof of presence. Yeah, this is indeed the person I’m presented with. And a green checkmark that says this person is old enough.</p>
<p>So, as opposed to the analogue physical driving license, he has no opportunity should he be amorously struck by the person to grab her address or follow her or grab your phone number or do any of that stuff. And the system operated by the bar also cannot record anything other than there was an age verification for a person, or they can–. On the other hand, depending on how the presentation goes, the backend system for John’s Bar and Grill could collect all the credentials that are on that driving license even if it only shows the doorman the other one and send me marketing email and all that other kind of stuff. So, you can do it in a really privacy protective manner, or you can take the bad edge case of presenting a card and automate that for negative consequences.</p>
<p>So obviously, the Kantara workgroup that I lead for reports and recommendations on privacy enhancing mobile credentials, is trying to come up with a set of recommendations for providers of verifier device issuers, providers of wallets or designers of mobile credentials, how to protect the privacy of the individual above and beyond the transaction.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely. In this example of the going to a bar, you illustrated how it works, but also in the privacy implications.</p>
<p>John: Personally, I’d prefer some of the European countries that don’t have age distinctions. If you want to send your six-year-old to the bar to pick up some wine, then… But I think there’s cultural bands in those countries where if you’re publicly intoxicated, you’re subject to social ridicule. There’s no social benefit to being inebriated. Anyway, that’s a side-line.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. And definitely you started explaining there some of the challenges about privacy. What would you say are the main, if you can just summarise the main challenges about privacy?</p>
<p>John: Well, the business culture, surveillance capitalism, if you will, I know that’s a fraught face. When I was running networking systems and systems administrator in the ’90s, I was issuing X.509 certificates and I had all my user data, and I had access to it. Which kind of made sense in mid to late ’90s systems. And we were a B2B company that I was working for, but we were processing the personal information of our customer’s clients. So, we also had a proprietary interest in that.</p>
<p>So, coming into 2000, there’s this sort of culture of data about people is an asset owned by the companies and can be used to those companies’ advantage. The idea of, because systems were centralised and few, privacy issues didn’t really raise their head. There was good confidentiality in most companies, but not privacy.</p>
<p>And then, with the explosion of systems, and the introduction of a very interconnected backend, and especially with the introduction of monetising data through behavioural advertising and tracking, the entire thing got out of control, and we need to wrest control back of our own information. The challenge is cultural as much as anything, like the business culture around personal data. And the business models, which are I think, not sustainable.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely. And could you now tell us about the solutions? What are the solutions to those challenges you just mentioned?</p>
<p>John: Well, I think the solutions are two or three-fold. Legislation like the GDPR in Europe, or a day or two ago, I don’t know when this is going out. But just today, I heard the news that in the US, there was an agreement that might lead towards a Federal Privacy Law in the US. But all of those laws have the same flaw, which is that they’re built on the idea of Fair Information Practices, which came out of a 1970s vision of the way computer networks and systems run. Which is what we know now to be a completely flawed, notice and consent model where the organisation is a trusted organisation. It provides you notice of what they’re going to do with your data, they get your consent, and then they take possession of your data and act as a trusted custodian of your data. That was fine when there was a couple of 100 mainframes scattered around the world and IBM, [0:13:31] [unsure] on most of them doesn’t make any sense now.</p>
<p>So, there’s a new type of regulation that’s needed. But there’s a new type of standard that’s needed as well. So, the new type of regulation is what I started to taking to call “digital building code” which is you shouldn’t, any more than you shouldn’t build a house with electrical connections without making sure that your electrical infrastructure meets the building code for your jurisdiction. I think that there needs to be digital building codes so you can’t build a system that’s going to process personal information without meeting a certain minimum set of standards for protecting so that people don’t have to try and read privacy policies that can give notice and consent. That should be matched by standards and business culture to meet that floor standards.</p>
<p>So, it’s a tripod, if you will, the complaint mechanisms in the current regulations, safety regulations to make sure everybody is operating off the same floor, and standards to enable developers and companies to meet those. And I’m working on the standards side.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. You mentioned the companies tend to use the data of the individuals as a property. So how you, when we were discussing before this interview, you mentioned was the role of the IAM into this, what is your view on that?</p>
<p>John: Well, I remember talking at IIW a few years ago, it wasn’t about SSI as this was pre-SSI, but it was about a product in the system that enabled companies to give control over some portion of their customer’s data to the customer. So, in financial institutions, they’re highly regulated, and oftentimes have a requirement to send paper to their customer’s home on a yearly or quarterly basis.</p>
<p>If you have the wrong address, it’s very expensive, but you have this address in your database for the customer. And if you’ve got it wrong, you eat the cost of reprinting, resending, bringing back the data that you sent to the wrong address. The customer neglected to update you on their address, and so forth and so on. It costs millions of dollars to some of these companies every year just in data around customer addresses.</p>
<p>So, this was a system that instead of a customer requesting an address change, the company gave control of the address information to the customer, so that if the customer didn’t update the data, so with power comes responsibility, then the customer will be charged for the delivery charge to the wrong place, the reprinting and delivery charge. So that de-risks that company on that.</p>
<p>In that particular system, I had also enabled the customer to update their address with multiple companies at once if they were participating in the protocol. So, you can de-risk your data, especially against data rot, by actually giving control back to the person who knows it best. Now, you’re not going to do, I know I worked in payroll and HR so theoretically, customers can also update their financial information like, “Oh, I changed account, let me enter, put a new account number.”</p>
<p>But anybody who’s worked in payroll and HR knows that you want to verify that, so you have to balance that. But giving control of customer’s data can save you money and improve the quality of your data. And I think that was kind of one of the arguments that SSI people don’t make often enough is just the simple, reduced cost and business risk of putting people in control of aspects of their own data.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. Regarding the report that you built in Kantara, tell me more about that. How it was the work that and you can tell the main findings?</p>
<p>John: The way Kantara works, there’s two kinds of discussion groups which produce reports and then recommendations, which will have requirements for conformance that could be tested. So, your audience may well know the identity assurance work trust mark that Kantara can issue if you want to make claims about your level of identity assurance for your firm.</p>
<p>So, the discussion group produced a report on protecting privacy and information and mobile driving licenses coming and that report is available on the <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">kantarainitiative.org</a> website for download and you can take a look at it. The workgroup is trying to do a little bit more ambitious. It’s trying to talk about how do you meet the reasonable expectations of privacy in the issuer, holder, verifier triangle where Alice is the holder? How can she trust that her reasonable expectations of privacy are maintained in the transactions after she’s been issued a mobile credential that that credential won’t be abused in a way? Because most of the standards are transactional, which is to say that if you use the ISO MDL standard, for example, it talks about the interfaces. It has good requirements around data minimisation, and notice and consent, but it’s all around the transaction. It doesn’t speak to, and it’s not supposed to, it’s scoped out of it.</p>
<p>It doesn’t speak about if John’s Bar and Grill is the verifier and they’re using a system issued by ‘insert your mobile payment system verifier here’ that both that system at John’s Bar and Grill. And John’s Bar and Grill, once they’ve gotten the identity attributes from the transaction, how do they use those in a privacy protective manner? If you’re building a wallet or building a mobile credential for a phone, how do you do that, so that Alice can trust the wallet not to share the information for advertising on the backend, and so forth, and so on. So, building human trust between entities is how I like to summarise it rather than technical trust between endpoints, which is a lot of what most of us work with.</p>
<p>Oscar: That’s a very interesting distinction you make, right? Trust is something technical for most of us.</p>
<p>John: Well, sure. But if you think about it, Zk-SNARKs or Zero Trust Solutions make perfect sense, right? If I went back to being a Network Administrator, I’d build a zero-trust network. I would assume that there was an APT inside my network and there would be zero trust between the endpoints, and everything would be cryptographically signed and verified and yadda yadda yadda.</p>
<p>But in the real world, and this is– I steal this example from Bruce Schneier. If there was zero trust, nobody would ever cruise through a green light. How many times, if you were driving today, how many times to do sales through a green light without looking to see if some idiot was ignoring the red light and ploughing through? I mean, it happens every once in a while, for a variety of reasons. But by and large, if you’ve got a green light, you trust that all the other drivers on the road are following the rules and you just go through.</p>
<p>That’s trust. That’s human trust. It’s built on systems that have all kinds of safeguards to make sure that you don’t have a green light going four ways. But once the systems are working, people can trust each other using those systems. And we do not have that on the internet. There is essentially zero people trust, and sadly, that’s been earned by the behaviour of a number of ecosystems that handle personal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed. So, you have seen this, the understanding of trust, let’s say the identity professionals are the one who are building the systems and the, let’s say, the majority of people that difference. So, you have noticed that this makes things complicated for developing the systems?</p>
<p>John: Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, the story for surveillance capital, like companies that depend on advertising is, we never sell your information, or we never share your information. Well, which was true in a sense, and that if you went to site X, or site F, or site G, you know, insert whatever company. And you went to that site, and then behind the scenes, real time bidding occurred, they didn’t share your information with any of the advertisers. The advertisers said, I want to put my ad on profiles that meet these parameters. And there’ll be real time bidding.</p>
<p>So, at one level, until you clicked on the ad, and at which point your positive action of clicking on the ad created a relationship between you and the advertiser, at which point it’s out of system X or system F or system G’s hands, you’ve now done something, and that advertiser or the publisher has access to your information, because you clicked on their ad. So, in a very narrow, untrustworthy sense, yeah, they weren’t selling your data. Although a lot has come out now about the way real time bidding works, and how much information is shared for the 100 bidders, who get to see some bit of your data to bid on that page, and only one of them actually gets the data, the one that actually wins the bid. It’s a snake pit behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed. Well, thank you, very interesting, what you are sharing with us about the mobile credential, the privacy and how things are progressing. Could you tell us now for all business leaders that are listening to us, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>John: The actionable item is, do you know who you share your customer’s data with? And why you shared it? And would you be comfortable sharing that information with your customer? So, the answer to all three of those questions should be yes. Yes, I know with whom I shared it. Yes, I know what I shared. And yes, I’m comfortable letting the customer know that I’ve shared it. If any one of those answers is no, then there’s going to be a reckoning at some point with your customers, or with the regulator, or with your business model.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yup. Three questions that, as you said, they should be yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>John: Those three yeses de-risk and future-proof your organisation.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly, exactly. Well, thanks a lot for putting it in a very, very clear way for everybody who is listening to this. Well, thanks a lot for sharing all this super interesting about mobile driver licenses. And of course, I recommend, so we’ll put the link to the report, <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/download/pimdl-v1-final/">Kantara Initiative report</a> that John has co-authored and super interesting,</p>
<p>John: And a link to the workgroup, hopefully, because I invite anybody who is interested in this to join the workgroup because you can start to help shape the requirements for the standard to come.</p>
<p>Oscar: So, what is the name of the workgroup? What is the exact name?</p>
<p>John: <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/groups/pemc-wg/">The Privacy Enhancing Mobile Credentials</a>.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, perfect. We will add the link as well. Fantastic. So, John, it was a pleasure talking with you. If there’s something else that you would like to tell or how people can get in touch with you.</p>
<p>John: Probably the simplest way is I’m @PrivacyCDN on both Twitter and LinkedIn, P-R- I-V-A-C-Y CDN. That’s a play on words because in Canada, CDN is sometimes used for Canadian. But in the rest of the world, it means Content Delivery Network, so I thought that was an interesting pun. Anyway, @PrivacyCDN on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/privacycdn/?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Egoogle%2Ecom%2F&amp;originalSubdomain=ca">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/PrivacyCDN">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, I didn’t know that’s CDN, so it’s good to know, thank you. Again, it was a pleasure talking with you, John, and all the best.</p>
<p>John: Take care, Oscar.</p>

<p>Between long hours at work and time spent on devices outside of work hours, digital interactions have become a dominant and permeating force in the lives of people all over the world. In 2020 and 2021, the global COVD-19 pandemic rewired consumers to be digital-first (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CpZP-avaaBZPAawyV07a_GWwFGOlGIiO/view?usp=sharing">Adobe</a>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of this, organizations and businesses have become hyper-focused on boosting user experience (UX) to ensure that customers and employees can easily engage with all their digital properties, helping to support and drive business growth. Unfortunately, this also means that bad actors are also on the rise, and online threats are more prevalent than ever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A great UX is critical in this digital-first world but begs the question: is it possible to balance UX and security in a way that creates a smooth experience for the user and a secure environment for your organization? In this article, we will look at how identity security can balance UX and security throughout the user journey.</p>

  <p>When it comes to infrastructure, public clouds are the most popular choice these days, especially Amazon Web Services (AWS). If you are in one of those lucky or unlucky (depending on how you see it) teams running microservices, then you need a way to orchestrate their deployments. When it comes to orchestrating microservices, Kubernetes is the de-facto choice. Most public cloud providers also provide managed Kubernetes as a service; for example, Google provides Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Microsoft provides Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and Amazon provides Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).</p>

<p>This doesn’t mean that deploying and managing microservices on the public cloud is easy; each cloud service comes with its own challenges and pain. This is especially true for Amazon EKS, which, in my opinion, is the most difficult Kubernetes service to use, but also one of the most flexible. This is because EKS consists of some clever orchestrations doing a complex dance on top of other AWS services like EC2, EBS, etc.</p>

<p>If you want to run a microservice stack on EKS, you will need to spend some extra time and effort setting it up and managing it. This is where infrastructure as code (IaC) tools like <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> come in handy.</p>

<p>So here is what you will learn to do today:</p>

 
   Scaffold a Java microservice stack using JHipster, Spring Boot, and Spring Cloud 
   Create an EKS cluster, Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), subnets, and required Kubernetes add-ons using Terraform on AWS 
   Set up OIDC authentication for the microservice stack using Okta 
   Build and deploy the microservice stack to the cluster

 Why Terraform, why not CloudFormation? 

<p>At this point, the first question that might pop up in your mind would be, “Why not use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">CloudFormation</a>?”. It’s a good question; after all, CloudFormation is built by AWS and hence sounds like an excellent solution to manage AWS resources. But anyone who has tried both CloudFormation and Terraform will probably tell you to forget that CloudFormation even exists. I think CloudFormation is far more complex and less developer-friendly than Terraform. You also need to write a lot more boilerplate with CloudFormation in YAML or JSON. Yikes! And most importantly, Terraform is far more powerful and flexible than CloudFormation. It’s cross-platform, which means you can take care of all your infrastructure management needs on any platform with one tool.</p>

 Scaffold a Java microservice stack using JHipster 

<p>You need a microservice stack to deploy to the cluster. I’m using a microservice stack scaffolded for demo purposes using <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech">JHipster</a>. You can use another microservice stack if you want. If you prefer using the same application as in this demo, then you can either scaffold it using JHipster <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/jdl/intro">JDL</a> or clone the sample repository from <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-jhipster-k8s-eks-microservices-example">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Option 1: Scaffold the microservice stack using JHipster</p>

   <code>mkdir jhipster-microservice-stack
cd jhipster-microservice-stack
# download the JDL file.
jhipster download https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oktadev/okta-jhipster-k8s-eks-microservices-example/main/apps.jdl
# Update the `dockerRepositoryName` property to use your Docker Repository URI/Name.
# scaffold the apps.
jhipster jdl apps.jdl
</code>   

<p>Option 2: Clone the sample repository</p>

   <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/okta-jhipster-k8s-eks-microservices-example
</code>   

<p>In either case, remember to change the Docker repository name to match your Docker repository.</p>

<p>The JHipster scaffolded sample application has a gateway application, two microservices, and uses <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/jhipster-registry/">JHipster Registry</a> for service discovery and centralized configuration.</p>

 Create an EKS cluster using Terraform 

<p>Now let us move on to the important part of the tutorial. Creating an EKS cluster in AWS is not as straightforward as in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). You need to also create a lot more resources for everything to work correctly without surprises. You will be using a bunch of Terraform providers to help with this, and you will also use some prebuilt Terraform modules like <a href="https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-vpc">AWS VPC Terraform module</a> and <a href="https://github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-eks-blueprints">Amazon EKS Blueprints for Terraform</a> to reduce the amount of boilerplate you need to write.</p>

<p>These are the AWS resources and VPC architecture you will create:</p>

<p></p>

 Build the Terraform configuration 

<p>First, make sure you use a specific version of the providers as different versions might use different attributes and features. Create a <code>versions.tf</code> file:</p>

   <code>mkdir terraform
cd terraform
touch versions.tf
</code>   

<p>Add the following to the file:</p>

   <code>terraform {
  required_version = "&gt;= 1.0.0"

  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "&gt;= 3.72"
    }
    kubernetes = {
      source  = "hashicorp/kubernetes"
      version = "&gt;= 2.10"
    }
    helm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/helm"
      version = "&gt;= 2.4.1"
    }
    random = {
      source  = "hashicorp/random"
      version = "&gt;= 3.2.0"
    }
    nullres = {
      source  = "hashicorp/null"
      version = "&gt;= 3.1"
    }
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Next, you need to define variables and configure the providers. Create a <code>config.tf</code> file:</p>

   <code>touch config.tf
</code>   

<p>Add the following to the file:</p>

   <code># ##  To save state in s3. Update to suit your needs
# backend "s3" {
#   bucket = "create-an-s3-bucket-and-provide-name-here"
#   region = local.region
#   key    = "eks-cluster-with-new-vpc/terraform.tfstate"
# }

variable "region" {
  default     = "eu-west-1"
  description = "AWS region"
}

resource "random_string" "suffix" {
  length  = 8
  special = false
}

data "aws_availability_zones" "available" {}

locals {
  name            = "okta-jhipster-eks-${random_string.suffix.result}"
  region          = var.region
  cluster_version = "1.22"
  instance_types  = ["t2.large"] # can be multiple, comma separated

  vpc_cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"
  azs      = slice(data.aws_availability_zones.available.names, 0, 3)

  tags = {
    Blueprint  = local.name
    GitHubRepo = "github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-eks-blueprints"
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = local.region
}

# Kubernetes provider
# You should **not** schedule deployments and services in this workspace.
# This keeps workspaces modular (one for provision EKS, another for scheduling
# Kubernetes resources) as per best practices.
provider "kubernetes" {
  host                   = module.eks_blueprints.eks_cluster_endpoint
  cluster_ca_certificate = base64decode(module.eks_blueprints.eks_cluster_certificate_authority_data)

  exec {
    api_version = "client.authentication.k8s.io/v1alpha1"
    command     = "aws"
    # This requires the awscli to be installed locally where Terraform is executed
    args = ["eks", "get-token", "--cluster-name", module.eks_blueprints.eks_cluster_id]
  }
}

provider "helm" {
  kubernetes {
    host                   = module.eks_blueprints.eks_cluster_endpoint
    cluster_ca_certificate = base64decode(module.eks_blueprints.eks_cluster_certificate_authority_data)

    exec {
      api_version = "client.authentication.k8s.io/v1alpha1"
      command     = "aws"
      # This requires the awscli to be installed locally where Terraform is executed
      args = ["eks", "get-token", "--cluster-name", module.eks_blueprints.eks_cluster_id]
    }
  }
}
</code>   

<p>You can uncomment the <code>backend</code> section above to save state in S3 instead of your local filesystem. This is recommended for production setup so that everyone in a team has the same state. This file defines configurable and local variables used across the workspace and configures some of the providers used. The Kubernetes provider is included in this file so the EKS module can complete successfully. Otherwise, it throws an error when creating <code>kubernetes_config_map.aws_auth</code>. The helm provider is used to install Kubernetes add-ons to the cluster.</p>

 Build the VPC 

<p>Next up, you need a VPC, subnets, route tables, and other networking bits. You will use the <code>vpc</code> module from the <a href="https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules"><code>terraform-aws-modules</code></a> repository. This module is a wrapper around the AWS VPC module. It makes it easier to configure VPCs and all the other required networking resources. Create a <code>vpc.tf</code> file:</p>

   <code>touch vpc.tf
</code>   

<p>Add the following to the file:</p>

   <code>#---------------------------------------------------------------
# VPC, Subnets, Internet gateway, Route tables, etc.
#---------------------------------------------------------------
module "vpc" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
  version = "~&gt; 3.0"

  name = local.name
  cidr = local.vpc_cidr

  azs             = local.azs
  public_subnets  = [for k, v in local.azs : cidrsubnet(local.vpc_cidr, 8, k)]
  private_subnets = [for k, v in local.azs : cidrsubnet(local.vpc_cidr, 8, k + 10)]

  enable_nat_gateway   = true
  single_nat_gateway   = true
  enable_dns_hostnames = true

  # Manage so we can name
  manage_default_network_acl    = true
  default_network_acl_tags      = { Name = "${local.name}-default" }
  manage_default_route_table    = true
  default_route_table_tags      = { Name = "${local.name}-default" }
  manage_default_security_group = true
  default_security_group_tags   = { Name = "${local.name}-default" }

  public_subnet_tags = {
    "kubernetes.io/cluster/${local.name}" = "shared"
    "kubernetes.io/role/elb"              = 1
  }

  private_subnet_tags = {
    "kubernetes.io/cluster/${local.name}" = "shared"
    "kubernetes.io/role/internal-elb"     = 1
  }

  tags = local.tags
}
</code>   

<p>This will create:</p>

 
   A new VPC, three private subnets, and three public subnets, 
   Internet gateway and NAT gateway for the public subnets, 
   and AWS routes for the gateways, public/private route tables, and route table associations. 
 

 Build the EKS cluster 

<p>Now that you have the networking part done, you can build configurations for the EKS cluster and its add-ons. You will use the <code>eks_blueprints</code> module from <a href="https://aws-ia.github.io/terraform-aws-eks-blueprints/v4.0.9/"><code>terraform-aws-eks-blueprints</code></a>, which is a wrapper around the <a href="https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules"><code>terraform-aws-modules</code></a> and provides additional modules to configure EKS add-ons.</p>

<p>Create a <code>eks-cluster.tf</code> file:</p>

   <code>touch eks-cluster.tf
</code>   

<p>Add the following to the file:</p>

   <code>#---------------------------------------------------------------
# EKS cluster, worker nodes, security groups, IAM roles, K8s add-ons, etc.
#---------------------------------------------------------------
module "eks_blueprints" {
  source = "github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-eks-blueprints?ref=v4.0.9"

  cluster_name    = local.name
  cluster_version = local.cluster_version

  vpc_id             = module.vpc.vpc_id
  private_subnet_ids = module.vpc.private_subnets

  managed_node_groups = {
    node = {
      node_group_name = "managed-ondemand"
      instance_types  = local.instance_types
      min_size        = 2
      subnet_ids      = module.vpc.private_subnets
    }
  }

  tags = local.tags
}

module "eks_blueprints_kubernetes_addons" {
  source = "github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-eks-blueprints//modules/kubernetes-addons?ref=v4.0.9"

  eks_cluster_id       = module.eks_blueprints.eks_cluster_id
  eks_cluster_endpoint = module.eks_blueprints.eks_cluster_endpoint
  eks_oidc_provider    = module.eks_blueprints.oidc_provider
  eks_cluster_version  = module.eks_blueprints.eks_cluster_version

  # EKS Managed Add-ons
  enable_amazon_eks_vpc_cni    = true
  enable_amazon_eks_coredns    = true
  enable_amazon_eks_kube_proxy = true

  # K8S Add-ons
  enable_aws_load_balancer_controller = true
  enable_metrics_server               = true
  enable_cluster_autoscaler           = true
  enable_aws_cloudwatch_metrics       = false

  tags = local.tags

}

# To update local kubeconfig with new cluster details
resource "null_resource" "kubeconfig" {
  depends_on = [module.eks_blueprints_kubernetes_addons]
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "aws eks --region ${local.region}  update-kubeconfig --name $AWS_CLUSTER_NAME"
    environment = {
      AWS_CLUSTER_NAME = local.name
    }
  }
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>eks_blueprints</code> module definition creates:</p>

 
   EKS Cluster Control plane with one <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managed-node-groups.html">managed node group</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/fargate-profile.html">fargate profile</a>, 
   Cluster and node security groups and rules, IAM roles and policies required, 
   and AWS Key Management Service (KMS) configuration. 
 

<p>The <code>eks_blueprints_kubernetes_addons</code> module definition creates:</p>

 
   Amazon EKS add-ons vpc-cni, CoreDNS, and kube-proxy, 
   AWS Load Balancer Controller that provisions an AWS Network Load Balancer for distributing traffic, 
   and <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server">Metrics Server</a>, and Cluster Autoscaler for scaling your workloads. 
 

<p>The <code>null_resource</code> configuration updates your local kubeconfig with the new cluster details. It’s not a required step for provisioning but just a handy hack.</p>

<p>Finally, you can also define some outputs to be captured. Create a <code>outputs.tf</code> file:</p>

   <code>touch outputs.tf
</code>   

<p>Add the following to the file:</p>

   <code>output "vpc_private_subnet_cidr" {
  description = "VPC private subnet CIDR"
  value       = module.vpc.private_subnets_cidr_blocks
}

output "vpc_public_subnet_cidr" {
  description = "VPC public subnet CIDR"
  value       = module.vpc.public_subnets_cidr_blocks
}

output "vpc_cidr" {
  description = "VPC CIDR"
  value       = module.vpc.vpc_cidr_block
}

output "eks_cluster_id" {
  description = "EKS cluster ID"
  value       = module.eks_blueprints.eks_cluster_id
}

output "eks_managed_nodegroups" {
  description = "EKS managed node groups"
  value       = module.eks_blueprints.managed_node_groups
}

output "eks_managed_nodegroup_ids" {
  description = "EKS managed node group ids"
  value       = module.eks_blueprints.managed_node_groups_id
}

output "eks_managed_nodegroup_arns" {
  description = "EKS managed node group arns"
  value       = module.eks_blueprints.managed_node_group_arn
}

output "eks_managed_nodegroup_role_name" {
  description = "EKS managed node group role name"
  value       = module.eks_blueprints.managed_node_group_iam_role_names
}

output "eks_managed_nodegroup_status" {
  description = "EKS managed node group status"
  value       = module.eks_blueprints.managed_node_groups_status
}

output "configure_kubectl" {
  description = "Configure kubectl: make sure you're logged in with the correct AWS profile and run the following command to update your kubeconfig"
  value       = module.eks_blueprints.configure_kubectl
}
</code>   

 Provision the cluster 

<p>Our Terraform definitions are ready. Now you can provision the cluster. First, initialize Terraform workspace and plan the changes:</p>

   <code># download modules and providers. Initialize state.
terraform init
# see a preview of what will be done
terraform plan
</code>   

<p>Review the plan and make sure everything is correct. Ensure you have configured your AWS CLI and IAM Authenticator to use the correct AWS account. If not, run the following:</p>

   <code># Visit https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/security_credentials for creating access keys
aws configure
</code>   

<p>Now you can apply the changes:</p>

   <code>terraform apply
</code>   

<p>Confirm by typing <code>yes</code> when prompted. This will take a while (15-20 minutes), so sit back and have a coffee or contemplate what led you to this point in life. 😉</p>

<p>Once the EKS cluster is ready, you will see the output variables printed to the console.</p>

<p>You should see the cluster details if you run <code>kdash</code> or <code>kubectl get nodes</code> commands.</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: The EKS cluster defined here will not come under AWS free tier; hence, running this will cost money, so delete the cluster as soon as you finish the tutorial to keep the cost within a few dollars.</p>
</blockquote>

 Set up OIDC authentication using Okta 

<p>You can proceed to deploy the sample application. You could skip this step if you used a sample that does not use Okta or OIDC for authentication.</p>

<p>First, navigate to the store application folder.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create jhipster</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
  Accept the default Redirect URI values provided for you.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI streamlines configuring a JHipster app and does several things for you:</p>

 
   Creates an OIDC app with the correct redirect URIs:
     
       login: <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> 
       logout: <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761</code> 
     
   
   Creates <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups that JHipster expects 
   Adds your current user to the <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups 
   Creates a <code>groups</code> claim in your default authorization server and adds the user’s groups to it 
 

<p>NOTE: The <code>http://localhost:8761*</code> redirect URIs are for the JHipster Registry, which is often used when creating microservices with JHipster. The Okta CLI adds these by default.</p>

<p>You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app. It will look like this (except the placeholder values will be populated):</p>

   <code>export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI="/oauth2/default"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID="{clientId}"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET="{clientSecret}"
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#okta">Create a JHipster App on Okta</a> for more information.</p>



<blockquote>
  <p>Note: Make sure to add the newly created <code>.okta.env</code> file to your <code>.gitignore</code> file so that you don’t accidentally expose your credentials to the public.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Update <code>kubernetes/registry-k8s/application-configmap.yml</code> with the OIDC configuration from the <code>.okta.env</code> file. The Spring Cloud Config server reads from this file and shares the values with the gateway and microservices.</p>

   <code>data:
  application.yml: |-
    ...
    spring:
      security:
        oauth2:
          client:
            provider:
              oidc:
                issuer-uri: https://&lt;your-okta-domain&gt;/oauth2/default
            registration:
              oidc:
                client-id: &lt;client-id&gt;
                client-secret: &lt;client-secret&gt;
</code>   

<p>Next, configure the JHipster Registry to use OIDC for authentication. Modify <code>kubernetes/registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml</code> to enable the <code>oauth2</code> profile, which is preconfigured in the JHipster Registry application.</p>

   <code>- name: SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE
  value: prod,k8s,oauth2
</code>   

<p>The application is now ready.</p>

 Secure secrets 

<p>If you have noticed, you are setting secrets in plain text on the <code>application-configmap.yml</code> file, which is not ideal and is not a best practice for security. For the specific JHipster application, you can use the encrypt functionality provided by the JHipster Registry to encrypt the secrets. See <a>Encrypt Your Secrets with Spring Cloud Config</a> to learn how to do this. But that would also rely on a base64 encoded encryption key added as a Kubernetes Secret, which still can be decoded. The best way to do this would be to use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/">AWS Secrets Manager</a>, an external service like <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault">HashiCorp Vault</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets">Sealed Secrets</a>. To learn more about these methods see <a>Encrypt Your Kubernetes Secrets</a>.</p>

 Deploy the microservice stack 

<p>You are ready to deploy to our shiny new EKS cluster, but first, you need to build and push the Docker images to a container registry. You can use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/">Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)</a> or any other container registry.</p>

 Build the Docker images 

<p>You need to build Docker images for each app. This is specific to the JHipster application used in this tutorial which uses <a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib">Jib</a> to build the images. Make sure you are logged into Docker using <code>docker login</code>. Navigate to each app folder (store, invoice, product) and run the following command:</p>

   <code>./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image=&lt;docker-repo-uri-or-name&gt;/&lt;image-name&gt;
</code>   

<p>Image names should be <code>store</code>, <code>invoice</code>, and <code>product</code>.</p>

 Deploy the applications to EKS 

<p>Start the deployment using the handy script provided by JHipster. You could also manually apply deployments using <code>kubectl apply -f &lt;file&gt;</code> commands.</p>

   <code>cd kubernetes
./kubectl-apply.sh -f
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>You can also run the following command to see the status of the deployments:</p>

   <code>kubectl get pods -n jhipster
</code>   

<p>View the registry using port-forwarding as follows, and you will be able to access the application at <code>http://localhost:8761</code>.</p>

   <code>kubectl port-forward svc/jhipster-registry -n jhipster 8761
</code>   

<p>You can access the gateway application using port-forwarding as follows, and you will be able to access the application at <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>

   <code>kubectl port-forward svc/store -n jhipster 8080
</code>   

<p>Or, you can access the application via the load balancer exposed. Find the external IP of the <code>store</code> service by navigating to the service tab in KDash or by running the following:</p>

   <code>kubectl get svc store -n jhipster
</code>   

<p>Navigate to the Okta Admin Console and go to Applications &gt; Applications from left-hand navigation. Find the application you created earlier with <code>okta apps create jhipster</code> and add the external IP from <code>kubectl get svc</code> command to the Sign-in redirect URIs and Sign-out redirect URIs. Make sure to use the same paths as the current <code>localhost</code> entries.</p>

<p>Now you should be able to visit the external IP of the <code>store</code> service on port 8080 and see the application, and you should be able to log in using your Okta credentials.</p>

 Tear down the cluster with Terraform 

<p>Once you are done with the tutorial, you can delete the cluster and all the resources created using Terraform by running the following commands:</p>

   <code>cd terraform
# The commands below might take a while to finish.
terraform destroy -target="module.eks_blueprints_kubernetes_addons" -auto-approve
# If deleting VPC fails, then manually delete the load balancers and security groups
# for the load balancer associated with the VPC from AWS EC2 console and try again.
terraform destroy -target="module.eks_blueprints" -auto-approve
terraform destroy -target="module.vpc" -auto-approve
# cleanup anything left over.
terraform destroy -auto-approve
</code>

				  Break and rebuild your decentralized identity products and services with Indicio’s new TempNet  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By <a href="mailto:lynn@indicio.tech">Lynn Bendixsen</a></p>
<p>When we talk about decentralized identity solutions, we usually talk about public ledgers for anchoring and verifying credentials. But there are use cases where the best solution is a private network. This type of distributed ledger network requires a certain level of permission to write to or even to read from.</p>
<p>A private network allows companies and organizations with shared or specific interests to provide verifiable information only to their customers or stakeholders. You could use a private network to manage a supply chain, a specific geographic location, or—as with the new Indicio TempNet—do critical internal product testing.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://indicio.tech/private-networks/">Indicio Private Networks</a>, you have a quick and hassle-free way to spin up your own networks; and now with our latest TempNet offering, you have access to a&nbsp;&nbsp; production-ready, lab environment for penetration testing, performance testing fixes, and private demos.</p>
<p>This is perfect for teams who want to test their mission-critical products or services to breaking point before public deployment. The key feature of Indicio’s Private Networks is that we take the responsibility for hosting, maintaining and updating these networks. Test it, break it, record it, demo with it, then when you’re done, you walk away and leave us to clean it up and decommission it.</p>
<p>But… maybe you want to keep your new TempNet network? No problem. We’ll switch it over to one of Indicio’s Private Network plans so you get continued maintenance, upgrades, and the tools you need to keep it running in perpetuity.</p>
<p>With years of experience in decentralized network development and management, our expert staff can build you a customized private network that meets your business or organizational needs—and we can do it in days, not weeks. We’ll show you how to run it, and we’ll provide you with all the engineering support you need.</p>

 The regulatory landscape remains heated, with authorities from many countries calling for regulating virtual&nbsp;assets <p>Welcome to Veriscope’s Weekly Regulatory Recap. This week, too, the regulatory landscape remains heated, with authorities from many countries calling for regulating virtual assets. Without further ado, let’s dive straight into it. We hope you enjoy&nbsp;it.</p><p>Don’t forget to subscribe to our weekly recap post, comment, and&nbsp;share.</p> Travel Rule Compliance to Become Mandatory in the UK From 23rd September 2023 <p>Amid concerns around sanctioned individuals &amp; entities using digital assets to bypass sanctions, the United Kingdom recently introduced “Amendments to the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017 Statutory Instrument 2022.”</p><p>The recent amendment proposal is aimed at strengthening the country’s Anti-Money Laundering/ Counter Financing of Terrorism framework. The UK government believes that although the implementation of the Travel Rule will increase the cost of compliance for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), it will be beneficial for the crypto industry in the long&nbsp;run.</p><p>The government has also agreed to provide a grace period for ease of compliance. Hence, the UK-based VASPs will now have until 22nd September 2023 to prepare for the Travel Rule compliance. If the amendment receives green light from the legislature, complying with the Travel Rule will become mandatory from 23rd September 2023.</p><p><a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/travel-rule-will-be-mandatory-in-the-uk-by-23-september-2023-2bfb3c4d1cde?source=user_profile---------1----------------------------">Click here</a> to read more about the UK government’s recent amendment proposal.</p> South Korean Government Asks Country’s Crypto Industry for Suggestions to Further Strengthen the Digital Asset Regulations <p>The Terra-Luna debacle continues to be a hot topic among the South Korean government and authorities. Recently, a Korean media report mentioned that the ruling party in South Korea has called for suggestions from the crypto industry to prevent Terra-Luna-like instances in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>As per the report, the South Korean government met industry representatives for consultation on Monday. And it was during the consultation, the officials and lawmakers asked industry players to come up with innovative suggestions to help ensure the safety of the country’s crypto industry.</p><p><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/south-korean-government-calls-for-voluntary-regulations-from-crypto-industry/">Click here</a> to read more about&nbsp;it.</p> Kazakhstan to Allow Authorized Virtual Asset Service Providers to Open Local Banking&nbsp;Accounts <p>The government of Kazakhstan is taking multiple initiatives to become a regional hub for the digital assets industry. Recently, the country’s Ministry of Digital Development adopted the framework that will allow Astana International Financial Center-registered VASPs to open accounts and avail of various financial services from local tier-II&nbsp;banks.</p><p>This positive news comes after the country’s central bank, the National Bank of Kazakhstan, said that the talk around legalizing the virtual asset industry is not something they are considering now. That said, the financial regulator is keeping an eye on the nascent&nbsp;sector.</p><p><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kazakhstan-allows-registered-crypto-exchanges-to-open-accounts-at-local-banks/">Click here</a> to read more about&nbsp;it.</p> India’s Central Bank Governor Calls for Global Coordination for Crypto Regulations <p>While speaking at the Financial Express-organized Modern BFSI Summit on June 17, Shaktikanta Das, the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, said that global coordination is necessary for digital asset regulations.</p><p>Das also gave the example of decentralized finance (DeFi) to explain why global regulators should come together and cooperate to regulate virtual assets. He said that DeFi’s “No-intermediary Approach” presents a unique challenge to regulators, which can only be tackled through a “globally-coordinated regulatory and inter-regulatory coordination.”</p><p><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/blockchain-technology-transcends-boundaries-need-global-regulations-rbi-governor/">Click here</a> to read more about the RBI governor’s recent statement on the need for global cooperation for digital asset regulation.</p><p>____________</p><p>With the global crypto market tumbling, regulators are demanding international coordination for regulating the industry. Thus, sooner or later, regulators will come together and work on a global regulatory framework for digital assets. In the meantime, the virtual asset service providers should begin complying with local and international digital assets regulations.</p><p>Speaking of international digital asset regulations, VASPs must first comply with the FATF’s Travel Rule. So, from where should VASPs start? Well, first, they should zero in on a Travel Rule Service Provider (TRSP), and no solution’s better than Veriscope.

			<p>Product Focus</p>
 The Sound of the ERC3643 Community 
<p>When Tokeny’s team designed the ERC3643, one of our key objectives was to develop a versatile open source standard that can be implemented in a variety of use cases, no matter the industry. At its core, it brings control and direct ownership at the token level while leveraging public blockchains. Since then, many applications – mostly in finance (securities, stablecoins, reward programs, etc.) – were built with this set of smart contracts.</p>

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in June 2022.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>It is also interesting to see that a community of developers is now using this framework to improve or create different implementations of the standard. On that note, we recently had the opportunity to mentor the team at Nusic, a DeFi startup creating groundbreaking work in the music industry. In brief, <a href="https://nusic.fm/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9rStajvtW6BK_tHrpTHbM0ONPrasZzhTFfpR23Mh7aqGgtky5fUKwdn87DmjKIfCJ1DslM#/">Nusic</a>&nbsp;provides a decentralized infrastructure for music creators, giving them the opportunity to unlock new streams of revenue and ultimately increase monetization through NFT bonds.</p>
 Monetization Made Compliant with ERC3643-based Permissioned NFTs 
<p>In 2021, Nusic won the Grand Prize at the&nbsp;<a href="https://chain.link/hackathon/hackathon-2021-fall?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9rStajvtW6BK_tHrpTHbM0ONPrasZzhTFfpR23Mh7aqGgtky5fUKwdn87DmjKIfCJ1DslM">Chainlink Fall Hackathon</a>, yet even though the project received critical acclaim from the DeFi ecosystem, they also received much blowback from potential investors regarding their proposed NFT bonds. It turns out that, after taking the Howey Test (which classifies whether or not transactions are considered investment contracts),&nbsp;their NFTs actually qualify as financial instruments, rather than utility tokens.</p>
<p>As their digital assets were now deemed securities, Nusic decided to look into permissioned tokens and the possibility of creating permissioned NFTs as their product. They eventually stumbled upon the ERC3643 standard and reached out to us on how they could make this happen. After some passionate discussions with the Nusic team about their intention to make a non-fungible version of the ERC3643, we decided to assist them in adopting, modifying, and implementing this standard for their music NFTs to meet their needs.</p>
<p>For this to work, we had to&nbsp;transpose the onchain permissioning layer of ERC3643 to NFTs&nbsp;which, by default, ensures compliant transfers and eligibility of each single token owner, thanks to the use of digital identities (<a href="https://www.onchainid.com/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9rStajvtW6BK_tHrpTHbM0ONPrasZzhTFfpR23Mh7aqGgtky5fUKwdn87DmjKIfCJ1DslM">ONCHAINID.com</a>). It was decided to name this new version of the standard&nbsp;ERC3643N&nbsp;(“N” for non-fungible).&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/nusic-fm/nusic-permissioned-token?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9rStajvtW6BK_tHrpTHbM0ONPrasZzhTFfpR23Mh7aqGgtky5fUKwdn87DmjKIfCJ1DslM">It is now published and available for the community</a>.</p>
<p>Musicians can now directly monetize their work through the Nusic application in an innovative, fully decentralized, and compliant way.</p>
<p>Their work on the ERC3643N made Nusic&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kLXEqQ6tL0&amp;utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9rStajvtW6BK_tHrpTHbM0ONPrasZzhTFfpR23Mh7aqGgtky5fUKwdn87DmjKIfCJ1DslM">winners</a>&nbsp;of another Chainlink Hackathon, taking home two prizes (in the NFTs &amp; Gaming, and Filecoin categories) from this year’s Spring Edition.</p>
 ERC3643 Sees Widespread Adoption as Web3 Users Search for Additional Safety and Security 
<p>We are very happy with the work accomplished with Nusic and extremely proud that the ERC3643 is spearheading itself as an easily accessible market solution across different industries using blockchain. As word continues to spread, it is becoming apparent that market standard permissioned tokens will be used in broader scenarios more often than before. We are looking forward to seeing more innovative use cases using this solution.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we would like to congratulate Nusic again on their achievements. The success from our work together is music to our ears!</p>

 Worked examples for OCEAN rewards and APYs for DF round&nbsp;1 <p>This post gives worked examples to help stakers (liquidity providers) understand potential earnings via the <a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean</a> Data Farming (DF) program, on DF’s round 1 (DF1) rewards formula and related settings.</p><p>For full context, please ensure that you’ve read <a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-is-launching-f633532d831c">Ocean Data Farming is Launching</a> first.</p><p>This piece will first review the Reward Function formula. Then, it will cover each of the following scenarios as worked examples.</p>  One LP, smaller stake, hits the APY cap of&nbsp;125%  One LP, larger stake, hits the weekly OCEAN_budget cap  Two LPs, same data consume volume (DCV), same&nbsp;returns  Two LPs, different data consume volume, different returns  <p>This post is not intended to cover all possible scenarios. Rather, it gives a few simple scenarios and shows a path by which the reader may do their own reasoning and logic in other scenarios.</p><p>Based on learnings, we can expect evolution of the DF Rewards Formula in future DF rounds DF2, DF3,&nbsp;etc.</p> Reward Function&nbsp;Formula <p>Here’s the Reward Function formula for DF1. The post <a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-is-launching-f633532d831c">Ocean Data Farming is Launching</a> explains its details more, as well as the specific meaning of each&nbsp;term.</p><p>RFᵢⱼ = stakeᵢⱼ * DCVⱼ = (stake of LP i on pool j) * (DCV on pool&nbsp;j)</p><p>RFₜₒₜₐₗ = sum across all&nbsp;RFᵢⱼ</p><p>Pro-rata RF for LP i and pool j: RFᵢⱼ_ₙₒᵣₘ = RFᵢⱼ /&nbsp;RFₜₒₜₐₗ</p><p>Subject to APY &lt;= 125% per LP per pool. An annual percent yield (APY) of 125% means a weekly percent yield (WPY) of 1.57171%.</p> Scenario 1 <p>Setup:</p>  1 pool  1 LP (staker), of 100K&nbsp;OCEAN  1 consume. Price on consume was 1.0 OCEAN / datatoken  10K OCEAN rewarded (= weekly budget for DF alpha&nbsp;phase)  <p>Q: How much does the LP earn in one week? What’s the&nbsp;APY?</p><p>First, calculate the pro-rata RF value for the&nbsp;LP:</p>  LP 0’s stake in pool 0 (i=0, j=0): stake₀,₀ = 100K&nbsp;OCEAN  Data consume volume for pool 0 (j=0): DCV₀ = 1 consume * (1 OCEAN / datatoken) = 1&nbsp;OCEAN  Reward function value for LP 0 on pool 0 (i=0, j=0): RF₀,₀ = stake₀,₀ * DCV₀ = 100K * 1 =&nbsp;100K  RFₜₒₜₐₗ = sum across all LPs and pools = RF₀,₀ =&nbsp;100K  RF₀,₀_ₙₒᵣₘ = RF₀,₀ / RFₜₒₜₐₗ = 100K / 100K = 1.0. The value of 1.0 means that this LP gets all the&nbsp;reward.  <p>Now, calculate the rewards going to the&nbsp;LP:</p>  OCEAN_budget = 10K&nbsp;OCEAN  total_OCEAN_rewards = min(OCEAN_budget, total_staked * WPY) = min(10K, 100K * 0.015717) = min(10K, 1571.7)= 1571.7&nbsp;OCEAN  LP 0’s rewards (i=0): rewards₀ = RF₀,₀_ₙₒᵣₘ * total_OCEAN_rewards = 1.0 * 1571.7 = 1571.7 OCEAN. That is, LP 0 gets all the rewards because they’re the only&nbsp;LP.  <p>Finally, calculate APY:</p>  LP 0’s weekly percent yield: WPY₀ = rewards₀ / stake₀,₀ = 1571.7 / 100K = 0.015717 =&nbsp;1.5717%  LP’s 0’s annual percent yield: APY₀ = (1 + WPY₀)⁵² — 1.0 = (1 + 0.015717)⁵² — 1.0 = 1.25 = 125%. This is the predicted yield for the year, if every week had the given WPY and it compounded.  We can confirm APY this by observing that total_OCEAN_rewards calculated value was bounded by the APY term (total_staked * WPY), not the budget term (OCEAN_budget).  <p>Discussion: APY was maxed out to 125% because stake was sufficiently low.</p><p>Summary: LP’s rewards were 1571.7 OCEAN, and APY was&nbsp;125%</p> Scenario 2 <p>Setup:</p><p>The setup is like scenario 1 but stake = 1M OCEAN (not 1000 OCEAN). That&nbsp;is:</p>  1 pool  1 LP (staker), of 1M&nbsp;OCEAN  1 consume. Price on consume was 1.0 OCEAN / datatoken  10K OCEAN&nbsp;rewarded  <p>Below, bold = different than scenario&nbsp;1.</p><p>Q: How much does the staker earn in one week? What’s&nbsp;APY?</p><p>First, calculate the pro-rata RF value for the&nbsp;LP:</p>  stake₀,₀ = 1M&nbsp;OCEAN  DCV₀ = 1&nbsp;OCEAN  RF₀,₀ = stake₀,₀ * DCV₀ = 1M * 1 =&nbsp;1M  RFₜₒₜₐₗ = RF₀,₀ =&nbsp;1M  RF₀,₀_ₙₒᵣₘ = RF₀,₀ / RFₜₒₜₐₗ = 1M/1M =&nbsp;1.0  <p>Now, calculate the rewards going to the&nbsp;LP:</p>  OCEAN_budget = 10K&nbsp;OCEAN  total_OCEAN_rewards = min(OCEAN_budget, total_staked * WPY) = min(10K, 1M * 0.0157171) = min(10K, 15717.1) = 10K&nbsp;OCEAN  LP 0’s rewards: rewards₀ = RF₀,₀_ₙₒᵣₘ * total_OCEAN_rewards = 1.0 * 10K = 10K&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Finally, calculate APY:</p>  WPY₀ = rewards₀ / stake₀,₀ =10K / 1M = 0.01 =&nbsp;1.0%  APY₀ = (1 + WPY₀)⁵² — 1.0 = (1 + 0.01)⁵² — 1.0 = 0.678 =&nbsp;67.8%.  <p>Discussion:</p>  In scenario 1, reward was bounded by the APY, so we saw (a) max APY and (b) rewards given was less than the weekly&nbsp;budget.  Here, in scenario 2, reward was bounded by the weekly budget, so we saw (a) APY less than max (b) rewards hitting their cap of the weekly&nbsp;budget.  <p>Summary: LP’s rewards were 10K OCEAN, and APY was&nbsp;67.8%</p> Scenario 3 <p>Setup:</p><p>This is a bit like scenario 2 but with two pools, and two LPs, each with equal stake and consume volume. That&nbsp;is:</p>  LP 0 stakes 1M OCEAN into pool 0. Pool 0 has 1 consume, price 1.0&nbsp;OCEAN  LP 1 stakes 1M OCEAN into pool 1. Pool 1 has 1 consume, price 1.0&nbsp;OCEAN  10K OCEAN&nbsp;rewarded  <p>Below, bold = different than scenario&nbsp;2.</p><p>Q: How much does the staker earn in one week? What’s&nbsp;APY?</p><p>First, calculate the pro-rata RF value for the&nbsp;LP:</p>  stake₀,₀ = 1M&nbsp;OCEAN  stake₁,₁ = 1M&nbsp;OCEAN  DCV₀ = 1&nbsp;OCEAN  DCV₁ = 1&nbsp;OCEAN  RF₀,₀ = stake₀,₀ * DCV₀ = 1M * 1 =&nbsp;1M  RF₁,₁ = stake₁,₁ * DCV₁ = 1M * 1 =&nbsp;1M  RFₜₒₜₐₗ = RF₀,₀ + RF₁,₁ = 1M + 1M = 2M&nbsp;OCEAN  RF₀,₀_ₙₒᵣₘ = RF₀,₀ / RFₜₒₜₐₗ = 1M/2M =&nbsp;0.5  RF₁,₁_ₙₒᵣₘ = RFi₁,₁ / RFₜₒₜₐₗ = 1M/2M =&nbsp;0.5  <p>Now, calculate the rewards going to the&nbsp;LP:</p>  OCEAN_budget = 10K&nbsp;OCEAN  total_OCEAN_rewards = min(OCEAN_budget, total_staked * WPY) = min(10K, 2M * 0.0157171) = min(10K, 31434.2) = 10K&nbsp;OCEAN  LP 0’s rewards: rewards₀ = RF₀,₀_ₙₒᵣₘ * total_OCEAN_rewards = 0.5 * 10K = 5K&nbsp;OCEAN  LP 1’s rewards: rewards₁ = RF₁,₁_ₙₒᵣₘ * total_OCEAN_rewards = 0.5 * 10K = 5K&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Finally, calculate APY:</p>  WPY₀ = rewards₀ / stake₀,₀ = 5K / 1M = 0.005 =&nbsp;0.5%  WPY₁ = rewards₁ / stake₁,₁ = 5K / 1M = 0.005 =&nbsp;0.5%  APY₀ = APY₁ = (1 + WPY)⁵² — 1.0 = (1 + 0.005)⁵² — 1.0 = 0.296 =&nbsp;29.6%  <p>Discussion: this is a simple scenario of two identical LPs getting identical rewards</p><p>Summary: each LP had 5K OCEAN rewards, and APY of&nbsp;29.6%</p> Scenario 4 <p>Setup:</p><p>This is like scenario 3, but pool 1 has 9x more consumes. That&nbsp;is:</p>  LP 0 stakes 1M OCEAN into pool 0. Pool 0 has 1 consume, price 1.0&nbsp;OCEAN  LP 1 stakes 1M OCEAN into pool 1. Pool 1 has 9 consumes, price 1.0&nbsp;OCEAN  10K OCEAN&nbsp;rewarded  <p>Q: How much does the staker earn in one week? What’s&nbsp;APY?</p><p>First, calculate the pro-rata RF value for the&nbsp;LP:</p>  stake₀,₀ = 1M&nbsp;OCEAN  stake₁,₁ = 1M&nbsp;OCEAN  DCV₀ = 1 consume * (1 OCEAN / datatoken) = 1&nbsp;OCEAN  DCV₁ = 9 consumes * (1 OCEAN / datatoken) = 9&nbsp;OCEAN  RF₀,₀ = stake₀,₀ * DCV₀ = 1M * 1 =&nbsp;1M  RF₁,₁ = stake₁,₁ * DCV₁ = 1M * 9 =&nbsp;9M  RFₜₒₜₐₗ = RF₀,₀ + RF₁,₁ = 1M + 9M = 10M&nbsp;OCEAN  RF₀,₀_ₙₒᵣₘ = RF₀,₀ / RFₜₒₜₐₗ = 1M/10M =&nbsp;0.1  RF₁,₁_ₙₒᵣₘ = RFi₁,₁ / RFₜₒₜₐₗ = 9M/10M =&nbsp;0.9  <p>Now, calculate the rewards going to the&nbsp;LP:</p>  OCEAN_budget = 10K&nbsp;OCEAN  total_OCEAN_rewards = min(OCEAN_budget, total_staked * WPY) = min(10K, 10M * 0.0157171) = min(10K, 157171) = 10K&nbsp;OCEAN  LP 0’s rewards: rewards₀ = RF₀,₀_ₙₒᵣₘ * total_OCEAN_rewards = 0.1 *10K = 1K&nbsp;OCEAN  LP 1’s rewards: rewards₁ = RF₁,₁_ₙₒᵣₘ * total_OCEAN_rewards = 0.9 *10K = 9K&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Finally, calculate APY:</p>  WPY₀ = rewards₀ / stake₀,₀ = 1K / 1M = 0.001 =&nbsp;0.1%  WPY₁ = rewards₁ / stake₁,₁ = 9K / 1M = 0.009 =&nbsp;0.9%  APY₀ = (1 + WPY₀)⁵² — 1.0 = (1 + 0.001)⁵² — 1.0 = 0.296 = 0.0533 =&nbsp;5.33%  APY₁ = (1 + WPY₁)⁵² — 1.0 = (1 + 0.009)⁵² — 1.0 = 0.5934 =&nbsp;59.34%  <p>Discussion: With everything identical except 9x DCV, LP 1 gets 9x the rewards of LP 0. As a staker, it really matters where you&nbsp;stake!</p><p>Summary: LP 0 had 1K OCEAN rewards and APY of 5.33%. LP 1 had 9K OCEAN rewards and APY of&nbsp;59.34%.</p> Conclusion <p>This post described worked examples to help stakers understand DF earnings in&nbsp;DF1.</p><p>The first two scenarios had just one LP (on one pool). Scenario 1 showed how APY could be the bounding factor, and scenario 2 showed how OCEAN_budget could&nbsp;be.</p><p>The next two scenarios had two LPs, each on its own pool, with identical stake. Scenario 3 had identical DCV, leading to identical reward for each LP. In scenario 4, one pool had 9x the DCV which led to 9x the&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Based on learnings, we can expect evolution of the DF Rewards Formula and related settings in future DF rounds DF2, DF3,&nbsp;etc.</p>Happy farming!

<p>Today, we are announcing the deprecation of support for Bloom Vault in the latest version of our Affinidi&nbsp;SDK.</p><p>This blog outlines the updates in the new versions of Affinidi stack and the required steps developers should take to avoid any disruptions in our SDK’s functionality.</p><p>What’s new in Affinidi SDK v6.0.4 and&nbsp;above?</p><p>At a glance, here’s what changes from Affinidi SDK v6.0.4 and&nbsp;above.</p>  Migrating from Bloom Vault to Affinidi Vault for improved performance  Server-side search by credential Id  Server-side search by credential types  <p>Read on to know why we are migrating to Affinidi Vault, what’s in it for you, and what steps you must&nbsp;take.</p><p>What are we changing?</p><p>The earlier versions of Affinidi SDK (below v6) use Bloom Vault as the end-to-end provider-agnostic storage. Undoubtedly, this has helped our customers to securely store verifiable credentials when using Affinidi’s open-source SDK. But starting from Affinidi SDK v6.0.4, we are migrating from Bloom Vault to our in-house built Affinidi&nbsp;Vault.</p><p>Why are we changing&nbsp;it?</p><p>It is our goal at Affinidi to provide an easy-to-use, secure, reliable, and high-performing set of functionalities within our Affinidi SDK. As a part of our continuous performance improvement activities, the engineering team has identified a need to replace the Bloom Vault with something that provides better performance and more advanced functionality. Thus, we have implemented Affinidi Vault as a replacement for Bloom within our&nbsp;SDK.</p><p>If you’re wondering why, here’s a comparison chart of the performance of Bloom vault vs Affinidi&nbsp;vault.</p><p>Comparison of vault performance</p><p>As you can see, there is a huge time-saving by switching to the Affinidi Vault, and this is why we made the&nbsp;change.</p><p>Why should you&nbsp;upgrade?</p><p>If you are using the earlier Affinidi SDK versions (lower than v6), your application won’t support the Affinidi Vault, and hence we can’t migrate you out of the Bloom&nbsp;Vault.</p><p>From Affinidi SDK v6.0.4 onwards, we have introduced an automatic migration trigger to the Affinidi Vault and that is why we ask you to upgrade to that version or above. Otherwise, your credentials will never be migrated and will eventually be wiped from the Bloom&nbsp;vault.</p><p>Please note that this migration will NOT impact the SDK performance negatively. On the contrary, if you have more than 100 credentials in Bloom Vault, you’re sure to see a big jump in performance after the migration.</p><p>Action points for&nbsp;you</p>  Update your services to use Affinidi SDK v6.0.4 or&nbsp;above.  Please pay attention to the changelog while upgrading the SDK version as some methods may be changed or deprecated.  <p>How to upgrade to the latest version of Affinidi&nbsp;SDK?</p><p>Go to <a href="https://github.com/affinityproject/affinidi-core-sdk">GitHub</a> and upgrade to version v6.0.4 or&nbsp;above.</p><p>When you send your first API request to get all the credentials using the new SDK, our system will start the asynchronous migration of your data from Bloom to the Affinidi Vault. No more action is required from&nbsp;you.</p><p>Once the migration is complete, your services will automatically start using only Affinidi Vault for both the write and read operations.</p><p>What is the timeline for this&nbsp;upgrade?</p><p>Starting from 8th July 2022, we will block writes to the Bloom Vault. All users must update their services to use the Affinidi SDK v6.0.4 or above by then. From 25th July 2022, we will block both reads and writes to Bloom Vault and depreciate support for the&nbsp;same.</p><p>For further questions/doubts, reach out to us at <a href="mailto:developers@affinidi.com">developers@affinidi.com,</a> or drop us a note on&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/ffV5ctBMXr">Discord</a>.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/affinityproject/affinidi-core-sdk">Visit GitHub</a> to download Affinidi SDK&nbsp;v6.0.4.</p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/upgrade-to-the-latest-affinidi-sdk-version-for-improved-performance-81e7d0cc7334">Upgrade to the Latest Affinidi SDK Version for Improved Performance</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Warum das so ist, führte Dominik Deimel in seinem Vortrag auf dem eIDAS Summit 2022 des bitkom aus.</p><p>Mobile Lösungen wie Identity Wallets werden von der EU gefordert und ersetzen veraltete Kartentechnologie in vielen Lebensbereichen. Denn Karten, Schlüssel und herkömmliche Token sind teuer im Betrieb, leicht manipulierbar und wenig komfortabel im Handling. Hier punktet das mobile Endgerät mit durchgehend digitalen Möglichkeiten, und zwar sowohl für den On- als auch den Offline-Use. Voraussetzungen sind entsprechende umfassende mobile Sicherheitstechnologie und ein flexibel gestaltbarer, vertrauenswürdiger Attribute-Austausch, dementsprechend wie es der jeweilige Service im Use Case benötigt. Hier ist bei den rein formalen Identitäts-Attributen wie Name oder Alter noch lange nicht Schluss.</p><p>Im Vortrag führt Dominik Deimel aus, worauf es im Zusammenspiel der Akteure und in der technischen Architektur von Wallets ankommt und wo Vorteile und Chancen liegen.</p><p></p><p>#vortrag #digitalIdentity #eIDAS #comuny #souvereignIdentity #wallet #ecosystem #bitkom #eIDAS22 #digitaleGeschäftsmodelle<br></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Concern regarding downtime is one of the major reasons that companies may be hesitant about implementing changes to their applications and services, including minor updates. Should you keep a current/old version so that users won’t lose access, or should you launch the new version but risk pushing users away to the competition while you make updates?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is where zero downtime deployment comes in. Companies can launch new versions of their applications and services without needing to have any downtime during the process.</p>

 Monthly Roundup for April&nbsp;2022 <p>Happy #HoloMonday everyone! Thanks for taking the time to click in to the latest Monthly Roundup. We are already a quarter through the year, and both the Holo and Holochain teams are busy working hard. Check out exactly what we’ve been doing in the roundup&nbsp;below.</p> 3 Milestones in 3 Months: Holo&nbsp;Update <p>On the Holo build out we’re really pleased with the fact that we <a href="https://press.holo.host/212551-holochain-roadmap-holo-milestones">passed 3 milestones in (less than) three months</a> over the holidays. Here is a short description of those milestones as they appear on our <a href="https://holo.host/roadmap/">roadmap</a>, and why they matter. Below is a brief summary of each of the Milestones:</p>  Elemental Chat in Public&nbsp;Alpha  HoloFuel Transactions Pre-release UX/UI  HoloPort Registration Usability   Check out the *New* Holochain Roadmap <p>As Holo announced in their <a href="https://press.holo.host/212551-holochain-roadmap-holo-milestones">recent update</a>, Holochain now has a <a href="https://www.holochain.org/roadmap/">public roadmap</a>. I’m thoroughly excited about this, and I sincerely hope it helps you, dear hApp developers, get an idea of where we’re heading — and plan your development trajectory accordingly.</p><p>There are a lot of milestones planned, including ephemeral storage (non-permanent DHT data) and pub/sub (subscribe to DHT change events), but I want to call out one in particular that’s simultaneously the least and most interesting: Stable Validation.</p> Approaching Longitudinal hApp&nbsp;Testing <p>We’re getting close to the <a href="https://press.holo.host/213339-today-s-update-april-15th">release of our next Holo milestone,</a> Longitudinal hApp Testing. Elemental Chat will be tested on the Holo infrastructure with no pre-determined limit for how long we keep it available. This is a longevity test primarily for use by our biz dev team and other partners building hApps and to gather data about use over time. Following the initial release, additional hApps will be added to the infrastructure. This release sets us up for future publishing milestones where we’ll work with early adopter app developers who want to publish their hApps in a live test environment. We’ve recently updated Elemental Chat to a recent version of Holochain and we’re doing regression testing for minor&nbsp;changes.</p> Regular Holo Dev Updates on&nbsp;Twitter <p>If you are curious about the — hot from the press dev updates — those can be found on Holo&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/H_O_L_O_">Twitter.</a></p> Dev Pulse&nbsp;117 <p>This is a very short Dev Pulse; but Paul covers the changes in the Holochain release earlier in April. Good news, links have gotten some more changes (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1298">#1298</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1308">#1308</a>), bringing us closer to the Holochain Resource Locators <a href="https://www.holochain.org/roadmap/">milestone</a>. Now you can use headers as your link base or target, without having to re-type them to entry hashes (which worked but felt kinda hacky to me). But not only that — you can now use external hashes as&nbsp;well!</p><p>Read the whole Dev Pulse&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.holochain.org/external-links/">here</a>.</p> Agent Key Stability in Holochain <p>Watch a clip from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtWViZHLxHE&amp;feature=youtu.be">latest AMA</a> where Erik Harris-Braun talks about what agent key stability looks like on Holochain.</p> Ecosystem Session with&nbsp;IOEN <p>Watch the Eco Sessions replay with Mike Gamble, Simon Wilson, and Phil Beadle on the <a href="https://twitter.com/IOEN_tech">@IOEN_tech</a>.

Read all about it&nbsp;below:</p> Holo Launches the Holochain Developer Education Initiative <p>Holo Limited is very pleased to announce the launch of the Holochain Developer Education Initiative. In the coming two years we are committing upwards of $2M to build and foster an ecosystem of developers. This work builds on past efforts–especially those of the Holochain open dev community–and will create efficient, effective, and scalable curriculum to educate experienced developers on how to code and build hApps and products on Holochain.</p><p>Read more here: <a href="https://press.holo.host/214789-announcing-the-holochain-developer-education-initiative">https://press.holo.host/214789-announcing-the-holochain-developer-education-initiative</a></p> Chess to be added to Longitudinal hApps test&nbsp;soon <p>Elemental Chat continues to work well with sharding enabled after two weeks of testing with approximately 1,000 people trying it out.

<p>Ocean Explorers is dropping 100K NFTs, deploying Civic Pass to protect the drops against bot spamming, as a way to illustrate bot protection at scale for large NFT mints.</p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO (June 20, 2022) — Civic, a leader in digital identity solutions for Web3, will be the official partner in protection for the upcoming <a href="https://twitter.com/ExplorersNFT">Ocean Explorers</a> NFT drop. Ocean Explorers co-founders Vinny Lingham, Michael Tant, Jason Plepel and Concept Arthouse intend for the free, phased drop of 100K NFTs, featuring 10 factions of 10K NFTs each, to bring a diverse and broad array of new users into the NFT market. Broad access to the drop is made far easier due to Solana’s low fees and fast throughout.</p>



<p>By leveraging a new suite of tools based on its flagship Civic Pass product, Civic is addressing a botting issue that has plagued NFT drops and made for a poor user experience for human participants. Civic is also introducing a tool, called uniqueness verification, that determines user uniqueness. Each user will be able to use one wallet, making the drop a more fair experience across the board. With this new tool, Civic aims to prevent bots from accumulating the bulk of the NFT inventory, and selling it on secondary markets for profit.</p>



<p>Civic also provides tools that can help avoid price manipulation and denial of inventory. By requiring NFT buyers to verify that they are not bots, Civic Pass has already prevented more than 1 million bots from participating across more than 275 mints.</p>



<p>Early glimpses of Ocean Explorers reveal a beautiful array of ocean characters, including pirates, deep sea soldiers and surfers. A full roadmap, or treasure map, will be revealed in the coming months ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vinny Lingham, co-founder of Oceans Explorers, shared, “Using free NFTs, a community of 100k real people, who are not priced out of participation from the start, could become very powerful. In order to build a big, diverse community, we must prevent bots from exploiting the drop. This is now possible with a new uniqueness verification from Civic Pass.”</p>



<p>Chris Hart, CEO of Civic, said, “As Ocean Explorers’ official bot protection partner, we look forward to participating in this first-of-its-kind free drop of 100K NFTs. By limiting the drop to support a diverse set of human buyers, this project will be a best-in-class example of how to leverage NFTs as a massive community-building tool.”</p>



<p>“Ocean Explorers is a collection based on some deep, wholly original lore with intricate worldbuilding. It’s also devised to be unique from a technical perspective so we can set limits on how many NFTs each person can purchase during the mint,” explained Jason Plepel, of the Ocean Explorers’ team. “We’re excited to launch this ambitious NFT community and look forward to seeing people engage and become long-term contributing members.”<br>Get ready for the mint by <a href="http://civic.me/#oe-get-civic-pass">securing your uniqueness verification now</a> for a small fee. And, join the Ocean Explorers Discord community for the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ysFJHDXVVc">latest minting information</a>.</p>

<p>This new and important certification for the world of trust services joins others that InfoCert has earned over the years, confirming it as a European Champion of Digital Trust.</p>



<p>AgID recently certified InfoCert for its Qualified validation service for qualified electronic signature and for its Qualified validation service for qualified electronic seal.</p>



<p>This new certification was designed to address a market need to ensure that large organisations (primarily central governments, public administrations and companies operating in the banking ecosystem) are able to verify with absolute certainty the validity and integrity of a signature affixed to a contract or document, whether by a natural person (QESig) or a legal entity (QESeal).</p>



 InfoCert increasingly a European Champion of Digital Trust 



<p>With this new certification, companies and public administrations in Europe can easily integrate this new, entirely API-based solution, and again rely on the largest QTSP in Europe.</p>



<p>InfoCert’s services portfolio has always included the signature validation service, until now offering it in GoSign Desktop, the most widely used signature application in Italy. This solution allowed anyone to upload a signed document to GoSign and verify its validity, whether in Italy or in any European country in which the certificate was issued.</p>



<p>Today this AgID-certified service is <a href="https://developers.infocert.digital/signature-validation/">also available via API</a> and InfoCert’s clients can automatically integrate the signature and seal validation step into their business processes.&nbsp; Verification is done in real time and validates signed files in any format, including PDF, P7M, XML and JSON.</p>



<p>This additional certification at the European level recognises our intensive group work and means that we can once more position ourselves as market leader in both Italy and Europe for Trusted Services compliant with the eIDAS regulation.</p>

   React was designed to make it painless to create interactive UIs. Its state management is efficient and only updates components when your data changes. Component logic is written in JavaScript, meaning you can keep state out of the DOM and create encapsulated components.

  <p>React was designed to make it painless to create interactive UIs. Its state management is efficient and only updates components when your data changes. Component logic is written in JavaScript, meaning you can keep state out of the DOM and create encapsulated components.</p>

<p>Developers like CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) apps because they show a lot of the base functionality you need when creating an app. Once you have the basics of CRUD completed in an app, most of the client-server plumbing is finished, and you can move on to implementing the necessary business logic.</p>

<p>Today, I’ll show you how to create a basic CRUD app with Spring Boot in React. In this tutorial, I’ll use the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow and package the React app in the Spring Boot app for production. At the same time, I’ll show you how to keep React’s productive workflow for developing locally.</p>

<p>You will need <a href="http://sdkman.io">Java 11</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node 16</a> installed to complete this tutorial.</p>

 Create an API app with Spring Boot 

<p>I’m a frequent speaker at conferences and user groups around the world. My favorite user groups to speak at are Java User Groups (JUGs). I’ve been a Java developer for almost 20 years and love the Java community. One of my good friends, James Ward, said doing a JUG Tour was one of his favorite developer advocate activities back in the day. I recently took his advice and traded overseas conferences for JUG meetups in the US.</p>

<p>Why am I telling you this? Because I thought it’d be fun to create a “JUG Tours” app today that allows you to create/edit/delete JUGs and view upcoming events.</p>

<p>To begin, navigate to <a href="https://start.spring.io">start.spring.io</a> and make the following selections:</p>

 
   Group: <code>com.okta.developer</code> 
   Artifact: <code>jugtours</code> 
   Dependencies: <code>JPA</code>, <code>H2</code>, <code>Web</code>, <code>Lombok</code> 
 

<p></p>

<p>Click Generate Project, expand <code>jugtours.zip</code> after downloading, and open the project in your favorite IDE.</p>

<p>TIP: If you’re using IntelliJ IDEA or Spring Tool Suite, you can also use Spring Initializr when creating a new project.</p>

 Add a JPA domain model 

<p>The first thing you’ll need to do is to create a domain model that’ll hold your data. At a high level, there’s a <code>Group</code> that represents the JUG, an <code>Event</code> that has a many-to-one relationship with <code>Group</code>, and a <code>User</code> that has a one-to-many relationship with <code>Group</code>.</p>

<p>Create a <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/jugtours/model</code> directory and a <code>Group.java</code> class in it.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.jugtours.model;

import lombok.Data;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;
import lombok.NonNull;
import lombok.RequiredArgsConstructor;

import javax.persistence.*;
import java.util.Set;

@Data
@NoArgsConstructor
@RequiredArgsConstructor
@Entity
@Table(name = "user_group")
public class Group {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;
    @NonNull
    private String name;
    private String address;
    private String city;
    private String stateOrProvince;
    private String country;
    private String postalCode;
    @ManyToOne(cascade=CascadeType.PERSIST)
    private User user;

    @OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.EAGER, cascade=CascadeType.ALL)
    private Set&lt;Event&gt; events;
}
</code>   

<p>Create an <code>Event.java</code> class in the same package.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.jugtours.model;

import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Builder;
import lombok.Data;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;

import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.Id;
import javax.persistence.ManyToMany;
import java.time.Instant;
import java.util.Set;

@Data
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
@Builder
@Entity
public class Event {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;
    private Instant date;
    private String title;
    private String description;
    @ManyToMany
    private Set&lt;User&gt; attendees;
}
</code>   

<p>And a <code>User.java</code> class.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.jugtours.model;

import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Data;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;

import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.Id;

@Data
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
@Entity
public class User {

    @Id
    private String id;
    private String name;
    private String email;
}
</code>   

<p>Create a <code>GroupRepository.java</code> to manage the group entity.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.jugtours.model;

import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;

import java.util.List;

public interface GroupRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;Group, Long&gt; {
    Group findByName(String name);
}
</code>   

<p>To load some default data, create an <code>Initializer.java</code> class in the <code>com.okta.developer.jugtours</code> package.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.jugtours;

import com.okta.developer.jugtours.model.Event;
import com.okta.developer.jugtours.model.Group;
import com.okta.developer.jugtours.model.GroupRepository;
import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

import java.time.Instant;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.stream.Stream;

@Component
class Initializer implements CommandLineRunner {

    private final GroupRepository repository;

    public Initializer(GroupRepository repository) {
        this.repository = repository;
    }

    @Override
    public void run(String... strings) {
        Stream.of("Seattle JUG", "Denver JUG", "Dublin JUG",
                "London JUG").forEach(name -&gt;
                repository.save(new Group(name))
        );

        Group djug = repository.findByName("Seattle JUG");
        Event e = Event.builder().title("Micro Frontends for Java Developers")
                .description("JHipster now has microfrontend support!")
                .date(Instant.parse("2022-09-13T17:00:00.000Z"))
                .build();
        djug.setEvents(Collections.singleton(e));
        repository.save(djug);

        repository.findAll().forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>TIP: If your IDE has issues with <code>Event.builder()</code>, you need to turn on annotation processing and/or install the Lombok plugin. I had to uninstall/reinstall the Lombok plugin in IntelliJ IDEA to get things to work.</p>

<p>If you start your app (using <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run</code>) …</p>

<p>… it will fail because Spring Boot 2.7.0 forces H2 v2.0. The H2 2.0 ecosystem doesn’t seem like it’s quite ready for prime time, so I recommend you downgrade to H2 version <code>1.4.200</code> in your <code>pom.xml</code>.</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;com.h2database&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;h2&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;scope&gt;runtime&lt;/scope&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;1.4.200&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>Then, <code>mvn spring-boot:run</code> should result in something like:</p>

   <code>Group(id=1, name=Seattle JUG, address=null, city=null, stateOrProvince=null, country=null, postalCode=null, user=null, 
  events=[Event(id=5, date=2022-09-13T17:00:00Z, title=Micro Frontends for Java Developers, description=JHipster now has microfrontend support!, attendees=[])])
Group(id=2, name=Denver JUG, address=null, city=null, stateOrProvince=null, country=null, postalCode=null, user=null, events=[])
Group(id=3, name=Dublin JUG, address=null, city=null, stateOrProvince=null, country=null, postalCode=null, user=null, events=[])
Group(id=4, name=London JUG, address=null, city=null, stateOrProvince=null, country=null, postalCode=null, user=null, events=[])
</code>   

<p>Add a <code>GroupController.java</code> class (in <code>src/main/java/.../jugtours/web/GroupController.java</code>) that allows you to CRUD groups.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.jugtours.web;

import com.okta.developer.jugtours.model.Group;
import com.okta.developer.jugtours.model.GroupRepository;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

import javax.validation.Valid;
import java.net.URI;
import java.net.URISyntaxException;
import java.util.Collection;
import java.util.Optional;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
class GroupController {

    private final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(GroupController.class);
    private GroupRepository groupRepository;

    public GroupController(GroupRepository groupRepository) {
        this.groupRepository = groupRepository;
    }

    @GetMapping("/groups")
    Collection&lt;Group&gt; groups() {
        return groupRepository.findAll();
    }

    @GetMapping("/group/{id}")
    ResponseEntity&lt;?&gt; getGroup(@PathVariable Long id) {
        Optional&lt;Group&gt; group = groupRepository.findById(id);
        return group.map(response -&gt; ResponseEntity.ok().body(response))
                .orElse(new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND));
    }

    @PostMapping("/group")
    ResponseEntity&lt;Group&gt; createGroup(@Valid @RequestBody Group group) throws URISyntaxException {
        log.info("Request to create group: {}", group);
        Group result = groupRepository.save(group);
        return ResponseEntity.created(new URI("/api/group/" + result.getId()))
                .body(result);
    }

    @PutMapping("/group/{id}")
    ResponseEntity&lt;Group&gt; updateGroup(@Valid @RequestBody Group group) {
        log.info("Request to update group: {}", group);
        Group result = groupRepository.save(group);
        return ResponseEntity.ok().body(result);
    }

    @DeleteMapping("/group/{id}")
    public ResponseEntity&lt;?&gt; deleteGroup(@PathVariable Long id) {
        log.info("Request to delete group: {}", id);
        groupRepository.deleteById(id);
        return ResponseEntity.ok().build();
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Add the following dependency to your <code>pom.xml</code> to fix compilation errors:</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;jakarta.validation&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;jakarta.validation-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;2.0.2&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>If you stop and start your server app and hit <code>http://localhost:8080/api/groups</code> with your browser, or a command line client, you should see the list of groups.</p>

<p>You can create, read, update, and delete groups with the following <a href="https://httpie.org">HTTPie</a> commands.</p>

   <code>http POST :8080/api/group name='Utah JUG' city='Salt Lake City' country=USA
http :8080/api/group/6
http PUT :8080/api/group/6 id=6 name='Utah JUG' address='On the slopes'
http DELETE :8080/api/group/6
</code>   



 Create a React UI with Create React App 

<p>Create React App is a command line utility that generates React projects for you. It’s a convenient tool because it also offers commands to build and optimize your project for production. It uses webpack under the covers to build everything.</p>

<p>Create a new project in the <code>jugtours</code> directory with <code>npx</code>.</p>

   <code>npx create-react-app@5 app
</code>   

<p>After the app creation process completes, navigate into the <code>app</code> directory and install <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>, cookie support for React, React Router, and <a href="https://reactstrap.github.io/">Reactstrap</a>.</p>

   <code>cd app
npm i bootstrap@5 react-cookie@4 react-router-dom@6 reactstrap@9
</code>   


<p>You’ll use Bootstrap’s CSS and Reactstrap’s components to make the UI look better, especially on mobile phones. If you’d like to learn more about Reactstrap, see <a href="https://reactstrap.github.io">reactstrap.github.io</a>. It has extensive documentation on Reactstrap’s various components and their use.</p>

<p>Add Bootstrap’s CSS file as an import in <code>app/src/index.js</code>.</p>

   <code>import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
</code>   

 Call your Spring Boot API and display the results 

<p>Modify <code>app/src/App.js</code> to use the following code that calls <code>/api/groups</code> and displays the list in the UI.</p>

   <code>import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

const App = () =&gt; {

  const [groups, setGroups] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    setLoading(true);

    fetch('api/groups')
      .then(response =&gt; response.json())
      .then(data =&gt; {
        setGroups(data);
        setLoading(false);
      })
  }, []);

  if (loading) {
    return &lt;p&gt;Loading...&lt;/p&gt;;
  }

  return (
    &lt;div className="App"&gt;
      &lt;header className="App-header"&gt;
        &lt;img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" /&gt;
        &lt;div className="App-intro"&gt;
          &lt;h2&gt;JUG List&lt;/h2&gt;
          {groups.map(group =&gt;
            &lt;div key={group.id}&gt;
              {group.name}
            &lt;/div&gt;
          )}
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/header&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}

export default App;
</code>   

<p>TIP: I learned a lot about React Hooks from <a href="https://www.taniarascia.com/crud-app-in-react-with-hooks/">Build a CRUD App in React with Hooks</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/taniarascia">Tania Rascia</a>.</p>

<p>To proxy from <code>/api</code> to <code>http://localhost:8080/api</code>, add a proxy setting to <code>app/package.json</code>.</p>

   <code>"scripts": {...},
"proxy": "http://localhost:8080",
</code>   

<p>To learn more about proxying API requests, see Create React App’s <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development/#docsNav">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Make sure Spring Boot is running, then run <code>npm start</code> in your <code>app</code> directory. You should see the list of default groups.</p>

<p></p>

 Build a React <code>GroupList</code> component 

<p>React is all about components, and you don’t want to render everything in your main <code>App</code>, so create <code>app/src/GroupList.js</code> and populate it with the following JavaScript.</p>

   <code>import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { Button, ButtonGroup, Container, Table } from 'reactstrap';
import AppNavbar from './AppNavbar';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

const GroupList = () =&gt; {

  const [groups, setGroups] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    setLoading(true);

    fetch('api/groups')
      .then(response =&gt; response.json())
      .then(data =&gt; {
        setGroups(data);
        setLoading(false);
      })
  }, []);

  const remove = async (id) =&gt; {
    await fetch(`/api/group/${id}`, {
      method: 'DELETE',

<p>Click on Manage JUG Tour and you should see a list of the default groups.</p>

<p></p>

<p>It’s great that you can see your Spring Boot API’s data in your React app, but it’s no fun if you can’t edit it!</p>

 Add a React <code>GroupEdit</code> component 

<p>Create <code>app/src/GroupEdit.js</code> and use <code>useEffect()</code> to fetch the group resource with the ID from the URL.</p>

            &lt;Button color="secondary" tag={Link} to="/groups"&gt;Cancel&lt;/Button&gt;
          &lt;/FormGroup&gt;
        &lt;/Form&gt;
      &lt;/Container&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  )
};

export default GroupEdit;
</code>   

<p>The <code>useParams()</code> hook is used to grab the ID from the URL and <code>useNavigate()</code> allows you to navigate back to the <code>GroupList</code> after adding or saving a group.</p>

<p>Modify <code>app/src/App.js</code> to import <code>GroupEdit</code> and specify a path to it.</p>

   <code>import GroupEdit from './GroupEdit';

const App = () =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;Router&gt;
      &lt;Routes&gt;
        ...
        &lt;Route path='/groups/:id' element={&lt;GroupEdit/&gt;}/&gt;
      &lt;/Routes&gt;
    &lt;/Router&gt;
  )
}
</code>   

<p>Now you should be able to add and edit groups!</p>

 Add authentication with Okta 

<p>It’s pretty cool to build a CRUD app, but it’s even cooler to build a secure one. To achieve that, you’ll want to add authentication so users have to log in before viewing/modifying groups. To make this simple, you can use Okta’s API for OIDC. At Okta, our goal is to make <a href="https://developer.okta.com/product/user-management/">identity management</a> a lot easier, more secure, and more scalable than what you’re used to. Okta is a cloud service that allows developers to create, edit, and securely store user accounts and user account data, and connect them with one or multiple applications. Our API enables you to:</p>

 
   <a href="https://developer.okta.com/product/authentication/">Authenticate</a> and <a href="https://developer.okta.com/product/authorization/">authorize</a> your users 
   Store data about your users 
   Perform password-based and <a href="https://developer.okta.com/authentication-guide/social-login/">social login</a> 
   Secure your application with <a href="https://developer.okta.com/use_cases/mfa/">multi-factor authentication</a> 
   And much more! Check out our <a href="https://developer.okta.com/documentation/">product documentation</a>

 Spring Security + OIDC 

<p><a>Spring Security added OIDC support in its 5.0 release</a>. Since then, they’ve made quite a few improvements and simplified its required configuration. Add the Okta Spring Boot starter to do OIDC authentication.</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.okta.spring&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;okta-spring-boot-starter&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;2.1.5&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>This dependency is a thin wrapper around Spring Security’s OAuth and encapsulates the following dependencies:</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-security&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.security&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-security-config&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.security&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-security-oauth2-client&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.security&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-security-oauth2-jose&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

 Create an OIDC app in Okta 

<p>Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>

<p>Select Okta Spring Boot Starter. 
    Then, change the Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta</code> and use <code>http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:8080</code> for the Logout Redirect URI.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: 
  /path/to/app/src/main/resources/application.properties
</code>   

<p>Open <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>
   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.client-id=0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
okta.oauth2.client-secret=NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/springboot/create-okta-application/">Create a Spring Boot App</a> for more information.</p>



 Configure Spring Security for React and user identity 

<p>To make Spring Security React-friendly, create a <code>SecurityConfiguration.java</code> file in <code>src/main/java/.../jugtours/config</code>. Create the <code>config</code> directory and put this class in it.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.jugtours.config;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.EnableWebSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter;
import org.springframework.security.web.SecurityFilterChain;
import org.springframework.security.web.csrf.CookieCsrfTokenRepository;
import org.springframework.security.web.savedrequest.HttpSessionRequestCache;
import org.springframework.security.web.savedrequest.RequestCache;
import org.springframework.security.web.savedrequest.SimpleSavedRequest;

import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeHttpRequests((authz) -&gt; authz
                .antMatchers("/**/*.{js,html,css}").permitAll()
                .antMatchers("/", "/api/user").permitAll()
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
            )
            .csrf((csrf) -&gt; csrf
                .csrfTokenRepository(CookieCsrfTokenRepository.withHttpOnlyFalse())
            )
            .oauth2Login();
        return http.build();
    }

    @Bean
    public RequestCache refererRequestCache() {
        return new HttpSessionRequestCache() {
            @Override
            public void saveRequest(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {
                String referrer = request.getHeader("referer");
                if (referrer != null) {
                    request.getSession().setAttribute("SPRING_SECURITY_SAVED_REQUEST",
                        new SimpleSavedRequest(referrer));
                }
            }
        };
    }
}
</code>   

<p>This class has a lot going on, so let me explain a few things. The <code>RequestCache</code> bean overrides the default request cache. It saves the referrer header (misspelled <code>referer</code> in real life), so Spring Security can redirect back to it after authentication. The referrer-based request cache comes in handy when you’re developing React on <code>http://localhost:3000</code> and want to be redirected back there after logging in.</p>

   <code>@Bean
public RequestCache refererRequestCache() {
    return new HttpSessionRequestCache() {
        @Override
        public void saveRequest(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {
            String referrer = request.getHeader("referer");
            if (referrer != null) {
                request.getSession().setAttribute("SPRING_SECURITY_SAVED_REQUEST",
                    new SimpleSavedRequest(referrer));
            }
        }
    };
}
</code>   

<p>Configuring CSRF (cross-site request forgery) protection with <code>CookieCsrfTokenRepository.withHttpOnlyFalse()</code> means that the <code>XSRF-TOKEN</code> cookie won’t be marked HTTP-only, so React can read it and send it back when it tries to manipulate data.</p>

<p>The <code>antMatchers</code> lines define what URLs are allowed for anonymous users. You will soon configure things so your React app is served up by your Spring Boot app, hence the reason for allowing web files and “/”. You might also notice an exposed <code>/api/user</code> path. Create <code>src/main/java/.../jugtours/web/UserController.java</code> and populate it with the following code. This API will be used by React to 1) find out if a user is authenticated, and 2) perform global logout.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.jugtours.web;

import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.security.core.annotation.AuthenticationPrincipal;

        // send logout URL to client so they can initiate logout
        String logoutUrl = this.registration.getProviderDetails()
                .getConfigurationMetadata().get("end_session_endpoint").toString();

        Map&lt;String, String&gt; logoutDetails = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
        logoutDetails.put("logoutUrl", logoutUrl);
        logoutDetails.put("idToken", idToken.getTokenValue());
        request.getSession(false).invalidate();
        return ResponseEntity.ok().body(logoutDetails);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>You’ll also want to add user information when creating groups so that you can filter by your JUG tour. Add a <code>UserRepository.java</code> in the same directory as <code>GroupRepository.java</code>.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.jugtours.model;

import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;

public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;User, String&gt; {
}
</code>   

<p>Add a new <code>findAllByUserId(String id)</code> method to <code>GroupRepository.java</code>.</p>

   <code>List&lt;Group&gt; findAllByUserId(String id);
</code>   

<p>Then inject <code>UserRepository</code> into <code>GroupController.java</code> and use it to create (or grab an existing user) when adding a new group. While you’re there, modify the <code>groups()</code> method to filter by user.</p>

<p>To magnify the changes, they’re in the <code>groups()</code> and <code>createGroup()</code> methods. It’s pretty slick that Spring JPA will create the <code>findAllByUserId()</code> method/query for you and <code>userRepository.findById()</code> uses Java 8’s <a href="http://www.baeldung.com/java-optional">Optional</a>.</p>

   <code>@GetMapping("/groups")
Collection&lt;Group&gt; groups(Principal principal) {
    return groupRepository.findAllByUserId(principal.getName());
}

@PostMapping("/group")
ResponseEntity&lt;Group&gt; createGroup(@Valid @RequestBody Group group,
                                  @AuthenticationPrincipal OAuth2User principal) throws URISyntaxException {
    log.info("Request to create group: {}", group);
    Map&lt;String, Object&gt; details = principal.getAttributes();
    String userId = details.get("sub").toString();

    // check to see if user already exists
    Optional&lt;User&gt; user = userRepository.findById(userId);
    group.setUser(user.orElse(new User(userId,
                    details.get("name").toString(), details.get("email").toString())));

    Group result = groupRepository.save(group);
    return ResponseEntity.created(new URI("/api/group/" + result.getId()))
            .body(result);

 Modify React to handle CSRF and be identity-aware 

<p>You’ll need to make a few changes to your React components to make them identity-aware. The first thing you’ll want to do is modify <code>src/index.js</code> to wrap everything in a <code>CookieProvider</code>. This component allows you to read the CSRF cookie and send it back as a header.</p>

   <code>import { CookiesProvider } from 'react-cookie';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  &lt;React.StrictMode&gt;
    &lt;CookiesProvider&gt;
      &lt;App /&gt;
    &lt;/CookiesProvider&gt;
  &lt;/React.StrictMode&gt;
);
</code>   

<p>Modify <code>app/src/Home.js</code> to call <code>/api/user</code> to see if the user is logged in. If they’re not, show a <code>Login</code> button.</p>

   <code>import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import './App.css';
import AppNavbar from './AppNavbar';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Button, Container } from 'reactstrap';
import { useCookies } from 'react-cookie';

const Home = () =&gt; {

  const [authenticated, setAuthenticated] = useState(false);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  const [user, setUser] = useState(undefined);
  const [cookies] = useCookies(['XSRF-TOKEN']);

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    setLoading(true);
    fetch('api/user', { credentials: 'include' })
      .then(response =&gt; response.text())
      .then(body =&gt; {
        if (body === '') {
          setAuthenticated(false);
        } else {
          setUser(JSON.parse(body));
          setAuthenticated(true);
        }
        setLoading(false);
      });
  }, [setAuthenticated, setLoading, setUser])

  const login = () =&gt; {
    let port = (window.location.port ? ':' + window.location.port : '');
    if (port === ':3000') {
      port = ':8080';
    }
    window.location.href = `//${window.location.hostname}${port}/private`;
  }

  const logout = () =&gt; {
    fetch('/api/logout', {
      method: 'POST', credentials: 'include',
      headers: { 'X-XSRF-TOKEN': cookies['XSRF-TOKEN'] }
    })
      .then(res =&gt; res.json())
      .then(response =&gt; {
        window.location.href = `${response.logoutUrl}?id_token_hint=${response.idToken}`
          + `&amp;post_logout_redirect_uri=${window.location.origin}`;
      });
  }

  const message = user ?
    &lt;h2&gt;Welcome, {user.name}!&lt;/h2&gt; :
    &lt;p&gt;Please log in to manage your JUG Tour.&lt;/p&gt;;

  const button = authenticated ?
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;Button color="link"&gt;&lt;Link to="/groups"&gt;Manage JUG Tour&lt;/Link&gt;&lt;/Button&gt;
      &lt;br/&gt;
      &lt;Button color="link" onClick={logout}&gt;Logout&lt;/Button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt; :
    &lt;Button color="primary" onClick={login}&gt;Login&lt;/Button&gt;;

  if (loading) {
    return &lt;p&gt;Loading...&lt;/p&gt;;
  }

  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;AppNavbar/&gt;
      &lt;Container fluid&gt;
        {message}
        {button}
      &lt;/Container&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}

export default Home;
</code>   

<p>There are some things you should be aware of in this component:</p>

 
   <code>useCookies()</code> is used for access to cookies. Then you can fetch a cookie with <code>cookies['XSRF-TOKEN']</code>. 
   When using <code>fetch()</code>, you need to include <code>{credentials: 'include'}</code> to transfer cookies. You will get a 403 Forbidden if you do not include this option. 
   The CSRF cookie from Spring Security has a different name than the header you need to send back. The cookie name is <code>XSRF-TOKEN</code>, while the header name is <code>X-XSRF-TOKEN</code>. 
 

<p>Update <code>app/src/GroupList.js</code> to have similar changes. The good news is you don’t need to make any changes to the <code>render()</code> method.</p>

   <code>import { useCookies } from 'react-cookie';

const GroupList = () =&gt; {

  ...
  const [cookies] = useCookies(['XSRF-TOKEN']);

  ...
  const remove = async (id) =&gt; {
    await fetch(`/api/group/${id}`, {
      method: 'DELETE',
      headers: {
        'X-XSRF-TOKEN': cookies['XSRF-TOKEN'],
        'Accept': 'application/json',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      credentials: 'include'
    }).then(() =&gt; {
      let updatedGroups = [...groups].filter(i =&gt; i.id !== id);
      setGroups(updatedGroups);
    });
  }
  ...

  return (...)
}

export default GroupList;
</code>   

<p>Update <code>GroupEdit.js</code> too.</p>

   <code>import { useCookies } from 'react-cookie';

const GroupEdit = () =&gt; {
  
  ...
  const [cookies] = useCookies(['XSRF-TOKEN']);

  ...
  const handleSubmit = async (event) =&gt; {
    event.preventDefault();

    await fetch(`/api/group${group.id ? `/${group.id}` : ''}`, {
      method: group.id ? 'PUT' : 'POST',
      headers: {
        'X-XSRF-TOKEN': cookies['XSRF-TOKEN'],
        'Accept': 'application/json',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(group),
      credentials: 'include'
    });
    setGroup(initialFormState);
    navigate('/groups');
  }

  ...

  return (...)
}

export default GroupEdit;
</code>   

<p>After all these changes, you should be able to restart both Spring Boot and React and witness the glory of planning your very own JUG Tour!</p>

 Configure Maven to build and package React with Spring Boot 

<p>To build and package your React app with Maven, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/eirslett/frontend-maven-plugin">frontend-maven-plugin</a> and Maven’s profiles to activate it. Add properties for versions and a <code>&lt;profiles&gt;</code> section to your <code>pom.xml</code>.</p>

<p>While you’re at it, add the active profile setting to <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code>:</p>

   <code>spring.profiles.active=@spring.profiles.active@

<p>After adding this, you should be able to run <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run -Pprod</code> and see your app running on <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>

<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed this tutorial on how to do CRUD with React, Spring Boot, and Spring Security. You can see that Spring Security’s OIDC support is pretty robust, and doesn’t require a whole lot of configuration. Adding CSRF protection and packaging your Spring Boot + React app as a single artifact is pretty cool too!</p>

<p>There is a classic juxtaposition within security controls. Organizations need to make data and services available, but if it’s too easily accessible, too open, then a data breach can occur. On the other hand, if data and services are too restricted then the controls are marginalized and ignored. Organizations struggle with balancing the risk between easy access and advanced controls. Whichever approach is taken impacts the user experience, and both can lead to less than desirable results if done poorly.</p>
<p>I’ve asked many IT professionals if they consider the end user when implementing a new security protocol. Surprisingly the answer is often, they don’t. The reasoning for my question is simple. If you know more about the users being asked to perform the task, the task can be implemented with less friction.</p>
<p>Friction, or the user experience, is a critical consideration to security. To achieve the desired security outcome, IT organizations must understand and develop with their customers’ motivations and behaviors in mind. In doing so, the intended ask will be met with less resistance and higher adoption, therefore improving overall security.</p>
 Why SSO Is Still A Must 
<p>Let’s clarify with something first – SSO is still a must in an enterprise infrastructure stack.</p>
<p>An end user will not type in their credentials for every access point. But, SSO in its current form and with 2FA or MFA as part of the access flow does not meet Zero Trust standards. And this construct ties back into what I started with above. Organizations need to balance the risk between easy access and advanced controls.</p>
<p>Zero Trust is a proactive security approach that continuously verifies users, devices, and services before trusting them. This approach is commonly summarized as “never trust, always verify”. Essentially, Zero Trust assumes that anything connecting to a system is a potential threat that should be verified before earning trust. But to do that security teams need to know as much about the identity accessing the resources as possible. Without this fundamental knowledge of identity, security is more hope-based than fact-based and impacts the effectiveness of a Zero Trust architecture.</p>
<p>On its own, the Zero Trust sounds like it will cause friction at the time of user access, a poor user experience. But that doesn’t have to be the case. Many of the access types that are in existence are here because the end users are creating poor passwords. These passwords can be hacked or even phished. So the transition to a Zero Trust architecture can be an opportunity for organizations to improve the user experience and implement technologies that improve security and improve user experience at the same time.</p>
<p>How can that be done? With Identity. What does identity have to do with Zero Trust architecture? It’s a pillar of the Zero Trust architecture because when you verify user identity at each point of access, you proactively verify users before a breach can happen. This is in line with the “never trust, always verify” core principle of Zero Trust. But to securely authenticate a user, one must first implement an indisputable identity proofing process. Because an indisputable proofed ID must involve the triangulation of a user claim with biometrics. Implementing this element of identity management will ensure that every access attempt is tied to a trusted and verified identity.</p>
<p>The result is a secure access infrastructure that is based on verified identities tied to the user’s biometrics. So instead of using passwords and trying to secure them with additional authentication methods, the user’s identity becomes the access method.</p>
 1Kosmos Supports Zero Trust and a Better User Experience 
<p>The 1Kosmos BlockID platform ensures that individuals are who they claim to be by using an identity-based approach to authentication. We bring identity into the security forefront so that organizations implementing a Zero Trust infrastructure know with certainty who is accessing IT assets and online services.</p>
<p>This means we have a quick and convenient way for users to self verify their identity using government, telco, and banking credentials. Then, once verified, workers, citizens, and customers use their digital identity to be utilized at login or transaction approval. This identity pre proofing injects a level of trust into the Zero Trust implementation and provides users with a frictionless experience. Organizations will implement their Zero Trust deployment with a significantly improved access user experience and high level of identity assurance for the identity on the other side of the digital connection.</p>

<p>Friends, Romans, Countrymen, lend me your ears. Vinay Gupta the coordinator of the 2015 Ethereum public launch has some thoughts on the state of the industry&nbsp;today.</p><p>Once again, crypto winter is upon us. Depending on how you count this is my fifth or eighth. Back in the 1990s there was ITAR and the crypto wars, where the US Federal Government basically killed the industry in America, back when crypto was a thing you did to emails not a shorthand for privately issued anonymous digital cash. The early days of bitcoin, when it hit thirty-something dollars then crashed to four and stayed there. The 2016 DAO crisis. I’ve seen it&nbsp;all.</p><p>I want to talk about how we wound up where we are today, and how we get off this nightmare ride of boom-and-bust cycles which are psychologically trashing our industry and making it so hard to build enduring value. We can stop the bleeding, but we have to be&nbsp;smart.</p><p>First of all though, here’s a bunch of stuff that might help with the deep background to all this if you want to orient yourself before plunging in; you don’t need to go through it to understand what follows, but a lot of the context is&nbsp;here:</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/leashless/status/1486147735212470274">@leashless</a></p></blockquote>  <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-blockchain-sleep-of-reason-b28f3bd3f83b">THE BLOCKCHAIN SLEEP OF REASON</a>  <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/03/03/ethereum-launch-process/">The Ethereum Launch Process</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/by-the-end-of-this-article-youre-going-to-understand-blockchains-in-general-and-ethereum-a-next-e11df6a1d7cf">Programmable blockchains in context: Ethereum’s future, by Vinay Gupta</a>   The psychology of the boom-bust innovation cycle. <p>Here’s <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/2018-year-in-preview-the-future-of-cryptocurrency-b99110480ff0">the piece I wrote in 2017 about the 2018 crypto winter</a>. Some of you may remember it. It lays out the same basic case I’m going to make here: crypto wins by solving problems that nobody else can solve, profitably. It has to win at three levels to&nbsp;survive:</p>  Ordinary people have to use&nbsp;it  It has to generate actual value, not just move value&nbsp;around  Governments have to tolerate it or use it themselves — either one will&nbsp;do  <p>If we can’t hit all three of those criteria WANGMI. We’re building a technology that needs a billion regular users to survive. The constants are huge: big engineering teams, big marketing budgets, complex legal and regulatory work. It all costs money and the only thing that can sustain the industry is real economic&nbsp;growth.</p><p>It is still <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/02/16/warren-buffett-invested-1-billion-crypto-bank/">Warren Buffet</a>’s world — literally, <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/berkshire-hathaway/marketcap/">he owns it</a>. His way of analysing the world is to look at the fundamental valuation and profitability of assets. He’s so good at it, his company has roughly the same market cap as Ethereum had a couple of years ago. But Buffet’s company doesn’t 10x up and 4x down every couple of years: it’s plodded along fairly reliably for decades, incrementally growing&nbsp;value.</p><p>Now, you’ve gotta ask yourself, “why can’t Warren Buffet see crypto?” And it’s not because he’s old or doesn’t get tech. No, it’s because he’s smart about <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentals.asp">financial fundamentals</a>.</p><p>That’s all that boring stuff&nbsp;like:</p>  How much food will come out of the&nbsp;ground?  What’s the global market for machine tools going to look like next&nbsp;year?  How fast are people moving to the&nbsp;cities?  <p>Thinking about this stuff really carefully is how you figure out when a real-world asset is under-valued.</p><p>Buying things which are under-valued is how Warren Buffet makes&nbsp;money.</p><p>But Warren Buffet won’t buy bitcoin at any price. So we have to think about that. What do we know that Warren Buffet&nbsp;doesn’t?</p><p>Now let me introduce another big thinker about finance: <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/people/carlota-perez">Carlotta Perez</a>. Perez is good at valuing bubbles. Specifically, she’s good at thinking about how bubbles create value in the long run even though they all pass through horrible periods like&nbsp;this.</p>Source: <a href="https://avc.com/2015/02/the-carlota-perez-framework/">https://avc.com/2015/02/the-carlota-perez-framework/</a>Source: <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oaqKjHbgsoqEXBMZ2/s-curves-for-trend-forecasting">https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oaqKjHbgsoqEXBMZ2/s-curves-for-trend-forecasting</a><p>What Perez says, roughly, is that bubbles build infrastructure. There’s a massive surge of irrational enthusiasm during which water flows uphill, capital flows into the most improbable things, and the future seems so close you can touch it. Warren Buffet hates this stuff because it involves guessing about the future. During that initial lift, during the innovation burn period, the G-force is like sitting in a plane at take-off. It hits you right in the base of your spine. Here we&nbsp;go!</p><p>Then a little later nearly everyone goes bankrupt.</p><p>Then a bunch of grown-ups who know how to run business move in, buy up all the assets cheap, and turn all of this technological potential into profitable businesses.</p><p>It’s a fundamental change in the nature of the people that run the industry: it goes from innovators to operators. Risk tolerance goes way down because the technology already works but it needs people who can operate it profitably.</p><p>My company, <a href="http://mattereum.com">Mattereum</a> is in the middle of that process of transformation right now as our business team takes more and more responsibility for running the business, and the original innovators are now more integrated into product development and sales. Usually companies don’t make that transition under their own power — somebody has to come in and fire the CEO — but in our case we knew enough about how businesses really run to make those changes under our own power (without anyone firing&nbsp;me).</p><p>I’ll introduce a few members of our new senior leadership team in another Medium post&nbsp;shortly.</p><p>So we’ve been through basically six rounds of the Perez cycle in crypto in the past 15 years. These things come on each-other thick and fast. An enormous amount of underlying technological, financial and even social innovation has happened.</p>  Bitcoin  Altcoins  Ethereum  ICOs  Defi  NFTs  <p>And at the end of that we’re left with a rough copy of about a third of the global financial system. You could just about put together a mortgage loan and buy a house as an NFT if you really put your mind to it. It would take work and connections, but you could just about buy real estate as an NFT today, with financing. Mattereum is of course going to make that a lot easier real soon, but let’s deal with things as they are rather than as they’re going to&nbsp;be.</p><p>So in every one of these rounds of the Perez cycle we can see the future as clearly as all the folks who went bust installing “dark fiber” optic cables in the ground. About 20 years ago companies ploughed billions into the ground to lay fiber optic cables that nobody needed or would pay for. It was THE FUTURE. <a href="https://www.wired.com/2002/11/fiber-optic/">Then everybody went bankrupt</a>, grown ups bought the assets for a song, and slowly started to operate the fibre profitably. Same thing happened with airlines: again and again and again Southwest Airlines acquired <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Southwest_Airlines">bankrupt airlines for a song</a>, with planes and routes, and operated them profitably.</p><p>In crypto we run this cycle super fast and with the same people in the room on each cycle. But the field keeps growing and changing, and all these ups and downs result in a most “interesting” phenomena: the All Time&nbsp;High.</p><p>During the All Time High, at crypto events, every single person in the room has made money. Everybody. You bought in yesterday, you’ve already made $5. You bought in six months ago and you look like a genius. The money just seems to take care of&nbsp;itself.</p><p>During a dip the “newbies” have lost money; the least socially connected 10% or 20% of the people in the room bought, then it dipped, and the old hands are buying at the current price. The newbies are a bit twitchy but the old hands are all looking greedy rather than fearful, and life goes&nbsp;on.</p><p>During a crash, and all-importantly after a crash, 70% of the people in the room have lost money. Some of them have lost 70% of what they invested: they took real money out of bricks-and-mortar assets and bought hype tickets, and then got rekt, to use current parlance. And in these periods the old hands aren’t buying anything; they’re sitting on their winnings and waiting for the rally somewhere on down the&nbsp;line.</p><p>The NFT space is now in this condition. I don’t know what <a href="https://www.nft.nyc/">NYC.NFT</a> is going to feel like later in June 2022, but I expect the mood to be mordant. People have lost a lot of money, and they wonder if they’re ever going to make it back. Remember 2018, Ethereum people? The ICO craze had blown over because the massive promises made by those projects had failed to materialise, and people were gloomy as all hell. A long time passed until <a href="https://oecdonthelevel.com/2022/01/31/from-defi-summer-to-crypto-winter-leverage-liquidations-and-policy-implications/">Defi Summer</a> in 2020, and then the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million">2021 NFT take-off a year&nbsp;ago</a>.</p><p>Most of the new folks in the space haven’t seen crypto winter before. 70% or so of the people in the room have lost money. The mood is down, down,&nbsp;down.</p><p>Welcome to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_Revolutions_and_Financial_Capital">Perez Cycle</a>, kids. I’m sorry to be seeing you down here in the gutter one more time, but you’ll find a lot of old friends here, survivors of previous rounds of the&nbsp;cycle.</p><p>We stick together.</p> The rebuild: real world utility, or bust&nbsp;(again). <p>Around 2017 I was looking at starting a VC fund. I didn’t know exactly how to do it: I’d worked in a fund in the 1990s but there was a lot about the business I did not understand at the&nbsp;time.</p><p>As part of the research, I put about 100 people through their first VR experience. I wanted to figure out if it was time to invest in VR projects. It was market research.</p><p>I came to the conclusion that we were years away from VR being a workable technology. The hardware was clearly ready: Oculus Rift was a little clunky but it was the Apple IIe of VR: the thing that tells you The Revolution is Coming. That was&nbsp;fine.</p><p>But the software was appalling. Back in the day they made movies by putting a camera on a tripod and doing a stage play in front of it. It took decades to make movies. A whole new art form (cinematography) had to be invented. Shocking and amazing things happened decade after decade for a century to get us to where cinema is now. Those changes were often driven by technology, but they were delivered by actors and directors portraying the human experience in new ways, creating ever-more-compelling works. VR is not ready for artistic reasons, far more than for technical ones. I could go on about this for some hours, but the lack of a “virtual cinematography” makes most VR experiences as compelling as watching CCTV footage of mall parking lots. It does not matter if I’m looking at the wheat fields of Gondor and scouting for Nazgul, if it’s not telling me a story I don’t want to&nbsp;know.</p><p>Also violence is overwhelmingly overpowering in VR. It’s literally just too much and reducing the violent content of our video games to the point that it doesn’t traumatize people to play (Arizona Sunshine, I’m looking at you here) is also going to take&nbsp;time.</p><p>So my prediction is this: the Metaverse is going to fail. At least for a while. It’s still too early. The pandemic is more-or-less over, people are back out in the world again, and everybody loves this place! The stay-at-home culture which VR is fundamentally rooted in doesn’t provide the lived experiences which people want. There is something very much like VR which people do want, but until VR has solved the artistic problems of storytelling in the virtual medium it’s just chat rooms with better graphics. I have an Meta Quest II, and it’s gathering dust: there’s just nothing to *do* in&nbsp;there.</p><p>Not yet.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/w0000CE0/status/1537401568328404993">@w0000CE0</a></p></blockquote><p>On the other hand, we have inflation. To inflate. The state of things being inflated.</p><p>The bubble of all&nbsp;bubbles.</p><p>Folks don’t remember inflation.</p>Source: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/11/business/economy/april-2022-cpi.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/11/business/economy/april-2022-cpi.html</a><p>Realistically the <a href="http://www.shadowstats.com/alternate_data/inflation-charts">US inflation rate is about 12%</a> right now, if it’s calculated using the same measures used back in the day. If that stays up for four years, each dollar in circulation loses half of its&nbsp;value.</p><p>The whole economy goes through what the Ethereum community has gone through in the last few weeks, over a couple of years. It is devastating. In theory wages adjust to keep up with inflation, and interest rates too. Practically speaking without strong labour unions to negotiate, workers get poorer year-on-year.</p><p>Pair that up with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jun/09/global-supply-chain-crisis-fuels-push-to-local-manufacturing-as-chinas-appeal-dims">global supply chain crisis</a>, including food, and you’ve got <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/06/1119752">a recipe for global disaster</a>.</p><p>The middle class don’t just get to retreat into the virtual world. There’s nothing there that anybody&nbsp;wants.</p><p>No, we have to stand our ground and fight for the real world: it’s where we&nbsp;live.</p><p>The metaverse is not going to save us. If we re-inflate the tech-hype bubble around the metaverse, it’ll produce a brief flare of innovation, some very inflated prices for assets which are inherently extremely volatile, and another flame-out like the one that we’re in, just a couple of years down the road (at most.) I quite liked <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/axie-infinity-axs-price-risks-deeper-losses-despite-90-drawdown-already">play to earn as a concept</a>. It didn’t seem inherently bonkers to me that the age-old practice of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_farming">gold farming</a> could be modernised by crypto into something that allowed essentially independent operators to do it in a defi way. But it’s stuck in the Perez spin cycle, along with everything else, and people in developing world countries are losing their entire livelihood in this&nbsp;chaos.</p><p>We have to change how this&nbsp;works.</p><p>We have to take the hard path now: we have to start building the kind of wealth that Warren Buffet can understand, the rebuilding that outfits like Southwest Airlines specialised in.</p><p>We have to learn how to make&nbsp;money.</p> Shovels and gold&nbsp;mines <p>During a Perez Cycle there is one very predictable way to make money: be the exchange. This is one form of the old saw about “<a href="https://medium.com/@transitprotocol/business-modelling-why-selling-shovels-during-a-gold-rush-is-the-surest-way-to-make-money-8fdf41f5bc1b">during a gold rush, sell shovels</a>.”</p><p>In the recent loops,&nbsp;that’s:</p>  Coinbase in its Bitcoin, altcoins, Ethereum, and ICOs&nbsp;phases  Uniswap (and all the rest) during the Defi&nbsp;phase  OpenSea during the NFT&nbsp;phase  <p>OpenSea got <a href="https://www.banklesstimes.com/news/2022/03/15/has-the-nft-bubble-popped-opensea-revenue-drops-97percent/">2.5% of everything</a>. Pushing $400,000,000 a month in fees at one&nbsp;point.</p><p>That’s no joke. That’s real money. But it’s essentially a toll road, and if the cars go somewhere else you don’t get a cut. <a href="https://nft.coinbase.com">Coinbase is doing NFTs</a> but it’s going to have a hard time catching OpenSea. Maybe <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/perspectives/2022/simple-nft-purchasing-on-nft-marketplaces/">this deal with Mastercard</a> will&nbsp;help.</p><p>But, really, this is just a tax on bubbles. You want to get into the bubble, you pay the gatekeepers. It’s generating real wealth by skimming a little on other people’s speculative activities. In a casino, this is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigorish">the vig</a>. In roulette, it’s the green “00” where the house wins and takes all the money on the&nbsp;table.</p><p>In crypto it’s the commissions going to the people selling access to the speculative market. This is not a bad business to be in for the winners. It’s real&nbsp;revenue.</p><p>But it’s not actually wealth generating.</p><p>So how does crypto actually generate&nbsp;wealth?</p><p>Here’s the first argument: crypto is monetary policy as a service. Crypto makes money by literally making money. Bitcoin miners pull the stuff out of thin air, with enormous energy costs, and sell it. Money is a product. Now this argument was always solid, but the counter-argument was “but Bitcoin is worse money than the US&nbsp;dollar.”</p><p>And here we get into a&nbsp;thicket.</p><p>Bitcoin was a worse, more expensive, more volatile version of the US dollar for a long time. But the price, on average, kept going up. Bitcoiners would talk about scarce supply and historical inevitability, and the good and right-thinking people of the world would roll their eyes and say “but it isn’t really money” and move on, while the bitcoiners continued to be wrong and get&nbsp;rich.</p><p>The thing that kept the Bond Villains in the loop on bitcoin was the underlying fear that the US dollar was inevitably going to start inflating eventually. The 2008 bust had left the economy in a fickle, precarious position and the vultures knew it was only a matter of&nbsp;time.</p>Source <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart">https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart</a><p>Well, that time is now. 12% inflation is one hell of a thing. It was a global crisis that last time inflation was that high. It’s a global crisis&nbsp;now.</p><p>And the bitcoiners are clearly and visibly right about Bitcoin being “monetary policy as a service” while, at the same time, losing money hand-over-fist right now as the current Perez Cycle bubble they are in bursts (again… for like the 5th time). They were making money when they were wrong. Now they’re losing money when they are&nbsp;right.</p><p>There’s no justice. But there is inflation.</p><p>For our younger readers: inflation means there’s too much money chasing not enough stuff. The price of the stuff starts to rise, and year-on-year everything gets more expensive. If wages rise at the same price as stuff, the people who lose are people with money in the bank. If wages don’t rise at the same price as stuff, the working class gets poorer and poorer, and the landlords get all the money. This was last a thing in the 1970s, and it led to the 1980s. What a disaster. And as for keeping wages rising through an inflationary period, who’s in a union these&nbsp;days?</p><p>So “monetary policy as a service” in bitcoin means this: by restricting the supply of money to below the availability of goods and services, the amount of goods and services a given amount of money can buy will keep going up. This is known as “deflation” — prices go down every year instead of up. Well, sure enough, with 12% inflation and worse on the way probably (stagflation! secular stagnation! contagion!) for the dollar economy, the bitcoin (and soon, Ethereum) “hard money claim” begins to look pretty good. There’s no doubt it’s a plausible model of the future: in-between the massive Perez cycle crashes, there is a massive on-going infrastructure built out and fundamental economic wealth creation from making and selling hard money during an age when all the governments will sell you is increasingly-soft money.</p><p>Back when the market cap of Bitcoin was around $500m USD people used to say to me “why is Bitcoin worth anything at all?” and I’d say “given the state of the world, does a $500m hedge against the dollar going horribly wrong seem unreasonable to you?” and usually they’d go “Ah. Hm. Alright then, sure.” It made a difference to their understanding of the situation.</p><p>So the argument here is that, even though Bitcoiners are losing money on the current Perez Cycle, they’re also right about inflation. Selling wealth preservation as a service is inherently profitable (if you’re any good at it) — just ask any professional wealth&nbsp;manager.</p><p>The long term trajectory here is WAGMI: Satoshi’s analysis of the inability of governments to control inflation in the long run was accurate, and the apocalypse that they predicted is&nbsp;here.</p><p>But Bitcoin prices are still going down because the <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/08/09/remain-solvent/">market can stay irrational longer than you can remain solvent</a>, as they say in finance. It’s a hard&nbsp;life.</p><p>So that’s one half of “during a gold rush, sell shovels.” Bitcoin is the selling the gold part. I won’t say that’s going well, but it’s going as expected. There are huge issues, as always with bitcoin, but the nation state’s money isn’t all roses either: defense spending vs. bitcoin mining, you know? It is the same sort of spending: protecting value.</p><p>Here’s the other&nbsp;half.</p><p>Protecting wealth from inflation is only one kind of protection we&nbsp;need.</p><p>The other kind of protection we need is environmental protection.</p><p>Now here you say “but Bitcoin has horrible environmental externalities” and I’m not saying you’re wrong. It does. There is a paradox here, at no mistake, and we all have to live with it regardless of what position we take relative to Bitcoin. I’m very pro Proof of Stake systems including Avalanche and whatever we’re calling ETH2 these days, and have been for&nbsp;years.</p><p>Environmental protection is a big deal. The existing economic architecture of the world makes it essentially impossible to protect nature. I could go on for some time about how the key function of colonialism is to convince rich people that it isn’t unceasing violence that maintains their wealth but, at the end of the day, you either know how this world works or you don’t. I used to get into trouble for saying “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CTCrWNYGTE">what is the point of Free Software running on hardware manufactured by slaves</a>” at open source conferences. You know&nbsp;me.</p><p>A system of sound money, no matter how outlandish or mainstream, is not going to save us alone. There is nothing about bitcoin that will stop us destroying ourselves with CO2 emissions, indeed many would argue (and I’m among them) that Bitcoin has done immense damage in this&nbsp;way.</p><p>We need a comprehensive overhaul of how things are done while the global system is in shock: there is a window of opportunity to start a reorganisation of trade the likes of which hasn’t been seen in about five hundred years. We need hard asset accounting to deal with fraud and asset bubbles, and we need to start counting environmental and social externalities on the same kind of basis that we account for payments. And it has to be the same system. (to read more about what an integrated blockchain-based environmental economics backbone would look like, see this Medium&nbsp;piece)</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/can-the-world-computer-save-the-world-part-3-building-an-economy-with-a-future-5d4156f06a04">Can the World Computer Save the World? Part 3: Building an Economy with a Future</a></p><p>But back to the hard asset economics. Here’s the core issue in a nutshell.</p><p>Nobody trusts anybody else’s&nbsp;money.</p><p>If you’re in China and signing a deal for 12 months in the future, what do you think the dollar is going to be&nbsp;worth?</p><p>So being able to see exactly what is going on with your counterparties is an increasingly good idea. If I’m being made promises about a supply chain, I want to be able to inspect it. Are you really going to be able to deliver me 1200 PC laptops at 200 a month, or is your vendor going to crap out? If you do fail me, can I get my money&nbsp;back</p><p>Uncertainty is high. All time high. Trust is low. All time low. The global system is stressed.</p><p>We restore trust by making the system transparent: visibility into our counterparties’ supply chains enables us to make a better guess about whether or not they’re going to be able to deliver. This kind of trust problem on trading and delivery is breaking out all over the place, in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jun/06/london-metal-exchange-sued-cancelled-trades-elliott-management">previously-unprecedented ways</a>.</p><p>The answer, inevitably, is to use less volatile things to pay for less volatile&nbsp;things.</p><p>Absolute certainty about hard assets and their value is a precondition for being able to do trade. But you also need certainty about the value of money, and the risks of the goods not being delivered because of supply chain problems. No system can solve all of this, but strategically deployed cryptographic assets can. If I have a crypto token which translates to four ounces of gold in the form of a gold bar, and you have every reason to trust that token, I can use it to pay for two laptops priced in gold. If you prefer SDRs to gold, and you want to bake in some terms for inflation to index-link the price of the contract, no reason that can’t be done&nbsp;too.</p> Turning the&nbsp;corner <p>The crypto industry has two fundamental ways of making money: “scarcity as a service” to protect wealth from governments printing currency. That mode of wealth production should be strongly reinforced by 12% per year US inflation and similar rates in other wealthy countries. But 50% drops that apparently come out of nowhere make it hard unnecessarily hard to make that&nbsp;case.</p><p>The other, complimentary, approach is to get stuck in to the hard work of getting physical asset trade on chain. There are a huge range of benefits to tokenizing physical assets as NFTs or representing them as&nbsp;ERC20s.</p>  support for environmental economics  lowered fraud&nbsp;rates  guarantees there’s no slave labour in your&nbsp;stuff  circular economy benefits to reduce raw material&nbsp;usage  easier sales because people trust the stuff they are&nbsp;buying  <p>All this together turns the blockchain itself into the marketplace for the entire world. That’s how we win: we get the real estate, the gold, the land, the wine, the cars, the clothes and furniture and everything else flowing over the magnificent complex infrastructure that has been built up by the last 6 rounds of the Perez Cycle in the blockchain space.</p><p>We have world-changing infrastructure. Now we have to use it to change the&nbsp;world.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/what-is-new-in-the-world-of-blockchain-64b482e1f9d7">What is New in the World of Blockchain?</a></p><p>My company, Mattereum, derisks physical assets as they are turned into tokens. We make Mattereum Asset Passports (MAP) which enable people to vouch (with their money) for the condition of physical goods, ranging from fine artwork to real estate. We combine cutting edge legal developments with blockchain technology so we can partner with merchants to add a MAP to every transaction — the MAP is a digital smart contract that legally binds the identity of an item being sold to its detailed specifications and value. Within the asset passport, each specification is backed by a warranty that is legally enforceable in more than 160 jurisdictions. This means it is no longer necessary to have to just rely on trusting the seller to tell the truth about an item, solving the problem of the lack of a trusted third party in sales on the blockchain. For the first time it enables purchasers to fully trust in the value, integrity and authenticity of on-chain merchant sales, which is of critical importance for the growth of metaverse and NFT transactions that will dematerialise and financialise the world’s physical assets, and allows an avenue for recompense if your on-chain asset is stolen. In addition, through engaging as a warrantor, brands and manufacturers can participate in recurring revenue streams from secondary market transactions.</p><p>Using MAPs we’ve helped our customers sell everything from gold bullion to a world-famous <a href="https://timmytrumpet.story.xyz/#/">DJ’s trumpet</a>. We are hard core economic realists: Vinay Gupta (CEO) spent years as a consultant on failed states; Anton Shelupanov (Managing Director) saw the economic troubles in former Soviet countries in the 1990s and early 2000s from an extremely difficult position: working alongside justice systems he witnessed the outcomes of economic collapse, which included uncontrolled hyperincarceration, leading to an amplification of the TB and HIV pandemics and the resultant harm to societies. It took respective governments and international organisations years and in some cases decades to put in place strategies to begin to recover from that&nbsp;harm.</p><p>We’re building the technologies, teams, and know-how to run the global economy in an era of unprecedented pressure. We have a <a href="https://mattereum.com/circular-economy/">circular economy service</a> to make the physical goods we have work harder. We’re working on a large-scale scale play to take gold bullion from around the world and decentralize gold custody. We’re working on real estate, both so you can use real estate as collateral more easily, but also to make it possible to transfer real estate faster and with more certainty which minimises exposure to fluctuating purchasing power and interest rates. We’re getting stuff digitally tagged so you know exactly what you are buying. Soon, all kinds of machineries like futures and options on physical assets: the full Defi toolkit applied to the real world. And because we really believe in and understand ecological economics, because the assets we help sell have estimates of their environmental impact and integrated CO2 offsets, this is all Refi: “Regenerative Finance.” Documenting real things, including the environmental externalities, is critical to our model of the world. You can’t know the real value of a thing unless you fully understand and know its environmental externalities. And knowing real value is what we are all&nbsp;about.</p><p>I want to encourage all of you to join us. The real asset revolution is how crypto really generates wealth.</p><p>How, you say? Right now the global economy offers us no reliable global way to buy and sell things of substantial value around the world, with strong legal protections for both buyers and sellers, and excellent risk management to make sure people get paid if something goes wrong. We don’t gather and collect the information necessary for environmental economics and right-pricing of assets, discounted by any environmental damage they are causing. We know only the cost of everything, but the value of nothing, and it’s really harming&nbsp;us.</p><p>TradFi destroyed the world through systemic fraud of the kind that led to the 2008 financial collapse. It’s working on destroying the future through funding climate change. Defi built the tools for doing some amazing things, but underpriced risk to a scary degree. Refi is both “regenerative finance” but also, critically, Re-al Finance. Finance fully grounded in the real world, including all that messy environmental, social and governance stuff that TradFi and Defi conveniently left out of the&nbsp;picture.</p><p>Everything that we can do to make transactions faster, more certain, more trustworthy, higher in information content, more international — all of that — generates real wealth by moving transactions from inefficient and data-losing rails (have you tried buying a house recently?) on to dramatically more functional infrastructure for the future of world&nbsp;trade.</p><p>And this is how we make the blockchain space valuable in an operational way, rather than a speculative way. This is how we move from a series of bubbles to enduring, stable wealth. We get into the real world, and we solve the transparency, accountability and trust problems which dominate real world trade and financial markets. This is the way&nbsp;forward.</p><p>Mattereum is up and running and open for business, creating MAPs for an ever-growing variety of assets.

 Technology and System — Which is the primary productive force?  Hope, Confusion, and Practice of&nbsp;Web3 <p>Having recently launched the <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/building-decentralized-society-own-your-value-c5be7088ac95">OWN Infrastructure</a> template for the building of Web3, it gives us great pleasure to welcome to the OWN Insights series, where we invite industry leaders to take us on a thought provoking journey through the Web3 space. Throughout this series, industry leaders will be sharing a space, communicating their thoughts, and helping us to better understand the new iteration of the internet. Please enjoy the first edition of OWN Insights, from Ontology Founder, Li&nbsp;Jun.</p><p>For most of history, “technology” and productivity have always been closely linked, and “concepts” are the driving force for the transformation of production relations. Therefore, people usually think of productivity as technological progress, and link production relations to group thinking models. Although changes in technology sometimes promote or affect the organization of production relations, the direct goal or direct impact of most technologies is still the improvement of productivity. But there is one technology that seems a little different. Its proposition has always been not to solve a single productivity problem, but to build a new collaborative organization. From this point of view, it is more like a mix of “technology” and “concept”. Its “concept” brings people hope and even imagination, and this “technical” practice is constantly facing the dilemma of overlapping hopes and troubles. It is the blockchain “technology” and the Web3 “concept” behind it that alternate between hopeful fanaticism and misunderstanding disputes.</p> Technology and System — A Timeless&nbsp;Topic  The Productivity Myth <p>In a conventional context, many daily discussions of productivity are involuntarily linked to hard technology, big bangs, machinery equipment, etc.</p><p>Indeed, from an intuitive point of view, the progress of technology, including the progress of manufacturing technology and the progress of production capacity, has indeed directly promoted the development of the whole society. However, no matter if it is from a historical point of view, or from a global perspective, there is another question that is equally important. That question is why these technologies were born, and why they were born here, not there. This has become an important issue of technological development.</p><p>Going further with the comparison of productivity, macroscopically speaking, the production capacity of the whole human being can be represented by the most advanced regions, the most advanced groups, the most advanced countries or the most advanced companies in human production. However, from the micro level, everyone of us&nbsp;, every country, every organization, as small as each individual, is actually more concerned about its own productivity, its advantages in this big competition, and its own productivity in the competition.</p><p>Therefore, the commonly used indicators for evaluating the productivity of different regions, organizations and countries are using a total factor productivity, which is not common. The development capability of science and technology that we are accustomed to think about, also includes organization and collaboration, etc. and other dimensions and evaluations.</p><p>“Total factor productivity refers to the “efficiency of production activities in a certain period of time”. It is a productivity indicator that measures total output per unit of total input, that is, the ratio of total output to total factor input. The growth rate of total factor productivity is often seen as indicative of scientific and technological progress, its sources include technological progress, organizational innovation, specialization and production innovation. The general meaning of factor productivity is the efficiency of the development and utilization of resources (including human, material, and financial resources). From the perspective of economic growth, productivity and capital, labor and other factor inputs will all contribute to economic growth. From the perspective of efficiency, productivity is equivalent to the ratio of the output of the national economy to the total input of various resource factors in a certain period of time. Essentially, it reflects the ability and effort of each country (region) to eradicate poverty, and increase economic development in a certain period of time, and it is a comprehensive reflection of the role of technological progress on economic development. Total factor productivity is an indicator used to measure production efficiency. It comes from three sources: first, efficiency improvement; second, technological progress; third, scale effect. In terms of calculation, it is the “residual value” after removing the input of labor, capital, land and other factors. Since the “residual value” also includes factors that have not been identified to bring about growth, conceptual differences and measurement errors, it can only relatively measure the extent to which benefits improve technological progress.</p><p>From this evaluation dimension, although there are three elements, it can be regarded as the common collaboration of two elements. The first is the advancement of technology and science, and it is also the way we are familiar with productivity advancement. The other can be included as the efficiency of organizational collaboration, and the improvement of scale. The last element can be regarded as the improvement and progress of production relations, so from an overall perspective, the ability of an organization is the simultaneous progress of technology and production relations.</p><p>If we call one of these two elements technology, the other can be summed up as a system. The system here does not refer to a narrow political system or some corporate system, but refers to the organizational forms and forms of organizational cooperation in various activities. These two factors constitute the total factor productivity indicator of productivity. Now, we need to go deeper and ask another question, whether these two factors develop independently or depend on each other, whether they promote each other, or come one after one. This question has been debated in all economic discussions.</p> Technology and System: Which one is the Chicken-Which one is the&nbsp;Egg <p>The systems discussed in this paper do not refer to political systems in a narrow sense, but to various cooperative mechanisms in a broad sense. In the debate on the importance of technology and systems, there are basically two viewpoints, one is that technology promotes changes in systems, and the other is that systems incubate technology。</p><p>For example, the industrial revolution in history is an obvious technological revolution from an intuitive point of view. The technological innovation represented by the steam engine has brought industrial production to a new height. The process of revolution is not a technological breakthrough at a certain point in time, but small technological changes throughout a long period of time, a cumulative technological change. The people who were in the middle of industrial civilization at that time, were not going through some sudden breakthrough technological change. Many things are slowly accumulating and coming into life naturally. It can be said that even if there is no Watt, a steam engine will be born at that point in time, but it may be that another person or several other people appear at the same time. The fact is that many new inventions and breakthroughs in basic science and technology at that time were invented by different people in different parts of Europe at the same time, which proves that the accumulation of science, technology and culture in Europe at that time had reached a certain level. New technologies and new models emerge naturally.</p><p>But there is another question, in what region are these new technologies born and developed? Is it accidental or inevitable? Or is it the result of the influence of other factors behind it? It can be compared in a narrow sense to the level of science and technology. Although the industrial revolution has always been considered to have appeared in the United Kingdom, when comparing the level of science and technology, the UK was not absolutely the leader. France on the other side of the strait also had very deep basic scientific and technical talents, but most of the technological innovations of the industrial revolution were ultimately based in the UK as the main foothold and source of development. What was the reason behind&nbsp;this?</p><p>A large number of studies on the history of the industrial revolution have found that the advantages of Great Britain in the construction of systems and cooperation mechanisms helped to incubate the birth of the industrial revolution, such as its patent system, and its social and political system dominated by industry and commerce. These all allowed more technologies to be born and incubated or to be moved to the UK to thrive. Therefore, from this perspective, the collaborative mechanism or system is an important catalyst for technology and an environment for growth. Although technology is a kind of knowledge shared by all mankind, where this technology occurs, where it is used, and even where it is controlled is very important.</p><p>However, because of this analysis, it is easy to fall into the comparative advantage of the political system in the narrow sense, so that many subsequent constructions emphasize the political system as the core element. This leads to thinking that as long as certain advanced political systems are adopted, all other development progress happens naturally, but looking back, in the end, many countries with very similar political systems also have great differences in economic development and technological development. Some countries with completely different political systems have also developed very well, and have different iterative paths of economic development and technological development.</p><p>Therefore, everyone gradually realized that the system is a good foundation and incubator for technological and even economic development, but much attention only focuses on the narrow political system. For the organization, it is the construction of organizational rules and structure in a narrow sense. It is felt that the adoption of some advanced political system or corporate governance structure will naturally bring about technological development or economic development.</p><p>Historically, this process has encountered a lot of contradictions, and many good top-down plans and good designs have ultimately failed to achieve the expected results, and even brought negative catastrophic effects. What is the core reason? In the development of technology, productivity, and society, there are a large number of uncertain elements and uncertain environments. A single top-down plan will play a catalytic role at certain points in time, but it cannot achieve long-term, continuous, and perfect control and&nbsp;design.</p><p>Therefore, there is a new concept that the system or cooperation mechanism is not designed, but emerges from the bottom up from the society&nbsp;itself.</p><p>More than 100 years ago, Alexis deTocqueville, a young French political scientist, made his first inspection of American democracy and wrote the book “Democracy in America”, which introduced the democratic system construction in the United States in a systematic way, but emphasized that the the spirit of society, civic spirit, social cooperation and participation in social governance are the key elements to ensure the integrity of this system and its sustainable operation.</p><p>Another American sociology book, “Bowling Alone” by Robert D. Putnam, observes from another angle and finds that because of new technologies, such as television and the Internet, people’s communication has become more independent. The result is that in the physical world, there is less and less participation in social governance around the community and organizations. It is also pointed out with concern that such a trend is a threat to the American political and democratic systems, because its underlying bottom-up system is becoming weaker and more fragmented.</p><p>Therefore, many people soon found that just designing a good collaboration system, according to a template, cannot solve the problem once and for all. Because in actual collaboration and social development, there are a large number of new scenarios, new collaboration methods, new business processes, and new social governance needs in social and economic development, which will continue to emerge. The so-called perfect system is difficult to solve long-term problems once and for all. Even in the new situation and environmental changes, such a perfectly designed system may actually hinder development.</p><p>So, this brings up a new question, how can a bottom-up social system that can iterate, adjust and even innovate itself be&nbsp;born?</p> Social Capital: Creating The Right Conditions <p>The previous section mentioned the bottom-up nurturing environment of a society. There have been many studies in this area, including the aforementioned civic community and social studies in the United States, and also crowd’s behavioral culture are studied in the intersection of sociology or anthropology in China, etc. The concept of “social capital”, which has been very popular in recent years, is also an important point of view in this regard. Social capital is a measure of the quality of a society’s resources.</p><p>The earliest narrow concept of social capital refers to the resources available to individuals in society. Subsequently, many sociologists have proposed that social capital is a characteristic of the infrastructure of the whole society, and it is the social resources and social capital required for the development of organizational cooperation, economic development, and social governance. The following is one of the broad definitions of social&nbsp;capital.</p><p>“The similarity in the connotation of social capital is reflected in the fact that researchers view social capital as either a productive resource that promotes cooperation among actors within a social network, or as an ability to facilitate individuals to obtain resources and benefits in a social network. Scholars will add the social and cultural essentials of network, trust and regulation into the framework of social capital theory, enriching the connotation of “social capital”.”</p><p>From the broad definition of social capital, it can be seen that social capital is a comprehensive evaluation index, which includes a social culture, organization, collaboration methods, the concept of citizens, and the perfection of various infrastructures, etc. Simply speaking, it is the measure of progressive fertility of the society in this&nbsp;area.</p><p>Just like farming, when you have a very fertile land, or a better ecological environment, you can naturally grow into a place with ecological diversity, and the types of animals and plants will be very rich, and they promote and affect each other, forming a positive cycle. Putting it into the real society, this also eventually brings prosperity and development of regional or national corporate organizations.</p><p>From this point of view, going back to the previous discussion regarding the industrial revolutions, Britain first sprouted before the European continent. It was also because in the hundreds of years before the industrial revolution, Britain’s cultural, political, and economic development had nurtured the formation of such social potential.</p><p>The social capital that has nurtured the system that is conducive to technological innovation and technological development is not only a single system factor. Just like in the UK, a better patent system will emerge, because of its previous concepts/values, culture and social capital naturally formed the system and&nbsp;concept.</p><p>From this perspective, social capital can be seen as an upgraded version of the system, a root, and a soil component that grows towering&nbsp;trees.</p><p>The complementary relationship between so many technologies and systems have been discussed above, which brings us to the question: what is the relationship between Web3 and&nbsp;them?</p><p>Web3 is a special product, in the eyes of some people it is technology, in the eyes of others it is a system and a concept, so it is a bit like the wave-particle duality of light. From here, we are more willing to define Web3 as a comprehensive product of technology and&nbsp;systems.</p> Web3: An Hybrid of Technology and&nbsp;Systems <p>I talked about the integration and incubation relationship between so many technologies and systems. From the perspective of Web3, it wants to create an environment that encourages free iterations and innovations — social capital or grassroots soil. But as mentioned before, whether it’s the glorious revolution promoted by the British industrial and commercial capital to the service of the industrial revolution, or the formation of the social mechanism and civic spirit of the American social system, it is more or less spontaneous, driven by history and religion, culture and other reasons. Web3 is a bottom-up, free collaboration infrastructure that wants to be realized for&nbsp;society.</p><p>What are the core elements of Web3? Some people may mention decentralization, and of course decentralization also has degrees, so this single element may not be enough to fully summarize Web3. From my personal point of view, the core element of Web3 is to give people the “tools” and “ideas” to collaborate freely without relying on third&nbsp;parties.</p><p>Historically, various collaborations in various major commercial societies will have certain dependencies on third parties. New collaboration systems, collaboration tools, and collaboration platforms need to be supported by different providers, and this provider will be embedded in the collaboration process like a&nbsp;link.</p><p>Without Internet companies, we may not be able to do social networking, e-commerce transactions and a large number of online jobs. Without the services of financial companies, we would not be able to do more large-scale transactions and capital collaboration, etc. These are all made possible with third party’s collaborative support, which of course is not free and will inevitably become part of the transaction cost. In addition, because the third party controls information, data, matching power, etc. in the intermediary link, a series of problems such as monopoly and privacy are derived. Further, you can only choose existing third-party services to complete your collaboration. If your collaboration tasks are special or do not have third-party support, many of them will not be able to get effective support even if they are willing to pay the&nbsp;cost.</p><p>Therefore, the concept of Web3 also arouses people’s hope, love and vision from the two aspects of technology and system. Technically, it is indeed possible to use a series of technologies to allow everyone to have a general decentralized collaboration tool, although it is still in the early days, but in constant iterations, everyone can do all kinds of collaborations. In terms of concepts, it has brought you a new concept of free collaboration, free combination, and self-control, a free combination of free people, which has formed a special&nbsp;concept.</p><p>Of course, you will also see some confusion in the process. First, Web3 itself is a concept that advocates bottom-up emergence, bottom-up free composition and decentralized collaboration, but Web3 has not yet been applied to the mainstream on a large scale. The concept of Web 3 itself comes from the planning of big ideas, the vision planning of Web3 is also based on concept first principles. How to find a balance between top-down planning and bottom-up emergence? That path is the main driver for the next phase of&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>In addition, between free collaboration and core promotion, when you only have free collaboration, you do not have the ability to execute effectively, and you cannot provide more effective services to society. Concepts touch many people, but often when it is time to actually use services or even definitions, concepts and interests conflict, and sometimes there are obstacles, and not everyone is willing to pay for new concepts.</p><p>At this stage, the concept of Web3 itself is more like a concept proposal. There is even a top-down design of such a decentralized collaboration concept, so its birth has a certain bottom-to-bottom effect. Because, frankly speaking, Web3 has not been widely used in a large number of mainstream application scenarios, and is still in the early stage of exploration and concept development, there will be many new hopes, contradictions, confusions, and uncertainty, we will discuss these issues of Web3 in the next part of this&nbsp;series.</p><p>OWN (Ontology Web3 Network) Infrastructure is a series of general blockchain basic protocols and products provided by Ontology for Web3 applications. Basic components including data and reputation, etc., and general-purpose tools such as a Web3 wallet, etc. Web3 applications can choose different basic components according to different scenarios for easy integration. It saves Web3 applications from developing basic functions from scratch, and thus can quickly develop applications. Individual users can also quickly access Web3 applications by using OWN basic products.</p><p>This first blog, written by Ontology Founder Li Jun, is the first in a series of OWN Insights. These publications, Twitter Spaces, and much more, will provide insight into the Web3 space from a collection of industry leaders and experts.

<p>According to Directive no. 2014/40/EU, cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco produced or imported into the EU must be marked with a unique identifier code to prevent and combat any smuggling and illicit sales phenomena.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each Member State shall appoint an entity (the ID issuer) responsible for generating and issuing unique identifiers.&nbsp; For example in Italy the Customs and Monopolies Agency is in charge to generate and verify the regular affixing of those codes on the individual packages of tobacco products placed on the market and the relative routes of the goods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each ID issuer shall make&nbsp;available to operators two services, one for registration and &nbsp;the other for requesting unique codes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All the operators will need to get a qualified electronic digital signature to register themselves in the system and then ask for the unique identification codes that must be affixed to the individual packages.&nbsp;</p>



 How InfoCert can support the European System for Tobacco Tracking and Tracing&nbsp; 



<p>As European leader of Digital Trust, InfoCert can issue qualified digital signature certificates helpful in several industries in order to allow different subjects to respect the European regulation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this case, InfoCert can release remote qualified certificates for automatic usage, that allow Tobacco’s companies to track any single package with a unique code, by allowing the correct tracing in any phase of the Tobacco supply chain. Thanks to InfoCert Signing APIs, a Tobacco Company can:&nbsp;</p>



  easily integrate the qualified digital signature in their existing applications  apply the requested XADES&nbsp; signature formats with a completely automatic process&nbsp;  avoid the need for a signing authorization by the owner of the certificate&nbsp;  



<p>The entire process is easy and secure, all the involved actors can apply digital signature on any documents in just few seconds. Finally, the use of Infocert’s fiduciary services allows companies to outsource the responsibility of the entire signing process.&nbsp;</p>

Source: <a href="https://www.moneylaundering.com/">MoneyLaundering.com&nbsp;:: Changes in Bank Regulations, Financial Compliance Regulations, Regulation Banks, Money Laundering Cases, Anti Money Laundering, Money Laundering Training</a> The European Union &amp; North America, are strengthening their anti-money laundering laws to prevent illicit activities.  Key Takeaways <blockquote>- The United Kingdom recently introduced “<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1082704/MLRs_SI_2022_-_Consultation_Response.pdf">Amendments to the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017 Statutory Instrument 2022.</a>”</blockquote><blockquote>- The amendment mentions that, subject to legislation, the Travel Rule will be enforced in the UK from 23rd September 2023.</blockquote><blockquote>- The threshold value for the Travel Rule compliance in the UK will be €1000, which may change to £1000 after the MRLs&nbsp;review.</blockquote><p>The United Kingdom is among the most important countries in the global financial ecosystem, with London being one of the only two <a href="https://www.lboro.ac.uk/microsites/geography/gawc/gawcworlds.html">Alpha++</a> cities worldwide. Alpha++ is the highest category according to a city as per its standing in the global financial industry. This ranking system is from a think tank known as the Globalization and World Cities Research Network&nbsp;(GaWC).</p><p>Speaking of digital assets, they have become a hot topic among the global financial circles, including in the United Kingdom. Due to the pseudo-anonymous nature of crypto-related transactions, there are concerns that illicit actors and sanctioned entities and individuals, including terrorist organizations, will turn to digital assets to circumvent the sanctions. Thus, countries, especially in the European Union &amp; North America, are strengthening their anti-money laundering laws to prevent such instances.</p><p>Recently, the United Kingdom introduced “<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1083351/MLRs_SI_2022_-_Consultation_Response_final.pdf">Amendments to the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds</a> (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017 Statutory Instrument 2022.” And the country is also mandating compulsory Travel Rule compliance nationwide from 23 September 2023. Thus, subject to final legislation the UK is closing all the loopholes illicit actors and sanctioned individuals and businesses can leverage to access the country’s financial infrastructure and services.</p><p>So, let’s look at what the recent amendment to the UK’s AML/CFT provisions has in store for the virtual asset service providers.</p> Crypto-Specificity <p>Respondents who shared their opinion on a proposal to extend FATF’s recommendations over wire transfers to digital assets agreed that a crypto-specific approach is a must. Thus, the Fund Transfer Regulations (FTR) provisions that will apply to the digital assets industry must be explicitly catered to&nbsp;it.</p><p>The respondents also brought attention to the uniqueness of the virtual assets industry. They mentioned that the words “Payer” and “Payee” do not fit within the context of the virtual assets. And instead, the terms “Originator” and “Beneficiary” should be&nbsp;used.</p> Costs <p>Although the government believes there will be a considerable increase in the cost of integrating new technologies to comply with the rules, on top of regular expenses because of ongoing compliance-related procedures, the benefits outweigh the risks. After all, complying with the Travel Rule will make the crypto industry better regulated. Thus, the crypto assets will become attractive to institutional and mainstream investors.</p> Grace Period <p>Most respondents agreed that a grace period of six to twenty months must be given to the firms to begin complying with the Travel Rule. Government, too, believes that businesses will need a grace period for ease of compliance. Thus, the Travel Rule will be enforced in the UK from 23 September 2023.</p> Data Privacy <p>Respondents from the industry expressed concerns about the breadth of personally identifiable information (PII) they will have to furnish to comply with the Travel Rule. After all, coupling the information that is publicly available on the blockchain with a user’s personal information, such as date of birth, name, address, and government ID number, among other things, can expose the user’s identity and spending&nbsp;habits.</p><p>Despite the industry’s reservations around data privacy and safety, the government has decided to make no changes to the type of information required from the originator and beneficiary of a crypto transaction.</p><p>The government also clarified that it is impossible to make unilateral changes to FATF’s recommendations. After all, FAFT’s recommendations are global in nature. Besides, most countries will fully comply with the Travel Rule and demand all the information that FATF has recommended. Thus, if the UK makes any changes to Travel Rule-related compliance requirements, it will severely impact cross-border transactions.</p><p>Also, the proposal does not indicate that the personally identifiable information (PII) during cross-border crypto-asset transfers should take place on-chain. Instead, it means that data transfer should be through other publicly-inaccessible mechanisms. And in such systems, data safety can be&nbsp;ensured.</p> Intermediaries = Crypto Asset Exchanges &amp; Custodial Wallet Providers <p>In the government’s opinion, the term “intermediary” is not too broad and is rather apt for crypto exchanges and custodial wallet providers. Thus, service providers like software developers do not come under the ambit of the Travel Rule, but third-party custodial wallet service providers do.</p> An Exemption for Exchange of Crypto Assets Between UK-based&nbsp;VASPs <p>When crypto-asset transfers take place between crypto exchanges located within the United Kingdom, it won’t come under the Travel Rule. Hence, for intra-country transactions, there won’t be any need to share the personal data of users involved in the transaction.</p> Threshold Amount <p>The government has kept the minimum threshold for Travel Rule at 1,000 Euros (rather than GBP). That said, there is a possibility of changing the threshold value to pounds from euros after the MRLs&nbsp;review.</p><p>Fiat and crypto-asset transactions will be treated separately to calculate the minimum threshold value. And the fiat currency transfers will be subject to Fund Transfer Regulations (FTR) provisions.</p> Unhosted Wallets <p>When it comes to unhosted wallets, the government will only mandate the collection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) when the risk of illicit financial activity is higher. The government has not entirely done away with this requirement, as this move would otherwise become an attractive incentive for criminals to undermine the current protocol.</p> Summary <p>All in all, the 2023 implementation of the Travel Rule in the United Kingdom has both positive and negative aspects. The positive aspect is that VASPs have a clear deadline to prepare themselves before the implementation of the Travel Rule. And the negative aspect is that the VASPs outside the UK will find it challenging to comply with the Travel Rule if they do business with the&nbsp;country.</p><p>Well, there’s a solution to this problem. Veriscope! First, it is a highly-secured Travel Rule Service Provider that can act as a safeguard against data privacy-related risks. Veriscope is special because it does not store PII, and the transfer of personal information is exclusively VASP to VASP. At no point does Veriscope access the data. Besides, Veriscope allows VASPs to obtain explicit consent from their users to prevent data&nbsp;mining.</p><p>And second, VASPs with counterparties in the United Kingdom can submit their request for information now, and once the UK-based VASPs come online, they will respond to their requests. Thus, solving the puzzle of the “Sunrise issue” in the process. All thanks to Veriscope “Historic Look-back” feature. So, all VASPs need to do for now is sign up for Veriscope and start submitting requests for information from UK-based&nbsp;VASPs.</p><p>As the date for implementing the FATF Travel Rule in the United Kingdom has been announced, VASPs must plan accordingly and be prepared beforehand. The first thing that VASPs must do is choose a Travel Rule Service Provider (TRSP). Speaking of TRSPs, <a href="https://www.veriscope.network/">Veriscope </a>is the best solution in the market, and is already compliant to FATF and proposed-UK standards. After all, with Veriscope, you don’t have to worry about VASP data discovery, data privacy and security, Know Your VASP, and payment screening-related challenges.</p><p>Visit our website to know more about Veriscope: <a href="https://www.veriscope.network/">https://www.veriscope.network/</a> and <a href="https://www.veriscope.network/contact">contact our BizDev team</a> for a discussion.</p><p>Also, follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/shyftnetwork/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ShyftNetwork">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://discord.gg/shyftnetwork">Discord</a>, <a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">Telegram</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/@shyftnetwork">Medium</a> to get regular updates on the evolving regulatory landscape in the world of digital&nbsp;assets.</p>

 What the heck is OAuth? 
 
 
<p>OAuth is an abbreviation for Open Authorization. It’s an open standard that anyone can implement. More specifically, OAuth is a standard that apps can use to provide client applications with "secure delegated access." OAuth works over HTTPS and authorizes devices, APIs, servers, and applications with access tokens rather than credentials.</p>
 
 
<p>In the old days (2006), websites used to prompt users for their Gmail credentials, so they could invite their contacts to use the website. Users often provided credentials, but there was no proof that the website didn’t store them for later use. OAuth was developed so users don’t have to provide credentials. Instead, users provide an access token from a trusted identity provider.</p>
 
 
<p>You can think of OAuth like hotel key cards, but for apps. If you have a hotel key card, you can get access to your room.</p>
 
 
<p>How do you get a hotel key card? You have to do an authentication process at the front desk to get it. After authenticating and obtaining the key card, you can access other resources across the hotel.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>OAuth 2.0 is not an authentication protocol.</p>
 
 
<p>OpenID Connect (aka OIDC) is an authentication protocol. I’ll cover that in another post.</p>
 
 
<p>OAuth 2.0 has many flows and <a href="https://oauth.net/2.1/">OAuth 2.1</a> is an in-progress effort to consolidate and simplify the best flows for developers. In a nutshell, OAuth 2.1 requires Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) for authorization code flows and implicit and password credential flows are removed.</p>
 
 






You can learn more about PKCE by reading <a>Use PKCE with OAuth 2.0 and Spring Boot for Better Security</a>.



 
 
<p>If you’d like to play with OAuth 2.0’s flows, you can try the <a href="https://www.oauth.com/playground/">OAuth 2.0 Playground</a> (built by <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronpk">Aaron Parecki</a>).</p>
 
 
 
<a href="https://www.oauth.com/playground/"></a>
 
 
 
 
 
 Can you do OAuth without a browser? 
 
 
<p>Developers often wonder, is it possible to do an OAuth flow without a browser in the mix? The short answer is No.</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/briandemers/status/1520104453155835905">A browser is required</a>. The browser doesn’t need to be on the same device. There are basically three options if a user is involved:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Web app: handle a redirect</p>
 
 
<p>CLI, TV, etc: use the Device Grant (browser on another device), app uses REST</p>
 
 
<p>Native app: use a custom URL handler</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Java’s OAuth 2.0 support 
 
 
<p>Java, the language, does not have built-in OAuth support. In fact, the JDK doesn’t even contain APIs to write a web app. The basic building blocks for constructing web apps are provided by the <a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/5.0/">Servlet API and Jakarta EE</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>The Servlet specification has a <a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/5.0/jakarta-servlet-spec-5.0.html#security">security section</a>, but there’s no OAuth in it. The <a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/security/3.0/">Jakarta Security 3.0</a> (still under development at the time of this writing) does mention that OpenID Connect and OAuth did not make it into the specification. To me, it seems strange that the "enterprise edition" of Java doesn’t have support for delegated authorization or federated identity. Hopefully, we can work as a community to fix this in the future.</p>
 
 
<p>On the upside, Java 18 does contain a <code>jwebserver</code> you can use to <a href="https://inside.java/2021/12/06/working-with-the-simple-web-server/">serve up static files</a>. That’s about all the "web" you’ll find in the JDK.</p>
 
 
 OAuth in Java frameworks 
 
<p>When SAML was first invented in 2005, Java web frameworks were experiencing their peak popularity. There were hundreds of Java web frameworks, and developers would make fun of this embarrassment of riches like they did with JavaScript frameworks in the late 2000s.</p>
 
 
 
<a></a>
 
 
 
<p>This History of Web Frameworks Timeline image is <a href="https://github.com/mraible/history-of-web-frameworks-timeline">maintained on GitHub</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/mraible">@mraible</a></p>
 
 
<p>Most Java web frameworks supported a form of MVC and others were component-based. All of them rendered their UIs on the server-side.</p>
 
 
<p>Fast-forward to 2022, and Java is mainly used for APIs, while JavaScript is often used for UIs.</p>
 
 
<blockquote>
I do find it ironic that there are now several JavaScript frameworks that provide developers joy with server-side rendering. It’s like the Java MVC frameworks of old but relatively new to JavaScript. History repeats itself, eh?

<p>One of OAuth’s key patterns is a resource server. A resource server accepts an access token. If the token is valid, it gives a client access to the resource owner’s data. In this example, a client is an app, the resource owner is a user, and the resource server is the Java API you develop.</p>
 
 
<p>In the section below, I’ll show you how you can use OAuth and set up a resource server with the most popular Java frameworks. You might think that Spring Boot is the de facto standard, and you should just use it. However, there’s a lot of innovation happening elsewhere, and I think it’s good to be aware of other options.</p>
 
 
 
 MicroProfile JWT authentication 
 
<p>When Java EE stagnated in the early 2010s, the Java EE community did too and eventually created MicroProfile in 2015. MicroProfile is a standards-based effort to group the parts of Java EE that can be used to create a microservice architecture.</p>
 
 
<p>As part of MicroProfile, there is a JWT Auth specification. Even though it doesn’t mention OAuth, it’s very much a viable way to implement an OAuth 2.0 resource server.</p>
 
 
<p>Suppose you’re using a Java framework that supports MicroProfile. In that case, you can likely add the framework’s JWT authentication dependency, plus a couple of properties to define the issuer and JWKS (JSON Web Token Key Signatures) location. The key names are standardized and can be used in frameworks like Helidon and Quarkus.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mp.jwt.verify.issuer=https://dev-13337.okta.com/oauth2/default
mp.jwt.verify.publickey.location=https://dev-13337.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/keys</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>What annoys me about this configuration is that <code>issuer</code> is an OpenID Connect concept that allows you to find all the endpoints for an identity provider, including the location of the JWKS keys. If you go to <code>${issuer}/.well-known/openid-configuration</code>, it has the location of the public keys in the <code>jwks_uri</code> value!</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>I really wish MicroProfile made things easier on the developer so you only have to specify the issuer.</p>
 
 
<p>The good news is you should be able to refer to one property from another.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mp.jwt.verify.issuer=https://dev-13337.okta.com/oauth2/default
mp.jwt.verify.publickey.location=${mp.jwt.verify.issuer}/v1/keys</code> 
 
 
 
<p>&lt;rant/&gt;</p>
 
 
 
 
 Quarkus 
 
<p>If you want to use MicroProfile JWT authentication with Quarkus, you need to add the properties above and a single dependency.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;io.quarkus&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;quarkus-smallrye-jwt&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
 
 Helidon 
 
<p>Helidon is very similar to Quarkus. The only difference is its dependency’s coordinates.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;io.helidon.microprofile.jwt&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;helidon-microprofile-jwt-auth&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>I’ve already mentioned Helidon and Quarkus. What about the other popular Java API frameworks?</p>
 
 
 
 
 Micronaut 
 
<p>Micronaut has support for OAuth and good documentation on how to configure it with IdPs like <a href="https://guides.micronaut.io/latest/micronaut-oauth2-okta.html">Okta</a>, <a href="https://guides.micronaut.io/latest/micronaut-oauth2-oidc-google.html">Google</a>, and <a href="https://guides.micronaut.io/latest/micronaut-oauth2-github.html">GitHub</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>Micronaut requires many more lines of configuration than MicroProfile, but it’s mostly YAML’s fault. It takes you 11 lines to configure an OAuth 2.0 resource server.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>micronaut:
  security:
    enabled: true
    token:
      jwt:
        enabled: true
        claims-validators:
          issuer: https://dev-13337.okta.com/oauth2/default
        signatures:
          jwks:
            okta:
              url: https://dev-13337.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/keys</code> 
 
 
 
<p>As you can see, Micronaut also requires you to specify the JWKS location, even though it can be looked up from the issuer. <code>:shakes-fist:</code></p>
 
 
 
 Spring Boot 
 
<p>Spring Boot uses Spring Security by default, and it’s the only framework that allows you to configure a resource server with one line of code.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.issuer-uri=https://dev-13337.okta.com/oauth2/default</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Of course, you could use YAML instead. That would be a bad life choice. Then it would require six lines of code. Don’t be that person. 😉 Spring Security is smart enough to look up the JWKS location from the issuer.</p>
 
 
<p>Spring Boot will <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/252cf9433252b08d8af6dc2457dea57b99658d6b/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/security/oauth2/resource/servlet/OAuth2ResourceServerJwtConfiguration.java#L100-L112">auto-configure Spring Security’s filter chain for a resource server</a>, so that’s all the code you need!</p>
 
 






If you use the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot">Okta Spring Boot Starter</a>, you’ll also have <code>oauthClient()</code> and <code>oauth2Login()</code> <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot/blob/ba1f203bdfc9ae7e969b7b5bc1cba211b38d9cc7/oauth2/src/main/java/com/okta/spring/boot/oauth/OktaOAuth2AutoConfig.java#L76-L90">auto-configured</a>.



 
 
<p>From this information, I hope you have a decent overview of where Java is regarding OAuth. If you like to learn by watching, reading, or doing—keep reading!</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Watch OAuth 2.0 in action with Java frameworks 
 
 
<p>I’ve created a few screencasts to show how to build a REST API with Quarkus, Spring Boot, Micronaut, and Helidon. These videos also show how to secure each API with OAuth 2.0.</p>
 
 
   
    
   
   
    
   
   
    
   
   
    
   
 
 
<p>At the end of each video, I show how the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> allows you to create working examples for each framework with the <code>okta start</code> command.</p>

<p><a>Create a Java REST API with Helidon</a></p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Java web frameworks without OAuth support 
 
 
<p>You might get away with saying that JSF and Wicket don’t have OAuth support. However, they both build on the Servlet API, so it is possible to use them with some of Java’s independent-minded security frameworks.</p>
 
 
<p>It’s possible your favorite framework doesn’t have a dedicated security plugin for OAuth, but that’s not important if you can get something to work, IMHO.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Java security frameworks 
 
 
<p>A few Java security frameworks aren’t tied to a specific web framework. I like to call them independent-minded, but honestly, they seem to struggle as volunteer-driven versus funded open source projects.</p>
 
 
 Apache Shiro 
 
<p>Apache Shiro expects to operate in a servlet environment and can work with any framework based on servlets and filters. It has many <a href="https://shiro.apache.org/integration.html">integrations</a>—such as Play, Wicket, and Lift—but most are dated and unmaintained.</p>
 
 
<p>Shiro can be adapted to work with OAuth 2.0, as demonstrated by Brian Demers in <a>Build a Secure Java Application with Apache Shiro and OAuth 2.0</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 Pac4j 
 
<p>Pac4j is a security framework with many sub-projects implementing OAuth 2.0, OIDC, and many others, like SAML.</p>
 
 
<p>A gentle reminder:</p>
 
 <blockquote><p>"SAML is to OIDC as SOAP is to REST." -- <a href="https://twitter.com/jf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@jf</a></p>— Matt Raible 🌴 (@mraible) <a href="https://twitter.com/mraible/status/1379871695163510795?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 7, 2021</a></blockquote>

 
 
<p>When a framework doesn’t have OAuth support, I’ve been able to use Pac4J successfully. For example, with <a>Play framework</a> and <a>plain ol' Java EE</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>You don’t hear much about Pac4J in the Java ecosystem. I’m not sure why that is. I’ve heard its quality isn’t that great, and I also believe it suffers because it’s not tied to a popular framework.</p>
 
 
<p>It’s kinda like the every-language-needs-a-framework concept. Maybe every security framework needs a web framework to help it succeed?</p>
 
 
 
 Spring Security 
 
<p>Spring Security has excellent integration with Spring Boot and it depends on the Spring Framework. However, you can use it to secure a <a>Java EE app that uses filters</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>It has <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/oauth2/index.html">OAuth 2.0</a>, <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/oauth2/login/index.html">OpenID Connect</a>, and even <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/saml2/index.html">SAML</a> support.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>It’s a shame Spring Security has to support SAML. 😞</p>
 
 
<p>Apparently, there’s a demand for SAML from Spring Security customers and users. Or maybe it’s just misinformed decision-makers? Are developers still implementing SOAP APIs? I hope not! If not, why are developers still using SAML?!</p>
 
 
<p>OIDC does it better. Just use it!</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 OAuth 2.0 authorization servers 
 
 
<p>Up to this point, all the things I’ve talked about are OAuth clients. They require an identity provider to do OAuth flows. An identity provider has OAuth 2.0 authorization servers. Most of the prominent providers have their own proprietary implementation.</p>
 
 
<p>However, there are a couple of open source Java-based authorization servers you can use:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p><a href="https://www.keycloak.org/">Keycloak</a></p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-authorization-server">Spring Authorization Server</a></p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://github.com/wso2/product-is">WSO2 Identity Server</a></p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Since I work for a company that is an OAuth 2.0 identity provider, it’s my duty to inform you that using one of these is called "building your own." We recommend buying instead. From us, of course. 😉</p>
 
 
<p>In reality, if you’re a developer, you’re always going to build your own somewhat. Even if you use a library like Spring Security, you can’t just add it to your project and expect everything to work without writing any code. Granted, it might only require ten lines of code, but you’re still building something.</p>
 
 
<p>You can’t just buy Okta and secure a Java API with it without writing code.</p>
 
 
 
 
 What about JavaFX? 
 
 
<p>JavaFX is often touted as an excellent way to build desktop apps. The folks that recommend it are typically JavaFX experts and Java enthusiasts that hate JavaScript.</p>
 
 
<p>JavaFX’s OAuth support is virtually non-existent, and there don’t seem to be many folks interested in fixing that.</p>
 
 
<p>As one of the few Java Champions that likes JavaScript, I poked the bear several weeks ago.</p>
 
 <blockquote><p>If <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/JavaFX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#JavaFX</a> is better than <a href="https://twitter.com/electronjs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@electronjs</a> for desktop apps, why are there no good OAuth or OIDC libraries for it?<br><br>To be fair, there is a library from Microsoft, but it requires Oracle's JDK 8, doesn't work on Windows, and the project is no longer maintained.<a href="https://t.co/53kcnRKrKJ">https://t.co/53kcnRKrKJ</a></p>— Matt Raible 🌴 (@mraible) <a href="https://twitter.com/mraible/status/1520048029641986048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2022</a></blockquote>

 
 
<p>My guess is this won’t be solved anytime soon. I’d love to be wrong.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Do Scala and Kotlin support OAuth? 
 
 
<p>Scala was all the rage in the mid-2010s. When the Play framework team announced they were writing Play 2 in Scala, the JVM world rejoiced. I was interested in it too. I took a course from Martin Odersky, learned a ton, and reached the top of Hacker News when I <a href="https://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/play_2_0_a_web">live-blogged about it</a> at Devoxx Belgium in 2011.</p>
 
 
<p>Since then, Play’s popularity has waned, Spring Boot has taken over, and Kotlin is a JVM language that many developers admire.</p>
 
 
<p>The good news for these languages is they have excellent Java interop. In theory, you should be able to use any Java security library for your Scala or Kotlin app. However, each language has its own web frameworks, so it might not be that easy.</p>
 
 
<p>The most popular Scala web framework is still Play and it does have <a href="https://www.playframework.com/modules/oauth-1.0/home">OAuth support</a>. Kotlin has Ktor, and it has easy-to-use <a href="https://ktor.io/docs/oauth.html">OAuth support</a> too.</p>
 
 
<p>We published a tutorial about <a>Ktor and Okta</a> in late 2020.</p>

<p>Our co-CEO and CTO Dr Paul Ashley was recently invited to present at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.riseofprivacytech.com/">TROPT</a>&nbsp;inaugural&nbsp;<a href="https://www.riseofprivacytech.com/tropt-web-3-0-privacy-conference-2022/">Web 3.0 Privacy Conference</a>&nbsp;and described some of the developments in decentralized identity that will help to enable Web 3.0, the next iteration of the internet.</p>



<p>Dr Ashley joined Warren Anderson, CEO at Discreet Labs, and Moushmi Banerjee, Senior Software Architect at Okta Inc. at the conference, which attracted hundreds of privacy tech and Web 3.0 key players.</p>



<p>Each panellist described recent privacy developments in the Web 3.0 space, which largely center on decentralized identity (DI). Dr Ashley spoke about digital wallets, verifiable data registries, verifiable credentials and identity hubs.&nbsp;Moushmi Banerjee added to verifiable credentials and explained zero knowledge proofs, while Warren Anderson looked at Discreet Lab’s work in building scalable privacy systems for Web 3.0 and the Findora public blockchain.</p>



<p>If you’re fairly new to Web 3.0 and DI, you might appreciate this context:</p>



 



 What is Web 3.0? 



<p></p>



<p>Web 3.0 is the latest iteration of the internet that’s arriving even as Web 2.0 still consumes us. It will shake up data privacy and change the data economy as we know it. Here’s a quick history:</p>



  Web 1.0 was the “read only” web, with static web pages connected with hyperlinks.  



  Web 2.0 is the “interactive; anyone can author and share content” web. It has e-commerce and social media and is&nbsp;highly centralized, with web sites and services collecting users’&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personally identifiable information</a> in exchange for access (think Meta, Google et al. knowing everything about us). This centralized model has led to&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">surveillance capitalism</a>&nbsp;(the data economy) and the trade of highly profitable personal data for serving up&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/06/do-consumers-even-want-personalized-ads/">personalized ads</a>&nbsp;and influencing decisions, which in turn has led to widespread&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/how-bad-is-the-global-data-privacy-crisis/">data abuse</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/11/the-growing-risks-to-business-and-their-customers-from-the-dark-web/">misuse</a>&nbsp;– and the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/how-bad-is-the-global-data-privacy-crisis/">global data privacy crisis</a>&nbsp;we currently face.  



  Web 3.0 promises to solve the privacy and security challenges of its predecessor by flipping the model to&nbsp;decentralized&nbsp;and returning control over personal data to users. It has been&nbsp;<a href="https://au.pcmag.com/help/92462/what-is-web3-and-how-will-it-work">called</a>&nbsp;a “decentralized digital infrastructure” because it uses blockchain technology and decentralized identity technology to give users digital identities that aren’t connected to their personal identity (just as Anonyome Labs’&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo</a>&nbsp;digital identity has done for years now). In doing so, Web 3.0 moves the user away from being the “product” as a result of their information sharing to being the “owner” of the information they share: they control which pieces of their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personally identifiable information</a>&nbsp;(name, date of birth, phone number, SSN etc.) they share in any given context. This essentially means paper and plastic IDs are replaced with digital versions housed in a digital wallet on a user’s device and completely under their control (no centralized authority storing or verifying). On Web 3.0, the user controls where to be identified and where to be anonymous.  



 What is decentralized identity? 



<p></p>



<p>If Web 3.0 will shake things up, then decentralized identity will be doing a lot of the shaking.</p>



<p>Anonyome Labs has long foreseen that, to work, Web 3.0 will depend on&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/?s=decentralized+identity">decentralized identity</a>&nbsp;(DI) technologies and standards to&nbsp;verify and exchange private information and develop trusted, secure digital relationships between users and services. DI is what will make digital identities being completely under the user’s control possible.</p>



<p>We believe DI delivers everything an effective Web 3.0 application needs:&nbsp;<br></p>



  Verifiable – allows authorities to issue statements about a subject (e.g. to prove their identity&nbsp;  Trustless – no requirement on the user to place their sole trust in any one third party in order for a network or payment system to function  Self-governing – allows users to retain full control over their personal information&nbsp;  Permissionless – no restrictions, and no central authority or administrator controls participation&nbsp;  Distributed and robust – stored on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp">blockchain</a>&nbsp;technology, a distributed database that is shared among the nodes of a computer network (as used in cryptocurrency)  Stateful – all transactions are immutable and stored in the distributed database of the network  Native built-in payments – facilitates the exchange of payment information  Standards-based and open source – sets “rules” to enable interoperability across web sites and services.&nbsp;

<p>RapidLEI has been a fast growing organisation identity service since being launched by Ubisecure in 2018. RapidLEI was designed from the ground-up to utilise automation, a global partner network and close business registry relationships to better support the broad range of Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) use cases. The goal, to dramatically grow LEI usage by organisations and improve how businesses identify each other in cross-border transactions.</p>
<p>With the significant growth in the uptake of LEIs, over 2 million of these organisation identifier codes have been registered to date. The Global LEI Foundation (GLEIF) has predicted that 20 million LEIs will be in use by 2027. The challenge is to encourage every organisation to have an LEI – whether voluntarily or led by regulatory mandates. This will be down to education, but also is where our simple and quick LEI issuance platform can help to increase the number of companies with LEIs. Once all organisations have LEIs this will improve transactions and onboarding processes, eliminating the delay of applying for an LEI.</p>
 What is an LEI? 
<p>An LEI is a 20-digit alphanumeric code, which acts as a global identifier to represent an organisation’s identity. It was created to better identify companies in cross border transactions, as different countries have historically used different identifiers. After the 2008 financial crisis, the G20 agreed that the introduction of LEIs could solve the global lack of corporate transparency and answer the critical questions of “who is who” and “who owns whom”. Organisations must complete an annual verification process, which is globally standardised, to gain their LEI, providing a greater level of transparency about the organisation. There are over 116 different <a href="https://rapidlei.com/lei-regulation/">regulations that either require or recommend the use of LEIs</a>.</p>
 KYC and LEIs 
<p>Know Your Customer (KYC) is the process of verifying the identity of a customer (or client) and is usually undertaken by organisations that require a highly-assured level of trust about who they are doing business with (such as banks). KYC covers both individuals and businesses, also known as KYB (Know Your Business).</p>
<p>Ubisecure believes that the LEI should be central to KYC/KYB. LEI in KYC provides the ideal technology to streamline KYC and onboarding. LEIs are verified organisation identities, that represent important KYC data points such as historical legal names, incorporation jurisdictions, entity status and much, much more. As the LEI issuer we also maintain verified information on parental and child structure, company officers etc. To make the LEI provide benefits in the KYC use case, we built the technology and commercial solution to allow for LEI registrations to be built directly in KYC workflows and applications.</p>
<p>The GLEIF is also a vocal advocate of the benefits that the LEI brings to KYC, and reported that: </p>
<blockquote><p>“Today, the global banking sector spends around U.S.$40 billion on client onboarding annually. That’s an estimated U.S.$54m per bank, U.S.$31m of which is ‘people’ cost. Productivity improvements gained through LEI usage could generate cross-sector cost reductions of between 5-10% annually.” </p></blockquote>
<p>We see the LEI adding a lot of value to KYC . It is a standardised identifier, centrally maintained in the Global LEI System, a free-to-use database of organisation identities. The LEI maintains historical changes in organisation data and attributes, and acts as a live record, so information is always up to date.</p>
<p>The Global LEI Foundation and McKinsey published a <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/blog/gleif-identifies-that-over-half-of-salespeople-in-banking-spend-27-of-their-working-week-onboarding-new-client-organizations">report</a> stating that in banking alone, senior salespeople can spend up to 1.5 days of their week onboarding new clients. This can lead to serious economic impact. Without LEIs, banks use many different identifiers. This can lead to inconsistencies alongside there being a considerable admin overhead and customer service impact.</p>
<p><a href="https://rapidlei.com/gleif-validation-agents/">LEI Everywhere</a> from Ubisecure is a programme designed for Banks and other financial institutions, which democratises availability of LEIs by lowering costs and allowing LEIs to be issued within existing onboarding or transaction processes to avoid interrupted of service. LEI Everywhere provides an API for fully integrated LEI lookup, registration, and renewal into KYC applications. Reduced fees also make it feasible for Banks to register LEIs on behalf of clients. Both aiding the KYC process and reducing the risk of regulatory non-compliance when transacting on behalf of clients.</p>
 Why RapidLEI? 
<p>Ubisecure gained its LEI issuance accreditation from GLEIF in 2018, allowing us to become an LEI Issuer through our RapidLEI brand. Becoming an LEI issuer has complemented the Ubisecure solution portfolio, proving us as a leading provider of strong organisation identities, and supporting our greater mission within the Identity &amp; Access Management space.</p>
<p>Ubisecure brought innovation to the LEI market by automating LEI issuance. Revolutionising how quickly and effectively an LEI can be registered. While improving data accuracy along the way by connecting directly to business registries globally. This innovation has helped RapidLEI to become the #1 LEI Issuer globally, issuing about 1 in 4 new LEIs monthly, in just 3 short years.</p>
<p>Ubisecure will continue to work towards the challenge of ensuring that every organisation has an LEI. To achieve this, along with the GLIEF and other LEI ecosystem stakeholders, we believe LEIs should be closely tied to KYC to both streamline and support existing KYC processes.

Also, in the online world, the creation of an ID has become more flexible. One person can create different emails in their name, for example, without a great amount of bureaucracy — but which of those IDs can be trustworthy?”</p><p>In Web2, identity mainly refers to information surrounding ancestry and real-life occupations. In the Web3 era, identity is endowed with richer connotations. For users to carry out various activities on-chain, they need a digital identity in the form of an address. Many people may think that the activities on-chain mainly focus on financial activities, such as transfers and pledges, but this is not the case. The most important element is the users themselves. Based on blockchain technology, the required data and information will go hand in hand, accompanied by a valid on-chain user who has been verified by KYC from beginning to&nbsp;end.</p><p>Follow us on social&nbsp;media!</p><p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-weekly-report-june-7-13-2022-973508710903">Ontology Weekly Report (June 7–13, 2022)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Introducing Sign-in with Web3 — Building a Non-Custodial World <p>In a much needed multi-chain extension to Sign-in with Ethereum, users will now be able to control their digital identity with their Ethereum/ENS, Solana, and Starknet accounts instead of relying on traditional/custodial profiles.</p><p>Importance of building a non-custodial future</p><p>In crypto, there is a saying that goes “Not your keys, not your crypto ‘’ exemplifying the importance of non-custodiality, — the need to shift the dynamic of ownership from entities to the end-user. The principle also extends beyond just the crypto you hold to your very identity itself. While traditional Web2 entities have done a tremendous job in making the user experience incredibly intuitive but that has also come at a cost — the cost of&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>There is excessive monetization of the users’ activity and their residing information on the web. Security compromises even among the biggest names in cybersecurity are increasingly common. As the average user is becoming more and more aware of these tradeoffs, the voice to safeguard their identity is growing louder by the day. We at Web3Auth firmly believe that non-custodiality is the future and we want to lead the way in making it&nbsp;happen.</p><p>Sign-in With Web3 — You Own Your&nbsp;Identity</p><p>Web3 has to a large extent cracked the code for the user privacy problem. The power of public and private keys, enabled by crypto technologies, allows users to own their username, and profile data, and use their accounts across different applications. This is the fundamental on which built Web3Auth was built — to leverage the power of threshold cryptography to shift the dynamic of power from entities to individuals. When the Ethereum Foundation announced Sign-in with Ethereum, it was not only an important(albeit silent) innovation for the internet, it was also a solid validation and acknowledgement of our core&nbsp;values.</p><p>Sign-in with Web3 adds on to that innovation with a powerful multi-chain twist. It extends that innovation to some of the biggest chain ecosystems. Starting today, users on the Ethereum, Solana, and Starknet chains can log in to any Web2 application using their web3 identities thereby bringing the security and privacy of Web3 authentication to&nbsp;Web2.</p><p>What Does Sign-in With Web3&nbsp;Solve?</p><p>Today, there are multiple blockchain platforms and thus naturally, there arises a need to have a standard specification for authentication with Web3 identities. This led to the birth of<a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-74.md"> CAIP-74</a> which allows for creating a chain-agnostic Object Capability (CACAO), based on a signing message as an IPLD object. Sign in with Web3 endeavours to maintain compatibility with CAIP-74, thereby adhering to a chain agnostic standard.</p> Supported Chains<a href="https://siww.web3auth.io/#supported-chains">​</a> <p>Currently, Sign-in with Web3&nbsp;supports</p>  Ethereum  Solana  Starknet  <p>**Support for more chains coming&nbsp;soon.</p><p>Do check our<a href="https://siww.web3auth.io/"> documentation</a> for a step by step guide on how to build a Sign-in with Web3 flow to navigate the authentication logic. Feel free to reach out to us in case you have questions on our<a href="https://t.me/web3authdev"> Telegram&nbsp;Chat</a></p><p>Additionally, Web3Auth, the creator of Sign-in with Web3, offers a dedicated <a href="http://docs.web3auth.io">suite of authentication</a> tools for all Web3 Developers. This includes support for OAuth and native biometric login using our Plug and Play SDK. You can also utilise one of the leading wallets in the Web3 ecosystem, i.e., the Torus Web3&nbsp;Wallet.</p><p>Stay in touch with&nbsp;Web3Auth</p><p><a href="http://web3auth.io/">Website</a> |<a href="https://docs.web3auth.io/"> Docs</a> |<a href="https://twitter.com/web3auth"> Twitter</a> |<a href="https://t.me/web3authdev"> Telegram</a> |<a href="http://discord.gg/web3auth"> Discord</a> |<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/web3auth">&nbsp;Linkedin</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/introducing-sign-in-with-web3-building-a-non-custodial-world-50136b3a6225">Introducing Sign-in with Web3 — Building a Non-Custodial World</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>The NIS Directive aimed at achieving a common standard of network and information security across all EU Member States, with a focus on operators of essential services, is scheduled for an update. Suppliers of utilities, healthcare, transport, communications, and other services need to know what changes are coming and what they need to do to comply.</p>
<p>Since the NIS Directive was adopted in 2016, network and information systems have developed into a central feature of everyday life, driven by digital transformation. This has led to an expansion of the cybersecurity attack surface. In response to these challenges, the proposed NIS 2 Directive repeals and builds on the existing NIS directive.</p>
<p>Join this session with two spokespeople from Duo Security, part of Cisco Secure: Advisory CISO Richard Archdeacon, and Head of Solution Engineering, Andy Mayle, and Mike Small, Senior Analyst at KuppingerCole for a discussion about what changes are coming, why they are being introduced, and how the scope is widening.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/changing-scope-nis2"></a>

 Nuggets and iProov Partner To Bring Biometrically Verified Self-Sovereign Identity and Payments to Web 2 and&nbsp;Web3 <p>The strategic partnership combines Nuggets’ self-sovereign ID with iProov’s biometric face verification, enhancing user privacy and security.</p><p><a href="https://nuggets.life/">Nuggets</a> has integrated with <a href="https://www.iproov.com/why-iproov/the-problem-we-solve/genuine-presence">iProov’s Genuine Presence Assurance®</a> and <a href="https://www.iproov.com/iproov-system/technology/liveness-assurance">Liveness Assurance™</a> technology to ensure compatibility with Self-Sovereign principles and open standards, including W3C Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs).</p><p>The integration enables users to own and control their <a href="https://www.iproov.com/iproov-system/iproov-products-for-biometric-authentication/iproov-face-verifier">biometric template</a>, which can then be used to authenticate transactions using iProov in a private and secure manner. Nuggets have implemented iProov’s technology in conjunction with its own NFC Passport onboarding and re-verification to enable truly trusted transactions.</p><p>This extra step ensures that the user behind an identity is always who it should be, above and beyond the device biometrics. iProov’s Genuine Presence Assurance and Liveness Assurance technologies enable organizations to verify that an online user is the right person and a real&nbsp;person.</p><p>In doing so, Nuggets protects users and businesses by preventing stolen or forged identities from being used for new account fraud and account takeover fraud. iProov’s award-winning technology is device and platform agnostic, working across any computer, tablet, or cellphone with a user-facing camera.</p><p>Driven by emerging regulations such as Europe’s <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0281&amp;from=EN">eIDAS 2.0</a> for Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), the collaboration looks to service the global demand for robust, empowering digital identity services. Increasingly, consumer needs are moving towards self-sovereign, user-controlled digital identities that are reusable, interoperable, decentralized, and powered by blockchain technology.</p><p>There is also a clear demand for such services from direct digital attestation end-users — such as passport offices and driver and vehicle licensing bodies in the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202110/new-mobile-driving-license-initiatives-unveiled-in-europe-and-the-u-s">US, EU</a>, and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dvla-strategic-plan-2021-to-2024/dvla-strategic-plan-2021-to-2024">UK</a>. Along with other civil and private registration services, these organizations highlight the need for increased provision of private and secure digital identities combined with biometric verification across a host of Web2-centric end-user implementations.</p><p>Nuggets’ platform-agnostic, non-custodial identity solution can service this demand, functioning as a reusable, interoperable Self-Sovereign ID (SSI) with a merit-based digital user reputation that travels with the user across Web 2.0, Web3, and Metaverse applications. Nuggets enables trusted transactions, with verified digital identities for every transaction.</p><p>Alastair Johnson, co-founder and CEO of Nuggets, said: “With services increasingly operating within a virtual environment, the need for a reusable and interoperable self-sovereign identity has never been greater. By combining Nuggets and iProov in a Self-Sovereign manner, we enable a high level of biometric verification that is now owned and controlled by the user for the first time. This will bring a new level of privacy, security, and confidence to both users and businesses in markets requiring eIDAS 2.0 (EU), GPG45 (UK), and NIST (USA) in the&nbsp;future.”</p><p>Andrew Bud, Founder and CEO of iProov, said: “We are delighted that iProov’s face biometric verification and authentication technologies have been chosen by Nuggets. It is vital that only the right person should ever be able to control and use their digital wallet, so that user-owned digital identity solutions can be trusted by users and by the organisations that rely on them. This will be of crucial importance as we approach eIDAS 2.0 and the implementation of digital wallets in the UK and throughout the European&nbsp;Union.”</p><p>If you’re a business looking to implement reusable digital identity, and for better ways to protect customer data, you can now enable Nuggets worldwide.</p><p>Get in touch and find out how at <a href="mailto:partners@nuggets.life">partners@nuggets.life</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.nuggets.life/nuggets-and-iproov-partner-to-bring-biometrically-verified-self-sovereign-identity-and-payments-to-b23c03946452">Nuggets and iProov Partner To Bring Biometrically Verified Self-Sovereign Identity and Payments to…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.nuggets.life">Nuggets</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cosmos-db/">Cosmos DB</a> is a cloud database product from Microsoft that offers scalable and high-performance services. The core product runs on a proprietary NoSQL database that should look familiar to experienced MongoDB developers. Microsoft offers several APIs in addition to the core Cosmos DB API. These include APIs for:</p>

 
   SQL 
   MongoDB 
   Gremlin 
   Cassandra 
 

<p>The shift to serverless database operations is one of the most obvious advantages of migrating. Cosmos DB can automatically scale your throughput based on load, rather than the traditional provisioning of throughput in advance.</p>

<p>As developers, we need to be mindful of how we can protect data at rest. In this article, you will learn how Cosmos DB helps to protect data at rest and what you can do to remove sensitive data like personally identifiable information (PII) from data that you intend to store in Cosmos DB.</p>

 A secure application for PII 

<p>One of my first jobs in development was writing applications that would perform a <code>scrubbing</code> process on personal data coming from clients. Effectively we would receive data that included the person’s name, social security number, and address. This data would then be sent out for verification to a consumer reporting corporation,  and that company would return a result letting us know if the address was current and if the information we’d received was correct. Once the data returned we could import the result into our software and if the scrub came back successful then the account was a valid contact.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you will do the same process. You will build an ASP.NET Core web application on .NET 6 that accepts a CSV file with a person’s name and social security number. You will send that to a dummy scrub service. Then you will record the results in a Cosmos DB account. But the word has come from your boss that you cannot store the social security number. So you will learn how to remove that information from your data model before storing it in Cosmos DB.</p>

<p>To continue you will need:</p>

 
   <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/">Visual Studio 2022</a> 
   <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0">.NET 6</a> 
   An <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup">free Okta Developer Account</a> (to handle your OAuth needs) 
   <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> 
   An <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/">Azure account with a subscription</a> 
 

<p>Of course, if you just want to see the code feel free <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta_dotnet_cosmosdb_example">to view it on Github</a>.</p>

 Cosmos DB overview 

<p>Like most Platform as a Service (PaaS) offerings, Cosmos DB provides many features for security and performance. There are too many to list here. Finding the documentation on Microsoft’s endless labyrinth of docs is challenging enough. But I do want to touch on a few highlights.</p>

<p>First, as a PaaS, Microsoft takes responsibility for network controls, host infrastructure, and physical security. They share application-level controls and identity access with you as well as the data classification. Endpoint protection is your responsibility.</p>

<p>It is important to note though that <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/faq#:~:text=Is%20Azure%20Cosmos%20DB%20HIPAA,of%20individually%20identifiable%20health%20information">Azure is HIPPA compliant</a>. Ultimately, the data that you choose to store is your responsibility and subject to laws and regulations that are out of scope for this article.</p>

<p>You should also take a moment to familiarize yourself with the Cosmos DB resource model. I won’t go into it too deeply here, but the short version is that a <code>database account</code> owns a <code>database</code>. The <code>database</code> contains <code>containers</code>. <code>Containers</code> can contain <code>items</code>, <code>stored procedures</code>, <code>triggers</code>, and other objects. In this tutorial, you will create the database account on the Azure portal, but you will create the database, container, and items from your web application.</p>

<p>The last thing I want to mention is that different Cosmos DB APIs have different methods for removing or encrypting data. In this tutorial, you will work with the core Cosmos DB API, but I encourage you to explore the other APIs.</p>

 Create your Okta application 

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>

<p>Select ASP.NET Core. 
    Then, change the Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:5001/authorization-code/callback</code> and use <code>http://localhost:5001/signout/callback</code> for the Logout Redirect URI.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that the TCP port 5001 must be the same used by the application. You can see it in the messages displayed in the terminal when you start the application with <code>dotnet run</code>.</p>
</blockquote>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>

   <code>export OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER="https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID="0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET="NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS"
</code>   

<p>Your Okta domain is the first part of your issuer, before <code>/oauth2/default</code>.</p>

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/aspnetcore3/create-okta-application/">Create a ASP.NET Core App</a> for more information.</p>



 Create a Cosmos DB account 

<p>As I mentioned before, the logic for creating your database, container, and items will be in your application. However, you do need to create a database account to connect to.</p>

<p>Navigate to <a href="https://portal.azure.com">the Azure portal</a> and select Create a resource. Search for <code>Azure Cosmos DB</code> and select the option. Follow the prompt and select Create on the Azure Cosmos DB marketing page.</p>

<p>Next, you will see a page asking which API best suits your workload. Find Core (SQL) - Recommended and press Create.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The Create Azure Cosmos DB Account - Core (SQL) page provides the details about your subscription and resource group. Make sure you select <code>Apply</code> under the Apply Free Tier Discount then press Review + create.</p>

<p></p>

 Create your web application 

<p>Now you can turn your attention toward creating your web application. Open Visual Studio and press Create a new project. Find the template for ASP.NET Core Web App (Model-View-Controller) and press Next. Name your application <code>Okta_CosmosDb</code> and press Next. Finally, select .NET 6.0 (Long-term support) from your framework and press Create. Allow Visual Studio a moment to scaffold the project.</p>

<p>Next, you can install the two packages you will need in your project.</p>

   <code>Install-Package Okta.AspNetCore -Version 4.1.0
Install-Package Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos -Version 3.26.1
</code>   

<p><code>Okta.AspNetCore</code> will do all the heavy lifting of connecting your web application to Okta using middleware provided by Okta. This package will just require a quick configuration using the values output to <code>.okta.env</code> from your application set up earlier.</p>

<p><code>Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos</code> provides the core libraries for accessing the Cosmos DB API. You will use this package to create your database, add a container to it, and insert items into the container.</p>

<p>Next, open <code>appsettings.Development.json</code> and replace the code there with the following.</p>

 <code>{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "Okta": {
    "ClientId": "{yourClientId}",
    "Domain": "{yourOktaDomain}",
    "ClientSecret": "{yourClientSecret}"
  },
  "CosmosDb": {
    "Account": "{yourCosmosDbUri}",
    "Key": "{yourCosmosDbPrimaryKey}",
    "DatabaseName": "oktacosmos",
    "ContainerName": "Results"
  }
}
</code> 

<p>You can find the Okta values in <code>.okta.env</code> produced by the CLI when you initialized your Okta application. To find your Cosmos values, navigate to your Cosmos DB account page and open the <code>Settings &gt; Keys</code> tab. Here you will find the <code>URI</code>, <code>PRIMARY KEY</code>, and other values you may need down the line.</p>

<p>Next, replace the code in <code>Program.cs</code> with the following.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect;
using Okta.AspNetCore;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add services to the container.
builder.Services.AddControllersWithViews();

builder.Services.ConfigureApplicationCookie(options =&gt;
{
    options.Cookie.HttpOnly = true;
    options.Cookie.SecurePolicy = Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.CookieSecurePolicy.Always;
})
.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
{
    options.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
})
.AddCookie()
.AddOktaMvc(new OktaMvcOptions
{
    // Replace these values with your Okta configuration
    OktaDomain = builder.Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:Domain"),
    ClientId = builder.Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:ClientId"),
    ClientSecret = builder.Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:ClientSecret"),
    Scope = new List&lt;string&gt; { "openid", "profile", "email" },
    PostLogoutRedirectUri = "/"
});

builder.Services.AddScoped&lt;Okta_CosmosDb.Services.IScrubService, Okta_CosmosDb.Services.ScrubService&gt;();
builder.Services.AddSingleton&lt;Okta_CosmosDb.Services.ICosmosService&gt;(Okta_CosmosDb.Services.CosmosService.InitializeCosmosClientInstanceAsync(builder.Configuration.GetSection("CosmosDb")).GetAwaiter().GetResult());

var app = builder.Build();

// Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
if (!app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
    // The default HSTS value is 30 days. You may want to change this for production scenarios, see https://aka.ms/aspnetcore-hsts.
    app.UseHsts();
}

app.UseHttpsRedirection();
app.UseStaticFiles();

app.UseRouting();

app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();

app.MapControllerRoute(
    name: "default",
    pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");

app.Run();
</code>   

<p>Much of this code is boilerplate from the Visual Studio scaffolding process but you are adding a few extra items.</p>

<p>First, you need to configure your authentication to use <code>AddOktaMvc</code> and provide the configuration values from your <code>appsettings</code> file.</p>

<p>Next, you are setting up the dependency injection for a couple of custom services that you will write soon. These are the <code>IScrubService</code>, which will handle your scrubbing process, and the <code>ICosmosService</code>, which will handle communication to your Cosmos DB account.</p>

<p>Finally, you are calling <code>InitializeCosmosClientInstanceAsync</code>, which will set up your database and container if they do not exist. Then it will return the <code>CosmosService</code> as a singleton.</p>

 Create your application services 

<p>Create a new folder in the project root and name it <code>Services</code>. You will add the following four files to this directory.</p>

 
   <code>ICosmosService.cs</code> 
   <code>CosmosService.cs</code> 
   <code>IScrubService.cs</code> 
   <code>ScrubService.cs</code> 
 

<p>Start by replacing the code in the two interfaces. First, replace the code in <code>ICosmosService.cs</code> with the following.</p>

   <code>namespace Okta_CosmosDb.Services
{
    public interface ICosmosService
    {
        Task SaveResultAsync(Models.ScrubResult result);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Next, replace the code in <code>IScrubService.cs</code> with the code below.</p>

   <code>namespace Okta_CosmosDb.Services
{
    public interface IScrubService
    {
        Task&lt;Models.ScrubResult&gt; ScrubAsync(Models.Person person);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Now you can implement these interfaces in their respective classes. First, open <code>CosmosService.cs</code> and update the code there with the code below.</p>

   <code>using Okta_CosmosDb.Models;
using Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos;

namespace Okta_CosmosDb.Services
{
    public class CosmosService : ICosmosService
    {
        private Container _container; 
        
        public CosmosService(
            CosmosClient dbClient,
            string databaseName,
            string containerName)
        {
            this._container = dbClient.GetContainer(databaseName, containerName);
        }

        /// &lt;summary&gt;
        /// Creates a Cosmos DB database and a container with the specified partition key. 
        /// &lt;/summary&gt;
        /// &lt;returns&gt;&lt;/returns&gt;
        public static async Task&lt;CosmosService&gt; InitializeCosmosClientInstanceAsync(IConfigurationSection configurationSection)
        {
            string databaseName = configurationSection.GetSection("DatabaseName").Value;
            string containerName = configurationSection.GetSection("ContainerName").Value;
            string account = configurationSection.GetSection("Account").Value;
            string key = configurationSection.GetSection("Key").Value;

            CosmosClient client = new CosmosClient(account, key);
            CosmosService cosmosDbService = new CosmosService(client, databaseName, containerName);
            DatabaseResponse database = await client.CreateDatabaseIfNotExistsAsync(databaseName);
            await database.Database.CreateContainerIfNotExistsAsync(containerName, "/id");

            return cosmosDbService;
        }

        public async Task SaveResultAsync(ScrubResult result)
        {
            await this._container.CreateItemAsync&lt;ScrubResult&gt;(result, new PartitionKey(result.Id));
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>This service does two tasks. First, it stores data in Cosmos DB using the <code>SaveResultAsync</code> method. This simply calls the container you are operating on and creates an item in that container.</p>

<p>This class also contains the static <code>InitializeCosmosClientInstanceAsync</code> method, which your <code>Program.cs</code> called to return the service. Anytime you attempt to access an <code>ICosmosService</code> your application will return a singleton using this method. This method will ensure your database and your container are created before passing the instance of the <code>CosmosService</code> to the consumer to be used.</p>

<p>Next open <code>ScrubService.cs</code> and replace the code there with this implementation.</p>

   <code>using Okta_CosmosDb.Models;

namespace Okta_CosmosDb.Services
{
    public class ScrubService : IScrubService
    {
        public async Task&lt;ScrubResult&gt; ScrubAsync(Person person)
        {
            var task = Task.Run(() =&gt; { return new ScrubResult(person, new Random().Next(2) == 0); });
            return await task;
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>This class serves to mock a true scrub service. The method here is <code>async</code> because in a real-world environment that would be the case, but since you are just mocking the service you can wrap the login in <code>Task.Run</code> to simulate an <code>async</code> method.</p>

 Create your models 

<p>Next, you will need a couple of data models to facilitate your views and to pass in your application. In your <code>Models</code> folder add a file for <code>ScrubResult.cs</code> and add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>using Newtonsoft.Json;

namespace Okta_CosmosDb.Models
{
    public class ScrubResult
    {
        [JsonProperty(PropertyName = "id")]
        public string Id { get; set; }

        [JsonProperty(PropertyName = "person")]
        public Person Person { get; set; }

        [JsonProperty(PropertyName = "success")]
        public bool Success { get; set; }

        public ScrubResult(Person person, bool success)
        {
            Person = person;
            Success = success;
            Id = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Now add the file and code for <code>Person.cs</code> in your <code>Models</code> folder.</p>

   <code>using Newtonsoft.Json;

namespace Okta_CosmosDb.Models
{
    public class Person
    {
        public string Name { get; set; }

        [JsonIgnore]
        public string SSN { get; set; }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>There are a couple of things going on here that you should understand. First, you are going to store the <code>ScrubResult</code> object in your Cosmos database. Each property is explicitly given a name using the <code>JsonProperty</code> attribute, however you do not need to do this. You do need a field called <code>id</code>.  The <code>JsonProperty</code> attribute helps keep your C# code consistently <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/pascalcase">Pascal case</a> while keeping your Cosmos DB property names camel case.</p>

<p>The real kicker here is that the API is using the <code>Newtonsoft.Json</code> package to serialize the objects into JSON strings. This means you can use any of the features that come with the Newtonsoft package to manipulate your data. This is what you did on the <code>Person</code> object where you use the <code>JsonIgnore</code> attribute to hide the SSN.</p>

<p>While <code>JsonIgnore</code> is the simplest way to remove the SSN from this object, there are many other approaches. You could even create a custom attribute using the <code>Newtonsoft.Json.Serialization.DefaultContractResolver</code>, and hash, encrypt, or otherwise translate the field into something less sensitive.</p>

 Add the controller logic 

<p>Now you can add your controller logic to your application.</p>

<p>Start by adding a class to your <code>Controllers</code> directory named <code>ImportController.cs</code>. Replace the code with the following.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;

namespace Okta_CosmosDb.Controllers
{
    [Authorize]
    public class ImportController : Controller
    {
        Services.IScrubService _scrubService;
        Services.ICosmosService _cosmosService;

        public ImportController(
            Services.IScrubService scrubService,
            Services.ICosmosService cosmosService
            )
        {
            _scrubService = scrubService;
            _cosmosService = cosmosService;
        }

        public IActionResult Index()
        {
            return View();
        }

        [HttpPost]
        public IActionResult Upload(IFormFile csvFile)
        {
            List&lt;Models.Person&gt; persons = new List&lt;Models.Person&gt;();

            using (var stream = csvFile.OpenReadStream())
            using (StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(stream))
            {
                while (!sr.EndOfStream)
                {
                    string[] rows = sr.ReadToEnd().Split(Environment.NewLine);          
                    
                    for(int i =0; i &lt; rows.Length; i++)
                    {
                       if(i == 0)
                        {
                            //header row
                            continue;
                        }

                        var row = rows[i].Split(',');

                        persons.Add(new Models.Person()
                        {
                            Name = row[0],
                            SSN = row[1]
                        });
                    }
                }
            }

            List&lt;Models.ScrubResult&gt; results = new List&lt;Models.ScrubResult&gt;();

            foreach(var person in persons)
            {
                results.Add(_scrubService.Scrub(person));
            }

            foreach(var result in results)
            {
                _cosmosService.SaveResultAsync(result);
            }

            return View(results);
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>This controller will serve as a view for the import page. It will also accept a CSV file, convert the file into a list of <code>Person</code> objects, and then run the scrub process against each person. Once the scrub process is complete it will save the results to your Cosmos DB account using the database you set up earlier.</p>

<p>Next, you will want a controller for logging users in and out. Add a controller called <code>AccountController.cs</code> and replace the code with the following.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Okta.AspNetCore;

namespace Okta_CosmosDb.Controllers
{
    public class AccountController : Controller
    {
        public IActionResult SignIn()
        {
            if (!(HttpContext.User?.Identity?.IsAuthenticated ?? false))
            {
                return Challenge(OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme);
            }

            return RedirectToAction("Index", "Import");
        }

        [HttpPost]
        public IActionResult SignOut()
        {
            return new SignOutResult(new[] { OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme,
                                         CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme });
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>This controller contains methods for <code>SignIn</code> and <code>SignOut</code> implemented per Okta’s recommendation.</p>

<p>Finally, replace the code in <code>HomeController.cs</code> with the code below.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Okta_CosmosDb.Models;
using System.Diagnostics;

namespace Okta_CosmosDb.Controllers
{
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        private readonly ILogger&lt;HomeController&gt; _logger;

        public HomeController(ILogger&lt;HomeController&gt; logger)
        {
            _logger = logger;
        }

        public IActionResult Index()
        {
            if ((User?.Identity?.IsAuthenticated ?? false))
                return RedirectToAction("Index", "Import");

            return View();
        }

        [ResponseCache(Duration = 0, Location = ResponseCacheLocation.None, NoStore = true)]
        public IActionResult Error()
        {
            return View(new ErrorViewModel { RequestId = Activity.Current?.Id ?? HttpContext.TraceIdentifier });
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Here you have the <code>Index</code> method but the logic is replaced to redirect authenticated users to the Import screen.</p>

 Add and edit your views 

<p>The first view to edit is the <code>_Layout.cshtml</code> in your <code>Views/Shared</code> folder.</p>

   <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;

                        &lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;/ul&gt;
                    @if ((User?.Identity?.IsAuthenticated ?? false))

                        &lt;/form&gt;
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        &lt;a href="Account/SignIn" class="btn btn-primary my-2 my-sm-0"&gt;Login&lt;/a&gt;
                    }

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/nav&gt;
    &lt;/header&gt;

        &lt;/main&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;footer class="border-top footer text-muted"&gt;
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;

    &lt;script src="~/lib/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="~/lib/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="~/js/site.js" asp-append-version="true"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    @await RenderSectionAsync("Scripts", required: false)
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>Most of the boilerplate layout is fine but it doesn’t include <code>Login</code> or <code>Logout</code> buttons. You added these to the navbar and displayed the appropriate one based on the user’s authentication status.</p>

<p>Next, replace the <code>Home\Index.cshtml</code> code with the following.</p>
   <code>@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Home Page";
}

&lt;div class="text-center"&gt;
    A small tutorial on protecting PII in Microsoft's &lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cosmos-db/"&gt; Azure Cosmos DB&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;br /&gt;Secured by &lt;a href="https://www.okta.com/free-trial/"&gt;Okta.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
    Written by &lt;a href="https://github.com/nickolasfisher"&gt; Nik Fisher.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>This is just a little home page with some information about the tutorial.</p>

<p>Finally, create a new folder (if one wasn’t created already) for <code>Import</code> in your <code>Views</code> folder. Add a file called <code>Index.cshtml</code> with the following code.</p>

   <code>@(ViewData["Title"] = "Import Clients")

&lt;form method="POST" asp-controller="Import" asp-action="Upload" enctype="multipart/form-data"&gt;
    &lt;input type="file" name="csvFile" class="btn-outline-primary btn" /&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit" class="btn btn-primary" value="Import" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code>   

<p>This simple page provides an opportunity for the user to import a CSV file and submit it to the server.</p>

<p>Next, add a file for <code>Upload.cshtml</code> that will display the results as they come back.</p>

   <code>@model List&lt;Okta_CosmosDb.Models.ScrubResult&gt;
@(ViewData["Title"] = "Scrub Results")

&lt;table class="table table-bordered"&gt;
    &lt;thead&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;Result&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/thead&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
        @foreach (var result in Model)
        {
            &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;@result.Person.Name&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;@result.Success&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;
        }
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code>   

 Test your application locally 

<p>With your application complete you can now start debugging. You should be greeted with the home screen.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click on Login and follow the login page to Okta and then back to your import page. Download the <a href="https://github.com/nickolasfisher/Okta_Cosmos/blob/master/Okta_CosmosDb/TestData/SampleFile.csv">CSV File found here</a> and upload this to your server using the application page.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Your application will then process this file and save the results to Cosmos DB. You can navigate to your Cosmos DB portal using the <code>Data Explorer</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You will note that the social security number does not appear in the data you sent to Cosmos DB.</p>

 Conclusions 

<p>As developers, we always need to be thinking about protecting users’ data. The rise of PaaS and SaaS platforms has decreased risk when used properly. But along with these new platforms, we must make sure we use best practices and keep an attentive eye on the data we choose to retain.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you learned how to store data in Cosmos DB from an ASP.NET Core application. You learned how to set up your Cosmos DB account and how to set up your application to create databases and containers to store your items. Finally, you used the JSON functionality to remove sensitive data from your data model before storing it.</p>

 Veriscope Weekly Regulatory Recap (June 6 — June&nbsp;10)  A quick review of past week’s most important news and updates on crypto regulation. <p>Welcome to the second edition of Veriscope’s Weekly Regulatory Recap. Amid the current crypto market turmoil, the regulatory landscape is heating up even further. So, let’s dive straight into it. We hope you enjoy&nbsp;it.</p><p>Also, don’t forget to subscribe to our weekly recap post, comment, and&nbsp;share!</p> Japan may Soon Approve a Proposal to Seize Stolen Virtual&nbsp;Assets <p>With the crypto space experiencing considerable growth, the number of hacking-related too experienced an uptick. Reports suggest that crypto thefts amounted to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/06/crypto-scammers-took-a-record-14-billion-in-2021-chainalysis.html">$14 billion</a> in 2021 compared to $3.2 billion in&nbsp;2020.</p><p>Japan, one of the most important markets in the crypto world, is among the most-affected countries in terms of crypto hacks. For example, Liquid, a Japanese crypto exchange, lost <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58277359">$100 million</a> to hackers in mid-2021.</p><p>Despite increasing incidents of crypto-related hacks, there are no laws that empower Japanese authorities to seize stolen digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Well, that is about to change, as per Nippon, a local media outlet. <a href="https://www.nippon.com/en/news/yjj2022060600835/japan-may-revise-law-to-seize-illegally-gained-crypto-assets.html">Nippon reported</a> that Japan’s Ministry of Justice is contemplating approving a proposal to confiscate stolen digital&nbsp;assets.</p> US Senators Kirsten Gillibrand &amp; Cynthia Lummis Unveiled the “Responsible Financial Innovation Act” Aimed at Regulating Digital&nbsp;Assets <p>After a long wait, two US Senators, Kirsten Gillibrand &amp; Cynthia Lummis, have finally introduced a bill to regulate digital assets in the country. Officially titled “Responsible Financial Innovation Act” or “Lummis-Gillibrand,” the bill was announced by Senator Gillibrand through a press&nbsp;release.</p><p>Senator Gillibrand believes the “Responsible Financial Innovation Act” will bring the same success at the federal level that her home state, Wyoming, has experienced, thanks to its crypto-friendly approach.</p><p>The bill has a lot in the store for the nascent crypto space. For instance, if the bill comes into force, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission will become the go-to authority of virtual currencies. It will also make it easier to identify the digital assets that are securities and the ones that are commodities.</p><p>Stablecoins, too, will be brought within the regulatory net. The bill states that stablecoin issuers must meet strict reserve requirements before issuing the asset-backed digital assets. <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/us-senators-kirsten-gillibrand-cynthia-lummis-introduces-the-responsible-financial-innovation-e75c238bacbb?source=user_profile---------1----------------------------">Click here</a> to read more about what aspects are covered under the Lummis-Gillibrand bill.</p> Lithuania to Crack Down on Digital Assets, Will ban Anonymous Accounts <p>To prevent misuse of Lithuania’s lax regulations around digital assets, the country’s various ministries came together to approve the legal amendment to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) provisions, as <a href="https://finmin.lrv.lt/lt/naujienos/kriptoturto-sektoriuje-skaidruma-didinantys-istatymo-pakeitimai">announced</a> by the Ministry of&nbsp;Finance.</p><p>Once approved, it will effectively outlaw anonymous accounts and further strengthen the user identification mechanism. The bill will also implement strong regulatory requirements for cryptocurrency exchanges.</p><p>For instance, the company operating the crypto exchange must have a minimum capital of €125000. And the company’s senior executive management must only consist of Lithuanian citizens.</p> South Korean Exchanges may Soon Have to Comply With Guidelines for Listing &amp; Delisting of Digital&nbsp;Assets <p>The Terra-Luna debacle initiated a chain of regulatory events worldwide, especially in South Korea. First, the country announced that it would establish a new regulatory body to oversee the digital assets&nbsp;market.</p><p>Now, <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/south-korea-eyes-guidelines-for-crypto-bourses-after-terra-crash-1.1775883">reports</a> indicate that South Korean authorities have asked crypto exchanges to prepare guidelines on the listing &amp; delisting of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Yun Chang-Hyun, a South Korean Lawmaker from the virtual assets committee, has called for a second meeting with Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax, the top-most crypto exchanges in the country. The main theme of the discussion would be the guidelines.</p><p>Although the crypto market is experiencing a downturn at the moment, the regulators are in no mood to let the nascent industry stay outside of the regulatory framework any longer. Thus, country after country is coming up with regulations to ensure that sanctioned individuals and entities do not turn to digital assets to circumvent the sanctions.</p><p>Thus, now is the right time to begin complying with the current regulations, if you haven’t already. It will enable you to stay clear of any possible violations now or in the future. Start with FATF’s Travel Rule, as it is the most significant piece of global regulation around digital assets&nbsp;today.</p><p>You will need a robust Travel Rule Service Provider (TRSP) to begin complying with the rule.

<p>On June 15th, starting &nbsp;from 10:am (CET), InfoCert will take part in one of biggest international virtual conference about eIDAS regulation, hosted by Bitkom the Germany’s digital association who represent more than 2,000 companies of the digital economy.</p>



<p>Daniele Citterio – InfoCert Chief Technology Officer – is taking a speech during the international stage at 3:35 pm, about the topic: “Growing decentralized identity ecosystem before the EIDAS2 revolution”.</p>



<p>The future is already here and about that, during his presentation, Mr Citterio will talk about <a>Dizme:</a> the blockchain technology-based App that promotes Self Sovereign Identity principles for distributed management of personal identity and information. Dizme allows all to create an ecosystem in which the anyone become the true “owner” of his proper digital identity.</p>



<p>Thanks to the participation of an InfoCert guest: Goran Stojadinovic – Enterprise Sales (B2B) and ICT Solutions Director @ A1 Serbia; there will be a pratical demonstration of how Dizme decentralized identity ecosystem empowered A1 Serbia to kick off a new business model.</p>



 Digital Identities &amp; ID Wallet 



<p>How is it possible to digitise your ID and wallet? And what potential do digital identities hold for the industry? The ID Wallet is a digital wallet for self-managed identities to identify yourself online and offline – but without cards and papers – for example at the hotel check-in or to proof your driver’s license. At the eIDAS Summit we will discuss what the ID wallet looks like, what it can do, and which chances and challenges are associated with the topic of digital identity.</p>



 Fill the gap between Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and eIDAS compliance. 



<p>Dizme is the first decentralized identity network that combines the benefits of the SSI world as well as the compliance to eIDAS regulation perimeter. Organizations rely on exchanging information with customers, suppliers, partners, employees, and many others, but verifying and certifying identity and data needs investments, takes time, and exposes the company to the risk of fraud.</p>

<p>Would you like to fully process your contracts electronically, eliminate paper-based work and optimize your business processes with digital identities? Get to know the eIDAS regulation! On 15 June 2022, you will have the opportunity to discover the novel application of digital trust and identity in business.</p>

 Let’s take a look at OceanONDA V4 Market and how to publish your first data&nbsp;NFT <p>OceanONDA V4 has brought a whole host of awesome new upgrades — data NFTs, Safer Staking, and a lot more flexibility in setting fees when running your own data marketplace. For most of us, we’ll be interacting with these updates through Ocean Market — so let’s take a look at what’s new. In this article, we’ll summarize some of the main changes in the market and then run you through a step-by-step guide on how to publish your first data&nbsp;NFT.</p><p>A lot of the changes in the V4 version of Ocean Market are based around the introduction of data NFTs, so before we get onto the details, let’s quickly ask — what is a data NFT? A data NFT is the representation of the intellectual property on-chain, we call this the base-IP. Data NFTs sit in your wallet, just like any other NFT, and they can be transferred directly from your wallet, meaning that you’re now able to sell or transfer your base-IP on-chain. You can also make use of all the awesome NFT tools in the rapidly growing NFT ecosystem — there are so many possibilities to&nbsp;explore.</p><p>If you’re looking for some more detail on how all the V4 updates work, we would highly recommend reading the following articles that we’ve recently published:</p>  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/what-is-a-data-nft-5804a2d88671">What is a data&nbsp;NFT?</a>  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/how-to-make-money-from-ocean-v4-477b3decad51">How to make money from OceanONDA V4</a>  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-v4-one-sided-staking-93988f65e378">One-sided staking blog&nbsp;post</a>   So what’s&nbsp;new? <p>The headline news is all about data NFTs and we’re very excited to show you how to publish your first one — but let’s first look at the changes in Ocean Market V4. We have a cool new publish flow, changes to how the pools work, updates to the asset detail page, and an awesome NFT image generator.</p> New publish&nbsp;flow <p>Ocean V4 was always going to be a serious upgrade and we felt it would be fitting to give serious consideration to how we could make a new publish form that was suitable for the new journey — publishing a data&nbsp;NFT.</p><p>If you’re thinking publishing an NFT must be super complicated — you’re in for a nice surprise, we’ve got a new wizard-style form that makes it fabulously easy. The whole process, including setting up pricing, is simplified down to 5 steps. It also gives you the opportunity to review everything that you’ve entered, so you can make sure you’re happy before you start signing transactions.</p><p>We’ll take you a more detailed look at the publish form in the step-by-step guide&nbsp;below.</p> Data NFT Image Generator <p>We know how cool it is when you can see the unique visualization of an NFT in your wallet and we felt like it was really crucial to include this in the new V4 version of Ocean Market. We’re giving you the opportunity to choose your image within the publish form — keep clicking refresh and see the alternative styles, it’s fun to play around with. This image will forever remain associated with the data NFT so make sure you’re happy with it before proceeding.</p><p>The SVG generator was developed from the ground up for Ocean Market V4. We have our friends at <a href="https://www.delta-dao.com/">Delta DAO</a> to thank for all the hard work they put into this great feature, they did an awesome&nbsp;job.</p> Data NFT image on Asset&nbsp;Page <p>What’s the point of having these cool Ocean wave pictures if you can’t see them anywhere? Well, we wouldn’t miss out on that opportunity — we’ve got them displayed in prime position on the asset page. This is a nice detail that adds an individual touch to each&nbsp;page.</p> Updates to the pool&nbsp;tab <p>If you’ve been keeping up with all the OceanONDA V4 updates, you will have heard of our one-sided staking improvements that make it safer to contribute liquidity to pools — no more need to worry about rug pulls. This is one of the upgrades that we’re most proud&nbsp;of.</p><p>Essentially, we have introduced a one-sided staking bot that ensures that the ratio of base tokens (e.g. Ocean Tokens) to datatokens in each pool is always kept in balance. When you add liquidity to the pool, the one-sided staking bot will mint datatokens and add them to the pool to match your additional liquidity. Alternatively, if you remove your liquidity, the one-sided staking bot will burn the equivalent number of datatokens to keep the ratio in the pool unchanged. It’s a fantastic solution to a serious problem — we don’t like seeing people losing money to rug-pulls.</p><p>Now, as you can imagine, all of that clever logic sits in the smart contracts so the changes here in the market are more subtle. Our goal here was to remove any unnecessary figures and make it all a lot clearer. We’ve simplified the views of liquidity and total value locked so that it only shows the number of Ocean tokens in the pool — that’s the only token you add after&nbsp;all.</p> How to publish your first data&nbsp;NFT <p>So now, let’s run through the process of publishing your first data NFT. There are a few things that you will need before you’re able to&nbsp;proceed.</p><p>Firstly, you will need a dataset — for the purpose of following along with this guide it’s perfectly fine to give it a go with a test dataset. There are a bunch of example csv files <a href="https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv/csv.html">here</a>. However, it’s good to start thinking about what data you might like to try and sell, possibly you have something in mind already or maybe you have lots of data but aren’t sure what’s valuable.</p><p>Next up, you’ll need a browser wallet (we recommend <a href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a>), some Ether and some OCEAN tokens. Now if any of that sounds unfamiliar we’d recommend taking a quick look at these guides on our&nbsp;docs:</p>  <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/wallets/">Wallet Basics</a>  <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/metamask-setup/">Set Up MetaMask&nbsp;Wallet</a>  <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/wallets-and-ocean-tokens/">Use Your Wallet to Manage OCEAN&nbsp;Tokens</a>  <p>To keep things simple (and free) we suggest publishing on the Rinkeby testnet for the first couple of times while you get used to the process. You can get 1000 free Ocean Tokens on Rinkeby from our <a href="https://faucet.rinkeby.oceanprotocol.com/">faucet</a>. And if you need some Ether on Rinkeby you can get that from the <a href="https://faucet.rinkeby.io/">Rinkeby&nbsp;Faucet</a>.</p> Step 1 — Connect your&nbsp;wallet <p>This first step is the same as it was in our V3 version of Ocean Market. You need to start by connecting your wallet. This is essentially the equivalent of logging into a traditional (Web2) application.</p><p>In the top right corner, you’ll see the button that says “Connect Wallet”. If you click that it will give you three different options — you’ll want to select MetaMask (assuming that’s the wallet you’re&nbsp;using).</p><p>You’ll now get a pop-up from MetaMask asking you if you would like to connect your account, you can click next and proceed to connect your&nbsp;account.</p> Step 2 — Setting the&nbsp;Metadata <p>At this point, you’re ready to get started with filling out the publish form, so click on the “publish” link at the top navigation if you haven’t done so already. Here you can see the cool new wizard-style form that we mentioned above.</p><p>This first tab on the publish form is all about the metadata for your data asset, so you’ll need to give it a title and description. This section of the form also asks for the author and tags (these help people discover and search for your data&nbsp;asset).</p><p>This is also the part of the form where you get to play around with our fun new SVG generator to select the image that you would like to represent your data&nbsp;NFT.</p> Step 2 — Defining the&nbsp;Access <p>Now, on the second page of the form, you’ll have to make an important decision about how you would like people to be able to access your data. You’ve got two options here — “download” or “compute”. Providing “download” access is the most straightforward, it’s exactly as it sounds — people will be able to download the dataset and have access to the raw data. This will be great for many situations but if your data is super sensitive and you don’t want people to be able to see the raw data then you’ll be better off choosing “compute”.</p><p>If you choose to provide “compute” access, it means that users will be able to run algorithms on your dataset behind a firewall but they will never gain access to the raw data. We call this model “compute-to-data” and it’s one of the features that make Ocean unique. If you’re interested in learning more about compute-to-data then we’d recommend reading our docs, where we’ve got a bunch of useful&nbsp;guides:</p>  <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/compute-to-data-architecture/">Compute-to-data architecture overview</a>  <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/compute-to-data-minikube/">Running a Compute-to-Data Environment</a>  <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/compute-to-data-algorithms/">Writing Algorithms for Compute to&nbsp;Data</a>  <p>On this page, you’ll also have to enter the URL where your dataset is hosted. You can host your dataset on any centralized or decentralized storage provider — it could be stored anywhere from an on-premise server to IPFS. All that’s required is that there is a URL where it is possible to access the dataset. We often get asked questions like “What’s the maximum file size?” or “What file types are accepted?” — we don’t handle the hosting of the data, so we don’t impose any limitations here. The maintenance and hosting of the dataset are your responsibility.</p><p>You’ll also notice that there is a field for inputting a sample dataset, this could be a subset of the actual dataset or a sample file that replicates the same format. This can be very useful for customers who wish to gain a better understanding of the data that you’re selling before they make a purchase.</p><p>This is also the stage where you can select the datatoken name and symbol. The datatoken is the token on the blockchain that grants access to your dataset — consumers have to purchase the datatoken to access the dataset. The name of the datatoken doesn’t really matter, it’s just important it’s unique, so it’s fine to keep the default or click refresh a couple of times until you see something you&nbsp;like.</p><p>The last field on this page is the timeout. You can decide how long you would like users to have access to the dataset after their initial purchase by choosing the timeout. If you’re constantly updating your dataset you may wish to have a shorter timeout so that customers come back to purchase the latest&nbsp;copy.</p> Step 3 — Creating&nbsp;Pricing <p>At this point, we’re almost done. You now need to turn our attention to how the asset will be priced. You’ve got three options here: dynamic pricing, fixed pricing, and free! It is important to think carefully about which one is appropriate for your data asset. Once you set the pricing type you will not be able to change it, although you will still be able to change the&nbsp;price.</p><p>Let’s take a look at each&nbsp;one:</p> Fixed pricing <p>Fixed pricing is fairly self-explanatory, you set the price and that’s what customers pay to access your data. You can change the price at any time and customers will always have to pay the amount that you&nbsp;set.</p> Dynamic pricing <p>Dynamic pricing is a little more complicated as the price is determined by an automated version of an order book. This concept is called an Automated Market Maker (AMM). Under the hood, Ocean uses a modified version of the <a href="https://balancer.fi/">Balancer</a> AMM&nbsp;pools.</p><p>If you would like to create dynamic pricing you will need to provide OCEAN tokens as liquidity to start the AMM pool. The price that the customer pays is set by the ratio of OCEAN tokens to datatokens within the pool. As more people purchase the datatokens, the ratio changes and the price increases.</p><p>Anyone can add liquidity to the pool you have created, they are known as liquidity providers. Liquidity providers earn a share of the transaction fees when the datatoken is purchased, this acts as an incentive for them to provide liquidity.</p><p>Free!</p><p>This is a new option available in the V4 market — you can offer your datasets for free, although gas fees still apply. We had a bunch of requests for the free pricing option, and it was already in use in some forks of the V3 market, so we decided to include it in the V4 version of Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p> Step 4 — Preview and&nbsp;Review <p>There were quite a few steps there so you might want to double-check that you’re happy with everything that you inputted. We’ve added a handy preview page so that you can review everything before you start signing any of the transactions.</p> Step 5 — Submit and Sign Transactions <p>We pushed ourselves to make the submitting process a lot more user-friendly here. We’ve added information on how many transactions you need to sign and an explanation of what each one is&nbsp;for.</p><p>After clicking submit. presented with a series of MetaMask pops. There are three transactions that you need to sign: creating the pricing, minting the datatokens, and then allowing Ocean Market to use them (i.e. selling them on your&nbsp;behalf).</p><p>Once you have confirmed each of these transactions you will see the success message. Your dataset has now been published and you’ll be able to see it for sale in Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p> All done! <p>We have covered a lot in this article so kudos for making it all the way to the end. We’ve looked at some of the cool new features in the V4 version of Ocean Market and run through step by step on how to publish your first data&nbsp;NFT.</p><p>Hopefully, you see now that publishing a data NFT is a straightforward process. No technical knowledge is required and the new publish form is easier to follow in many ways than the previous one. We can’t wait to see all of the interesting datasets that you publish in the V4&nbsp;market.</p><p>These updates to the market are just one part of all the wide range of upgrades we’ve introduced in Ocean V4.

 The Way Things Used to Be 
<p>During the pandemic, life and work changed rapidly. Appointments needed to be conducted remotely, which resulted in some employees never even meeting each other in person. At 1Kosmos we were sure to have regular video conferences and virtual happy hours to provide company updates and foster personal connections. However, the virtual working model posed its share of challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a large organization and a rapidly shifting economy, working together purposefully and seeing accurate results is tricky.&nbsp; All companies slowed down or halted during this time because company culture and working together is essential for ensuring your company’s success.&nbsp;</p>
 Coming Together 
<p>During the pandemic, our motto was “come together.” It was essential to remind our team that we need to work together still and rely on one another no matter what. Although we successfully stuck together during the most challenging times, nothing beats finally feeling the spark of collective and creative energy when finally working together again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zoom and video conferencing make it easy for us to communicate regularly, but there’s no substitute for meeting in person when collaboration and understanding each other is critical. Sitting in the same room together, you can know the person, learn what they like, and whiteboard and brainstorm ideas that can be easily missed over the phone or via video chat.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sitting with the team over a couple of days gave so much insight into what our employees would like out of our company, how we can increase productivity, and help with more interactions between the teams.</p>
<p>In addition to employees, our interactions with our customers in India have also been limited.&nbsp; This face-to-face interaction with your customer base is crucial, and the pandemic damaged many company-customer relationships.&nbsp; The market in India is moving at a rapid speed and adopting a digital identity and security is at the forefront there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of our core values is “Service to our customers”. Having an opportunity to meet our customers in India, learn about their environments, and get their feedback was refreshing. Meeting with our prospects face-to-face allows us to better tap into exactly where we need to provide value as a company.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 Takeaways 
<p>Recently, we invited all our employees who lived across India to visit our office for an entire week. In addition, we also got a chance to meet some of our customers and prospects in India.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best part of this trip was when we held a day-long company session. In this session, we took the time to re-introduce the company to our team and exchange ideas on collaborating better in a hybrid environment.&nbsp; This was exciting, and so many of the team members shared incredibly insightful questions and thoughts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the most interesting questions was: “I believe the 1Kosmos culture and values have been upheld well and resonate strongly with our customers. But with such a fast-growing organization, how do we maintain our culture and prioritize employee enablement? ”</p>
<p>The answer, in my opinion, is pretty simple – encourage asking questions. The simple mantra here is that a person learns more by asking questions rather than knowing the answers. To that extent, we have fostered multiple platforms/calls where we share information and encourage questions to be asked.</p>
<p>The more asked questions mean that everyone is on the same page about areas the company needs to continue to grow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>During this day-long event, we also learned so much about our team through the team-building activities. Usually, we tend to focus on the individual through interviews, and we try to understand what a person is best at in their day.&nbsp; Instead, we focused on team building and how to best effectively work as a team. This is another reason why a hybrid work environment is essential for new growth as a company.&nbsp;</p>
 Shifting Towards a New Hybrid Work Environment 
<p>We’ve learned that the best work environment is a hybrid of both in-person and remote activities. You can’t have a great company culture without teamwork and operating together.&nbsp; Although all employees successfully continued working through remote work during the pandemic, this isn’t sustainable for long-term growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A hybrid work environment allows for reflection and creativity both alone and together.&nbsp; It is proven that a better balance between home and work life results in increased productivity and satisfaction. Working completely remote did have its benefits. We want to continue reaping those benefits while also adding back that crucial team collaboration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pandemic forced us to take a step back and prioritize exactly what is most important in our lives.&nbsp; This was health, family, or personal growth for many of us.&nbsp; A hybrid work environment provides the right balance between taking care of yourself and prioritizing your health and wellness while also beginning to lean back into growing together in a fast-paced world.&nbsp;</p>

Sens. Cynthia Lummis (left) and Kirsten Gillibrand (right) introduced a cryptocurrency regulation bill on Tuesday. Bloomberg via Getty&nbsp;Images US Senators Kirsten Gillibrand &amp; Cynthia Lummis Introduces the “Responsible Financial Innovation Act” to Regulate Digital Assets in the&nbsp;Country  US Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Cynthia Lummis introduced the the Responsible Financial Innovation Act, a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. <p>The United States is a global economic behemoth with a GDP of <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=US">almost $21 billion</a>. Its financial industry does business worth a whopping $4.8+ trillion per year. Thus, quite naturally, the United States is at the top of the ladder in terms of the crypto market, too. The only thing that was missing so far was serious efforts by US authorities to regulate in the virtual assets industry in a progressive way.</p><p>Finally, US Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Cynthia Lummis introduced a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and announced it <a href="https://www.lummis.senate.gov/press-releases/lummis-gillibrand-introduce-landmark-legislation-to-create-regulatory-framework-for-digital-assets/">through a press release</a> on June 7, 2022. Drawing a parallel with Senator Gillibrand’s home state, Wyoming’s crypto-friendly practices that contributed significantly to the state’s standing in the global and the national crypto industry, the press release noted that the “Responsible Financial Innovation Act,” also known as Lummis-Gillibrand, will bring similar success at the federal&nbsp;level.</p><p>So, without further ado, let’s look at what the “Responsible Financial Innovation Act” has in store for the crypto industry.</p> What’s in Store for&nbsp;Crypto?  Regulatory Clarity <p>The Act will make it easier to distinguish between digital assets, meaning which is a security and which one is a commodity. It will further shine a light on the regulatory obligations of virtual asset companies and empower regulators by giving them more clarity on their role and how they should enforce the current regulations. Besides, the bill will have an all-around definition of digital assets, which, so far, has been non-existent.</p> Commodity Futures Trading Commission: The new Crypto&nbsp;Police <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission is the de-facto authority over the crypto assets so far in the United States. That will change if the “Responsible Financial Innovation Act” comes into force. The bill states that most digital assets are more like commodities than securities. Thus, instead of the SEC, CFTC will be the regulatory authority of digital&nbsp;assets.</p> Wild West Days of Stablecoin Will be&nbsp;Over <p>Stablecoins play a critical role in the virtual assets space. Thus, it is crucial to ensure that stablecoins are backed by 100% reserve, whichever may be the asset behind them (USD, Gold, Silver, Bitcoin). Thus, the Act mandates that the stablecoin issuer must hold 100% reserve equal to the value of stablecoins issued, and they must also comply with detailed disclosure requirements.</p> Launch of an Advisory Committee <p>The world of virtual assets is a fast-evolving one. Thus, the Lummis-Gillibrand Act calls for forming an advisory committee to advise lawmakers on this new technology and empower regulators.</p> Mandatory Disclosure for Digital Asset Companies <p>The Act underscores the need for consumer education in the Virtual asset space. Thus, it makes disclosure mandatory for crypto companies to ensure that consumers make an informed decision.</p> Report on Energy Consumption of the Industry &amp; the Opportunity and Risks Crypto can Pose if Added to Retirement Savings <p>Considering that the environmentalists call crypto mining a highly energy-intensive practice contributing to global warming, the bill demands a report on energy consumption by the crypto industry from Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.</p><p>The bill also directs Government Accountability Office (GAO) to prepare a report on the pros and cons of adding digital assets to retirement savings. After all, digital assets have become a popular addition to retirement savings funds such as&nbsp;401(K).</p> Development of a Sandbox for Collaboration Between State &amp; Federal Regulators <p>The bill notes that the new-age innovative technologies need support in the early stages. Thus, the Act will create a collaborative framework bringing both state and federal regulators together, where they will study the products and their underlying technology. As such, it will enable regulators to get a first-hand experience of the innovative digital asset-related products, helping them develop a better understanding of the technology.</p> In-depth Study of China’s Digital&nbsp;Yuan <p>The bill directs the Office of Management and Budget, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Defense Department to conduct a study on Digital Yuan, China’s CBDC. The reason is that China has become the first country to launch a CBDC, and it is now pushing for its use on the international stage, which can become a national security complication for the United&nbsp;States.</p><p>___</p><p>With more &amp; more countries regulating digital assets, crypto exchanges must start complying with the current law of the land from today itself, if they haven’t already been doing so. It will help them stay clear of any present &amp; even future violations. Start with the FATF’s Travel Rule, as it is the most crucial piece of global regulation around digital assets today and is likely to shape the future of virtual asset transactions worldwide. As of now, only a couple of countries have adopted the Travel Rule. But, sooner or later, all FATF member countries will adopt&nbsp;it.</p><p>Complying with the Travel Rule is easy. All you need is an excellent Travel Rule Service Provider (TRSP), and <a href="https://www.veriscope.network/">Veriscope </a>is the absolute best. Plus, it is also the only solution to the “Sun-rise Issue” that Virtual Asset Service Providers face while complying with the Travel Rule.

<p>Unique digital identifiers will ensure authenticity across multiple chains to prevent counterfeits</p><p>10 June 2022, Austin, TX and London — Today at the Consensus conference, myNFT and B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH (BTE), a developer of applications for KILT Protocol, announced the launch of AssetDIDs, a new type of identifier that can be used with multiple asset classes from fungible and non-fungible assets like&nbsp;NFTs.</p><p>A DID or decentralized identifier functions like a digital fingerprint does for people. A DID can be created for machines, services, and anything that identities can be attached to, including assets. Verifiable credentials can be attached to AssetDIDs, which uniquely describe an asset on any given blockchain. By connecting credentials to these entities, AssetDIDs can transparently ensure authenticity and other properties of both physical and digital assets like NFTs across multiple&nbsp;chains.</p><p>A unique AssetDID for an NFT is generated from four existing datapoints about the&nbsp;asset:</p>  The NFT identifier issued by the&nbsp;creator.  The NFT standard that was used to create the NFT (there might be two NFTs with the same NFT identifier, but from different standards).  The identifier of the issuing instance (e.g. smart contract, blockchain, person, which might not be&nbsp;unique).  The identifier of the blockchain (there might be different chains with common asset-issuing logic).  <p>All together, these uniquely describe an&nbsp;NFT.</p><p>An AssetDID is public by default, as anyone can gather the information and build the identifier. Therefore, it is not necessary to store the AssetDID on a blockchain. Unlike normal DIDs, the AssetDID does not have private keys, because objects like NFTs cannot sign messages or transactions.</p><p><a href="http://kilt.io/">KILT</a> is a decentralized blockchain identity protocol for issuing anonymous and verifiable credentials and DIDs. Credentials and DIDs created with KILT applications are under the control of the owner, who can then decide who to share them with. The DID can also be linked to an easily readable <a href="https://www.trusted-entity.io/assets/pdf/How_To_Guide_web3name_link_address_Full_May22.pdf">web3name</a> (like w3n:alice) and used to represent the owner online, with public credentials adding an extra trust&nbsp;layer.</p><p>Anyone can create KILT credentials to certify properties of any NFT and link them to an AssetDID by storing the credentials publicly on the KILT blockchain. In this way, KILT credentials can be assigned to NFTs stored on any blockchain ecosystem.</p><p><a href="https://www.mynft.com/">myNFT.com</a> is an upcoming multi-chain NFT marketplace built on the Moonbeam parachain that is introducing a wide range of exciting features such as new auction technology, best in class UX, low gas architecture, fiat onramps and cross-chain NFT migration.</p><p>As a marketplace, myNFT wants to ensure that customers on their platform are able to easily distinguish between counterfeit and legitimate NFTs. AssetDIDs combined with myNFT’s internal verification system represent a critical step in helping customers navigate the NFT&nbsp;market.</p> AssetDIDs for&nbsp;NFTs <p>Any NFT owner could create their own credentials using the <a href="https://www.sporran.org/">Sporran</a> wallet and <a href="https://socialkyc.io/">SocialKYC</a> applications built on KILT. They could then link their credentials to an Asset DID by storing them publicly on the KILT blockchain, to certify properties of their&nbsp;NFT.</p><p>For example, Alice could mint an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain and choose an NFT marketplace to sell her art. The NFT marketplace could attest that she is the artist. The AssetDID would then be composed of existing information about the NFT, including the blockchain, type of NFT, smart contract number and NFT ID. A credential that includes this AssetDID could then be generated and stored on KILT certifying that Alice is the creator of the NFT. This credential would be linked to the NFT via the AssetDID. Any potential buyer could then check the KILT blockchain for any credentials related to this AssetDID, to make sure that they are buying the original NFT and not a&nbsp;copy.</p><p>This adds an extra layer of security and can be particularly useful to address ownership and counterfeit issues in digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>‘’Right now one of the biggest problems in the NFT industry is the high number of scams and counterfeit NFTs circulating due to how easy it is to create copycats of original projects. This is where AssetDIDs built on KILT can really help us solve this problem,’’ said Guillaume Gonnaud, CTO and co-founder of&nbsp;myNFT.</p> Asset DIDs for physical&nbsp;assets <p>AssetDIDs may also be used to certify properties of physical items. For example, a watch manufacturer could issue a unique NFT for each watch it makes. The smart contract of the NFT can be used to record changes of ownership on the blockchain. KILT credentials that include the AssetDID can be generated to record properties of the watch — gold content, limited edition number, etc. — and these credentials can be attached to the NFT. If the watch is stolen, the ownership represented by the NFT still remains with the original owner. The thief will have a harder time reselling the stolen watch because he cannot prove the ownership of&nbsp;it.</p><p>This could also be applied to ownership of other physical property such as a house. A notary service could issue an NFT to show ownership of the house. A credential showing the AssetDID and the properties of the house — size, location, etc. — could be notarized on the KILT blockchain and attached to the NFT. The smart contract could track ownership with each sale. Thus, ownership of physical items could be transferred digitally in a transparent and cost-effective way.</p> Cross-chain Interoperability <p>Using the Cross-Consensus Message Format (XCM) in the Polkadot ecosystem, an NFT created in a smart contract, e.g. on Moonriver, could send an extrinsic to KILT via the Kusama Relay Chain to trigger the creation of a KILT credential proving its authenticity. Once the credential is created, any external marketplace application could read it and verify that the NFT is authentic. With AssetDIDs, NFTs live on two blockchains by default, making this a prime use case for cross-chain interoperability.</p><p>“AssetDIDs bridge the physical world with the NFT world. Adding verifiable credentials to uniquely identifiable NFTs brings enormous power and huge opportunities to the NFT ecosystem. Ownership of physical assets can be represented by a verifiable credential”, said Ingo Rübe, founder of KILT Protocol and CEO of B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH. “If this credential is attached to an NFT, and the NFT then changes ownership on a smart contract, the credential and all values associated with it would travel with the NFT. There are thousands of use cases for attaching physical goods with&nbsp;NFTs”.</p><p>BTE is working with a number of NFT partners to introduce AssetDIDs, and collaborating with Parity Technologies to incorporate AssetDIDs into a pallet that will become part of the Substrate framework. KILT founder Ingo Rübe will introduce AssetDIDs during the Polkadot ecosystem track at Consensus on Saturday 12 June starting at 11am&nbsp;CST.</p> About myNFT <p>myNFT is a new multi-chain NFT marketplace that is owned by Perpetual Altruism Ltd, a UK company that was founded in London by three university friends in 2018 and that specializes in the development of NFT technologies. myNFT will eventually allow people to buy and sell any NFT on any blockchain in any currency (crypto or fiat) and allow people to fully migrate their NFTs between blockchains.

<p>The German and overall DACH (Germany, Austria, and Switzerland) Online Gambling market is an emerging one, but it is also one of the largest in Europe. Recognizing this, new regulations legalizing Online Gambling in Germany added to an already existing and sizable legal gambling market.</p>



<p>Overall, Germany’s gambling market is forecast to grow from €2.2bn in 2019 to €3.3bn in 2024, with the legalization of Online Gambling no doubt playing a key role. Meanwhile, Austria’s online gaming market was the fastest-growing gambling sector in the country in 2017, <a href="https://europeangaming.eu/portal/latest-news/2018/06/05/21065/lack-of-regulations-hinders-austrian-igaming-market/">growing by 11%</a> Switzerland is also expanding its Online Gambling market share since it became legal in 2019.</p>



<p>Currently, all DACH countries have legalized online betting markets, with lottery, casinos, and sports betting being the most popular. The regulatory and KYC compliance requirements are strict and , each of these countries feature different requirements.. For example, Germany requires a deposit limit of €1000 for all players, stake limits, and a range of other player-protection requirements.</p>



<p>On the whole, regulations are a mixed bag for the DACH market. The gambling markets are forecast to grow, with legalization allowing players to move away from black market gambling and into a safer, regulated environment. However, there are limitations, such as the aforementioned regulations in Germany, as well as a myriad of different rules in different countries. In particular, limits to advertising and promotions can have an impact on operators’ growth.</p>



 Why Online Gambling needs to be regulated in DACH 



<p>Regulation is crucial for the Online Gambling market in the DACH region. It’s beneficial to both operators and players, with the core focus of regulations being the safety of all parties. This is done through regulations that promote fraud prevention, anti-underaged gambling processes, and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-mules/">Money Muling</a>.</p>



<p>With Online Gambling being easily accessible, each of these things and more have become vital. It’s easy for underaged users to claim to be of any age, thus regulations such as ID verification and other anti-underaged gambling tools were introduced. In the same light, using Online Gambling to ‘clean’ money is a common criminal practice, and many regulations focus on Anti-Money Laundering processes.</p>



<p>It’s also important to consider how sports events affect Online Gambling and why regulation is vital in that aspect. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ensure-player-friendly-id-verification/">Euro 2020 saw an incredible increase in player verification</a>, with millions being waged throughout the tournament. It’s easy for fraudsters to attempt to slip through the cracks in such a busy period, where operators may be overwhelmed with player signups – so it is vital for emerging markets like Germany to be ready.</p>



 Online Gambling in the DACH market 



<p>Online Gambling in the DACH market varies from country to country. In Germany, individual states act as regulators, with the Glücksspielstaatsvertrag (or the State Treaty on Gambling in Germany) providing many of the current rules and regulations in the country.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Austria and Switzerland follow a more traditional regulatory format, key regulatory bodies being set up to overview the gambling sector. In Austria, the Ministry of Finance is mostly responsible for regulating the sector, following the Law on Games of Chance. However, the country is making plans to create a new regulatory body.</p>



<p>Switzerland currently has two regulatory bodies, the Eidgenössische Spielbankenkommission (or Swiss Federal Gaming Board) which handles casino gaming and the Interkantonale Geldspielaufsicht (or Swiss Gambling Supervisory Authority) which regulates lottery, sports betting, and skill games (such as poker). These regulators follow the Federal Gaming Act.</p>



<p>When it comes to Online Gambling regulations in Germany, few are more important than the identity verification rules. These state that robust age verification solutions need to be implemented by operators, using an approved age verification system that checks players’ names, addresses, date and place of birth, as well as nationality.</p>



<p>The goal of this is to combat illicit actions, such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/prevent-underage-gambling/">Underage Gambling</a> and fraud. These <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">KYC checks</a> have a big impact on both players and operators, forcing players to submit documents and wait for verification before gambling. Meanwhile, operators not only have to invest time and money to put these systems into place, but also overcome customer issues like users not understanding the verification process, or simply getting bored while waiting for verification.</p>



 Changes by the Glücksspielvertrag in Germany 



<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/gluecksspielstaatsvertrag-glustv/">Glücksspielvertrag</a> brings many changes to Online Gambling in Germany. Most importantly, it is now legalized in all of the country’s states, and operators need to obtain a permit to offer Online Gambling services.</p>



<p>There are many limitations, however, including enforced deposit limits, extra player protection, limitations to advertising and promotions, as well as robust verification requirements. Overall, these regulations seem to bring a promising future for Germany’s Online Gambling market – players can now safely seek regulated Online Gambling services, rather than having to resort to black market or offshore sites.</p>



<p>Of course, there is a lot for operators to do to keep, especially in terms of KYC requirements, however, players and operators alike are set to reap the benefits of an open and regulated market.</p>



 How to get a license as a gambling operator in DACH 



<p>Receiving a license as a gambling operator in DACH can be challenging. There are many requirements, and each country has its own specific rules which must be followed. In Germany, this includes following new Glücksspielvertrag regulations, which includes things like limiting monthly deposits of players, limiting activity on virtual slot machines, following KYC requirements, and more.</p>



<p>Things are a bit more complex in Switzerland. In order to receive a license for a casino, operators must follow regulations set out by the Swiss Federal Gaming Board. Additionally, an active land-based casino license is required to open an online casino. When it comes to betting, operators need to follow regulations set out by the Swiss Gambling Supervisory Authority, however, only two companies currently have a license.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, in Austria, operators must be compliant with laws set out by the Law on Games of Chance, as well as regulations put in place by the Ministry of Finance and potentially local governments.</p>

<p>Overall, there are many rules and regulations for operators to overcome to attain compliance and it can be a real challenge, especially when it comes to stringent technical aspects like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC processes</a>.

 Funding ‘public good’ in complexity: four interrelated propositions <p>Since 2020, we (Dark Matter Labs) have worked together with <a href="https://lankellychase.org.uk/">Lankelly Chase</a>, <a href="https://www.demsoc.org/">The Democratic Society</a>, <a href="http://blackthrive.org/">Black Thrive</a> and<a href="https://www.yorkmcn.org/">York MCN Network</a> on #BeyondtheRules, exploring how we organise and govern when seeking to create public value within the realities of a deeply interconnected, complex&nbsp;world.</p><p>When no one actor can know the full picture of a question:</p>  What agreements do you need between each other to align on complementary work for public&nbsp;value?  Who decides where funds are invested, and how is this funding structured?  Who gets to generate funds and&nbsp;how?  How do you determine whether you are achieving your intentions?  Who owns and has access to intellectual property or data? How is it stored and&nbsp;shared?  How do accountabilities and responsibilities get structured? Who can take on different roles and how do they shift and&nbsp;rotate?  <p>More broadly, <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/BeyondtheRules">#BeyondtheRules</a> is a conversation between hundreds of peers who are grappling with similar topical challenges.</p><p>Over the last year, one enquiry has focused on ‘grantmaking’. We spoke to a range of insightful people and compiled insights into a written and visual overview that grantmakers — indeed any actors involved in public value creation — can build from when looking at how they organise and&nbsp;govern.</p><p>We have compiled this learning into a downloadable and shareable <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NIw_EUu6cDevJyBN9xQmoyYLrWWY7igg/view?usp=sharing">Grantmaking #BeyondtheRules Report</a> (download by clicking the&nbsp;link).</p><p>We’d also happily create an interactive Grantmaking #BeyondtheRules Notion page where you could browse through pages and leave comments and notes. We’d create this subject to demand — so if this sounds useful, then please let us know via email (<a href="mailto:annette@darkmatterlabs.org">annette@darkmatterlabs.org</a>) or Twitter (@AnnetteDhami or @DarkMatter_Labs).</p><p>This blog intends to summarise the report’s contents — we welcome any insight or feedback, and use and adaptation of ideas; all of these materials are licenced under a Creative Commons <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0</a> International Licence.</p><p>The ideas shared here draw together a range of insights from interviewees, informal conversations, reading and the thoughts of many. A breakdown of contributions is shared in the Report introduction; the Report also includes a series of case studies which we encourage you to&nbsp;explore.</p><p>There are four ‘propositions’ in the report; they are tailored approaches based on tried-and-practised learning. Our intention is to gather insight from a range of organising and governance methods and propose a draft model of what a more appropriate grantmaking system might look like. It was never our intention to prescribe a fixed model or template, and we fully expect that governance models, in practice, will be formed in response to — and tailored to — unique contexts.</p><p>The next stage for us — and anyone else interested in experimenting with ideas shared here — is to create a working model and to learn from what evolves. We believe that the deep foundation of learning upon which the propositions sit means that these ideas are ‘safe enough to&nbsp;try’.</p><p>Proposition 1</p><p>An exploration and critique of the governance logics that can underpin funding methods for public value creation, recognising that the contexts being explored are influenced by many factors, only some of which are within an actor’s ability to influence.</p>Internal mapping that was developed to help us to see the landscape of the questions we are looking at and their interconnections.<p>After lightly tracing a history of philanthropy and contracting, we propose that an X+Y=Z logic, combined with a single-point definition of ‘value for money’ creates a race to the bottom and sets us up to provide little more than symptom response.</p>Adapted from the ‘Cone of Plausibility’ (Charles Taylor, 1988), grantmaking governance often involves projecting a desired destination (Z), predetermining the actions that will lead to it (X+Y), and then distributing funding on the basis that the actions are executed (and the destination reached) for the lowest possible cost (‘value for&nbsp;money’).<p>Although this can create order and control — it fails to accurately consider how complex systems function, and as a result, creates significant negative&nbsp;impacts.</p>This rough and stylised causal loops map seeks to illustrate some of the ways that these funding norms cascade across a system; it also seeks to highlight the other ‘rules’ in the broader systems that they take part in, and how these also play a role in locking in or reimagining these&nbsp;norms.<p>We propose an alternative logic of governance that can underpin funding stewardship.</p>Alternative logics: an unfurling approach towards a broader mission and agreement space, developed from multiple perspectives.<p>We propose that — if conditions are in place, including sufficient structure to assist navigability and to shed light on dynamics in the system — the impacts of this type of approach could dramatically improve the efficacy of our shared attempts to create public&nbsp;value.</p>This alternative stylised causal loops map seeks to illustrate some of the ways that alternative norms could cascade across a&nbsp;system.<p>Proposition 2</p><p>Adopting this new logic, we propose a draft outline of a governance model to orchestrate finance across a complex system, and exploring examples of how elements of this approached are already being lived and practised in various settings.</p>A visual depiction of the systems orchestration method outlined in Proposition 2<p>Proposition 3</p><p>An outline of five strategic areas for a systemic funding approach. It invites us to continue responding to symptoms; while investing in the discovery and systemic incorporation of emergent public value; growing capacity and capability of actors across the system; addressing imagined orders and narratives and building desire for change; while changing the hard rules in law, regulation and policy in order to overcome problematic lock-ins.</p>A visual depiction of the systemic funding approach outline in Proposition 2.A shared compass for actors to see how their work sits alongside others’, and collectively to check that various parts in the system are being addressed.<p>Proposition 4</p><p>Explores the behaviours and crafts that can be developed within any current system of funding governance, drawing upon insights from inspiring grantmakers and grantees.</p><p>We’ve summarised some of these shifts&nbsp;as:</p><p>Rebalancing and distributing your system of governance</p>  Recentering voices of embodied knowledge  Devolving assets for community governance  Shifting narratives through self-told stories  Wielding positional power to influence the wealth inequality that creates institutional philanthropy  <p>Addressing your organising crafts</p>  Supporting systemic legibility and compounded learning  Softening your boundaries and inspecting the way you&nbsp;organise  <p>We end the report with a nod to a reality ‘Beyond the Rules’ of philanthropy, and how it might look radically different if we are successful in transforming how we create&nbsp;change.</p><p>In this&nbsp;future:</p>  the formation of capital has been decentralised and all communities have access to capital formation and the ability to invest&nbsp;it  financing has moved beyond requiring existing capital to mitigate risk and is less reliant on underwriting assets accumulated in the&nbsp;past  discounting of future value has been adjusted so that longer-term investments are no longer so high&nbsp;risk  externalities of interventions are better incorporated into the core accounting models, shifting incentive systems  <p>The report ends with a series of case studies from the following groups, who are already each manifesting ways of organising and governing that provided inspiration for these propositions:</p>  Global Greengrants Fund&nbsp;UK  Guerilla Foundation  FundAction  BD Giving  An Untold Story&nbsp;Voices  <p>If you are interested in how we organise and govern within systems then you are invited to take part in the conversation. To subscribe to updates, we suggest filling in<a href="https://dark-matter-labs.typeform.com/to/jpm8rdp1"> this Typeform</a>&nbsp;. Over the next year, we’ll host a range of open learning sessions to further explore this topic together. We will also link up with the Transformative Governance group who are facilitating peer learning cohorts on this topic. The Democratic Society will be working deeply with a number of groups looking to shift their existing&nbsp;systems.</p><p>If you are a grantmaker and are interested in manifesting some of these ideas in your context, we will begin experimenting with a small group of grantmakers to build this approach in practice over the coming months. The intention is to set up a #BeyondtheRules Fund, which will, in turn, fund consecutive work by many actors developing practice on governing and organising in&nbsp;systems.</p><p>If you are interested in taking part please contact Annette Dhami on <a href="mailto:annette@darkmatterlabs.org">annette@darkmatterlabs.org</a> and Joe Doran on <a href="mailto:joe@lankellychase.org.uk">joe@lankellychase.org.uk</a></p> <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/grantmaking-beyondtherules-8dfc752df3da">Grantmaking #BeyondtheRules</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Its membership consists of global remittance and payment companies, including MoneyGram, M-Pesa(by Vodafone), UPT, Trustly, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>Together with IAMTN, we aim to use the MetaMUI blockchain to advance existing payment infrastructure and lead the way into a new era of international payment systems. While transferring money with current remittance service providers is expensive and time-consuming, on top of the MetaMUI blockchain, money can easily be transferred through a simple Internet connection without any intermediary currencies. As a result, global remittance fees and transaction costs can be significantly lowered, and money transfer times substantially reduced to a matter of seconds, regardless of where it is sent from or received.</p><p>With the potential to revolutionize the whole cross-border payments and international remittance industry, we are looking forward to working closely with IAMTN and its partners.</p><p>More about&nbsp;us</p><p><a href="https://sovereignwallet.network/">Website</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/metamui/">Linkedin</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/MUIcommunity">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://t.me/muicommunity">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SWNGlobal">Youtube</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/">Medium</a></p>

<p>According to a&nbsp;<a href="https://prod-finweb-frontend.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/20220114015112/Mortgage_Report_final.pdf">recent study</a>&nbsp;from Mastercard, consumers say obtaining a mortgage is a serious pain point in an already painful homebuying process. The survey shows that 89% of homebuyers find the mortgage process to be equally or more stressful than the homebuying experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Borrowers whose lenders used digital mortgage verifications were less likely to say the loan process was the most stressful part of buying or refinancing a home, and 83% of respondents using digital verifications said their loan processing time was shorter than expected or met their expectations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a designated third-party service provider of Freddie Mac, Finicity, a wholly owned subsidiary of Mastercard, offers an integration of its open banking data and Mortgage Verification Services (MVS) with AIM that allows clients to automate the capacity assessment using consumer-permissioned data, direct deposit account data and work history. In the case of income, lenders can now look at direct deposit history to verify income.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Identity plays a critical role in supply chains. Stakeholders place value on unambiguous identifiers for governments, organizations, people, devices, and assets. As supply chains grow more complex, we mitigate risks by codifying the relationships between these stakeholders and the actions they have taken over time into identifiers using shared terms to assess&nbsp;value.</p><p>We will explore the relationship between identity terms and supply chain using the purchase of organic strawberries as an&nbsp;example.</p><p>Introduction to Identity: A Strawberry Story</p><p>Identity in daily practice is shorthand for every action we&nbsp;take.</p><p>Bob buys fruit at the grocery&nbsp;store.</p><p>Each element in that sentence combines identifiers, claims, knowledge, logic, and likely several credentials to provide key stakeholders with the confidence they need to ensure a stable and trustworthy supply chain. Using organic strawberries as an example, a crop that grossed almost <a href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/AgCensus/2017/Online_Resources/Organics/organics_1_006%20_006.pdf">US $321 million in sales in 2019</a>, how those terms are defined and applied demonstrate the tangible value of identity in the supply&nbsp;chain.</p> Identifiers <p>What is the difference between an identity and an identifier?</p><p>Identifiers are labels for identities, or a way to recognize and establish identity.</p><p>In the context of supply chains, prudent stakeholders establish identifiers to avoid harm that might come from confusion over identity and protect value that is derived from certainty regarding identity and provenance. In practice, we mostly use identifiers as a way to describe separate entities and their interactions.</p><p>When we write policy, we mean for it to apply to identities, but when we convert that policy to software, it can end up applying only to identifiers. Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the US government placed <a href="https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/policy-guidance/country-guidance/russia-belarus">stringent export controls on Russia</a>. That policy is written using the English language identifier for Russia, but it is meant to enforce all language identifiers for Russia, including Россия. Software designed to implement the policy effectively should account for all identifiers associated with the restricted identity.</p><p>In the sentence about Bob’s shopping trip, there are multiple identifiers that can be added or altered that change nothing for the subjects of the sentence.</p><p>Robert buys strawberries at&nbsp;S-Mart.</p><p>In this way, identity is an abstraction used to communicate sameness, a way to say that two or more things are in fact the same&nbsp;thing.</p><p>Person = Robert,&nbsp;Bob</p><p>Goods = fruit, strawberries</p><p>Vendor = grocery store,&nbsp;S-Mart</p><blockquote>Zooko’s Triangle and&nbsp;Identity</blockquote><blockquote>Names as identifiers highlights one of the most challenging aspects of applying identifiers to supply chains, or any network protocol, often referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko%27s_triangle">Zooko’s triangle</a>, an identity trilemma that maintains no single name can achieve more than two of: human-meaningful, secure, and decentralized.</blockquote><blockquote>In supply chain use cases, this triangle has often been addressed by trading decentralization for human readability, typically through the use of registries managed by trusted entities, for&nbsp;example:</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://www.gs1.org/standards/epcis">GS1 EPCIS</a> — Relies on a standards process for describing supply chain activity.</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://www.sigstore.dev/">Sigstore</a> — Relies on email addresses and a centralized database.</blockquote><blockquote>Identifier registries solve for global uniqueness and discoverability by sacrificing privacy and decentralization, but there are many use cases where this trade off makes a lot of sense, for&nbsp;example:</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://www.iana.org/domains/root/servers">IANA Root&nbsp;Servers</a></blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEA_number">DEA Numbers</a></blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://github.com/advisories">GitHub Advisory&nbsp;Database</a></blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CM/ECF">Case Management/Electronic Case&nbsp;Files</a></blockquote> Claims Help Us&nbsp;Choose <p>Identifiers and claims are meaningless without each&nbsp;other.</p><p>Knowing who said something is just as important as what they said, or about whom they said&nbsp;it.</p><p>Most often, we encounter two kinds of&nbsp;claims:</p> Self Attested <p>Self attested claims are when an identity claims something about itself or something it controls. When you “agree to terms of service”, you are claiming to have read and understood the terms of service. The consequences of self attested claims are generally individualized, and the more valuable claims in the supply chain are made by reputable third&nbsp;parties.</p> Third Party&nbsp;Attested <p>Third Party Attestations are claims about a subject (identity) made by a different identity. In some US states to acquire a driver’s license, you need to present a physician’s signature to approve your medical authorization to drive because the state does not trust you to make these claims by yourself. Third party attestations are a common building block for establishing trust, and removing conflicts of interest.</p><p>One of the most common types of claims is a claim about the relationship between identifiers. Email verification to complete actions like signing up for a newsletter or establishing a new social media account helps the newsletter service links two of your personal identifiers together around your identity.</p><p>Third party attestations solve for Zooko’s triangle where we must associate a secure globally unique identifier with a human readable identifier. Leveraging a third party attestation for this allows us to get the benefits of multiple identifier formats at the cost of trusting the identity provider to make claims of equivalence.</p><p>Supply chain stakeholders can request third party attestations like an independent audit of a manufacturing or food producing facility; a third party security review of a cryptography library; or an independent review of a company’s financials before it can be bought or&nbsp;sold.</p><p>Bob buys organic strawberries at&nbsp;S-Mart</p><p>In this example, the claim is that the strawberries are organic. All strawberries carry the same identifier, but Bob prefers the strawberries that claim to be&nbsp;organic.</p> Logic Applied to Identifiers and&nbsp;Claims <p>“<a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/logic">Logic is a particular way of thinking, especially one that is reasonable and based on good judgment</a>.”</p><p>Claims that leverage identifiers and logic, are better than claims that don’t. Not every identifier-claim pairing can be taken at face value because they don’t all map to logical assumptions.</p>  If there is a conflict of interest to misreport a value, it’s not logical to accept self attested claims regarding that&nbsp;value.  If the identifier for a subject might not be unique enough, how will we know which identity is making the&nbsp;claim.  <p>By taking care to design claims that leverage identifiers and their critical properties as noted by Zooko, we can remove ambiguity, reduce the chances of human errors that arise from confusion and poor communication, and increase the ability to process claims using automated systems that can exploit&nbsp;logic.</p><p>Bob buys organic strawberries at&nbsp;S-Mart.</p><p>Because claims can quickly become too complex to verify, it can be helpful to use logic to navigate a claim’s construction. If we apply logic to the claim that the strawberries are organic, we can immediately identify questions that verify or increase our confidence in the claim, such&nbsp;as:</p>  Where do the strawberries come&nbsp;from?  Is the organic claim made by the producer (labeled on the packaging) or S-Mart (unlabeled)?  Does S-Mart have a history of selling organic&nbsp;produce?  Does the product carry the USDA certified organic&nbsp;label?   Knowledge as&nbsp;Context <p>Knowledge comprises all the information about an identity, including identifiers, claims, and the results of applied&nbsp;logic.</p><p>It’s important to agree to common representations for knowledge so that claims can be understood with context. Shared vocabularies and ontologies can help remove ambiguity and reduce the possible complexity of claims, which in turn can unlock more efficient knowledge processing.</p><p>In the context of supply chains, we require knowledge about the details of each transaction in order to proceed safely and profitably:</p>  A container with a weight of 667 with no units can’t be safely loaded onto a&nbsp;ship.  An outstanding invoice of 100.50 with no currency can’t help us answer questions about how much in USD we&nbsp;owe.  <p>Instead of processing all invoices and containers in all possible currencies and physical units, supply chain stakeholders share knowledge by agreeing to a subset defined in a specific document. By rejecting data that does not meet those agreed-upon knowledge requirements, they can improve the quality of the data that is processed, and save on expensive and possibly dangerous normalization computations.</p><p>Not every supply chain system can use knowledge management to limit claims. For example, when processing real world data in many languages, you cannot just ignore claims in other languages. If you are dealing with historical data, there could be documents which you must process which may have complied with regulations at the time, but which are not compliant with current regulations.</p><p>Just as claims can change over time, so too can knowledge management systems.</p><p>Bob’s knowledge about his organic strawberry purchase could be augmented by S-Mart claims to source their strawberries from a local farm; a comparison between the cost of conventional versus organic strawberries at S-Mart; or an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/us/hepatitis-a-us-canada-strawberries.html">outbreak of hepatitis</a> caused by strawberries.</p> Credentials for Efficiency and Protection <p>When a claim is made by an identifier (issuer), in such a way that it can be attributed to the issuer’s identity, and is protected from being tampered with, some call it a credential, certificate or&nbsp;license.</p><p>Credentials about products are only meaningful when you trust the identity making the claim. If you are importing or exporting products that might have a national security, environmental or social impact, you probably need a special credential from a government to engage in that activity. When the stakes are that high, the most valuable credential comes from a reputable, mutually agreed upon third&nbsp;party.</p><p>If you learn you are interacting with an identity which has lost their license several times in the past few years, you search for a new vendor or evaluate if the price of the goods or service is worth the risk to your business.</p><p>Supply chain credentialing in the form of bills of lading, certificates of origin, or letters of credit is used to protect honest parties and their merchandise from being confused with dishonest parties or entities that are engaged in unethical practices, such as environmental destruction, or forced&nbsp;labor.</p><p>The best credential Bob can look for in the United States is the USDA organic sticker on his strawberries. But it’s not just a helpful credential for Bob. Producers who violate the USDA’s organic terms face up to <a href="https://attra.ncat.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/nop_organiccertification.pdf?">$11,000 per violation and a revocation of the producer’s organic certificate</a>.</p><p>To incentivize the credentialing process for producers, obtaining USDA certification opens doors to participating in an <a href="https://attra.ncat.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/nop_organiccertification.pdf?">organic trade agreement</a> where Canada, the EU, Japan, and Taiwan also recognize the USDA’s organic certification. The US producer that <a href="https://www.solidaritycenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Strawberry-Global-Supply-Chains-in-Mexico.March-2021.pdf">controls 60 percent of the organic strawberry market</a> — Driscoll’s — made US $473 million in&nbsp;2018.</p><p>The value producers, consumers, and trade partners place on credentialed identifiers for this single commodity demonstrates the necessity for defining and securing identity terms across the entire supply&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Written by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessicatacka/">Jessica Tacka</a>, Product Marketing Manager Transmute</p>

 The Cause to support Jolocom 



<p>Digital identification and verification is still a rare occurrence for some, and becoming common place for others. Fact is digital identities will become ubiquitous in just a few years. This is why the European Union, along with many other national lawmakers, are currently developing their positions on how to regulate this growing space and market, why a lot of the Big Tech actors are moving into the digital identity space, and why demand for digital identity infrastructure is steadily increasing.</p>



<p>The good news is: a lot of innovation is happening and things are developing at amazing speeds.</p>



<p>The vulnerable aspect is: the infrastructures we implement will have a decisive influence on who will own our individual data in the future. Will it be citizens and individuals themselves? Or large corporations or governments? How will this affect our freedoms, expressions of self and democratic processes?</p>



<p>Jolocom can offer identity infrastructure for users, entities and authorities that keeps data solely in the hands of the data subject, but also allows for controlled, self-sovereign exchange of select data with trusted partners. In order to get this infrastructure to production readiness, we now need to scale a lot faster than we have before, in order to forcefully compete with the federated or centralized identity infrastructures of GAFA &amp; Co. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Starting today, <a href="https://gitcoin.co/grants/5885/internet-archive">make a small donation</a> through Gitcoin and have an enormous impact for the production-readiness of SSI, through <a href="https://wtfisqf.com/?grant=&amp;grant=&amp;grant=&amp;grant=&amp;match=1000">Gitcoin’s quadratic funding</a>. The funding round closes on June 20th, 2022.</p>



<p></p>



<p><a href="https://gitcoin.co/grants/">Gitcoin Grant Round 14</a>&nbsp;is open now, supporting advocacy groups around the world. When you donate even 1 EUR worth of crypto to Jolocom, it will be multiplied through the matching pool. Quadratic funding rewards the number of community members who give, along with the amount. So many small donations can really have an enormous impact.</p>


 
<code>This is an example of the matching funds allotted to a Gitcoin Grant donation.</code> 


 How to donate 



  First, you’ll need to create or&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/login">log in your Github</a>&nbsp;account.&nbsp;  Use that account to&nbsp;<a href="https://gitcoin.co/sign-in">authorize in to Gitcoin</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Choose our or any number of Gitcoin grants that speak to you here:  



  <a href="https://gitcoin.co/grants/5862/jolocom-tech-stack-20-own-your-digital-self">Jolocom</a>  <a href="https://gitcoin.co/grants/5885/internet-archive">Internet Archive</a>  <a href="https://gitcoin.co/grants/5845/dweb-fellowship-fund">DWeb Camp Fellowships</a>  



  You’ll need a crypto wallet like&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/metamask-blockchain-wallet/id1438144202">Metamask</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rainbow-ethereum-wallet/id1457119021">Rainbow Wallet</a>&nbsp;with some Ethereum or other tokens.  Select how much you want to donate. (For example: .003 ETH = about 5.00 EUR)  Do you want to also add some money to the matching pool? Be sure to set an amount in that field as well.  Hit the “I’m Ready to Checkout” button.  In the drop-down menu, pick Standard Checkout, Polygon, or zkSync.  Connect and log in to your crypto wallet to pay.  BONUS: You can&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/gitcoin/status/1534614555162288128">verify your identity</a>&nbsp;by creating a Gitcoin Passport via Ceramic to maximize the matching funds (up to 150%).  The more people who give, the greater the percentage of the matching pool we receive.  



<p>Thank you for taking these steps to unleash huge support for Jolocom. A small amount means the world to us, and helps Jolocom build the Future of Identity!</p>

<p>Why the blockchain works for the young and old people hate&nbsp;it</p><p>By Vinay Gupta, CEO, Mattereum</p><p>The younger generation suck at explaining the blockchain. No wonder there’s so much fear, uncertainty and doubt in the space right now. Let me explain what’s going on, but this time we’re going to leave the really important parts of the picture in the&nbsp;frame.</p><p>You’ve got to start in 2008 with the global financial collapse. Since then, interest rates have hovered around zero as government pumped cash into the global economy to keep it running. For a long time, no inflation. The extreme medicine was working. Then covid, and 5% inflation.</p><p>During that period with no inflation, and tons of money printing, there was very little economic growth. If there had been, inflation would have started then — the economy picks right up, credit risk goes down because lending is less risky, and prices start to rise on the&nbsp;cash.</p><p>So what happens to people who are turning 20 or graduating college in 2009? Nothing. Nobody will lend them money to start businesses, VC becomes extremely conservative and risk-averse, and Silicon Valley starts to consolidate. Life is slowly getting harder, and young are v.&nbsp;poor.</p><p>Actually take a look at this&nbsp;thing:</p><p>There’s just a titanic concentration of wealth in the hands of older people, and the young are living on scraps. This is absolutely brutal: feels like civilization is going backwards. The young are terrified.</p>(<a href="https://on.mktw.net/3muGpZu">https://on.mktw.net/3muGpZu</a> )<p>So in this situation what the young need is economic opportunity and THEY ARE NOT GOING TO GET IT IN ANY RESOURCE POOL THAT THE BOOMERS CONTROL.There’s just no room to expand: whatever you want to do, there’s a tax: boomers control media distribution, VC finance, real estate. Most of the easy niches in the dotcom world are already taken: people shop, they read the news, they listen to music, they date — and big dotcoms are already in all of those niches. Nobody is going to overthrow reddit and FB anytime soon; they’re solidly locked into place now. This is a simple problem of access to capital: land, patents, intellectual property, distribution networks for physical products (Target, Walmart). The young don’t have enough cash to BUY INTO THE SYSTEM. They’re so poor they can’t even get exploited.</p><p>Now do you see Bitcoin’s’s fix? Bitcoin allows its adherents an escape from the boomer-ridden conventional economic landscape. What is bitcoin’s core feature? IT’S TOO HARD FOR BOOMERS TO USE. So you can build an economy for the young, a parallel state to the Boomer Dollar dominated US political landscape.</p><p>This is one of those Voice, Loyalty and Exit things. The young complain: nobody hears them. They try and tough it out in existing cultural blocs: still can’t make rent. But to exit the boomer-controlled old economy into the btc/web3 space? Wow: a huge self-financed bubble grows.There is practically no boomer control of bitcoin or web3. I’m 50, and I’m one of the oldest people in the space — Ian Grigg, David Chaum, Joe Lubin, Don Tapscott, a handful of others — but the old guys are rare and (apart from Joe) not that powerful.</p><p>Young blockchain frontier. Now, young people, they are not so smart. I was young myself. They make mistakes. Big ones. Now we have Oh So Many young people running around with a huge pile of capital that they basically created by believing each-other’s stories. It’s a creative pact. A NEW SOCIAL CONTRACT.</p><p>So this New Social Contract (NSC), let’s examine things like Bored Apes. In this contract, kids who grew up with an ipad in their hand acquiring virtual property in games and trading it with friends, go from renting virtual property from Farmville to creating and owning it. Why is an Ape valuable? The younger generation decided it was valuable. Why isn’t this golf course valuable? The people that thought golf was at the centre of the universe are all too old to play much. This is a generational turnover of wealth, an escape from a locked-up world.</p><p>Because there’s practically no law in (for example) defi or the NFT game. The ICOs ran afoul of old school financial regulation. But the NFTs are bang in the middle of open ground: you draw a thing, the government says you own it outright if it isn’t Mickey Mouse. You sell it. So now you have tons of cultural production — young people making art for young people — but the distribution channel is OpenSea, and that’s also owned by… young people. And their fees are light. The younger generation are Exiting the Boomer Machine to live on their own terms. 25 years ago, John Perry Barlow (I met him once!) wrote The Declaration of Independence of Cyberspace:</p><p>Does any of this sound familiar to&nbsp;you?</p><p>Now let’s discuss the New Social Contract’s critics.Who’s getting so het up here? Why all the hatred for Web3 these&nbsp;days?</p><p>Let me tell you where the action is: it’s the people who are waiting around to inherit their parent’s houses who are telling you that this NFT thing is no good and YOU SHOULD GET BACK INSIDE OF THE MACHINE WHICH WILL ONE DAY PAY MY PENSION. Because this “defection” hurts them. The more the young define their own system with their own rules, the more the old are missing out on the deal. But they’re mostly not watching this: Warren Buffet is an exception, and he called BTC “rat poison” remarkably early.</p><p>But he’s the&nbsp;rat.</p><p>But mostly the old missed it. Then the bridge generation, the one doing the complaining, clogging the airwaves with NFT hate and trying to coerce artists and brands into staying&nbsp;away.</p><p>What do they have to&nbsp;lose?</p><p>The answer is: they’re late to the party, and were hoping to WIN AT THE OLD GAME in the future. The well positioned chattering classes, the media and academics, want to inherit the system that the young are refusing to join and actively working to undermine. They don’t have real power yet but they know if the system stays up, in 20 years they’ll run the next TED/Davos. And these slightly younger defenders of the Status Quo are fighting like hell to defend the Status Quo only because they expect to inherit&nbsp;it.</p><p>If the cultural production system burns to the ground before they inherit, they get&nbsp;nothing.</p><p>All the value’s skipping a generation. So when you see somebody wailing on NFTs, ask the hard question: “how old are they, and what is their stake in the old&nbsp;system?”</p><p>This is not to say that NFTs and crypto are perfect: young people made them without much reference to the Old Social Contract and they worked very fast. I was under 30 in the 1990s when I got involved in cryptocurrency. By the time Ethereum rolled round I was one of the oldest members of the team: a stabilizing influence, perhaps. But I was on that side because I had nothing to lose: I had no property, no stake. Open Source guy! Now I’m plotting a global environmental and economic reform which, even if it works, I will not likely see the end of unless I live for a very long&nbsp;time.</p><p>I’m working for future generations now. <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/can-the-world-computer-save-the-world-part-3-building-an-economy-with-a-future-5d4156f06a04">(medium.com/humanizing-the…)</a></p><p>I should probably also mention <a href="http://myhopeforthe.world/">http://myhopeforthe.world/</a> which is a rough summary of how I spent my life before lucking into Ethereum and becoming the Launch Coordinator for the 2015&nbsp;launch.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-blockchain-sleep-of-reason-b28f3bd3f83b">THE BLOCKCHAIN SLEEP OF REASON</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Ontology Web3 Network (OWN) Infrastructure <p>Web3 is here to revitalize the way in which our entire society operates, ushering in a new era of trust and collaboration. With its outstanding advantages in the fields of technology and economy, users now have more autonomy in the online world, with data no longer in the hands of a few tech giants. As more people participate in common governance, principles such as rights, information privacy, and copyright can be better protected.</p><p>This new type of production relationship also exposes certain problems, which are mainly manifested in decentralized scenarios such as content creation during social collaboration, community governance, and on-chain transactions. These actions still rely on centralized platforms; over-collaterailization is still not very mainstream in financial activities in the DeFi ecosystem.</p><p>The reality is Web3 social relations still lack the basic elements needed to create real trust. With the right infrastructure, we will remove bottlenecks in current systems, creating a long-term, effective social trust and collaboration within&nbsp;Web3.</p> Trust Infrastructure  The Underlying Layer: Providing a Solid Foundation <p>A high-performance and fully scalable underlying public chain is essential to building long-term growth of the on-chain trust ecosystem.</p><p>Ontology Web3 Network (OWN) Infrastructure provides an efficient, compatible and secure public chain at the base layer. The development of decentralized applications, network congestion, high transaction fees, and long transaction confirmation times can often affect user experience. In contrast, the OWN infrastructure helps solve these problems through its own Verifiable Byzantine Fault Tolerance (VBFT) consensus mechanism and Optimistic Rollup’s Layer2 solution. With this, the platform can process more than 5,000 on-chain transactions per&nbsp;second.</p><p>In terms of platform scalability, OWN supports multiple languages ​​and protocols. Following the EVM integration, it has realized support for 4 types of contracts, as well as multi-chain and cross-chain collaboration. In practice, if a project party builds an application based on OWN, it can easily migrate to the Ethereum platform. Its data can also be synchronized on multiple chains to achieve overarching integration across multiple&nbsp;chains.</p> The Protocol Layer: Enriches Identity Connotation <p>The underlying protocol layer is an important bridge for promoting trust cooperation. In Web2, identity mainly refers to information surrounding ancestry and real-life occupations. In the Web3 era, identity is endowed with richer connotations. For users to carry out various activities on the chain, they need a digital identity in the form of an address. Many people may think that the activities on the chain mainly focus on financial activities, such as transfers and pledges, but this is not the case. The most important element is the users themselves. Based on blockchain technology, the required data and information will go hand in hand, accompanied by a valid on-chain user who has been verified by KYC from beginning to&nbsp;end.</p><p>Therefore, the protocol layer technology that supports trust collaboration also plays a key role. Academic fraud, impersonation, and online fraud are all manifestations of blind spots in trust and cooperation. For example, tools such as the SDK in the ONT ID decentralized identity protocol can help solve issues such as academic&nbsp;fraud.</p><p>By issuing a Verifiable Credential (VC) the institution can view the signature and validity period of the credential to ensure it is trustworthy information. For the issuer, the VC can also be used to mark the status of the individual’s license for the verifier. These VCs can be bound with decentralized identities, created and managed by users, to be selectively displayed in line with the needs of various scenarios.</p><p>Once we have addressed issues surrounding identity, there will be a higher demand for reputation and data processing management. As such, Orange and POD can further provide solutions to help reputation and data processing reach their full potential.</p><p><a href="https://www.orangeprotocol.io/">Orange</a> is a protocol based on decentralized reputation. It uses a range of algorithms to calculate the data related to the user’s decentralized identity in different blockchain ecosystems, integrates the user’s reputation across the wider web, and can be used and circulated anywhere in&nbsp;Web3.</p><p><a href="https://poddb.io/">POD</a> is a Web3 on-chain data middleware for data collaboration that enables metadata processing across multiple blockchain networks. It helps to solve data management across the board, from obtaining the data, to correlation and utilization. In turn, POD makes it easier for developers, builders, and users to work with metadata and build a richer ecosystem when it comes to managing all metaverse data within a single interface.</p><p>The exploration of protocol layer technologies continues to develop. Both <a href="http://ONT.ID">ONT ID</a> and other community projects within the OWN network provide solutions to solve pain points and promote the construction of a more efficient and transparent trust cooperation mechanism. With the continuous development of Web3, there will be more object-oriented authentication requirements, and more innovative solutions will&nbsp;emerge.</p> The Application Layer: Effectively Connecting Users <p>In the Web3 production relationship dominated by the token economy, the public is prone to fall into a misunderstanding that trust collaboration is only related to financial activities. Yet, this is not the case. As the widespread adoption of crypto continues to rise, so does the appetite for data control and security of users’ assets. As such, asset management applications alone are no longer enough. <a href="http://ONTO.APP">ONTO Wallet</a> not only provides basic on-chain asset management functions, but also leads the way towards innovative functions that can meet wider Web3 needs, including decentralized identity. Each wallet user can create their own decentralized digital identity through the mobile client or desktop plug-in application. The assets that the user owns and the transactions on the chain will be recorded in the KYC-verified identity, and the individual can then independently manage their data. ONTO Wallet is regarded as a “Web3 gateway” and currently supports up to 25 chains, constantly expanding to meet the needs of a wider range of Web3&nbsp;users.</p><p>Additionally, users can generate corresponding credit points based on their on-chain behavior by using ONTO Wallet. The DID (ONT ID) owned by a user in ONTO Wallet represents their social relationship and can be used as a reference point when interacting with other users or applicants. In practice, a user with a high credit score (OScore) can rent a vehicle through the digital wallet without a deposit. The individual’s educational background, qualifications, and other key information are also closely related to the DID and stored on the&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>In OWN, the related ONT ID protocol-level products also include a suite of other protocols: ONT Login, the decentralized login component which optimizes the user login experience; ONT TAG, which provides KYC services; and Mercury, a peer to peer communication protocol for Web3 applications. Together, these products create sufficient channels for all parties to provide or use Web3 services, as well as to assist and accelerate the construction of decentralized applications.</p> Common and Compatible Infrastructure <p>When working towards creating total social trust, the base layer, the protocol layer, and the application layer become one. Together, they play a multi-dimensional role in laying a solid foundation and providing an advanced experience. The token model, node economy and identity authentication promotes the prosperity and development of the entire ecosystem.</p><p>In this regard, OWN fully reflects its versatility, specifically in:</p><p>- Multi-language support: OWN supports multiple languages ​​such as Java and GO, offering developers sufficient choice and insisting on an open source&nbsp;code;</p><p>- Multi-chain support: After the integration of EVM, 4 contracts, Native, NeoVM, WasmVM and EVM are now supported. With this, developers can migrate on-chain at a lower cost to achieve full integration with the Ethereum ecosystem and share with&nbsp;users;</p><p>- Multi-asset support: ONT is OWN’s native asset, while ONG is the on-chain fee that provides the Ontology Bridge to support the conversion of multiple&nbsp;assets;</p><p>- Multiple development tools: OWN offers users multiple development tools such as Web3 API, smart contracts, and blockchain browsers, with detailed documentation for developers’ reference.</p><p>The decentralized digital identity represented by ONT ID in OWN allows users to perform multiple functions such as asset management, on-chain governance, dApp, wealth management and&nbsp;lending.</p> Scenario-Based Trust Collaboration  The Trust of&nbsp;DAO <p>Identity-related solutions in the OWN infrastructure will play an important role when it comes to screening member structures in DAOs. Firstly, it can help to set the entry threshold. Users who want to become DAO members must pass KYC verification and achieve a high credit score before they can formally participate in any voting. This will filter out a large number of fake accounts and ensure that there is activity from users on the chain. In turn, the development of a DAO can be closely integrated with the services provided by Orange in OWN and reduce problems caused by centralization. This is achieved by determining the weight a vote carries in line with the user’s reputation. Users’ with high participation and a good credit score will have relatively greater rights to participate in governance.</p> NFT Circulation <p>Whilst assets are typically interchangeable, there is another non-fungible asset class that is typically represented by NFTs. From the earliest game props of CryptoKitties, to the series of avatars created by platforms such as the Bored Apes Yacht Club, NFTs have become a central product in the Web3 field, attracting a large number of creators and buyers. NFTs go through a series of circulation processes from generation, to attribution, and even destruction. Due to the value attached to NFTs, copyright, metadata, and attribution rights must be reviewed and defined. To this end, POD features methods for storing, organizing, managing, and using on-chain metadata to achieve entity-based storage, definition, and cross-platform data consistency.</p> DeFi Innovation <p>Decentralized finance (DeFi) is a remake of traditional finance in the blockchain field. Most notably, DeFi prevents the risk of malicious acts by centralized financial platforms. Among the many forms of DeFi, decentralized lending has become a key component. Decentralized lending lowers the high threshold for participation enforced by centralized institutions, as users do not need to provide a series of personal identification certificates. Instead, individuals only need to provide asset mortgages in the form of over-collateralization to complete loans. Evidently, over-collateralization is not an advanced financial resource allocation method. However, credit lending in the form of “borrowing” has begun to take shape through decentralized lending.</p><p><a href="https://wing.finance/">Wing Finance</a> was the first DeFi project for credit lending when the Inclusive Pool and OScore scoring system were launched. When users independently authorize OScore to read their own digital asset transaction records, holdings, KYC (real-name authentication) status, default, historical credit data, they will automatically generate their own OScore&nbsp;scores.</p><p>In order to ensure that credit lending is entirely secure, Inclusive Pool has established a risk control mechanism synchronously. Once a user defaults it will be included in OScore’s default list, but the defaulter’s private information is hidden and protected. At the same time, there are mechanisms such as liquidation and fines that allow users to complete credit lending through the OWN infrastructure while protecting their privacy. Individual users can also participate in governance to varying degrees based on their own reputation on the&nbsp;chain.</p> Metaverse Imagination <p>The metaverse refers to a virtual world parallel to the real world, creating monumental transformations of content production, economic systems, user experience, and physical world content. It builds an economic system based on blockchain technology, closely integrating the virtual world and the real world in the economic system, social system, and identity system.The metaverse presents a wide variety of manifestations, including games, virtual characters, and more, which have proven to be vastly popular across the&nbsp;globe.</p><p>The way in which users connect their real-world identities to the metaverse, while protecting their rights and personal assets, should be at the forefront of these rising innovations. ONT ID can help users to connect on-chain and off-chain identities, confirm the ownership of virtual assets, issue certificates, and further attribute them to users’ identities. These features will become an essential component for users to safely interact with each other in the metaverse, further promoting the establishment of trust and collaboration in virtual&nbsp;worlds.</p> Trust Collaboration will Come&nbsp;True <p>Decentralized trust collaboration will become crucial across all industries in order to eliminate the drawbacks of previous methods and bring true cost-free trust collaboration.</p><p>As the general blockchain infrastructure provided by Ontology for the Web3 ecosystem, OWN offers comprehensive infrastructure support, including basic blockchain underlying technologies, blockchain protocol-level technologies, and general-purpose tools. Moreover, OWN provides project parties with a platform that supplies developers with well-equipped tools and helps them to achieve faster results with less effort. These features, along with catering to the core demands of individual users, allow them to have independent control over their assets and&nbsp;data.</p><p>Trust infrastructures, such as OWN, can’t be built overnight. It is essential to ensure that the framework is flexible enough to function independently and when combined with other components to create a variety of different outcomes. OWN has the potential to combine these elements to achieve multi-chain co-prosperity and finally build the Web3 trust ecosystem that users&nbsp;deserve.</p><p>Follow us on social&nbsp;media!</p><p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/building-decentralized-society-own-your-value-c5be7088ac95">Building Decentralized Society: OWN YOUR VALUE</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 216M $OCEAN program to unlock an Ocean of data, with up to 125%&nbsp;APY  1. Introduction <p><a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean</a> Data Farming (DF) is launching. DF incentivizes for growth of data consume volume in the Ocean ecosystem. It rewards OCEAN to pool liquidity providers (stakers) as a function of consume volume and liquidity. It’s like DeFi liquidity mining, but tuned for data consumption. DF’s aim is to achieve a minimum supply of data for network effects to kick in, and once the network flywheel is spinning, to increase growth&nbsp;rate.</p><p>Expected APY can get up to 125% for any given week. To max out APY, you’ll need to work to help drive data consume volume&nbsp;(DCV).</p><p>DF has these&nbsp;phases:</p>  DF Alpha. Counting starts Thu June 16. 10K OCEAN rewards are budgeted per week. Rewards are distributed at the end of every week, for the activity of the previous week. It runs 4 weeks. The aim is to test technology, learn, and onboard data publishers.  DF Beta. Counting starts Thu July 14. Rewards are up to 100K OCEAN per week. It runs up to 20 weeks. The aim is to test the effect of larger incentives, learn, and refine the technology.  DF Main. Immediately follows DF Beta. Rewards are up to 718K OCEAN per week. It runs for decades; at least 215.7M OCEAN total is committed. Expected APY is 125% over many months (once fully ramped), staying generous over the long&nbsp;term.  <p>The rest of this post is organized as follows. Section 2 gives specific instructions on how to earn, by staking and claiming rewards. Section 3 describes the reward function. Section 4 describes DF phases and future evolution. Section 5 describes OCEAN emitted and expected APYs. Section 6 concludes. The appendices have further&nbsp;details.</p><p>It’s time to farm.🧑‍🌾🚜</p> 2. How to Earn in&nbsp;DF  2.1 Introduction <p>DF rewards depend on data consume volume (DCV) and stake. The higher DCV, the higher the reward. The higher the stake, the higher the reward. (Section 3 elaborates.)</p><p>This section describes how to earn. First we focus on the more passive parts of DF: staking and claiming. Then, we will describe how high APYs will take active&nbsp;work.</p>If you want to earn, you’ve got to put in the work. Left: seeding. Right: harvesting 2.2 How to&nbsp;LP <p>To provide liquidity, towards earning DF&nbsp;rewards:</p><p>1a. Go to <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market</a>&nbsp;webapp</p><p>1b. Find data assets that have consume volume (or that you expect will get consume&nbsp;volume)</p><p>1c. Add liquidity, i.e.&nbsp;stake</p>Where to add liquidity (stake) from <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market</a>&nbsp;webapp. 2.3 How to Claim&nbsp;Rewards <p>At the end of the weekly cycle (Thursday), the DF core team computes rewards for LPs using <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/df-py">this code</a>. Rewards are sent to the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/df-py/blob/main/contracts/DFRewards.sol">claims contract</a>, deployed to each <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/">Ocean-supported network</a> (Eth, Polygon,&nbsp;etc).</p><p>As an LP, here’s how to claim&nbsp;rewards:</p><p>2a. Go to <a href="https://df.oceandao.org">DF webapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal</p><p>2b. Connect your&nbsp;wallet</p><p>2c. For each network: select network, click “Claim”, sign the tx, get rewards:)</p><p>Rewards will accumulate over weeks, so you can claim rewards at your leisure. If you claim weekly, you can re-stake your rewards for compound&nbsp;gains.</p>Claim Portal of <a href="https://df.oceandao.org">DF Webapp</a>. It’s linked directly from <a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com">oceanprotocol.com</a>. 2.4 Active work to drive&nbsp;APY <p>Data Farming is not a wholly passive activity. The name of the game is to drive data consume volume (DCV). High APYs happen only when there is sufficiently high DCV. High DCV means publishing and consuming truly useful datasets (or algorithms).</p><p>Thus, if you really want to max out your&nbsp;APY:</p>  create &amp; publish datasets — or work with people who&nbsp;can  consume them — or work with people who&nbsp;can  go stake on them, and finally claim the&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Driving DCV for publishing &amp; consuming is your challenge. It will take real work. And then the reward is APY. It’s incentives all the way&nbsp;down:)</p> 3. Reward Function&nbsp;Info  3.1 Who Receives&nbsp;Rewards <p>Pool liquidity providers (LPs) receive rewards based on the reward function.</p> 3.2 Reward&nbsp;Function <p>The reward going to an LP for a given pool depends on LP’s liquidity (stake) and how much that dataset is being consumed ($ volume). Reward&nbsp;is:</p><p>RFij = Sij *&nbsp;Cj</p><p>where</p>  Sij is LP i’s stake in pool&nbsp;j  Cj is data consume volume for pool j, in&nbsp;$  LPs receive rewards pro-rata according to&nbsp;RFij  <p>There are rewards only on pools where the data has consume volume. The higher the consume volume, the more the rewards. The more you stake, the more the rewards. If you want to max out rewards, find pools that people find useful and consume. Even better, publish your own datasets:)</p><p>For a given week, OCEAN rewarded is bounded by the OCEAN budget, keeping APY ≤ 125%, and dis-incentivizing “wash consuming”. The Appendix has&nbsp;details.</p><p>This is the reward function for DF Round 1 (DF1). Based on learnings, we can expect it to evolve in rounds that follow DF2, DF3,&nbsp;etc.</p> 3.3 Pools that&nbsp;Qualify <p>It’s data pools that receive DF rewards. A data pool contains Ocean datatokens for given data service. That data service may be of any type — dataset (for static URIs) or algorithm for Compute-to-Data.</p><p>To qualify for DF, a data pool must follow these criteria:</p>  Asset &amp; pool must have been created by Ocean smart contracts, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts/blob/v4main/addresses/address.json">deployed</a> by OPF to production networks  Asset &amp; pool must be visible on <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean&nbsp;Market</a>  Pool must use OCEAN or H2O as basetoken  Asset can’t be in <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/list-purgatory/blob/main/policies/README.md">purgatory</a>   3.4 Clarifications <p>Q: What’s the difference between staking in Ocean Market, and Data&nbsp;Farming?</p><p>You can stake your OCEAN in any data pool in Ocean Market, as of its launch (Jun 8). As a liquidity provider, you get paid a % cut of all swap&nbsp;fees.</p><p>Then, DF is an extra incentive: it gives rewards based on amount staked and the data’s $ consume volume. This post elaborates on&nbsp;DF.</p><p>Q: when exactly does counting start and finish, for a given&nbsp;week?</p><p>The counting starts at 12.01am on Thursday, and ends at 11.59pm on the following Wednesday.</p><p>Q: I staked for just one day. What rewards might I&nbsp;expect?</p><p>At least 50 snapshots are randomly taken throughout the week. If you’ve staked just one day, and all else being equal, you should expect 1/7 the rewards compared to the full 7&nbsp;days.</p><p>Q: The datatoken price may change throughout the week. What price is taken in the DCV calculation?</p><p>The price is taken at the same time as each consume. E.g. if a data asset has three consumes, where price was 1 OCEAN when the first consume happened, and the price was 10 OCEAN when the other consumes happened, then the total DCV for the asset is 1 + 10 + 10 =&nbsp;21.</p><p>Q: Can the rewards function change during a given&nbsp;week?</p><p>No. At the beginning of a new DF round (DF1, DF2, etc), rules are laid out, either implicitly if no change from previous round, or explicitly in a blog post if there are new rules. This is: rewards function, bounds, etc. Then teams stake, buy data, consume, etc. And LPs are given DF rewards based on staking, DCV, etc at the end of the week. Overall cycle time is one&nbsp;week.</p><p>Caveat: it’s no at least in theory! Sometimes there may be tweaks if there is community consensus, or a&nbsp;bug.</p> 4. DF Phases &amp; Evolution <p>This section elaborates on DF phases, and how DF will&nbsp;evolve.</p> 4.1 Phase: DF&nbsp;Alpha <p>DF Alpha runs for 4 weeks. The budget is 10K OCEAN per week. This is a conservative amount <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-verifying-token-based-systems-c33eca757ecf">by design</a>, as the primary aim is for everyone to&nbsp;learn:</p>  For data publishers to publish datasets (and pools), and finding consumers of their&nbsp;data.  For Data Farmers — anyone staking in an eligible pool — to learn more about Data Farming process, and to observe how rewards are received.  For the DF Core team to identify issues in the DF process, and resolve them before the stakes are&nbsp;high.  <p>While the budget is conservative, APY may still hit 125% in scenarios with low or moderate&nbsp;stake.</p> 4.2 Phase: DF&nbsp;Beta <p>DF Beta aims to test the effect of larger incentives, learn, and refine the technology.</p><p>It will run at least 10 weeks, and up to 20 weeks. The budget is at least 10K OCEAN per week, up to 100K OCEAN per&nbsp;week.</p><p>The DF Core Team will decide the amount each week, based on learnings so far. The aim is allocate OCEAN efficiently to activities that drive data consume volume in a beneficial way, rather than to mal-intentioned actors gaming the system. We hope to ramp to 100K OCEAN quickly and to complete in minimal time; but let’s&nbsp;see.</p><p>APY may hit up to&nbsp;125%.</p> 4.3 Phase: DF&nbsp;Main <p>DF Main is designed to give an APY of 125% until the amount staked gets super-high, with a cap according to the Bitcoin-like curve described below.</p><p>Here’s where the funds come from. OCEAN total supply is <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/https-blog-oceanprotocol-com-ocean-tokenomics-ii-faf05854314b">1.41 billion tokens</a>. Ever since Ocean was launched, <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/tech-whitepaper.pdf">51% of total OCEAN supply</a> (719M OCEAN) has been earmarked for the Ocean community; 30% of this will go directly to DF Main (=15.3% of total supply, or 215.7M&nbsp;OCEAN).</p><p>The baseline emissions schedule determines the weekly OCEAN budget for this phase. The schedule is like Bitcoin, including a half-life of 4 years. Unlike Bitcoin, there is a burn-in&nbsp;period:</p>  The curve initially gets a multiplier of 10% for 0–12&nbsp;months  Then, it transitions to multiplier of 25% for 0–6&nbsp;months  Then, a multiplier of 50% for 0–6&nbsp;months  Finally, a multiplier of&nbsp;100%.  <p>Each transition is made under control of a multisig by&nbsp;OPF.</p><p>The burn-in period <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-verifying-token-based-systems-c33eca757ecf">ratchets up value-at-risk over time</a>. It gives us time to learn and for future scope to get built, before full-blown emissions.</p><p>APY may hit up to 125%, especially for weeks where the OCEAN budget is comparatively high relative to the amount of&nbsp;stake.</p> 4.4. DF Evolution <p>With each weekly cycle, the DF core team may tune the Reward Function or make other changes based on learnings.</p><p>After DF Main is shipped, the DF core team will expand scope. Current plans&nbsp;are:</p>  DF Partners Program — While other DF rewards come from the baseline OCEAN budget, these are additional token rewards coming from Ocean’s collaborators: H2O stable asset, storage networks, L1 chains, and more. APY will sum across these; it may go much higher than the target 125% from baseline&nbsp;OCEAN.  Add rewards for fixed-price data.  Add rewards for free/open data.  DF Crunch Program — <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions">Kaggle</a>-style data science competitions. Initially, there will be a weekly reward to the best predictor of&nbsp;OCEAN.  Over time, DF changes will slow. Then, we will move to automate DF further <a href="https://a16z.com/2020/01/09/progressive-decentralization-crypto-product-management/">towards full decentralization</a>.  <blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/trentmc0/status/1534824753231544322">@trentmc0</a></p></blockquote> 5. Walk-Through Numbers <p>This section walks through example numbers. The first subsection describes OCEAN disbursement with the most aggressive possible schedule; the subsection after describes a conservative schedule. The likely scenario is somewhere in between. A third subsection describes possible&nbsp;APYs.</p> 5.1 OCEAN Schedule with Aggressive Ramp <p>Here’s a scenario that goes through DF the most aggressively: DF Beta takes 10 weeks and emits 100K OCEAN per week, and each multiplier in DF Main time takes 0 time (goes to 100% multiplier immediately). All plots are computed from <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_1SUpImOxVY8lVEinExzTVHQRjKev7519sWkzMiCCB4/edit#gid=0">this Google&nbsp;Sheet</a>.</p><p>The image below shows the first half-year for the aggressive-ramp scenario. The y-axis is OCEAN released each week. It’s log-scaled to easily see the differences. The x-axis is time, measured in weeks. We can see the distinct phases for DF Alpha, DF Beta, then DF&nbsp;Main.</p>OCEAN released to DF per week — first 0.5 years, aggressive ramp<p>The image below is like the previous, but now shows for the first five years. DF Main starts at week 14 with full-blown OCEAN emissions. Recall that DF Main emission follows a Bitcoin-style curve where the rewards decrease according to an exponential with a 4-year half-life. With each DM main multiplier taking 0 time, it means that half of all the DF Main rewards are distributed in its first 4&nbsp;years.</p>OCEAN released to DF per week — first 5 years, aggressive ramp<p>The image below shows the total OCEAN released by DF for aggressive-ramp scenario. The y-axis is log-scaled to capture both the small initial rewards and exponentially larger values later on. The x-axis is also log-scaled so that we can more readily see how the curve converges over&nbsp;time.</p>Total OCEAN released to DF — long term, aggressive ramp 5.2 OCEAN Schedule with Conservative Ramp <p>Here the opposite-extreme scenario, having a highly conservative ramp of DF rewards. DF Alpha runs at 10K OCEAN per week, over four weeks. DF Beta runs at 10K OCEAN per week, over 20 weeks. DF Main starts at the 10% multiplier, transitions to 25% at 12 months, to 50% at 18 months, and to 100% at 24 months. The image below shows the first five&nbsp;years.</p>OCEAN released to DF per week — first 5 years, conservative ramp<p>The image below shows the total OCEAN emitted for DF. The y-axis is log-scaled to capture both the small initial rewards and exponentially larger values later on. The x-axis is also log-scaled so that we can more readily see how the curve converges over&nbsp;time.</p><p>DF Beta starts at week 8, where the curve gets steeper. DF Main starts at week 20, where the curve is again more gradual. The curve gets steeper with each multiplier ratchet at weeks 48, 72, and 98, finally arriving at a shape just like the Bitcoin exponential curve.</p>Total OCEAN released to DF — long term, conservative ramp 5.3 Example&nbsp;APYs <p>The table below explores possible APYs, calculated from <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_1SUpImOxVY8lVEinExzTVHQRjKev7519sWkzMiCCB4/edit#gid=187527164">this Google Sheet</a>. We assume 2.2M OCEAN staked in week 0, OCEAN staking growth initially 20% per week, growth rate reduces by 5% relative per week, and aggressive ramp.</p><p>Here are the highlights. In the first week that DF gets generous, APY is 125%. It stays pegged at 125% from week 8 until week 27. After that the amount of OCEAN staked has become sufficiently high that OCEAN released is the limiting factor to APY. APY gently reduces over time, to 66% one year in, and is still at 21.68% five years in. This APY does not account for other positive-APY factors such as OCEAN price rising; or negative-APY factors such as impermanent loss.</p>Expected APYs (aggressive ramp) 6. Conclusion <p>Ocean Data Farming incentivizes for data consume volume in the Ocean ecosystem. It gives expected APYs of up to 125%, and is designed to last for many&nbsp;decades.</p>Seed, harvest, then fill your bins. Image: #McConaghyFarms Appendix: Who are Data&nbsp;Farmers <p>A Data Farmer is anyone who adds liquidity (stake) to a qualified data pool, to receive&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Various actors in the Ocean ecosystem are therefore Data Farmers, each with their own unique advantages.</p>  Data Publishers can be Data Farmers. You’ve published a dataset, added liquidity, and got the dataset to be qualified for DF. Now, your liquidity will count for DF rewards. Your advantage is your understanding of how much a dataset might get consumed, as you published the&nbsp;dataset.  Data Curators / Stakers can be Data Farmers. You don’t have to publish data or consume data to get DF rewards. Just simply stake on the datasets eligible for DF rewards that you believe will offer you the best returns, ie datasets with good consume volume and where you can get a decent proportion of liquidity.  Data Consumers can be Data Farmers. If you only bought and consumed a dataset without adding liquidity, you’re not eligible for DF rewards. However as by consuming the dataset, you know its usefulness better than most, and are therefore well positioned to predict its consume volume. You can capitalize on this knowledge by staking on the most promising and eligible datasets, making you eligible for DF&nbsp;rewards.  Data Traders can be Data Farmers. If you’re just buying and selling data assets without staking, you’re not eligible for rewards. However if you’ve worked to understand the relative value of datasets enough, you can capitalize on this knowledge by staking on the most promising eligible datasets, making you eligible for DF&nbsp;rewards.  <p>We are all Data Farmers.&nbsp;👩‍🌾</p>You, Data Farmer. Image: #McConaghyFarms Appendix: Wash Consume&nbsp;Attack <p>DF solves “wash consume” attacks by making them unprofitable. Here are&nbsp;details.</p><p>Wash trading is where a malicious actor trades with themselves to fake trading volume, in cases that they are rewarded for high trading&nbsp;volume.</p><p>The equivalent in Ocean is wash consuming, where people buy and consume datasets for themselves, to get rewarded for high data consume volume. There are many possible ways to combat this; most require manual intervention.</p><p>Our solution is: knowing that there’s a maximum x% APY, then set a rule: for a data asset to be eligible for DF, it must have a % consume fee of y%. Our current calculations put this value around 3%; therefore this is the value of <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/fees/#ocean-community-fee">Ocean Community Order Fee</a>. This fee goes to the Ocean community every time a data asset is consumed.</p> Appendix: Reward Function&nbsp;Details  Candidate Reward&nbsp;Function <p>This section describes the reward function — a measurable formula that each actor can individually optimize&nbsp;for.</p><p>The initial reward function is given in the next subsection. Here’s the thought process that led to&nbsp;it.</p><p>What if the reward function was simply for the number of datasets added? Here’s the problem: people would create large numbers of random or garbage datasets. This doesn’t add value, of&nbsp;course.</p><p>What if it was the trading volume of a dataset, measured in OCEAN or $? This has two problems. First, most volume is speculative. This isn’t real value creation from a data perspective, it’s just money sloshing around in a (nearly) closed chamber. Furthermore, high trading volume of a token may not be a great proxy for value creation of that token, as we’ve seen with several scam-coins in&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>Where is the value creation for data? We’ve arrived at: it’s when people are actually consuming a data asset. Here’s an example. Researchers may have data for thousands of people; for each person there is genetic information, age, and whether the person has Parkinson’s. From this, the researchers build a model mapping genetic information and age to the chance of getting Parkinson’s. Then general practitioners use this model for early-stage screening. The model can report the chance of someone getting Parkinson’s; if it’s high they can take measures to slow the onset. This is an example of value creation, via consuming data. There are countless examples across many verticals.</p><p>We’ve established that consuming data is useful to aim for. What should be the specific measure? A first approach is the number of consumes of a data asset in a time period. But that doesn’t capture that some assets may be far more expensive than others. For example, compare a $1 dataset is bought and sold 1000 times, versus a $1000 dataset bought and sold 1000 times. Under this measure, all else being equal, both datasets would lead to the same reward. This is not desirable.</p> Towards a Chosen Reward&nbsp;Function <p>Better yet is consume volume, expressed in $ or OCEAN. Ocean Market uses OCEAN so we will focus on that. Then: consume volume = (# times a data asset was consumed in a time interval) * (price of that data asset, in OCEAN). This accounts for some assets being more valuable than others, yet avoids speculation volume.</p><p>Thus, consume volume (in OCEAN) is the key measure to incentivize for.</p><p>We can refine the incentive further. Ocean V3 introduced datatoken pools. These enabled automatic discovery of the price of data, and helped curation of data (higher liquidity in a pool is a useful signal). More liquidity in a datatoken pool means lower slippage when buying datatokens. In short, more liquidity is&nbsp;good.</p><p>Therefore liquidity of datatoken pools (in OCEAN) is the secondary measure to incentivize for.</p> Chosen Reward&nbsp;Function <p>We combine consume volume and liquidity into an overall DF Reward Function.</p><p>RFij = Sij *&nbsp;Cj</p><p>where:</p>  RFij = relative reward going to LP i in pool&nbsp;j  Sij= LP i’s relative stake in pool j = (LP’s $-value stake in pool j) / (total $-value stake in pool j). We express in $ terms, to allow for for pools with OCEAN or H2O as basetoken.  Cj = consume volume of data asset in pool j, spread among pools with that asset = (price of datatoken j in $ terms) * (# of consumes during the week) / (# pools with that data&nbsp;asset)  <p>Actors receive rewards pro-rata according to RFij, subject to the bounds described below.</p><p>We considered log() of each term, to incentivize for a variety of assets. Alas, this causes Sybil&nbsp;attacks.</p> Bounding Reward <p>For a given week, the OCEAN rewarded is bounded&nbsp;by:</p>  OCEAN budget for that week. E.g. for DF Alpha, this is 10K per&nbsp;week  APY bounded to ≤ 125%. An annual percent yield (APY) of 125% means a weekly percent yield (WPY) of 1.57171%.  Ensuring that wash consuming is unprofitable.  <p>Implementation of these bounds includes:</p>  Total OCEAN rewards distributed for that week = min(OCEAN_budget_week, total_staked *&nbsp;WPY)  APY ≤ 125% for each LP at each&nbsp;pool  3% consume fee that goes to the Ocean community  And more.  <p>For a given week, any OCEAN in the budget that was not distributed due to bounds will be saved in the DAO treasury for future DF rewards or other related community initiatives.</p> Appendix: Why&nbsp;Now? <blockquote>Q: DF was first <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/announcing-ocean-data-farming-26c036d12f20">announced</a> right after Ocean V3 launch, more than a year ago. Why is it only shipping&nbsp;now?</blockquote><p>Here’s the answer. A pre-requisite for DF was for V3 to be hardened / stabilized further. Then, rug pulls happened in V3. Staking wasn’t safe enough to incentivize on with&nbsp;DF.</p><p>OceanONDA V4 <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-v4-one-sided-staking-93988f65e378">One-Sided Staking</a> solved this. It <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceanonda-v4-production-has-arrived-cb4fe8faaf39">went into production yesterday</a> (June 8, 2022). Now, we’re ready for Data&nbsp;Farming.</p>Let’s go 🚜🚜🚜!

<p><a href="https://collab.land/">Collab.Land</a>, a user-friendly, tokenised, community-management system, has announced a partnership with <a href="https://nuggets.life/">Nuggets</a>, a self-sovereign verified digital identity and payment platform, to allow users greater portability, interoperability, and control over their web3 reputation and DAO participation based on&nbsp;merit.</p><p>The integration will ultimately enable the portability of web3 verified credentials (VCs). While VCs typically refer to cryptographically verified, tamper-resistant credentials such as a passport or ID, web3 VCs can represent anything from Discord server badges to tokenised attestations of skills, character traits, membership or accomplishments.</p><p>Nuggets’ introduction comes amid a growing appetite from community members to build their web3 reputation and digital identity and port it across various online communities. By integrating Nuggets’ ID system, Collab.Land bypasses the need for users to have to rebuild their reputation from scratch each time they join a new community or&nbsp;DAO.</p><p>Collab.Land started as a means for anyone to build tools to manage their community via bot integrations and has since snowballed. The service — which recently announced plans to decentralise and become a DAO — now boasts over 3.5 million users across its various communities including <a href="https://axieinfinity.com/">Axie infinity</a>, <a href="https://boredapeyachtclub.com/">Bored Ape Yacht Club</a>, and <a href="https://nbatopshot.com/">NBA Top Shot</a>. As it stands, over 100 new communities are adding Collab.Land every&nbsp;day.</p><p>Decentralised, portable reputation is something that’s necessary for fulfilling the promise of web3, as well as being able to onboard DAO members based on merit. Reputation is everything when it comes to DAO governance, therefore, being able to attach a users’ DAO admittance, privileges, and voting rights to their Nuggets ID via SSI, which can be used across platforms and DAOs demonstrates how portable reputation is coming to life&nbsp;today.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamessyoung/">James Young</a>, Founder and CEO Collab.Land commented: “Our partnership with Nuggets illustrates a critical step in our journey to decentralise. Giving users control of their online reputation and allowing them to go beyond the confines of centralised platforms fits perfectly with that goal. Reputation and community can unlock many opportunities in web3, from DAO participation through to content moderation, and being able to verify standing in this space represents a significant boon for&nbsp;users.”</p><p>Nuggets enables individuals to secure their digital identity and associated finances through a self-sovereign identity and payment solution that serves as a reusable, interoperable and verified digitalID for Web 2.0, web3 and as a non-custodial cache for digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>This information can be ‘shared’ with the required parties without revealing any personally-identifying information. This is achieved via zero-knowledge proofs, a cryptographic technique that allows one party to verify data to another party without disclosing any information beyond the capacity to verify said&nbsp;data.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alastairijohnson/">Alastair Johnson</a>, Founder and CEO at Nuggets, Said: “Reputation is paramount in web3. Being able to provide cryptographic proof of your credentials in a way that safeguards privacy and provides security perfectly aligns with the ethos of web3, and we’re thrilled to be working with Collab.Land to be making this a reality.”</p><p>If you’re a business looking to implement reusable digital identity, and for better ways to protect customer data, you can now enable Nuggets worldwide.</p><p>Get in touch and find out how at <a href="mailto:partners@nuggets.life">partners@nuggets.life</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.nuggets.life/collab-land-enables-nuggets-verified-self-sovereign-digital-identity-8f99f35a13cf">Collab.Land enables Nuggets’ verified self-sovereign digital identity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.nuggets.life">Nuggets</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>False assumptions and misconceptions circulate in the media about the potential and risks of SSI. In this article, we address some of those misconceptions and summarize the most important core aspects of SSI. By doing so, we create a clear picture of what SSI is and, above all, what SSI is not and should not be.</p>



<p>Can SSI data be stolen and used without my knowledge? Is SSI enabling a data market and further misuse of our data?</p>



<p>The focus of SSI lies on self-determined use and simultaneous data security for the individual. At the same time, data economy is important: the user should only ever have to disclose the necessary minimum of information about himself that is necessary for the use of a service. In summary, with SSI you can only decide who you give your data to, but not what happens to it – which is not a technical question, but is due to the trust frameworks and the implementation of policies. This is regulated via certification and approval, as this creates trust in the involved actors of the ecosystem. SSI itself does not offer any general protection against data misuse. Nevertheless, it represents the possibility of managing one’s own data securely and independently using the principle of decentralization. The services to which personal data is transmitted are ultimately also bound by the General Data Protection Regulation. You can not only decide to whom you give the data, but also how (e.g. as ZKP or as VP).</p>



<p>Why does SSI offer more privacy than current systems?</p>



<p>Because we don’t outsource our data to hundreds of platforms, but manage it centrally. Ideally, hacking a service would not result in the capture of thousands of user profiles with sensitive data, only worthless peer-to-peer connects. This creates more privacy and personal responsibility for personal data. Christopher Allan’s first article on SSI already says: The user can and should decide for himself who he or she shows personal data to and for what purpose. The prerequisite for this is interoperability and portability of identities. In a way, this idea is the core of SSI. But the statement that as a user I have complete sovereignty over my digital identity is often misunderstood and is wrong in this form.</p>



<p>Does SSI make me loose my anonymity?</p>



<p>Which data a service requests depends on the service and the legal requirements. If the service provider is not bound by a real name obligation, i.e. not obliged to query and check a real name, he cannot demand this from the user either (according to the General Data Protection Regulation). If he does this anyway, the user must agree and a specific reason must be given.</p>



<p>Why does SSI have nothing to do with blockchain?</p>



<p>SSI is often equated with blockchain technology. This creates the impression that SSI can only work together with blockchain. However, this is not the case. We have summarized a comprehensive explanation here: <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/dezentrale-identitaten-not-blockchain/">https://jolocom.io/blog/dezentrale-identitaten-not-blockchain/</a></p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Aside from the convergence of decentralized and centralized identities and the return of policy-based access controls, here is my #3 on the list of hot topics at EIC 2022: Identity proofing &amp; fraud reduction. These are two closely related topics, with fraud covering not only the initial proof of an identity, but also the recurring access and user behavior.</p>
 Massive market uptake 
<p>We have seen a massive uptake in both fields, with identity proofing also having a close link to decentralized identities and the reusable proofs in identity wallets. Identity proofing as the reliable verification of the identity of someone, e.g., via video identification, has seen a significant uptake, as well as the number and maturity of fraud reduction solutions, which we refer to as FRIP (Fraud Reduction Intelligence Platforms).</p>
<p>To find out more about these topics, have a look at this webinar on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/facilitating_business_with_state_of_the_art_identity_proofing_solutions">Facilitating Business with State-of-the-Art Identity Proofing Solutions</a>, this video on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/iam-essentials-identity-proofing-verification">IAM Essentials: Identity Proofing and Verification</a>, this webinar on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/choosing_the_right_fraud_tool">Choosing the Right Fraud Reduction Intelligence Tool in a Digitally Evolving Economy</a>, and this Leadership Compass on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80127/fraud-reduction-intelligence-platforms">Fraud Reduction Intelligence Platforms</a>.</p>
 Mainstream technologies 
<p>The most important trend, though, is that both technologies are becoming mainstream. Identity proofing, so far, has been mostly used in heavily regulated use cases such as the finance industry or by telcos for mobile phone contracts. The majority of FRIP use cases still is also in the finance industry and in some fields of retail. This is about to change. We observe an uptake in interest and adoption in other industries, for workforce and business partner fraud analytics, and for identity proofing, e.g., for the remote workforce.</p>
<p>HR and IAM processes can become modernized and optimized by applying such technologies, as the security posture can be increased. It is time for every organization to put more attention on the potential of these technologies for their processes and security.</p>

 Introduction <p>There is a greater emphasis on privacy and security today than ever before as more people strive to preserve their digital identities from misuse by cybercriminals and organizations that harvest personal data for advertising purposes.</p><p>In parallel, governments and regulators are pushing to improve online privacy&nbsp;, resulting in the proliferation of data protection legislations like the GDPR in the EU. As a result, both from a legal and ethical perspective, there is a growing urgency among companies to protect individuals’ privacy by empowering them to decide how and where their data is&nbsp;used.</p><p>An integral part of this process is a consent management system that explicitly informs users about how their data will be used, so users can make an informed decision about which data usage policies they agree to. While there are many consent management systems available today, not all of them are geared for <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/web-2-0-vs-web-3-0-a-bridge-between-the-past-and-the-future-c99668c1e2f0">Web 3.0</a> — widely regarded as the future of the Internet.</p><p>In this blog, we will be talking about the benefits of implementing consent management using an emerging standard known as <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a>. We will also dive deep into Affinidi’s consent manager and what it can do for&nbsp;you.</p> What is Consent Management? <p>Consent management is the process or system where customers determine what personal data they are willing to share with a business and/or third parties. This user empowerment is a central theme of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity</a>, a powerful framework that allows users to be the ultimate administrators of their personal data. Further, they can determine what parts of their data are shared, thereby bringing users to the center of the data transaction.</p><p>Currently, much of consent management is managed through browser cookies. But this method is far from perfect because users can’t granularly choose to disclose only some parts of their information. Moreover, some browsers are planning to phase out certain types of cookies as early as 2023, due in part to concerns about customer&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Bridging this gap is essential, and this is where Verifiable Credentials (VCs) come into&nbsp;play.</p> Why Consent Management through Verifiable Credentials? <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/8-reasons-to-use-verifiable-credentials-300833276b52">Verifiable credentials</a> are a machine-readable and tamper-proof W3C standard specification for storing and managing personal information. They come with features that are designed for managing digital identity in a web 3.0 infrastructure. This is why implementing consent management through VCs can help create a streamlined system for the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Also, here are more reasons why VCs are ideal for a consent management system.</p><p>Machine-readable</p><p>One of the key applications of web 3.0 is the Semantic Web, an advanced metadata system that structures and arranges all kinds of data in such a way that it’s readable by both machines and&nbsp;humans.</p><p>VCs fit this bill perfectly as they can be read by both machines and humans. Moreover, machine readability enables a host of opportunities for automating business logic surrounding user content and data&nbsp;sharing.</p><p>Supports Selective Disclosure</p><p>VCs support <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/a-detailed-guide-on-selective-disclosure-87b89cea1602">selective disclosure</a>, in which a user can disclose only the selected data that he or she wants to. For example, if a user wants to disclose just their email ID and not their name or gender, VCs enable&nbsp;this.</p><p>Tamper-proof</p><p>VCs are tamper-proof and can’t be altered unilaterally without destroying the contents. However, they can be revoked by the issuer or the VCs can expire, and both situations require the issuance of a new&nbsp;VC.</p><p>As a verifier or manager of user consents, you can rest assured that if the VC is valid and not expired, then it is authentic.</p><p>Follows the Principles of Decentralized Identity</p><p>Managing consent through VCs follows the principle of decentralized identity as there are no central authorities involved. Further, these VCs are capable of being shared without using a single repository or database.</p><p>Every VC is stored by the user in his or her wallet — either custodially or on the edge — and hence can be highly decentralized.</p><p>Compliant with Privacy&nbsp;Laws</p><p>Established by the EU, the GDPR aims to give individuals complete control over their personal data, including with whom and how they are shared. Three important data protection and privacy principles of GDPR&nbsp;are:</p>  Giving users control over the transactional aspects of their digital identity including its monetization.  Free movement of data across the union to enable commerce.  The right to be forgotten.  <p>VCs adhere to these principles as users control their data and the same can be shared with anyone in any part of the world securely by the&nbsp;user.</p><p>Customer-centric Solution</p><p>Existing identity solutions such as <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/compare-and-contrast-federated-identity-vs-self-sovereign-identity-227a85cbab18">federated identity</a>, are designed to give businesses control over all their users’ data rather than putting control in the hands of the customer.</p><p>VCs reverse this by putting customers at the center of every data transaction. Such customer-centric solutions are increasingly demanded in the world of web 3.0, and expectations of privacy and portability are expected to continue to rise as the widespread adoption of cryptography shifts the balance of ownership towards end customers.</p><p>Secure</p><p>VCs use <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/role-of-public-key-cryptography-in-self-sovereign-identity-8c2dc37a2bf3">public-key cryptography</a> to secure the contents, making them well-protected from hackers and untrusted third&nbsp;parties.</p><p>Further, the effort and resources needed to expose the data of a single VC are extremely high in proportion to the reward. Compare this to the traditional system of centralized database, in which, gaining access to one database provides access to potentially millions of customers’ information.</p><p>All these make it clear why the concepts of decentralized identity provide a far safer option for storing sensitive data.</p> Introducing Affinidi’s Consent&nbsp;Manager <p>Affinidi’s Consent Manager is a privacy and data protection solution that enables application owners and organizations to manage end-customers’ consent through&nbsp;VCs.</p><p>Our consent manager is designed as a plug-and-play solution that can integrate with your existing or future applications, and can scale well with your business growth as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Broadly speaking, Affinidi’s consent manager empowers administrators to create consent policies and surface them to users to get their consent. Once the user agrees, a VC is generated and stored automatically in the user’s wallet and is also shared with the administrator.</p><p>In turn, the administrator can generate a verifiable presentation with some or all of the VCs, and even share proofs of consent with regulatory authorities if required in an&nbsp;audit.</p> Who should use the Consent&nbsp;Manager? <p>Affinidi’s consent manager is a generic application that can be used by different entities to get the benefits that matter to&nbsp;them.</p><p>It is a good choice&nbsp;for,</p>  Developers who prefer to use a plug-and-play module for managing consent across their websites and applications.  Users who want to control what information they share and with whom, in order to avail specific services from providers.  Communities and individuals who want to build applications in web&nbsp;3.0.  Web apps that require authentication, so users can consent to avail the services offered through the&nbsp;app.  Organizations that need to generate reports/audit trails for consent management  <p>If you fall into any of the above categories, you may wonder why you should use Affinidi’s consent manager over other solutions.</p> Why Use Affinidi’ s Consent&nbsp;Manager? <p>Affinidi’s consent manager offers many unique features and benefits. Here’s a look at some of&nbsp;them.</p>  Provides a tamper-evident and secure way to manage&nbsp;consent  Makes it easy to create, update and delete policies, in&nbsp;runtime  Follows the principles of decentralized identity management  All modules can be reused across applications  Integrates with Web and&nbsp;ReactJS  Meets compliance with GDPR and other privacy and security regulations  Comes with extensive documentation to quickly find all that you&nbsp;need.  Backed by technical support on&nbsp;Discord  Future-ready and scalable for all web 3.0 applications  Supports extensive audits for different internal and external stakeholders.  <p>Now that you know what you gain with our consent manager, let’s get down to the technical aspects.</p> High-Level Architecture <p>Affinidi’s consent manager has a simple architecture as it comprises only a small number of modules. This is what makes it easy to implement across any application stack.</p><p>Here’s an overview of the architecture.</p> Components of the Consent&nbsp;Manager <p>As you can see, the consent manager comprises of two important modules and they&nbsp;are:</p>  Consent Manager UI Widget — A pop-up widget that allows users to view the consent policy and approve it. The user can determine the start date for the consent. This is stored as a VC in the user’s cloud wallet first, and on approval, a signed VC is sent to the&nbsp;admin.  Consent Manager Admin UI Widget — A UI that allows the admin to create the consent policy. The signed VC from the user is stored in the admin’s wallet for future reference.  <p>Other than these two, we have the optional Consent Management Admin Backend where you can store consent templates to simplify the dev experience. This module also connects to the underlying database. Depending on your implementation, you can choose to connect the Consent Manager UI Widget directly with the Consent Management Admin&nbsp;Backend.</p> Workflow of the Consent&nbsp;Manager <p>Moving on, let’s see the consent manager workflow.</p><p>Step 1: Create a&nbsp;Consent</p><p>The workflow for the consent manager starts with the Admin widget. This is where the Admin of a website or application creates a consent policy for the&nbsp;users.</p><p>In this widget, you can create the contents of the consent, the country of jurisdiction, and any other attributes that come with&nbsp;it.</p><p>Once you’re happy with the consent, save&nbsp;it.</p><p>You can also copy it to a clipboard if you have to collaborate with other team members or get approval from&nbsp;others.</p><p>Step 2: Users View the&nbsp;Consent</p><p>After the admin saves the content, every user who visits the website or web app can see the consent through the Consent Manager UI Widget. This will pop-up as soon as a user visits the website or wants to use a web app for the first&nbsp;time.</p><p>The attributes mentioned by the Admin will be visible to the user, and he or she can choose which of the attributes must be sent to the Admin. Further, the user can determine the start date of the consent and the same will be included in the&nbsp;VC.</p><p>After entering these details and reading through the consent, the user can choose to press the “Next” or “Close”&nbsp;button.</p><p>If the user chooses the “Close” button, it will be construed that the user has not consented to the terms and conditions mentioned. On the other hand, if the user consents, he or she can press the “Next”&nbsp;button.</p><p>Step 3: Enter the Phone Number or Email&nbsp;Address</p><p>When the user chooses the “Next” button from the previous screen, he/she will be prompted to enter the email address or phone number associated with their <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/5-reasons-to-use-an-identity-wallet-c289ba2980cf">digital wallet</a>, as the VC will be created and stored automatically in&nbsp;it.</p><p>A quick note here. A digital wallet is a mobile/desktop app where a user can safely and securely store his or her digital credentials.</p><p>After entering the email address or phone number associated with the wallet, the user clicks the “Next” button. If the user doesn’t have a wallet, a new wallet will be created automatically in Affinidi’s cloud&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>The consent VC will be shared in this wallet and the user can subsequently access it with the email address or phone number. While logging in the first time, a confirmation code will be sent to the user, and this has to be entered in the next&nbsp;screen.</p><p>If the confirmation code matches, a “Success” message is displayed.</p><p>As soon as the VC is created, it is also shared with the administrator, and this entity can choose to store it in its wallet. This is later sent to verifiers like regulatory authorities to prove compliance with existing legislation. This VC will contain the DID of the administrator to prove that consent was given to the website/web app maintained by the&nbsp;admin.</p><p>Thus, this is the workflow in Affinidi’s consent&nbsp;manager.</p> Upcoming features <p>At Affinidi, we constantly strive to create impactful applications. Our roadmap for this product includes the following features</p>  End date of&nbsp;consent  Automating data sharing or storing based on consent and revocation of&nbsp;consent.  Customizing the look and&nbsp;feel  Localization support  Consent management without email id/phone&nbsp;number  Report generation  Revocation  Customer-facing widgets can be made open source for the community to work&nbsp;on.  <p>If you’re looking for specific features, please reach out to us on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ffV5ctBMXr">Discord</a>, and we will be happy to include them as&nbsp;well.</p><p>To learn more about such Web 3.0 and digital identity-based products, <a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1FhRGo3c4T-erYRGOSRyzCQ8oa2v">join our mailing&nbsp;list</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/building-a-consent-management-system-for-web-3-0-39e79b792eea">Building a Consent Management System for Web 3.0</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Microservices are not everyone’s cup of tea, and they shouldn’t be. Not every problem can or should be solved by microservices. Sometimes building a simple monolith is a far better option. Microservices are solutions for use cases where scale and scalability are important. A few years ago, microservices were all the rage, made popular, especially by companies like Netflix, Spotify, Google, etc. While the hype has died down a bit, genuine use cases still exist. With ongoing advances in cloud computing technologies, building microservices as cloud-native services is the way to go due to many benefits.</p>

<p>Today we will look at building a cloud-native Java microservice stack that utilizes a service mesh to provide most of the distributed system needs and we’ll deploy it to the cloud using Kubernetes.</p>

<p>So here is what we will do today:</p>

 
   Build a Java microservice stack using JHipster, Spring Boot, and Spring Cloud 
   Create a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster 
   Deploy Istio service mesh to the cluster

 Why build cloud-native microservices using a service mesh? 

<p>Before we dive into building a cloud-native microservice stack, let’s look at what a service mesh is and the benefits of using one.</p>

<p>A service mesh provides features to help with common distributed microservice challenges. Like service discovery, routing, load balancing, and so on. Today we will be using <a href="https://istio.io/">Istio</a>, one of the most popular service mesh solutions available. Istio is tailored for distributed application architectures, especially those you might run in Kubernetes. Istio plays nicely with Kubernetes, so nicely that you might think that it’s part of the Kubernetes platform itself. Istio isn’t the only service mesh around; we also have platforms like <a href="https://linkerd.io/">Linkerd</a> and <a href="https://www.consul.io/">Consul</a>, which are also quite popular.</p>

<p>Istio specifically provides the following features.</p>

 
   Secure service-to-service communication over TLS. Of course, with support for identity-based authentication and authorization. 
   Service discovery, so that your microservices can discover each other. 
   Automatic load balancing for the services 
   Traffic control features like routing, circuit breaking, retries, fail-overs, and fault injection. 
   A pluggable policy layer that can enforce stuff like access control, rate limiting, A/B testing, traffic splits, quotas, etc. 
   It also provides automatic metrics, logs, and traces for all traffic within the cluster from Ingress to Egress and between pods. 
 

 What is Istio Service Mesh? 

<p>Let’s take a quick look at Istio internals. The Istio architecture can be classified into two distinct planes.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Control plane: It consists of the istiod demon, and it manages and configures the envoy proxies to route traffic. The control plane also enforces policies and collects telemetry, and includes components like Pilot for traffic management, Citadel to manage security, and Galley to manage configurations.</p>

<p>Data plane: It’s made of <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/">Envoy</a> proxies deployed as sidecars to our application containers. Envoy is a high-performance, lightweight distributed proxy. It controls all the incoming and outgoing traffic to the container it is attached to.</p>

<p>We can use tools like <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a>, <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a>, <a href="https://www.kiali.io/">Kiali</a> and <a href="https://zipkin.io/">Zipkin</a> for monitoring and observability as they work well with the telemetry provided by Istio. You can use these or use your existing monitoring stack as well.</p>

 Build a Java Microservices Stack using JHipster 

<p>Before you proceed, ensure you have installed JHipster. If not, install it using the command <code>npm -g install generator-jhipster</code>. At the moment of writing, I’m using JHipster version 7.8.1.</p>

<p>We will be using the <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/jdl/intro">JHipster Domain Language (JDL)</a> to define our microservices, entities, and deployment options. But first, let’s take a look at the architecture we will be building today.</p>

<p></p>

<p>We have the Istio control plane taking care of policy, load balancing, etc. We also have the Istio Ingress gateway to route all external traffic to our applications. We have four microservices. First is a gateway application created by JHipster that acts as our React GUI and authentication layer. The remaining are services that provide APIs. Each of our containers will have an envoy proxy as an auto-injected sidecar. We hook up Grafana, Prometheus, Zipkin, and Kiali to the telemetry provided by Istio so that we have monitoring and observability for our cluster. Each microservice also has its own database.</p>

<p>If you would prefer not to build the application yourself, clone the example from <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-java-spring-k8s-istio-microservices-example">GitHub</a>.</p>

   <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/okta-java-spring-k8s-istio-microservices-example.git
</code>   

<p>It’s not an overly complex architecture, but it’s also not that simple. First, let us define our microservice using JDL. Create a file called <code>app.jdl</code> and paste the following content into it.</p>

   <code>application {
  config {
    baseName store
    applicationType gateway
    packageName com.okta.developer.store
    serviceDiscoveryType no
    authenticationType jwt
    prodDatabaseType postgresql
    cacheProvider hazelcast
    buildTool gradle
    clientFramework react
  }
  entities *
}

application {
  config {
    baseName product
    applicationType microservice
    packageName com.okta.developer.product
    serviceDiscoveryType no
    authenticationType jwt
    prodDatabaseType postgresql
    cacheProvider hazelcast
    buildTool gradle
    serverPort 8081
  }
  entities Product, ProductCategory, ProductOrder, OrderItem
}

application {
  config {
    baseName invoice
    applicationType microservice
    packageName com.okta.developer.invoice
    serviceDiscoveryType no
    authenticationType jwt
    prodDatabaseType postgresql
    buildTool gradle
    serverPort 8082
  }
  entities Invoice, Shipment
}

application {
  config {
    baseName notification
    applicationType microservice
    packageName com.okta.developer.notification
    serviceDiscoveryType no
    authenticationType jwt
    databaseType mongodb
    cacheProvider no
    enableHibernateCache false
    buildTool gradle
    serverPort 8083
  }
  entities Notification
}
</code>   

<p>Each application defines its name, package name, authentication type, database, etc. For all supported options and configurations, please refer to the <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/jdl/applications">JDL applications documentation</a>. Each application also defines the <code>applicationType</code> and the entities it serves. Next, add the entity definitions to the <code>app.jdl</code> you just created.</p>

   <code>/**
 * Entities for Store Gateway
 */
// Customer for the store
entity Customer {
  firstName String required
  lastName String required
  gender Gender required

}

enum Gender {
  MALE, FEMALE, OTHER
}

relationship OneToOne {
  Customer{user(login) required} to User
}

paginate Customer with pagination

/**

  details String
  sentDate Instant required
  format NotificationType required
  userId Long required
  productId Long required
}

enum NotificationType {
  EMAIL, SMS, PARCEL
}

microservice Notification with notification
</code>   

<p>We define entities for each service and mark the entities as microservice entities. We also define relationships between entities, enums, and other options like pagination, service layer, etc. Please refer to JDL <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/jdl/entities-fields">Entities</a> and <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/jdl/relationships">relationships</a> documentation for more possibilities.</p>

<p>Now, we are ready to run JHipster. Open a terminal window on the folder where you saved the JDL and run the following command.</p>

   <code>mkdir jhipster-istio
cd jhipster-istio

jhipster jdl app.jdl --fork
</code>   

<p>This will create the applications with all their entities and specified configurations. You should be able to see the gateway application in action by running the following command on the store folder.</p>

   <code>./gradlew # starts the Spring Boot application
</code>   

<p>You can see everything that’s generated in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-java-spring-k8s-istio-microservices-example">example application on GitHub</a>.</p>

 Create a GKE cluster and install Istio 

<p>To deploy the stack to Google Kubernetes Engine, we need to create a cluster and install Istio. So let’s begin by creating a cluster using Google Cloud SDK.</p>

 Create a cluster 

<p>Ensure you are logged into the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud">gcloud CLI</a> from the command-line and run the following command to create a GKE cluster.</p>

   <code># set region and zone
gcloud config set compute/region europe-west1
gcloud config set compute/zone europe-west1-b
# Create a project and enable container APIs
gcloud projects create jhipster-demo-okta # You need to also enable billing via GUI
gcloud config set project jhipster-demo-okta
gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com

# Create GKE Cluster
gcloud container clusters create hello-hipster \
   --num-nodes 4 \
   --machine-type n1-standard-2
</code>   

<p>This could take anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes. <code>--machine-type</code> is important as we need more CPU than available in the default setup. Once the cluster is created, it should be set automatically as the current Kubernetes context. You can verify that by running <code>kubectl config current-context</code>. If the new cluster is not set as the current context, you can set it by running <code>gcloud container clusters get-credentials hello-hipster</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: I’m using <a href="https://kdash.cli.rs/">KDash</a> to monitor the cluster; you can try it or use kubectl, <a href="https://github.com/derailed/k9s">k9s</a>, and so on as you prefer.</p>
</blockquote>

 Install Istio to cluster 

<p>As of writing this, I’m using Istio version 1.13.4. You can install istioctl by running the following command, preferably from your home directory.</p>

   <code>export ISTIO_VERSION=1.13.4
curl -L https://istio.io/downloadIstio | sh -
cd istio-$ISTIO_VERSION
export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
</code>   

<p>You should now be able to run istioctl from the command line. Now, we can use the CLI to Install Istio to the GKE cluster. Istio provides a few <a href="https://helm.sh/">Helm</a> profiles out of the box. We will use the demo profile for demo purposes. You can choose the production or dev profile as well. The command should install Istio and set up everything required on our cluster.</p>

   <code>istioctl install --set profile=demo -y
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: If you run into any trouble with firewall or user privilege issues, please refer to <a href="https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/platform-setup/gke/">GKE setup guide from Istio</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once the installation is complete, we need to fetch the External IP of the Istio Ingress Gateway. If you are using KDash, you can see it on the services tab, or you can run the following command to get it using kubectl.</p>

   <code>kubectl get svc istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system
</code>   

 Install observability tools 

<p>Istio also provides addons for most of the popular monitoring and observability tools. Let’s install Grafana, Prometheus, Kiali and Zipkin on our cluster. These are preconfigured to work with the telemetry data provided by Istio. Ensure you are in the folder where you installed Istio, like istio-1.13.4.</p>

   <code>cd istio-$ISTIO_VERSION
kubectl apply -f samples/addons/grafana.yaml
kubectl apply -f samples/addons/prometheus.yaml
kubectl apply -f samples/addons/kiali.yaml
kubectl apply -f samples/addons/extras/zipkin.yaml
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>If we look at the istio-system namespace, we can see all the Istio components along with Grafana, Prometheus, Kiali, and Zipkin running. You can also see this by running the following command .</p>

   <code>kubectl get pods -n istio-system
</code>   

 Deploy the microservice stack to GKE 

<p>Our cluster is ready, and we have Istio installed. Now, we can deploy our microservice stack to the cluster. First, we need to create Kubernetes manifests for our deployments and services and configurations for Istio. And once again, JHipster comes to the rescue. We can use the <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/jdl/deployments">JDL deployment</a> configurations to generate Kubernetes setup for our stack with one command easily.</p>

 Create Kubernetes manifests 

<p>Create a new JDL file, say <code>deployment.jdl</code>, and add the following content.</p>

   <code>// will be created under 'kubernetes' folder
deployment {
  deploymentType kubernetes
  appsFolders [store, invoice, notification, product]
  dockerRepositoryName "&lt;your-docker-repository-name&gt;"
  serviceDiscoveryType no
  istio true
  kubernetesServiceType Ingress
  kubernetesNamespace jhipster
  ingressDomain "&lt;istio-ingress-gateway-external-ip&gt;.nip.io"
  ingressType gke
}
</code>   

<p>I hope it’s self-explanatory. You can refer to the JDL deployment documentation for all the available options. We have enabled Istio and set the ingress domain to the Istio Ingress Gateway’s external IP that we noted earlier. Make sure to use a docker repo where you have push rights.</p>

<p>Now run the following command from the root folder where you ran the previous <code>jhipster jdl</code> command.</p>

   <code>jhipster jdl deployment.jdl
</code>   

<p>This will create a new folder, kubernetes, with all the required Kubernetes manifests like deployments, services, Istio virtual services, gateways, and so on, for all the applications, databases, and monitoring.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Each of the services will also have an Istio <a href="https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/virtual-service/">virtual service</a> and <a href="https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/destination-rule/">destination rule</a>. For example, the invoice service will have the following destination rule defining traffic policies.</p>

   <code>apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: invoice-destinationrule
  namespace: jhipster
spec:
  host: invoice
  trafficPolicy:
    loadBalancer:
      simple: RANDOM
    connectionPool:
      tcp:
        maxConnections: 30
        connectTimeout: 100ms
      http:
        http1MaxPendingRequests: 10
        http2MaxRequests: 100
        maxRequestsPerConnection: 10
        maxRetries: 5
    outlierDetection:
      consecutive5xxErrors: 5
      interval: 30s
      baseEjectionTime: 60s
  subsets:
    - name: v1
      labels:
        version: "v1"
</code>   

<p>It also includes the following virtual service that defines the route. You could also use virtual services to do traffic split between two versions of the same app, among other things.</p>

   <code>apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: invoice-virtualservice
  namespace: jhipster
spec:
  hosts:
    - invoice
  http:
    - route:
        - destination:
            host: invoice
            subset: "v1"
          weight: 100
      retries:
        attempts: 3
        perTryTimeout: 2s
</code>   

<p>The gateway is defined for the store application as it is our GUI as well.</p>

   <code>apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: store-gateway
  namespace: jhipster
  labels:
    gateway: store-gateway
    istio: ingressgateway
spec:
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway
  servers:
    - port:
        number: 80
        name: http
        protocol: HTTP
      hosts:

        name: http2
        protocol: HTTP2
      hosts:

    - store.jhipster.34.76.233.160.nip.io
  gateways:
    - store-gateway
  http:
    - match:
        - uri:
            prefix: /services/invoice/
      rewrite:
        uri: /
      route:
        - destination:
            host: invoice
    - match:
        - uri:
            prefix: /services/notification/
      rewrite:
        uri: /
      route:
        - destination:
            host: notification
    - match:
        - uri:
            prefix: /services/product/
      rewrite:
        uri: /
      route:
        - destination:
            host: product
    - route:
        - destination:
            host: store
</code>   

<p>As you can see, there are also many useful commands printed on the console that you can use to do the deployment.</p>

 Deploy to GKE 

<p>We are ready to deploy now. First, we need to build and push the images to the registry. We can use the handy <a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib">Jib</a> commands provided by JHipster. Navigate to each of the microservice folders and run the commands below.</p>

   <code>cd store &amp;&amp; ./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image=yourDockerRepository/store
cd invoice &amp;&amp; ./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image=yourDockerRepository/invoice
cd notification &amp;&amp; ./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image=yourDockerRepository/notification
cd product &amp;&amp; ./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image=yourDockerRepository/product
</code>   

<p>Once the images are pushed to the Docker registry, we can deploy the stack using the handy script provided by JHipster. Navigate to the <code>kubernetes</code> folder created by JHipster and run the following command.</p>

   <code>cd kubernetes
./kubectl-apply.sh -f
</code>   

<p>Once the deployments are done, we must wait for the pods to be in RUNNING status. Useful links will be printed on the terminal; make a note of them.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You can now access the application at the given <code>http://store.jhipster.&lt;istio-ingress-gateway-external-ip&gt;.nip.io</code> URI and log in with the default credentials.</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: Currently, the JHipster OIDC setup does not work with Istio and there is an <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/17384">open issue</a> in JHipster issue tracker for this. Alternative solutions would be to use an <a href="https://istio.io/latest/blog/2021/better-external-authz/">external authorization server</a> with something like <a href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org/">Open Policy Agent</a>. We will cover this in a later blog post.</p>
</blockquote>

 Monitoring and observability 

<p>Since we deployed tools for observability, let’s see what we have.</p>

 Grafana 

<p>First up are Grafana and Prometheus for metrics and dashboards. Click the URI for Grafana from the previous deployment step. Click General at the top left corner and click the istio folder. You should see multiple preconfigured dashboards. You can monitor the performance of the workloads and the istio system itself here. You can also create your own dashboards if you like. Prometheus provides the data visualized on Grafana.</p>

<p></p>

 Kiali 

<p>Kiali is a management console for Istio service mesh, and it provides a web interface for visualizing the network topology of your service mesh. You can use it to explore the network topology of your cluster and see the network traffic flowing through it. Click Graph on the left side menu to see the network topology.</p>

<p></p>

 Zipkin 

<p>Zipkin is a distributed tracing solution for distributed systems. It is a tool for capturing distributed traces and providing a centralized view of the traces. This is essential for a microservice setup where a request could span multiple services, and debugging would require tracing them. Click RUN QUERY on the home screen to fetch recent traces, and click SHOW on one of them.</p>

<p></p>

 Cleanup the GCP cluster 

<p>Once you are done with experiments, make sure to delete the cluster you created so that you don’t end up with a big bill from Google. You can delete the cluster from the Google Cloud Console GUI or via the command line using the following command.</p>

   <code>gcloud container clusters delete hello-hipster
</code>

<p>Offering fast, secure payment choices to consumers is absolutely essential to the success of any small-to-mid-sized business (SMB). The digitization of every business, large or small, has been underway for decades, but recent studies show that the pandemic accelerated that process by <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-covid-19-recovery-will-be-digital-a-plan-for-the-first-90-days">five years</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consumers are looking for fast, convenient, contactless ways to shop and pay bills, driving businesses to adopt open banking-powered card and non-card technologies and platforms to service them.&nbsp;</p>
 Payments are the Entry Point to Open Banking for Small Businesses 
<p>Nearly nine in 10 business owners utilize digital payments and open banking-backed payments, speeding up cash flow. Owners are also leaning into open banking to verify, secure and personalize payment transactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SMBs are projected to spend more than <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/small-business-payment-disruptors?_gl=1*10gx4lz*_ga*MjM5NDYxMTE4LjE2NTQxMTczNjI.*_ga_XXYLHB9SXG*MTY1NDExNzM2MS4xLjAuMTY1NDExNzM2MS4w&amp;_ga=2.267860426.511027473.1654117362-239461118.1654117362">$100 billion</a> on payment services by 2025. It’s no surprise that payments are the open banking entry point for small businesses, according to Mastercard’s <a href="https://www.finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking-sme/">Rise of Open Banking</a> small business report.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As emerging payment methods like cryptocurrency and digital wallets <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fintech-study-estimates-4-4-billion-global-users-will-adopt-mobile-wallets-by-2024/">gain widespread adoption</a>, SMBs rely on open banking to create streamlined customer journeys.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ninety percent of SMBs utilize services that link accounts, enabling the speed, convenience and confidence of open banking payments. Owners cite a few core payment-related benefits for linking accounts:</p>
<p></p>
 Small Businesses are Quickly Migrating to Digital 
<p>The pandemic-driven fast-forwarding of digital adoption by SMBs has raised owners’ financial IQ, as 95% consider themselves heavy fintech users. The top driver for fintech use is the desire to make their businesses more digital. Permissioned data and the payment innovations it enables are primary needs for the SMB, as 92% are currently using or want to use digital payment systems. With a <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/us-ecommerce-sales/#:~:text=the%20same%20rate.-,US%20total%20retail%20sales%20reach%20%244.55%20trillion%20in%202021,analysis%20of%20Commerce%20Department%20data.">50.5% increase</a> in online sales from 2019 to 2020, the trend toward digital is evident, and businesses are embracing open banking to stay ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>SMBs are looking for solutions for agility and resilience, powered by technology. They’re facing challenges that are mostly digital, and they’re looking for digital solutions. Owner-permissioned data, insights and analytics from open banking platforms is creating new payment experiences for SMBs to offer consumers. To the SMB owner, open banking is an opportunity to partner with an innovator and grow.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Accelerating adoption of digital channels means that a small business needs a partner that can handle real-time bank account verification, account data snapshots and predictive analytics. These core services can mitigate payment failures and fees, enable onboarding, maintain compliance and power next-gen payment apps and services.</p>
<p>Mastercard’s complementary account-based payments business leverages best-in-class capabilities across infrastructure, applications and services. By converging capabilities, Mastercard provides one trusted platform that empowers businesses to pay and get paid with confidence, using a card, bank account, or cryptocurrency. SMB owners can use a device or no device, and send or receive payments in real time or later. This kind of empowerment is what today’s innovators can offer the SMB, by leveraging open banking solutions. Maximum choice in payment types and methods, powered by open banking, providing effective tools for small business.&nbsp;</p>
 Open Banking Payment Innovations are Gaining Momentum 
<p>Account-based payments are an emerging area ripe for targeted fintech development. Open banking technology allows you to integrate consumer-permissioned technology to your fintech innovation that offers more ways to pay with greater speed, convenience and confidence. With better quality data and insights about the small business, the non-card payments journey can be smoother.</p>
<p>Account-based payments are a new way for consumers to pay small businesses with <a href="https://b2b.mastercard.com/pay-by-account/">convenience, security and control</a>. Instead of entering payment card information, the customer can view their bank and the account they want to use, authenticate themselves, and pay immediately. Customers can:&nbsp;</p>
 
 View balances before checkout 
 Pay from any account 
 Authenticate with an app and a device 
 
<p>Mastercard is delivering the platform for innovation in the payments sector, giving fintechs the ability to scale up confidently. The recent release of Mastercard’s <a href="https://www.finicity.com/how-mastercard-is-using-open-banking-to-make-ach-payments-faster-and-predictable/">Smart Payment Decisioning Tools</a> uses real-time bank data permissioned by a consumer to show payment indicators that can raise successful payment completion rates and reduce transaction costs. With Payment Success Indicator, payment failure risk can be mitigated by scoring the likelihood of a success before initiating it. Then with Payment Routing Optimizer, payment originators are given a recommendation for the most optimal day and rail to choose for the highest likelihood of successful settlement at the best cost and speed. These next-gen tools can give the SMB the advantage they need to best compete in a growing digital economy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this vlog, our Chief Strategy Officer and Co-Founder, Mike Engle, joins our Chief Marketing Officer, Michael Cichon, to discuss FIDO’s May 5th announcement and what it means for the future of passwordless authentication.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All right. Hello, everybody, again. This is Michael Cichon, the Chief Marking Officer here at 1Kosmos. I’m here again with Mike Engel, our co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer. Mike, welcome to the vlog.</p>
<p>Thanks for having me again.</p>
<p>Awesome. Well, today we’re going to talk about FIDO. FIDO has been in the news. The Fast Identity Online Alliance has released some new capabilities or a new spec, if you will. Can you talk a little bit about what that news consisted of?</p>
<p>Yeah. I think taking just a 10 second step backwards, FIDO, Fast Identity Online was formed in 2013 by a bunch of tech companies that came together with the goal of setting up standards on how you could get rid of passwords over time. So today, there’s over 200 tech and other service providers that are members. The big announcement that came back on May 5th, I think it’s International Passwordless Day or Password Day or something, was that it’s going to be much easier for you to use your passwordless authenticator across different devices. Because one of the challenges with FIDO has been you can enroll and register it right here on this device or whatever device, but then when you go to a new device, you have to do that again. So this is big news because it’s going to open up the door a bit for this to be used in a big way.</p>
<p>Yeah. Can you get that? Okay. So I guess, support across devices. So what does this mean for passwordless access? Is passwordless going to follow this? Or what are the implications for passwordless access?</p>
<p>Well, FIDO is the passwordless standard. So what this means is the major tech providers, Google, Microsoft, and Apple are the ones that made the announcement, are going to build it into their systems to let your FIDO process be a little more open and transferable across your devices. And so the example they give is you could log in to a Chrome browser on a Mac machine and log in to an Apple website, or all these different interoperability examples they give now. And so the experience will be soon, hopefully, you come to a website, it says, “Would you like to go passwordless?” You say yes. And then you get to do that over and over again. And I’m seeing more and more websites that are doing this in practice. So it’s starting to get real.</p>
<p>Okay. All right. Well, I know 1Kosmos is certified to the FIDO2 standard. What does this mean? Does 1Kosmos then support this new capability?</p>
<p>We do, yeah. So out of the box, you can basically drop our technology in there and have any website or service or operating system go passwordless in minutes, really.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>So that’s one of the big challenges is people don’t know how to embrace it. So they hear about it, but they don’t know how to go about getting started.</p>
<p>Right, right. So I would imagine one day, we’re going to look back and wonder how we ever got by without this type of capability. But I just mentioned that 1Kosmos is certified, what does that mean? What are the benefits of being certified to the FIDO2 standard? Not just compliant, but certified.</p>
<p>That’s right. Yeah. So the FIDO Alliance will certify products to make sure that they adhere to the FIDO specifications. So anybody can go to the fidoalliance.org and read all this and see who’s certified and who’s not. So by being certified, it enables organizations to ensure that they have something that’s interoperable because you don’t want to pick some siloed technology that is only you get beholden to the vendor at that point. So interoperability is key. So you want to pick somebody who has a FIDO2 certified server is the main standard that you want to follow these days.</p>
<p>Gotcha. Okay. So what, if anything, does 1Kosmos then provide over and above what FIDO2 dictates or enables?</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, the problem of your authentication being able to be used anywhere, even on the first touch, right? So as I mentioned, one of the challenges in years past has been I can enroll it here, but if I go to my second computer somewhere, it’s not set up there. I have to go set it up there. That usually needs a username and password again, right? So you fall back to that lowest common denominator. Since day one, we’ve allowed you to have your authenticator be used anywhere. And we call it FIDO Plus. That’s not an official standard. I don’t want to get in trouble. But we make it really easy to use it on 150 different target systems. And the user experience then is the same across all of them. So if I walk up to a new Windows workstation, or Mac, or come to a different website, I can use it out of the box on day one and I’ll know exactly how to do that every time.</p>
<p>Okay. All right. So then, I guess, what’s the secret ingredient in getting passwordless activated on more websites?</p>
<p>Well, there’s two different types of deployments typically. There’s when you do it for your employees within an organization, you can tell them what to do. You give them something that’s awesome, they’ll use it and make it part of the standard operating procedure. But with consumer or citizen-facing services, you have to lead them to water. You have to show them that it’s awesome, prompt them to engage with it until everybody thinks it’s as easy to do and knows it’s as easy to do as looking at your phone and unlocking it. What we have is something we call the developer experience, developer.1kosmos.com. With the press of a button, you can see exactly how to do it, how your developers would download and install the code. And within minutes, they can actually try it right on the website. So making it easy for the developers to solve their problems is what we’ve been focusing on and we’ve had great success with that.</p>
<p>Got it. Got it. So once again, I mean, it sounds to me as if 1Kosmos got on the FIDO track early, has stayed on the FIDO track, and now we’re, I guess, somewhat reaping the benefits of that as these new capabilities to that standard evolve.</p>
<p>That’s right. Exactly. And one of the exciting developments will be the marrying of strong identity with that strong passwordless authentication. So the FIDO is working in that direction. Of course, we’ve been doing that since day one as well, where your real identity is linked to that passwordless experience. So you get a two for the price of one there, right?</p>
<p>That’s great. All right. Well, me not being a FIDO expert, I feel like I’ve covered all the points. Have we left anything critical out?</p>
<p>No, no. I think we’ve done it. So I encourage everybody to come over to developer.1kosmos.com and check it out and see how easy it can really be.</p>
<p>That’s great. Yeah. We put it right in the menu, right at the top for developers. All right, Michael. Thank you very much. I appreciate your time today. You have a good rest of your day.</p>
<p>Thank you. Take care.</p>

 Let’s dive into the technical detail about the Sudo Platform DI Relay.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 



 What is a DI relay?<br> 



<p>A DI relay makes it possible to exchange messages between&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/decentralized-identity-key-concepts-explained/">peer agents</a>. Relays are necessary for DI peer-to-peer messaging because they allow edge agents, such as mobile phones, to store and forward messages, regardless of the agent’s availability. Without a relay, messages cannot be delivered to offline recipients, so the relay acts as an intermediary for receiving and storing messages until the recipient is back online.</p>



 



 What are edge agents? 



<p>An&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/decentralized-identity-key-concepts-explained/">edge agent</a>&nbsp;is an application that sits on an edge device, such as a user’s mobile phone. Edge agents can provide an array of DI functionality such as providing&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/05/part-3-how-were-enhancing-sudo-digital-identities-with-decentralized-identity/">wallet and peer-to-peer services</a>. Since many devices are not guaranteed to always be available online, relays act as always-on endpoints for receiving inbound message from sending peers. When the device later reconnects to the network, it requests any received messages stored by the relay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Edge agents differ from DI&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/decentralized-identity-key-concepts-explained/">cloud agents</a>, which are usually discussed together. Cloud agents are software components similar to edge agents, but cloud agents provide cloud-based&nbsp;services that are always available – they&nbsp;do not need relays because they are always connected to the network.&nbsp;</p>



 



 What is a&nbsp;relay? 



<p>A relay is a&nbsp;passive&nbsp;entity in peer-to-peer message delivery that simply receives a message and forwards it to the next service or agent (see Figure 1). Relays may forward these messages on the same or a different transportation medium. This opens the possibility of creating mix networks for communications that are more difficult to trace.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Further, relays do not&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/01/what-is-encryption-and-why-is-it-important/">decrypt or encrypt</a>&nbsp;messages, so the sender does not need to be aware of the presence of a relay or adjust their behavior to account for it. As an example, the sender would not need to manage extra keys to use relays, unlike its mediator counterparts.</p>



 



Figure 1: A relay forwarding a message encrypted for the receiver.



 



<p>Unlike relays, mediators&nbsp;actively&nbsp;participate in the message delivery process by decrypting the outer layer of the packet received (chunk of data that goes across the network). Mediators use the decrypted information to forward the packet onwards to another participant in the delivery process. Because of this additional layer of encryption, senders must manage extra keys to use mediators. For every extra mediator in the message delivery sequence, the sender must manage one extra key. Further, the sender must encrypt the message multiple times using the public key of each mediator, in the precise order of the receiving mediators. For N mediators, the sender must store N additional keys and encrypt the message N times. Figure 2 shows 3 senders using the same mediator to send messages to 3 receivers. Note that each sender must store an extra public key for the mediator.</p>



 



Figure 2: A mediator acting as a herd host for 3 peer connections.



 



<p>With the extra complexity, what is the benefit of using mediators? One benefit of mediators over relays is that the additional encryption conceals the end destination from an eavesdropper and deters traffic analysis. Another benefit is ‘herd immunity’, where multiple connections are not easily traced to a single recipient. Users must make a risk decision about whether this additional benefit is worth the extra complexity.&nbsp;</p>



 



 Why use relays and not a mediator as an always-on endpoint?<br> 



<p>We chose relays over mediators because the goal was to build a simple transport mechanism for DIDComm connections. Relays provide a lightweight means of transporting DIDComm messages, which are already encrypted. It is possible to build a mediator later as a subsequent iteration if it is deemed necessary to conceal the message route and endpoint destination.</p>



<p>There are some additional costs with mediators that do not fit into the lightweight requirement. The onion-style routing of mediators is difficult to diagnose when communications fail. The routing also relies on the sender encoding the correct source routing. The costs associated with sending messages also grow with the number of encryption operations required for each mediator to the recipient.&nbsp;Further, the herd immunity the mediator provides can be achieved with a simpler relay by implementing separate and anonymous relay connections (or a post box) for each DIDComm connection.</p>



<p>Relays are a standards-based approach to DI peer-to-peer message delivery.&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/concepts/0046-mediators-and-relays/README.md">Aries RFC 0046: Mediators and Relays</a>&nbsp;defines mediator and relay behaviour for all implementations to follow, allowing interoperability by design. This RFC was initiated in 2018 and the identity community currently accepts it. Due to this, relays built according to standards are interoperable with other solutions from a variety of vendors within the global DI ecosystem.</p>



 



 Enter the Sudo Platform DI Relay&nbsp;<br> 



<p>The Sudo Platform DI Relay unites standards-based interoperability with Sudo Platform modularity, reliability, and security. The Sudo Platform DI Relay is an implementation of&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/concepts/0046-mediators-and-relays/README.md">Aries RFC 0046</a>&nbsp;with additional features that allow developers to create secure, compartmentalised relays within their applications. This sits alongside other DI offerings, such as the Sudo Verifiable Credentials service, and the Sudo Identity Wallet app (and their associated SDKs, sample apps and documentation) (see Figure 3).</p>



 



Figure 3: Sudo Platform offers various modular and compatible solutions that allow consumers to choose precisely which functionality they would like to have in their offerings. Read more about Sudo Platform&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.sudoplatform.com/">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;



 



<p>The Sudo DI Relay allows users to participate in peer-based messaging over HTTPS. It provides a unique, always-on endpoint for each connection the user creates. Messages sent to their endpoint are stored in a post box dedicated to that connection. These post boxes can be associated with a&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo</a>&nbsp;identity to allow for complete&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalization-is-the-most-powerful-data-privacy-strategy/">compartmentalization</a>&nbsp;between the identities associated with the connections.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 



Figure 4: Peers can send messages to the relay’s endpoint. Messages are stored in users’ post boxes. The Sudo mobile agent can retrieve messages from post boxes.&nbsp;



 



 Use case 1: Sudo-to-Sudo encrypted messaging<br> 



<p>You can see in-network messaging between two Sudo mobile agents in Figure 5. The Sudo mobile agent (A) is the inviter of the DIDComm invitation exchange, and Sudo mobile agent (B) is the invitee. Sudo mobile agent (A) creates their post box and subscribes to inbound messages before the DIDComm invitation exchange. Sudo mobile agent (B) creates their post box and subscribes to inbound messages during the exchange.When the user sends messages to their peer, they can store their outgoing messages in their own post box to store the entire message exchange.&nbsp;Note that these messages are&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/01/what-is-encryption-and-why-is-it-important/">encrypted</a>. Retrieving a list of messages in the post box will retrieve both incoming and outgoing messages.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 



Figure 5: Swimlane diagram describing Sudo-to-Sudo encrypted messaging. Note that Sudo mobile agent (B) creates their post box and subscribes to inbound messages during the DIDComm invitation exchange.



 



 Use case 2: Sudo to out-of-network endpoint encrypted messaging<br> 



<p>Out-of-network messaging occurs when a Sudo DI mobile agent communicates with another non-Sudo DI agent, as seen in Figure 6. The user creates a post box and undergoes a DIDComm invitation exchange directly with the peer. Afterwards, the user subscribes to messages incoming to their post box. Messages are sent back to the peer via the peer’s chosen transport destination. These outgoing messages can be stored in the user’s post box for persistence.&nbsp;</p>

 Using the relay to help establish DIDComm connection 



<p></p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0160-connection-protocol/README.md">Aries RFC 0160 Connection Protocol</a>&nbsp;defines a protocol that allows agents to establish connections. At the time of writing, this protocol is commonly used, but we expect that&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0023-did-exchange/README.md">RFC 0023 DID Exchange</a>&nbsp;will eventually replace Connection Protocol,&nbsp;along with&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0434-outofband/README.md">RFC 0434 Out of Band Messaging</a>. These protocols have a similar messages flow with subtle differences in the message contents (which we’ll explain).&nbsp;</p>



 



 Use case 3: Sudo-to-Sudo connection establishment using Connection Protocol 



<p></p>



<p>Figure 7 describes how the relay can be used to assist in the Connection Protocol, where Sudo mobile agent (A) is the inviter, and Sudo mobile agent (B) is the invitee. First, the inviter creates a post box and subscribes to messages incoming into that post box. The inviter sends a&nbsp;send_invitation&nbsp;message to the invitee containing the service endpoint (serviceEndpoint), recipient keys (recipientKeys), and other metadata. The service endpoint is the post box endpoint from the Sudo DI Relay. This is sent directly to the invitee via another medium such as QR code.&nbsp;&nbsp;QR codes are often used to initiate in-person connections, because they are fairly impervious to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3340117/man-in-the-middle-attack-definition-and-examples.html">man-in-the-middle</a>&nbsp;attacks.</p>



<p>Upon receiving the&nbsp;send_invitation&nbsp;message, the invitee then creates their post box and subscribes to incoming messages. They can then reply with a&nbsp;connection_request&nbsp;that is sent directly to the inviter’s post box. This message is forwarded to the inviter, who then replies similarly with a&nbsp;connection_response&nbsp;message that is sent directly to the invitee’s post box. The protocol is finished with a final&nbsp;ack&nbsp;sent by the invitee to the inviter.&nbsp;</p>



 



Figure 7: Using the relay to facilitate Connection Protocol. Note that the send_invitation message must be delivered directly between agents or through another medium such as a QR code.



 



<p>DID Exchange and Out of Band Messaging can also be achieved using the relay for Sudo-to-Sudo connection establishment. DID Exchange must be preceded by either an implicit invitation with a readily known resolvable DID, or an explicit invitation using an invitation from Out of Band Messaging. The&nbsp;out_of_network&nbsp;message in Out of Band Messaging can replace the&nbsp;send_invitation&nbsp;message in Figure 7. The&nbsp;didcomm_response_message&nbsp;is diagrammatically similar to the&nbsp;connection_request&nbsp;message.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The&nbsp;request&nbsp;message in the DID Exchange protocol has a similar flow to the&nbsp;connection_response&nbsp;in Figure 7. The&nbsp;exchange_response&nbsp;message is diagrammatically similar to the&nbsp;ack&nbsp;message. DID Exchange finishes with a final&nbsp;complete&nbsp;message. While each of these messages have a similar flow between actors in the diagram, their purpose and contents can vary between protocols.</p>



 



 Use case 4: Sudo to out-of-network communication establishment via Connection Protocol 



<p>Figure 8 describes how the relay can be used to facilitate Connection Protocol between a Sudo and an out-of-network peer. The&nbsp;send_invitation&nbsp;message is sent directly to the peer.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the&nbsp;connection_request&nbsp;contains a DIDDoc which specifies the peer’s out-of-network service endpoint, the&nbsp;connection_response&nbsp;can be sent to that endpoint. The remaining message flow is similar to use case 3.</p>



 



Figure 8: Connection Protocol between a Sudo DI agent and an out-of-network peer.



 



<p>DID Exchange and Out of Band Messaging can also be achieved between a Sudo DI agent and an out-of-network peer. The&nbsp;out_of_band&nbsp;message replaces&nbsp;send_invitation&nbsp;on Figure 8. The&nbsp;didcomm_response_message&nbsp;replaces&nbsp;connection_request. The&nbsp;request&nbsp;message replaces&nbsp;connection_response, and the&nbsp;exchange_response&nbsp;replaces&nbsp;ack.&nbsp;DID Exchange completes with an additional&nbsp;complete&nbsp;message.<br></p>



 



 Publicly resolvable DIDs and the Sudo DI Relay 



<p><br>Publicly resolvable DIDs resolve to a DIDDoc. This DIDDoc contains a service endpoint on which a server listens to invitations. This server should ideally also provide extra features such as traffic filtering, DOS detection and spam identification. It is possible that the Sudo DI Relay can act as this server, but these extra features are not implemented.&nbsp;</p>

				 <p>Decentralized Identity has gone international! In this week’s GIMS, we’ll talk about some of the most exciting projects and some of the lessons learned from around the globe.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/worldwide-digital-identity-and-security/government/magazine/eu-digital-id-wallet-coming-heres-what">The EU Digital ID Wallet Is Coming. Here’s What It Means For You&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>The EU recently announced that they will be implementing a digital wallet for citizens and businesses to use for online authentication and proving identity. The system is set to be built from existing regulations implemented in 2014 called eIDAS, which mandated consistent standards across the EU for electronic authentication. Unfortunately, this initiative was not adopted by most EU members, with only 14% of public services offering cross-border authentication. Recognizing that the previous program had significant shortcomings, the EU expressed the need to improve the coverage, user experience, and cross-border acceptance of digital identity services this time. The proposal has a target date of September 2022 to agree to a technical framework and begin pilot projects.</p>
<p>This is, arguably, the most ambitious implementation of decentralized identity we’ve seen yet. The article does a great job of reflecting&nbsp; issues that we have seen implementing solutions for our customers, such as adoption and usability, and how they plan to avoid them to provide easier travel and business to EU citizens. The EU was originally founded to reduce the barriers to trade between members, and implementing this solution will be a massive step forward in reducing those barriers as more and more of our lives require proving our identity online.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202206/uk-government-allocates-5m-to-retire-verifys-digital-id-infrastructure">UK Government Allocates $5M To Retire Verify’s Digital ID Infrastructure</a></p>
<p>The UK is in the process of shutting down their Verify program, an undertaking they began in 2016 to provide one trusted login for all the services provided by the British government. The government ruled after five years that the program simply wasn’t providing enough value for the 154 million pounds (almost $194 million dollars) invested in it. Verify is expected to be replaced by One Login, a single sign-on replacement which is planned to be fully rolled out by 2025.</p>
<p>The UK had many issues with this project but the big lesson here is mostly about adoption. In an article by the Panorama Consulting Group that looks at some of&nbsp; <a href="https://www.panorama-consulting.com/gov-uk-verify-failure/">Verify’s failures</a>, it found that the project had predicted 46 government services would adopt the platform by March 2018, but as of Feb 2021 only 22 had done so. If the platform can’t deliver over half the services it promised how can the citizens trust and rely on it? This led to tepid interactment numbers on the platform at best, with only 6.7 million of the 25 million predicted users. There is a reason that one of the first things we discuss with customers at Indicio is user buy-in and first experiences! Because if there is another option that is easier or more reliable why would they use your solution?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.itworldcanada.com/article/the-state-of-digital-id-in-canada/484618">The State of Digital ID in Canada</a></p>
<p>Digital ID is coming to Canada, slowly, and with some expected wariness and skepticism. This article is excellent at addressing some of the concerns citizens have with moving their identity online: Some see it as an invasion of their privacy, some fear that their personal information could be leaked, and some feel it is not secure enough. These are all valid concerns, and the government has responded with a slow rollout, starting with provincial initiatives that discuss the technology, its security, and how it would improve citizens’ day-to-day lives.</p>
<p>It is refreshing to see public concern so focused on and answered in a direct way. Having an open discussion will likely speed adoption. The overall plan also falls in line with one of the principals we believe in whole heartedly at Indicio – start small and scale. By starting at the providence level they can work out the kinks and add features in a way that builds success.</p>
<p><a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2022/05/can-digital-identity-help-with-the-world-refugee-crisis/">Can Digital Identity Help With the World Refugee Crisis?</a></p>
<p>This article by Security Boulevard looks at an identity use case that many simply don’t think about but which directly affects millions of people. Currently, in Ukraine alone, 12 million people have been displaced from their homes in the last few months.</p>
<p>Overall, there are an <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/figures-at-a-glance.html">estimated 26.4 million</a> refugees worldwide, and as Security Boulevard notes, a refugee by definition is cut off from the government that validates and confirms their identity, so what is the solution? A decentralized ledger accessible globally is certainly a good start, but you would need widespread adoption to make sure that the identity is accepted by the government of the country where the person is seeking asylum. One of the biggest hurdles in applying for refugee status and citizenship is lack of documentation, solving this problem would be a game changer for millions of people just trying to get their life back, and significantly reduce the amount of time and effort necessary to make that happen.</p>
<p>As decentralized and digital Identity solutions become more widespread, this technology offers a solution for millions of people, and this use case is certainly something we will be keeping in mind at Indicio. This is a complex problem, and we certainly don’t claim to have all the answers, but Security Boulevard provides insights into usability and backup plans for anyone creating identity solutions.</p>

 Looking Forward — web3name <p>Making Web3 Accessible</p><p>Written by Majella Horan, Content Writer for KILT Protocol.</p><p>Since launching in April 2022, over 10,000 web3names have been claimed. In short, a <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/introducing-web3name-your-unique-digital-name-for-web3-the-internet-of-the-future-c301a18f75e8">web3name</a> replaces a long string of numbers and letters (typical for blockchain) with an easily readable name. But it’s so much more! Welcome to the world of identity in&nbsp;Web3.</p> Identity on&nbsp;KILT <p><a href="https://www.kilt.io/">KILT</a> allows you to generate your digital identity easily and safely. Identity on KILT begins with a decentralized identifier (DID). A DID is an industry standard developed by the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) for standardization by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). In essence, a DID works as your digital fingerprint.</p><p>Using KILT, you can generate your own DID — a unique and cryptographically verifiable string of numbers and letters specific to you and entirely under your control — via the <a href="https://www.trusted-entity.io/assets/pdf/Create-KILT-Sporran-Identity.pdf">Sporran</a> wallet on your laptop. Then you can build your digital identity around it by adding credentials — attributes, certificates, social media accounts, the things that make up who you are in the digital sphere. Your DID may also be registered on the KILT blockchain and represented by an easily-readable <a href="https://www.trusted-entity.io/assets/pdf/How_To_Guide_web3name_link_address_Full_May22.pdf">web3name</a> such as w3n:majella.</p><p>Since your web3name is unique and secured by the KILT blockchain, no one else can claim it. Similar to the real world, the identity you build around it is not transferable and is a combination of your web3name and all the credentials and attributes that you connect with it. Just as in real life, it can grow and change. Likewise, anyone who just claims the web3name of a brand cannot replicate the brand’s identity without the brand’s added credentials.</p> web3name vs. existing name&nbsp;services <p>web3name is different from other naming services such as ENS (Ethereum Name Service) in several&nbsp;ways.</p><p>Like web3name, ENS allows users to represent a long series of letters and numbers with an easily readable name, such as majella.eth. However, in ENS this is a domain name URL, which represents an address, not a DID. So the name majella.eth could just work as a replacement for the Ethereum or Ethereum-compatible address. Searching Majella.eth on a blockchain explorer such as Etherscan would show the address and all transactions related to&nbsp;it.</p><p>In contrast, web3name is not limited to any chain or ecosystem. It is linked to a DID, a widely-accepted industry standard for decentralized identifiers. Web3name is not designed as a simple replacement for an address, as it may be <a href="https://linking.trusted-entity.io/">linked to one or several account addresses</a> even on different blockchains, to credentials that give more flavor to the identity behind it, as well as to service endpoints to show more details. All information shared through service endpoints can be deleted if you ever wish to change your public appearance. And it is entirely up to you if you link to any of these or not, and what information you want to share publicly.</p> Advantages of&nbsp;web3name <p>Once linked, searching a web3name such as “w3n:majella” on an app like <a href="https://w3n.id/">w3n.id</a> shows the associated DID and anything publicly connected to it. Just as Etherscan can be searched using either the ENS name or the linked address, w3n.id can be searched using either the web3name or the linked&nbsp;DID.</p><p>Multiple things may be connected with your web3name including:</p>  As many of your addresses as you want to make publicly available across any number of blockchains in the Kusama and Polkadot ecosystems. Ethereum and more blockchains will be added in the coming&nbsp;months  As many of your credentials of any kind that you want to add, either privately or&nbsp;publicly  Communication endpoints, e.g., linking to your website or marketplace  <p>Being able to add several addresses across blockchains is especially useful for those providing on-chain services such as validating on different blockchains, and will become increasingly valuable as Web3 continues to mature and different chains gain interoperability.</p><p>Adding credentials to a web3name adds an extra layer of trust. All compatible digital credentials are supported, including free KILT credentials via <a href="https://socialkyc.io/">SocialKYC</a> proving your ownership of things like email addresses, GitHub accounts and social media handles. These can be kept private on your device, or made public by linking via service endpoints such as GitHub or IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). URLs with extra details such as your website may also be added to provide further information.</p><p>As Web3 matures, more real-world credentials will be available in the digital world. Already, real-world credentials could be verifiably and revocably replicated and represented in the digital world without heavy investment by the credential provider using the KILT open-source <a href="https://www.kilt.io/developers/kilt-sdk/">Software Development Kit&nbsp;(SDK)</a>.</p><p>Of course, since anything linked on the blockchain is public and, therefore, a permanent record, it’s important to only link addresses or credentials that you wish to make publicly identifiable with your name. What happens on the blockchain stays on the blockchain!</p> Looking forward <p>Creating your on-chain DID and web3name requires a refundable deposit and small transaction fees, so you need around 3 KILT in your wallet before your start. Once you have your web3name it’s yours forever, unless you later decide to give it up, or unless the KILT community decides otherwise via a public referendum. There are no more costs or&nbsp;charges.</p><p>Web3 is maturing, and there are several applications built on KILT already available and ready to be used.

				 <p>I discussed the concept of Dumb Money&nbsp;in a <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/say-no-with-grace/#:~:text=to%20find%20you.%E2%80%9D-,Dumb%20Money,-%E2%80%93%20Customer%20has%20a">previous post</a>, and I wanted to provide more detail on the idea since it’s critical to keep in mind for Fintech and Crypto startups. Dumb Money is a term used to describe a situation where a customer approaches you with a bag of money and asks you to solve their problem with a project; it can be an excellent opportunity to be a hero.</p>
<p>However, if their project means you are straying away from your core business, you’re taking a candy-covered poison pill. The poison is slow-acting, though. As you become the hero and solve the customer’s problem, you’re slowly killing yourself.</p>
<p>There are a lot of businesses that try to be all things to all people. They think they need to offer a little bit of everything to succeed; this is not only impossible but unwise. When you try to be a hero for every customer who walks in the door, you’ll lose focus and become the go-to business for nothing. It can be tough to say no to a customer offering a lot of money for a project that seems out of your area of expertise. However, it’s important to remember that taking on these projects can be dangerous to your business.</p>
<p>The best way to deal with Dumb Money is to set some boundaries. Figure out what you will and won’t do – and where the blurry line is between those things. Additionally, let your customer know that you can help them, but you can’t do everything. If they are looking for a specific product or service, point them in the direction of a competitor who might be able to serve their needs better. They are likely asking because they trust you – don’t lose that trust by saying you are fantastic at something that you aren’t – point them in the right direction.</p>
<p>Your business should stick to what it does best and let others do the same. Specialize in what you know and offer the best possible product or service in that category. You’ll be more successful, and your customers will be happier.</p>

				 <p>There are times when saying No to Dumb Money is the best decision for everyone involved—learning how to say no without feeling guilty or like a jerk is an important life skill. No one likes to let others down, but sometimes it’s necessary for self-preservation. <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/say-no-with-grace/">Saying no with grace</a> can be difficult, but it’s crucial to stay professional.</p>
<p>The key is to remember that you’re not doing anyone any favours by agreeing to something that’s not good for you. It’s unfair to them because you won’t be able to give your best effort if you’re stretched too thin. And they’ll probably end up disappointed in the end.</p>
<p>Dumb Money projects can significantly impact your business. Know what you do best and let someone else do the rest, and you’ll be able to make better decisions for your business.</p>

   CDD measures have a lot of crossover with standard KYC processes, though they're designed to not only identify a customer, but also assess the risks they pose. By undertaking effective CDD, crypto companies can ensure they know who they are dealing with, and scale securely and efficiently.

 The partnership will work towards making it easy for everyone to interact with the blockchain — self-custodially and without seed&nbsp;phrase <p>Web3Auth and StarkWare Sign-in a Strategic Partnership</p><p>Web3Auth and StakWare enter into a Strategic Partnership that will provide a major push to our shared vision of onboarding the next billion users into Web3. The genesis of StarkWare lies in improving scalability and privacy on the blockchain so as to accommodate more and more users. Web3Auth’s origins lie in the fact that seed phrases create a huge entry barrier in onboarding mainstream users into blockchain applications. Given their strikingly similar genesis, it is only natural that both ecosystem stakeholders joined forces to increase mainstream adoption of&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>What does the partnership entail?</p><p>Uri Kolodny, CEO &amp; Co-Founder, StarkWare:</p><p>“Our teams share the mutual goal of bringing web3 closer to mainstream users. With Web3Auth providing easy login and onboarding of users, and with StarkWare providing low gas costs and security, this partnership is a natural and important step in achieving this&nbsp;goal.”</p><p>StarkWare Offers Grant to&nbsp;Web3Auth</p><p>In a major endorsement for Web3Auth’s mission, StarkWare has offered Web3Auth a grant to ensure its self-custodial private key infrastructure powers as many dApps and wallets in the Web3 eco-system as possible. How we onboard users and handle their private keys in the next few years will largely determine the pace at which the Web3 eco-system will grow. The grant will be used by Web3Auth to to make its authentication suite available and accessible to as many developers as possible and by doing so, to more and more applications and&nbsp;users.</p><p>Web3Auth Announces Sign-in With StarkWare</p><p>Also as part of the partnership, last week, Web3Auth and StarkWare <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/sign-in-with-starkware-711d48f2dbbd">announced Sign-in With StarkWare</a>, a unique initiative that brings in the security of StarkWare to Web2 allowing users to sign-in to any Web3 application using their StarkWare account.</p><p>Quote from Zhen, CEO &amp; Co-founder, Web3Auth:</p><p>“Our partnership with StarkWare is a natural evolution of both our organizations’ genesis — to make blockchain more accessible to the masses. This partnership holds immense possibilities for the ecosystem overall and we are excited to see what it&nbsp;unfolds”</p><p>Web3Auth SDK now supports key generation and management on the STARK&nbsp;curve</p><p>Web3Auth strongly believes that ZK-Rollups such as StarkWare’s scaling solutions have played and will continue to play a huge role in making the Blockchain more usable and secure. Web3Auth extends 100% support to all developers building on the StarkWare family to seamlessly onboard their userswhile keeping core principles of self-custodiality intact.</p><p>Coming Soon…</p><p>From TSS on STARKs to JWT verification on StarkNet, stay tuned for more&nbsp;updates.</p><p>About Starkware family:</p><p>StarkWare develops STARK-based solutions for the blockchain industry.</p><p>StarkEx, is a standalone permissioned scaling engine that already powers few of the biggest applications such as dYdX, Sorare, Immutable, DiversiFi and Celer. StarkNet is a decentralized permissionless STARK-powered L2 ZK-Rollup over Ethereum, that supports general-computation based on the Cairo language.</p><p>About Web3Auth:</p><p>Web3Auth is a leading non-custodial private key management infrastructure that helps dApps and Wallets on-board users eliminating the need for seed&nbsp;phrases.</p><p>Stay in touch with&nbsp;Web3Auth</p><p><a href="http://web3auth.io/">Website</a> | <a href="https://docs.web3auth.io/">Docs</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/web3auth">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://t.me/web3authdev">Telegram</a> | <a href="http://discord.gg/web3auth">Discord</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/web3auth">Linkedin</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/web3auth-and-starkware-announce-strategic-partnership-142ce14fda1a">Web3Auth and StarkWare Announce Strategic Partnership</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

This is a massive release that the whole team has played a huge part in. We’re super proud of what we have achieved over the last 18 months and we want to share some of the highlights with you in this article.

The vision for Ocean dates back to <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/from-ai-to-blockchain-to-data-meet-ocean-f210ff460465">2017</a> and we had our <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/secure-on-chain-access-control-for-ocean-protocol-38dca0af820c">first release</a> in 2018. From the very beginning, we were on a mission to create a data-sharing protocol that preserved privacy and put the data owners in control. With our <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/v2-ocean-compute-to-data-guide-9a3491034b64">second release</a>, in 2020, we launched Compute-to-Data, to enable algorithms to be run on a dataset without ever revealing the raw data. In 2020 we made another huge step with our <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-v3-is-now-live-b47c0e73f52a">third release</a> and the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-datatokens-from-money-legos-to-data-legos-4f867cec1837">introduction of ERC20 datatokens</a> which tokenize access control, to boost interoperability. Another big milestone in V3 was the introduction of <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-market-an-open-source-community-marketplace-for-data-4b99bedacdc3">Ocean Market</a> which enables the publishing, staking, and trading of datatokens. Since the release of V3, we have introduced <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/fine-grained-permissions-now-supported-in-ocean-protocol-4fe434af24b9">fine-grained permissions</a>, <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceans-on-ethereum-mainnet-ba9be1aee0ce">multichain support</a> [<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-on-polygon-network-8abad19cbf47">2</a>][<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceans-on-binance-smart-chain-6bfe715a492c">3</a>][<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceans-on-energy-web-chain-1343e56d884d">4</a>][<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceans-on-moonriver-d4f3e26fbc5">5</a>] and a <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/list-purgatory">mechanism</a> for handling IP violations &amp; sensitive data.</p><p>We are always keen to iterate and improve and we quickly saw elements of the V3 release to improve. For our V4 release, we chose to focus&nbsp;on:</p>  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-v4-one-sided-staking-93988f65e378">Solving rug pulls</a>, since the introduction of datatoken liquidity pools it became apparent that there was the risk of a rug pull in the&nbsp;pool.  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/what-is-a-data-nft-5804a2d88671">Introducing data NFTs</a>, to allow for more flexibility in how to handle a data asset’s “master tape”&nbsp;rights.  More ways for the community to <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/how-to-make-money-from-ocean-v4-477b3decad51?source=collection_home---5------1-----------------------">make money</a>! We want to help the community create sustainable projects as they published, consumed, and built data marketplaces, data wallets, and data&nbsp;DAOs.   Solving Rug&nbsp;Pulls <p>One of the upgrades that we are most proud of is making it safer to stake liquidity in datatoken pools by solving rug pulls. We have done this by introducing one-sided staking.</p><p>In one-sided staking, the publisher does not get any initial datatokens. Instead, datatokens are sent to the one-sided staking bot, which is programmed to regulate the supply. It ensures that the price — the ratio of OCEAN or H2O to datatokens — is kept constant for any staking / unstaking action.</p><p>The result is that the publisher (and no other whale) is no longer in a position to impact the price by pulling out their liquidity.</p> Introducing Data&nbsp;NFTs <p>A centrepiece of the OceanONDA V4 release is the introduction of ERC721 data NFTs. A data NFT represents the copyright (or exclusive license against copyright) for a data asset on the blockchain — we call this the “base IP” (intellectual property). Data NFTs are like “master tapes” and datatokens are like CDs licensed against the master&nbsp;tape.</p><p>When a user publishes a dataset in OceanONDA V4, they create a new NFT as part of the process. This data NFT is proof of your claim of base IP. Assuming a valid claim, you are entitled to the revenue from that asset, just like a title deed gives you the right to receive rent. The data NFT smart contract holds metadata about the data asset, stores roles like “who can mint datatokens” or “who controls fees”, and has an open-ended key-value store to enable custom&nbsp;fields.</p><p>If you have the private key that controls the NFT, you are the owner of that NFT. The owner is the default recipient of any revenue and they can also assign another account to receive revenue. This enables the publisher to sell their base IP and the revenues that come with it. When the data NFT is transferred to another user, all the information about roles and where the revenue should be sent is reset. The default recipient of the revenue is the new owner of the data&nbsp;NFT.</p><p>Data NFTs introduce a new level of flexibility. For instance, in Ocean V3 each asset can only have one type of license for accessing it and it’s not possible to transfer the base IP. In OceanONDA V4 it is now possible to publish different types of datatokens that provide different levels of access to the asset. So for example, one datatoken could give access for one day while another could give access&nbsp;forever.</p><p>With the implementation of data NFTs we have followed the common ERC721 standard which brings further benefits with it. You are able to take advantage of the wider NFT ecosystem and all the tools and possibilities that are constantly growing. As a first example, many leading crypto wallets have first-class support for NFTs, allowing you to manage your data NFTs from your existing&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Data NFTs have flexible metadata key-value pairs (via <a href="https://github.com/ERC725Alliance/erc725/blob/main/docs/ERC-725.md">ERC725</a>y standard), on-chain data availability, and GDPR compliance (via on-chain encryption, decrypted by Ocean Aquarius for rendering in frontends). Caching and retrieval is fast &amp; convenient via Ocean Aquarius / ElasticSearch. With ocean.js &amp; ocean.py drivers, like the rest of&nbsp;Ocean.</p><p>This means that data NFTs have many cool use cases beyond the initial “base IP” use! They can implement a) comments &amp; ratings, b) verifiable claims, c) identity credentials, d) social media posts, and more. <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/v4main/READMEs/profile-nfts-flow.md">Here’s an example</a> of data NFTs for user profile data in a&nbsp;dapp.</p> New Opportunities to Make&nbsp;Money <p>Innovative new ways of making money are one of the most exciting developments that blockchain technology has delivered, and OceanONDA V4 is no different. There are broadly three exciting ways of making money from Ocean — selling data, running a marketplace or providing liquidity. OceanONDA V4 has improved each of these by offering more revenue upside and more flexibility in how fees can be charged. Additionally, we have also introduced an additional fourth way of making revenue by running your own Provider.</p><p>The Ocean V3 smart contracts were limited in how you could charge fees, they only enabled marketplace operators to collect a fee in one place: consume. The value was hardcoded to 0.1% so there was no flexibility at&nbsp;all.</p><p>OceanONDA V4 provides more upside for marketplace operators and far more flexibility. First, V4 smart contracts enable marketplace operators to collect a fee not only in consume, but also in pool-based swaps. Being able to charge fees on swaps is a big win as we have seen that there is 100x more volume on swaps than on consume. The second major change is allowing the marketplace operator to set the fee value at a level they choose. Fees can now also be charged separately in the marketplace where the asset was published and the one where it was consumed.</p><p>Furthermore, Ocean V4 enables third-party Providers to provide compute, for a fee. This enables a marketplace of Providers to emerge. This will work for centralized trusted providers (that the data publisher and consume must trust), but also trustless providers (via decentralization or other privacy-preserving mechanisms).</p><p>The full details of our new fee structure are explained in our&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/fees/">docs</a>.</p> Updates to the Ocean&nbsp;Market <p>While a lot of the most exciting changes introduced by OceanONDA V4 are introduced behind the scenes in the smart contracts (Data NFTs, solving rug pulls, flexible fees), we have also been spending time delivering new upgrades in Ocean Market. We have a cool new publish flow, changes to how the pools work, updates to the asset detail page, and an awesome NFT image generator.</p> New publish&nbsp;flow <p>OceanONDA V4 was always going to be a serious upgrade and we felt it would be fitting to give serious consideration to how we could make a new publish form that was suitable for the new journey — publishing a data&nbsp;NFT.</p><p>If you’re imagining that publishing an NFT must be super complicated — you’re in for a nice surprise, we’ve got a new wizard-style form that makes it wonderfully easy. The whole process, including setting up pricing, is simplified down to 5 steps. It also gives you the opportunity to review everything that you’ve entered, so you can make sure you’re happy before you start signing transactions.</p> Data NFT Image Generator <p>We know how cool it is when you can see the unique visualization of an NFT in your wallet and we felt it was really crucial to allow publishers to choose the image that is associated with their data NFT. On the publish form we have a new SVG generator, you keep clicking refresh and see the alternative styles, it’s fun to play around with. This image will forever remain associated with the data NFT so make sure you’re happy with it before proceeding.</p> Data NFT image on Asset&nbsp;Page <p>And what’s the point of having these cool Ocean wave pictures if you can’t see them anywhere? Well, we wouldn’t miss out on that opportunity — we’ve got them displayed in prime position on the asset page. This is a nice detail that adds an individual touch to each asset&nbsp;page.</p> OceanONDA V4 is Now Fully Available <p>Over the last few weeks, we have been testing and collecting feedback through a bug bounty program while running OceanONDA V4 on various test networks. We are excited to announce that OceanONDA V4 is now live and all the key components are deployed on Ethereum mainnet and Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Energy Web, and Moonriver.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Following my recent blog post on trending topics at EIC 2022, where I discussed the integration of decentralized and centralized identities, there are other topics I’d like to highlight. My #2 on the list of outstanding topics at EIC 2022, is the return of policy-based IAM.</p>
<p>More than a decade ago, XACML (eXtensible Access Control Markup Language) was a trending topic, as a standard that allows applications to send a request to an authorization server at run-time. The server then checked this request and either granted or revoked access (or granted access with restrictions). Externalizing authorization and basing it on centrally defined, explicit policies is a great idea. Unfortunately, XACML failed to deliver on the promise of widespread adoption.</p>
<p>To read more, read this Market Compass report on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/mc81101/policy-based-access-management">Policy Based Access Management</a> and have a look at this technology report entitled: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/report/fg_xacml_report">XACML – Extensible Access Control Markup Language</a>.</p>
 New era with OPA and Rego 
<p>In the past year, however, things have started to change, and policy-based authorizations and access control have been back as a prominent topic at EIC. They never disappeared, really, but with the emergence of OPA (Open Policy Agent) and Rego as a policy-language, widespread adoption of policy-based authorization by developers has begun. When building digital services from scratch, it is straightforward to rely on an external policy engine. This reduces the burden on developers, increases security, and speeds up time-to-value. To find out more about OPA and this topic in general, have a look at this webinar: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/2022/04/open-policy-agent">Policy Based Access Control for Cloud-Native Applications</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>OPA and Rego are just part of a bigger trend, where policy-based access controls are returning to the center of attention. JIT (Just-in-Time) access for privileged and standard users is another important topic, and we observe the growing interest of customers in strategically moving towards policy-based approaches in IAM. Technology is maturing. Standards are evolving. Time to put this topic on the top of the IAM agenda again, for efficiency, security, and time-to-value. It is also time to finally solve the authorization challenge, which is one of the underserved areas in IAM.</p>
<p>Here are some links to presentations and panel discussions at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2022/agenda">EIC 2022</a> that focused on OPA:</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and welcome to this new episode. And today, we’ll talk about enabling and protecting children’s digital identity. And for that, we have two guests who are working together in this very important issue.</p>
<p>Let me introduce my first guest, it’s Nicky Hickman. She is a Freelance Product and Innovation Manager based in the UK with international experience in the Asia Pacific, Europe and Africa. With a background in telecoms, she has worked with digital identity and personal data markets for 20 years researching, designing and delivering multichannel, large-scale CIAM services and strategies for clients including Vodafone, O2, the GSMA, Barclays, Sky, and Verizon.</p>
<p>All of Nicky’s recent work focuses on using digital identity to promote socio-economic inclusion, and impact against the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals with an underlying commercial business model that is sustainable for the long-term. For the last year, Nicky has focused on youth and child identity through work with a UNICEF YOMA programme, and with TrustElevate as a Product and Innovation Manager.</p>
<p>Our second guest is Dr. Rachel O’Connell. She is a leading expert on online child safety. Her PhD examined paedophile activity online and the implications for investigative strategies. Rachel set up the first UK Internet Safety Centre in 2000. She was Chief Security Officer for Bebo, a social networking platform between 2006 and 2010. Rachel is the founder of TrustElevate. She’s an author of a technical standard published by the British Standards Institution that describes how to verify the age band, a person belongs in, a privacy preserving and secure manner.</p>
<p>Hello, Rachel. Hello, Nicky, welcome.</p>
<p>Dr. Rachel O’Connell: Hello.</p>
<p>Nicky Hickman: Hello, Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s a pleasure being with you. Definitely we want to hear– and for the first time touching specifically this topic of children’s digital identity. So, let’s start talking about digital identity. First, I would like to hear, as always, a bit more about our guests, especially how was your journey into this world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Rachel: Absolutely. So, Oscar, for me, it was you mentioned that my PhD was analysing paedophile activity on the internet, and that was way back in the late 1990s. And since then, I’ve just been a firm advocate of the very simple premise that platforms need to know the age bands of their users so that they can better protect them. And that’s been the kind of driving force throughout my career as I set up the first UK Internet Safety Centres and ran 19 of them across Europe. We’re developing programmes of education to keep kids safe online and to equip parents, teachers, social workers, anybody responsible for the care of children and young people. We wanted to equip them with the kind of tools, the knowledge, and the skills to navigate the internet safely.</p>
<p>But also, another focus was looking on how we could leverage the technology intelligently, to enhance children’s safety online. And I’ve been working in and I’ve chaired a number of cross industry groups. For example, we developed the Safer Social Networking Principles that were guidelines for social media companies to comply with, but it was during the era of self-regulation. So even though companies signed up to make under 16s’ profiles private by default, and we had a signing event, et cetera, a few weeks later, those companies reverted to making those profiles public.</p>
<p>So, there is a clear and present need for regulatory drivers to enhance children’s safety online to ensure the companies are held accountable and are transparent in terms of the measures that they take to keep kids safe online. And critical and central to that is digital identity and specifically checking a particular attribute of a child which is their age, to understand their age.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thank you, Rachel. And Nicky, what was your journey?</p>
<p>Nicky: Quite different from Rachel. I started working with digital identity in the telecoms industry, working on kind of large-scale multichannel digital identity capabilities for consumers about the time that the mobile internet was just starting. So, there weren’t really CIAM solutions at the time, we were using Enterprise IAM solutions. I then did some work with various programmes associated with government type digital identity, now known as the .Verify solution. And I worked with Verizon and Barclays on various rounds with that.</p>
<p>And then I’ve also, I’ve done quite a lot of work on the other side of identity, attribute sharing in advertising and media and banking markets. More in the last five years, I’ve really been focusing my identity time in the self-sovereign identity, decentralised community. And I lead some working groups at the Trust over IP Foundation at the moment, focused on human experience and understanding harms associated with digital identity, particularly in decentralised ecosystems. So, I’m on much more of a commercial focus, perhaps than Rachel, and just kind of large-scale login angle for many years.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, thank you. So, it’s super interesting the journey that you came to now work together in TrustElevate solving this problem that we’re going to discuss today. So, first question will be, why do children need a digital identity?</p>
<p>Rachel: It’s absolutely critical in terms of like- one in three users online are children, young people, the services that have been developed social media, gaming, et cetera have been designed with adults in mind. And therefore, when platforms don’t know the ages of their users reliably, that inhibits and means that children can’t exercise their rights online. And they can’t benefit both from the protections that should be afforded to them and the opportunities. Knowing the age bands of your users, rather than restricting them, it actually creates safer environments for them to have fun and enjoy and to exercise their rights and connect with kids in the same age bands.</p>
<p>And right now, the business models that underpin social media, the systems and processes are driven by a commercial imperative around the attention economy, trying to keep your eyeballs on that screen for as long as possible so that you could see the maximum number of ads. And that business model puts children at risk and definitely needs to be, and is currently being, reviewed by lawmakers around the world.</p>
<p>For example, the easiest way to explain this is that, for example, if you’re an adult and you’re really interested in cooking and comedy, if you go on TikTok, the algorithms detect that and just serve you that content, which is fine. If you’re an adult with a sexual interest in children, the algorithm similarly detects that you are interested in looking at content that’s produced by 6, 7, 8-year-olds, and will connect you seamlessly with those children. And when those children are live streaming, their audience are adults, who ask them to engage in specific, sometimes sexually explicit acts. And so, we’ve seen over the last year, a quadrupling in the prevalence of child sexual abuse material online because these guys are asking these kids to engage in specific sex acts.</p>
<p>So, the business models that underpin the operation of social media platforms actively put children at risk. So having a digital identity, and specifically having one aspect of your digital identity, i.e., your age band, known to the platforms should result in a massive reduction in the risks, the kid’s exposure to risks and harms.</p>
<p>Another example of that is, for example, if you’re a young girl or a young boy, and you might be worried about your weight, and you go on YouTube, and you look at a video about, I don’t know, a diet smoothie, the algorithm similarly detects that. And then you’re inundated with a tsunami of content that relates to eating and eating disordered behaviour, because the attention economy wants to keep you engaged. So, the content becomes more and more engaging but in some instances it’s very, very harmful. So, by knowing the age bands, on one part of your digital identity, you can mitigate the risk.</p>
<p>The third kind of risk then that to be aware of is huge amounts of data about children has been collected by companies so that they can serve ads. So, what you’re seeing is the surveillance, corporate surveillance of children from a very, very young age, in the absence of their knowledge or indeed the knowledge of their parents. So those are the sorts of issues that need to be combatted.</p>
<p>And a final one then is then you’ve got kid influencers. Many parents of children who like to be influencer, kid influencers stars, so they have– they run unboxing. They get new toys, and they film the unboxing of those toys and stuff. And these children have huge followings. Some of them started out with life as young as four years of age.</p>
<p>So, a French MEP introduced employment law to protect these kids, and to make sure not only that the platforms look out for the well-being of these children, but also that their parents do. So, there is a plethora of, there are just some top-level examples about how digital identity could impact positively on enabling those kids to exercise their rights online and to be protected.</p>
<p>Nicky: Maybe I could add to that. I thought this was a kind of interesting question, and needed to be supplemented by some other questions, because in many respects, children already have multiple identities online. In many cases, before they’re even born, their parents are sharing images about them. And the platforms are tracking the fact that they’re coming into the world, because they can derive from their parents’ activity, they can estimate birthday, you know, we all know the amazing things you can do with analytics. So, they’ve got loads of identities. And that suggests there’s a need, at least from the platforms if you like, and in many ways from the parents, for them to be recognised online.</p>
<p>The questions are more that I would ask are what type of ID is it? And who controls that ID? And when do they get an ID that they control, that they are aware of, and that they’re able to understand, start moving their learning and understanding about what that means in terms of their interactions, and the exercise of those rights that Rachel was talking about. So, my answer to the question is, they already have one. And what the need is, they need a control point that rests with their parents, and as with other rights and responsibilities as you grow up is gradually transitioned to the control of the child.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, indeed, I agree with your comment, Nicky. And the way that Rachel explained all this problem, it’s huge, definitely it’s huge. Many reasons why children need a digital identity in a controlled way. And one of the main aspects that comes to our minds when we think of digital identity for children, especially underage, is verify someone’s age. So, why should companies verify someone’s age when they are using an online service?</p>
<p>Rachel: They’re essentially for the reasons outlined earlier. Once they know a person’s age, they can then tailor the service accordingly. And increasingly, we’re seeing a raft of regulations. So, this is – these are regulatory requirements. There are drivers such as the General Data Protection Regulation, Article 8 of which requires companies, they’re going to process the data of anybody under the age of 16 to obtain parental consent. Now there is go for a derogation, so some countries like Germany have stuck with 16 and Ireland, but the UK and Malta, for example, have gone for 13. And this reflects the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act in the US which came into- was started to be discussed in 1998, right? So, this is a consistent kind of issue, and has been to date, the unsolvable problem online.</p>
<p>But now, we’re seeing a plethora of age verification and parental consent projects. And certainly, that’s what TrustElevate is, we’re a child age verification and parental consent provider so we can actually meet this requirement. That’s also echoed in the Digital Services Act, and a whole range of Internet Safety, Online Safety bills, that first originated in Australia, and the most recent one is being discussed currently in the UK, which all of these take at their core, the notion of a duty of care that company should exercise a duty of care towards children and young people.</p>
<p>And the simple kind of analogy is in the real world. If you go to an amusement park that has really big roller coaster rides and smaller ones for kids. If you’re not above a certain height, if you’re below a certain height, you’re not allowed to go on to the big, huge roller coasters, you have to be confined to the smaller ones, which are still a huge amount of fun, particularly if you’re a kid. So, it’s kind of trying to bring those health and safety requirements into the online digital playgrounds.</p>
<p>The question is why should companies? They should do it because it’s the right thing to do. But now there are regulatory drivers that insist that they should do. And similarly, a lot of the Age Annual General Meetings are happening at Meta, Alphabet and Amazon. So, their shareholders are increasingly calling for greater transparency and accountability in relation to, not only children’s rights but human rights impacts around the world. They are saying to companies, you have a responsibility, we have seen what the unfettered spread of misinformation, disinformation online, the harms that can result.</p>
<p>So, there is an increasing pressure on companies to know the age bands of their users and also to conduct impact assessments to understand the features of their products and how the deep learning, machine learning and algorithms and recommendations engines, how those are actually impacting on society and human rights in general.</p>
<p>Oscar: And those regulations you have mentioned, how present are they across the globe? So, what would you say, are in many countries or just a few of them right now?</p>
<p>Rachel: Oh, absolutely. So, the General Data Protection Regulation has got an extra territoriality clause in it, which means it applies globally, just as the COPA, the Children’s Online Privacy Act, apply to globally. But what we’re seeing in like, for example, South Africa, in various countries around the world, the GDPR, or the General Data Protection Regulation is being replicated.</p>
<p>So, one of the industry, when I worked within the industry, one of the responses that we had to lawmakers was like, “Hey, listen, we’re offering a free service. There are different legislations in different jurisdictions, which would mean we’d have to have compliance teams in each country and that’s overly burdensome.” But now there’s a whole almost a harmonisation of data protection regulation. And also, and increasingly, you could see a harmonisation in relation to the centrality of human rights and the need to conduct impact assessments, and for there to be regulatory oversight of these companies in terms of their degree of adherence and alignment to those requirements. So, it’s happening globally. And, frankly, it’s kind of about time.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed. And how can you verify the age of a user?</p>
<p>Rachel: So, we have, for example, TrustElevate, we have developed a way to do this, and we’ve got a process patent pending on this. So, we’re gathering data from minimal, absolutely minimal data points from the parents first name, last name, mobile number, and the child’s first name, last name and date of birth. And we’ve connected to a number of authoritative data sources, government and non-government data sources. And we check for a match. We’re hashing the data on the user’s device, and the data sources that we’re checking against. So, we don’t hold any data. It’s a zero data, zero knowledge model. And this is quite ground-breaking. And it was because we are driven, our purpose is to enhance child safety online, it’s not to use their data in any way that is harmful. So that’s the core in essence of how TrustElevate does this. We don’t require biometrics, or any document scanning.</p>
<p>Other services that are out there scan the faces of children and estimate the age of those children, which can be useful. And so, it certainly can be useful in the context of 18 plus. If you want to go to a remote checkout, or a checkout that isn’t handled by a human being anywhere to buy some wine, it can be handy to have age estimation. But age estimation has its drawbacks in terms of younger children, because it’s happening in the absence of the consent of the parents, or indeed the child who’s too young to give consent.</p>
<p>Other approaches are using various data sources and, again, estimating potentially the age. So different sectors are going to require different levels of assurance in relation to how confident you can be in the verification. There is a plethora of approaches that are developing, because this is a new marketplace. And many of these are subject, all of these actually are subject to regulatory oversight.</p>
<p>Nicky: And maybe I could add a couple of points on that. So, in terms of the regulatory and compliance and indeed commercial drivers for businesses, one aspect that’s really caught my interest in the last year or so, is the new requirement, the EU Directive on corporate responsibility and sustainability due diligence against environmental, social and governance factors.</p>
<p>This is important for businesses operating in any market where you’re using digital identity, because the requirement moves from an optional or reporting requirement to due diligence. And obviously, identity data is going to be really fundamental in these growing ESG data markets. And also, how that translates in terms of obviously, investment in capital markets.</p>
<p>So, adherence to human rights and supporting that in your product and your business at every level, for me, this is really significant because it moves it out of the CSR department and into the core of your business. So, there’s lots of thinking and opportunity for identity and attribute verification services to happen there.</p>
<p>Also I think, one of the things that really surprised me when I first started working with Rachel, is that this requirement to know the age of your users or the age band, for example, adhering to children’s code or age-appropriate design code, and so forth. What surprised me was that platforms don’t know. They say they can’t know. Because my experience in data analytics is that absolutely they know, otherwise, they can’t sell the advertising. It’s one of the core attributes.</p>
<p>So, I mean you know, we’ve seen evidence from Meta, they know the harms that are being done specifically to teenage girls. So, they know a great deal more often than many of the kind of bearer providers like the telcos. So, I really struggle with this, because the tech is not hard. There are many solutions, as Rachel pointed out. Obviously, many of them are very disrespectful of that initial consent piece, which is so fundamental with children, scanning lots of faces, you know, we’re all– “we don’t want that, we don’t need that.” And obviously, from a documentation ID and V perspective, children don’t have utility bills. So, they’re automatically thin files. So, it’s very difficult to start using the documentation approach.</p>
<p>So really, this interrogation of data sources, which the platforms have, to at least a degree of level of assurance. So, we rely on the regulators, the policy makers, and the moral compass of people making these decisions, thinking about all the children in their life, just to do the right thing and recognise the age band of users. Obviously, verification requires a solution, like TrustElevate or one of the others. But I’m pretty certain that the methods, the platforms like Meta or in Google have already, they are more accurate, I would suggest than the plus or minus three years that you get from facial scanning.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, most likely, that’s the case, at least in the big platform. Big platforms should have that capability. I agree with that. The technical – yeah, it has like an excuse. One topic that it’s related also, I’ve been talking recently is the guardianship. Could you, any of you, tell us a bit about guardianship?</p>
<p>Nicky: Sure, I’ll take that one. So, guardianship is obviously a legal term in many jurisdictions. But what we mean by guardianship, in a more general sense, kind of started about three years ago when we were doing The Sovrin Foundation Governance Framework. And we were thinking about what was necessary for self-sovereign identity and for identity for all that anyone could have a digital identity via the Sovrin Network. And we started thinking about how you manage people who, for whatever reason, digital exclusion, or they’re a child, or they’re an elder person living with dementia, or they’re a refugee, or many such exclusionary examples.</p>
<p>And we wrote a <a href="https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/Guardianship-Whitepaper2.pdf">white paper</a>, which is freely available from <a href="https://sovrin.org/">The Sovrin Foundation</a> website, about guardianship. That has been, further extended and explored, and it looks at how you could use things like verifiable credentials and other governance constructs to enable guardianship. And this would be represented, obviously, the parent is the guardian of a child, and they are able to exercise their rights and responsibilities with respect to dependents. And they are also gradually able to transfer those rights and responsibilities because there’s no cut-off date when you cease to be a child and suddenly become an adult.</p>
<p>And all of us require guardianship or our guardians at some point in our lives. So, it enables by fragmenting out, if you like, not having one single digital identity or decentralised solution, you’re able to represent those relationships using various forms of digital identity. Obviously, it can be done in a more classic, centralised model. But considering the number of different context and jurisdictions that you might want to assert your identity, and the need for data minimisation, particularly when it comes to children. You know, we looked into that and to my mind, if you’re not designing guardianship into your identity architecture and set of services, then you’re going to have to go back and start again. It’s so fundamental, in my mind to a good architecture that is respectful of human rights and is focused on human beings.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, as we know, you’ve been describing in a very interesting way, what are the challenges, the solutions that have been introduced also from the technical side, from the regulatory side. But we also know that the identity landscape is evolving, it’s evolving all the time. So those challenges that we are describing now, or were the main challenges few years ago, will be changing. So how that, this change of challenges affects the solutions or the proposal for verifying the children’s identity?</p>
<p>Rachel: So, we are seeing increasingly, as Nicky just really eloquently pointed out there, the responsibility that companies have in relation to understanding guardianship and building that into their frameworks. And we’re seeing increasingly across the EU, for example, the eIDAS framework, and the architecture, and for mobile bank and eID and its use, there is an increasing focus on children and young people. So, there’s a project at the moment called <a href="https://euconsent.eu/">euCONSENT</a>, which is looking at exactly this issue about guardianship and parental responsibility.</p>
<p>And the key thing to keep in mind Oscar, is that like kids as young as two, three or four are online, they’re on YouTube videos. So, at that very young age, there is such a critical need for parental oversight. And for parents to be able to exercise children’s rights on their behalf in relation to what happens to their data, what kind of content that they’re exposed to, and increasingly, we’re seeing VR in education. They’re huge. This technology is so exciting. It’s so incredibly exciting, that children could put on these headsets and be transposed to, I don’t know, if they’re studying volcanoes to see Mount Etna and stuff. There are incredible, incredible opportunities here. And we want children to be able to benefit from these and not have to deal with the huge negative issues that they’ve had to deal with, that they can deal with on an everyday basis.</p>
<p>And, for example at Bebo, I was responsible for the abuse management system, so first hand, the issues that kids have to deal with in relation to eating disorders, suicidal ideation, self-harm, and adults with a sexual interest approaching them. So, these future Metaverse and VR-enabled environments need to be designed with safety at its core. Safety by design principles need to be implemented. Core to that is understanding the age bands, and then critical to that are their supporting identity architectures and trust frameworks that can enable that at a global level. And for those to be interoperable is critical also.</p>
<p>Nicky: I see some interesting trends in the landscape at the moment, which are going to throw up some new challenges and opportunities for children’s identity. So, I think the first is obviously, there’s lots of talk about Web 3.0 and it’s definitely happening in all sorts of different ways. There are new types of asset and one of those types of asset is our digital identity.</p>
<p>What’s interesting for me is a couple of trends from the kind of world of DeFi and crypto and stuff like that, is the falling importance of legal identity, because a lot of it is wild west, and there aren’t the legal frameworks in place, although they’re coming. And there’s obviously a kind of anarchic strand in there. It’s kind of designed, the world of Bitcoin is designed not to be controllable or regulated by central authorities and governments, in particular, which obviously has that strong link with legal identity.</p>
<p>So, what you’re seeing is emerging are two other types of sort of clustering of attributes and identity. The first is ability to pay. Now, if we think most of our identity systems are there to manage risk and liability. Because children are not legally liable, they’re of little interest to centrally orchestrated identity systems that control only the risks to that central authority or paying stakeholders. So, as we recognise more types of value exchange above and beyond payments and in fiat, for example, I think that ability to pay will be calculated and managed in a different way. So, I think that provides a challenge for children because obviously, one of their rights is financial inclusion, and there are some challenges around privacy, different types of control points. And again, the interplay of liabilities in complex and decentralised transactions. So, identity that’s more about the ability to pay, and more about the association of attributes with different types of value.</p>
<p>And then the second one that’s emerging quite strongly is reputation based, social reputation. So, in the world of crypto, etc., they just care about the consequences. So, there’s no law, and they’re not going to be fined necessarily, because there’s no central authority or judiciary to impose that law. Even though we’ve got things like DAOs, at the same time, what you’re seeing is a kind of self-regulation. So, what’s the worst thing that could happen to you, is that your reputation in these networks takes a beating, and that no one will do business with you or trade with you. And so, you’ve got things like KILT developing, which are based on reputation scoring. So, I see a lot more of that kind of identity emerging, which might be, nothing about what we would classically call legal identity or foundational identity.</p>
<p>Rachel: Yes, and in terms of that ability to pay as well, in the more regulated spaces, we’re seeing the Payment Services Directive, which enables bank-to-bank transactions, and the growth of super apps such as, which are basically enabling you to, like WeChat in China, enabling you to do everything, pretty much everything from within the app. So that ability for kids to be able to make bank-to-bank transactions brings in secure customer authentication requirements.</p>
<p>For example, a child’s bank account, until they’re about 11 or 12, is a sub-account of a parent’s account. So, in the more regulated payment environments, there is a need for– and certainly that’s a driver for the evolving digital identity landscape, to ensure that the legal requirements for secure customer authentication of the parents, and that the authorisation of that transaction to happen is critical.</p>
<p>And also, for example, TrustElevate, we enabled digital onboarding of child and teen bank accounts, which is new, because ordinarily, you have to go into a bank with your child and have somebody look at your identity documents, and basically eyeball you and the child and say, “How likely is it that this chap is that child’s parent?”</p>
<p>So, we’re seeing the evolving digital landscape, identity landscape is streamlining those processes and making those a seamless process and that should result in a greater proportion of children having access to bank accounts. And then that in combination with PSD2, we can see a change in that happening and the levels of financial inclusion and the opportunities for financial education for children and young people. So, it’s a change that will have an impact across business sectors and enhancing children’s rights in relation to payments and their engagements online.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely, that’s a great solution that you already have shaped by TrustElevate. Indeed, hearing both of you, again, I can see many new challenges, let’s say growing at this time we are speaking and some that will become more relevant in the years to come. So, if you can just shortly summarise how do we overcome these new challenges?</p>
<p>Rachel: I think part and parcel is, and it’s really, really important to understand, like Nicky brought this up earlier, of course, companies know probably within reason, a reasonable number of years, the ages have their users. But the thing is, they’ve had 20 years to recognise that and to behave accordingly, and they haven’t done so.</p>
<p>But there’s also that notion of, for example, in a nightclub, you have a bouncer who’s not going to let you get into the nightclub if you’re 12 years old, right? So that’s what age verification does. It’s a bouncer at the door, rather than the systems that currently are in place, it’s like let everybody in, and then we’ll use AI and tracking and surveillance to pick out the ones that are below age, and then kick them out. And in the absence of a reliable age verification system, you can kick them out, but they can just create a new identity and login again. So, if you remove all your cookies, you could just set up another account. It’s a little bit more challenging with mobile phones these days.</p>
<p>So, we need to set a standard. And that’s what the PAS 1296 Age Checking Code of Practice did, is set a standard, and that’s becoming an ISO standard. And once we have those standards in place, and the legislation in place, and the drivers such as shareholders holding companies to be a bit more responsible, then we can have greater clarity in relation to what is expected of companies, and where the lines are drawn in relation to what is acceptable and what is illegal, or what is in noncompliance with the legislation.</p>
<p>So those are the challenges. It’s ensuring those regulatory drivers have enough of an import on the way that companies think about their duty of care towards children and young people. And then ensuring that regulators– one of the challenges to date has been that regulators have kind of operated in silos. The data protection regulator is not necessarily talking to the Financial Conduct, the financial regulator, they weren’t necessarily speaking to Competition Markets Authority.</p>
<p>What we’re seeing over the last few years is those– a recognition that those regulators need to be speaking to each other and need to have a way to enforce the regulation and a way to communicate to industry to help them to understand all the differing- the impact of a raft of regulation on different aspects of their businesses. And once they understand that, actually, if I’m going to be selling products and I want to enable bank-to-bank transactions, there is a clear return on investment in terms of knowing the identity of my users, so that I can enable that to happen, right?</p>
<p>So, getting companies to understand the impact of those regulations on different business verticals, and horizontally, having the ability to know the key identity attributes of their users, it actually makes good business sense. And I think once companies grasp that, and also understand that for end users, trust is a massive differentiator, right? People have seen the negative impact of the unfettered spread of misinformation, disinformation, the harms on children, so they’re expecting more from companies.</p>
<p>And also, we’ve had a generation, a couple of generations of kids going through who are now adults. And so, there’s almost a mobilisation of consumers to say, “Listen, we expect more from you and we demand more from you, as companies.” So, I think the winners in going forward will be those companies that recognise that actually it is valuable and meaningful, and there’s a massive return on investment for them, if they behave responsibly, and comply with the regulations, and exercise a duty of care towards children and young people.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thank you. Final question for you, for all business leaders, listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Rachel: I think they must recognise that they need to know the ages of their users and design their services accordingly. They need to understand the harms, and work with– very often, and I’ve seen this myself working with product developers and stuff like, “Whoa, dude, we could create this amazing product, and then we’ll be able to serve ads.” Increasing legislation and statutory obligations are to think about the age bands of your users, think about the various harms, the known risks and harms that are associated with particular product features, and behaviour modification, like endless scroll and loop boxes. And there are known mitigations.</p>
<p>So, making sure that your product developers, data scientists, and commercial teams are engaged in the process of conducting a Child Rights Impact Assessment, so that they’re understanding and really thinking through and then documented, “we’ve considered these risks, these know risks and known harms, we’ve utilised, we’ve put in place these mitigations so we’ve kind of diversified our product offering depending upon the ages of our users”. And then you build consumer trust. So, thinking through those regulatory requirements, and the end user, and exercising their duty of care is certainly something that they should have on their agenda.</p>
<p>Nicky: And I just have one simple thing that you could do is create a youth council in your organisation that’s made up of young people and works with children themselves. Because as adults, we haven’t grown up with the world that we see today. We’re too busy creating the wonder machines and trying to figure out the latest software and so forth, but they’re living this experience and as with all great products and services, if you talk to the people who you’re designing the service for and co-create with them, then all sorts of magic can happen. So, create a youth council for your organisation.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, great idea. Thank you for that. And thank you for this super interesting conversation. Would you finally please tell us if someone would like to get in touch with you or learn more about the work you are doing what are the best ways for that?</p>
<p>Rachel: You can come to info@trustelevate.com, or to me directly Rachel@trustelevate.com.</p>
<p>Nicky: Yeah. And you can contact me at Nicky@trustelevate.com or via LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Oscar: Perfect. Well, thank you very much Nicky and Rachel for the super interesting interview. And congratulations for all the work, the amazing work you are doing. So, thanks a lot and all the best.</p>
<p>Nicky: OK. Thanks, Oscar.</p>
<p>Rachel: Thank you. Thank you, Oscar.</p>

  <p>Cyber-Attacks are increasing in frequency and they are getting smarter at an amazing pace, with each successful hit being potentially more disastrous than the last, causing greater destruction and incurring higher recovery costs. At the same time, we are working hard to increase resilience by investing in more and better tools, and the latest technology, creating an over-abundance of cybersecurity infrastructure and tools. But are we doing any better or is it even getting worse? Such a complex tools landscape comes at a price: more patch management challenges, more misconfiguration, more privileges to manage, and more risk.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kclive-2022-spotlight-dirk-wahlefeld"></a>

 Veriscope — Weekly Regulatory Recap  A quick review of past week’s most important news and updates on crypto regulation. <p>Welcome to the first Veriscope Regulatory Recap, a quick review of past week’s most important news and updates on crypto regulation. Our goal is to raise awareness of the growing global effort to bring crypto under regulation, and the push from the industry’s best and brightest to make sure that it is done in a constructive and intelligent way.</p><p>We hope you enjoy it; don’t forget to subscribe to our weekly recap post, comment and&nbsp;share!</p> European Union may Remove the €1000 Threshold for Implementation of FATF’s Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>The EU parliament is currently discussing the proposal to remove the €1,000 threshold set by FATF for the Travel Rule to kick in. If the proposal receives green light from the EU parliament, virtually all crypto transactions will have to go through the Travel Rule scanner, no matter the&nbsp;amount.</p><p>In a recent video <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2022/eu-parliament-likely-to-impose-restrictive-aml-rule-on-crypto-expert-says/">published on PYMNTS.com</a>, Ajinkya Tulpule, Chief Compliance Officer at crypto exchange bitFlyer, said that a lot of crypto exchanges are lobbying against this proposal as they see it as an extreme measure. Yet, there is a significant chance of the proposal getting approved. After all, most MEPs (Members of the Parliament) favor&nbsp;it.</p><p>Tulpule believes that the proposal may turn out to be a “Headache” for virtual asset exchanges if it comes into force. That said, a robust Travel Rule Solution Provider (TRSP) such as <a href="https://www.veriscope.network/">Veriscope</a> can make Travel Rule compliance easier for exchanges.</p> A Fall-out of Terra-Luna Fiasco: South Korea to Form a new Regulatory Body for Digital&nbsp;Assets <p>South Korea will launch a regulatory body to oversee the nascent digital asset sector in the country. Recent reports indicate that the South Korean government is fast-tracking the launch of a crypto regulatory body because of the Terra-Luna debacle that led to investors losing millions of&nbsp;dollars.</p><p>The news was first reported by <a href="https://www.newspim.com/news/view/20220531000633">Newspim</a>, which mentioned that the regulatory body named “Digital Assets Committee” is likely to launch early next month. It will be distinct from the other two major financial authorities, namely Financial Services Committee (FSC) and Financial Supervisory Service&nbsp;(FSS).</p><p>Currently, the Financial Services Committee and its financial intelligence unit monitor and ensure that the crypto industry plays by South Korean rules. But once the Digital Assets Committee is launched, it will be the sole authority to ensure strict compliance by the virtual asset companies operating in the&nbsp;country.</p> European Council &amp; Parliament Come to an Agreement on Digital Operational Resilience Act <p>The European Council issued <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/05/11/digital-finance-provisional-agreement-reached-on-dora/">a press release on 11th May 2022</a>, announcing that it has come into a provisional agreement with the European Parliament on Digital Operational Resilience Act.</p><p>Popularly known by its moniker, DORA, the law aims to strengthen the European financial industry. Once the law comes into the implementation, a range of industries, from virtual assets to payment providers, will have to begin complying with&nbsp;it.</p><p>The first thing DORA would do is bring uniformity to financial companies’ networks and information infrastructure security. It will compel financial companies to maintain an extensive risk-tackling mechanism, a thorough record of any ICT breaches, and conduct regular preventive exercises to test the resiliency of the system. Besides, it will also bring in the third-party service providers of these financial companies within the regulatory net.</p> European Financial regulatory Bodies Call for “License Revocation” of Crypto Exchanges Violating AML&nbsp;Rules <p>Three European Financial bodies, namely European Banking Authority, European Insurance and Occupational Pension Authority, and European Securities and Markets Authority, recently published a 73-page report titled “<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/joint_report_on_withdrawal_of_authorisation_aml_breaches.pdf">On the withdrawal of authorization for serious breaches of AML/CFT&nbsp;rules</a>.”</p><p>In the report, the financial bodies overseeing securities, pension, insurance, and banking sectors in the 27-nation bloc called for stringent action against virtual asset companies for violating anti-money laundering provisions. That said, the report also notes that license revocation should only be used as a last resort and that, too, in severe cases&nbsp;only.</p><p>Governments are coming together to regulate the digital assets industry globally. Thus, complying with crypto regulations is no longer an option but a must-do. The most prominent piece of regulation that virtual asset companies must start complying with is FATF’s Travel Rule, which will sooner or later be adopted by all countries globally. And that’s where a Travel Rule Solution Provider (TRSP), such as Veriscope, comes into the picture.

<p>In this vlog, our Chief Strategy Officer and Co-Founder, Mike Engle, joins our Chief Marketing Officer, Michael Cichon to discuss how a zero trust architecture can be defeated. They also discuss how to go beyond 2FA and MFA to prove identity and prevent breaches.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello, everybody. This is Michael Cichon, chief marketing officer at 1Kosmos. I’m here again today with Mike Engle, our co-founder and chief strategy officer, to discuss zero trust. Mike, welcome to our vlog.</p>
<p>Thanks, Michael. It’s great to be here.</p>
<p>I got to tell you, I read recently, I think it was a tweet from an IT person that said, “The next vendor that mentions zero trust, I’m going to stab them.” At the risk of getting stabbed, what is zero trust? Can you get us started?</p>
<p>It’s actually been around for a long, long time. I think I read that the concept was first coined in 1994 by some professor in some doctoral thesis or something and then Google made it pretty popular. There was some organization called the Jericho Forum that talked about it 10, 15 years ago. It’s been around for a while but it got really popular, I’d say in the last eight to 10 years or so. And the idea is that your perimeter is disappearing.</p>
<p>It used to be, back when I was running infrastructure for a large company doing the security, you’d have firewalls and harden your external systems and you’d have DMZs and all this stuff. Well now with all the compute resources going to the cloud and everybody having 10 computers on them, half of them managed half of them not, you have to assume that the bad guys are going to get visibility into kind of all of your compute resources. And so they say, you always have to verify. You can’t just trust that somebody has gotten in the right way, which is the way it used to be back in the old days before I had gray hair.</p>
<p>A little bit of gray hair. Unverified trust, I guess that’s the vulnerability then.</p>
<p>It is. Imagine again, going back to say in the 2000s, somebody would VPN into your network and then it’d be very simple. You’d have file shares open, you’d go grab your files and things like that. Anybody who could get in through that perimeter could just kind of have their way with what’s on the inside so you made that outside really hard.</p>
<p>Because IT is trying to make the environment secure but at the same time convenient for users. It’s this balance between convenience, I guess, and safety or security. But I guess while everybody seems to be peddling zero trust now, while a lot of security practitioners, network administrators want zero trust, maybe they know more what they don’t want than what they do want and maybe the architecture is not that clear to them. Can you talk a little bit about the architecture that supports a zero trust environment?</p>
<p>There’s six pillars of zero trust and some examples are the identity, which we’re going to talk about here today of who’s coming in, the security of the endpoints themselves. Do you have the proper security on the workstation or on the phone or whatever it is on the servers? There’s an kind of an auditing component. There’s also authorization. What are you allowed to do once you get in? All of them need to be addressed as part of zero trust and it’s a journey. It’s a continuous kind of business process analysis but arguably the most important pillar of those six is identity. Because imagine if I absolutely knew it was Michael coming in and doing something inside the infrastructure, then I’m a little more comfortable with what is happening after that fact.</p>
<p>1Kosmos, we’re an identity verification solution as well as an authentication solution, so I think the critics will say, “Well, every SSO, every identity provider is going to claim that zero trust is the same as identity.” You just said, it’s maybe one of six pillars. Can you step into that a bit and differentiate maybe what part of zero trust is identity and what is not?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly. We all know that usernames and passwords are not identity because anybody can, if they have your username and password, they can get in and they can get access to whatever it is you had. What a lot of people say is, “Well, I’ll put 2FA or MFA on and that’s zero trust.” But it’s not, it is better security but it’s not zero trust because those other things, whether it’s a token or a one time code or whatever, can also be used by somebody else. And that’s to me, the real definition of zero trust is can somebody else use it? Can I unlock my iPhone and go give it to a colleague or let them enroll, their our phone is me?” And the answer is typically with most traditional or even the newer MFA systems, the answer is yes. The only way to do zero trust is with a biometric.</p>
<p>Well, because you got me thinking now because the network administrator or the network security guy, he’s going to say, “Well, I’m getting identity from my IDP.” But I guess the acid test is, can that identity be reused by somebody that isn’t that person?</p>
<p>And the term IDP is often misused as well. People confuse SSO systems with IDP because let’s say you put an SSO system in and there’s a handful of big vendors out there that we all know and love and they single sign on super easy. You get into this one front door and now you don’t have to log into Slack or Salesforce. The SSO system just kind of passes a, it’s okay signal and they take it. But if you compromise that single sign on system, because there’s no identity there, there’s username, password 2FA. Now you’ve actually kind of made your security worse. Imagine now you have access to those 200 downstream systems because you got one username and password. If that SSO system said, “Who is this? I really need to know,” and you could prove it, now you’ve got a match made in heaven. Now you have identity coming into the SSO and can be used over and over again.</p>
<p>You’ve kind of hinted at this in a couple ways. The question is, what then is identity? You mentioned biometrics, you just mentioned proofing, I think. Can you bring it all together and describe when you talk about identity as a critical pillar supporting zero trust, what is identity then?</p>
<p>Identity is a credential matched to a biometric. And the word biometric is also a little subjective because the biometrics that are on our phones and laptops are not linked back to a real world identity. It is somebody’s finger or face on the scanner. What we do to implement real zero trust is something we call live ID, which is a live selfie that has been matched to a source of truth about me. For example, if here’s my corporate photo, which I enrolled, and this is my face and they match, then let me in. That is the only way to do true zero trust as part of the identity pillar.</p>
<p>If you will, just drill down for that on me, device biometrics, real biometrics, they’re not one and the same?</p>
<p>That’s right. Apple and Google have done yeoman’s work and they’ve made everybody using biometrics on their device ubiquitous, billions of times a day. And it’s much more secure than typing in a pin or password but it doesn’t match your face or fingerprint or voice print, whatever, back to something authoritative. When I set up this iPhone, you don’t know if it’s me or a spouse or my kids or a coworker. That’s the difference. And if it’s a real biometric, of course, it’s almost like looking somebody in the face and saying, “Yeah, I can prove that that person is who they think they are.”</p>
<p>Well, you mentioned Google and Apple. There’s another little company called Microsoft, which is doing biometric login. What about that? Obviously environments are a little bit more complex than Microsoft so how does zero trust work in a highly complicated or complex environment?</p>
<p>Again, if you have a true identity provider, some system that you can go ask and say, “Tell me who this is authoritatively?” It doesn’t matter if it’s Microsoft, Apple, Google, if it’s Okta Ping, 4drop, you’re going into Azure AD. It doesn’t matter, as long as you have an authoritative source and that’s what we provide. And the authoritative source is linked back to a real world identity and verified with real biometrics. If you have this critical who is it, question answered everything else downstream becomes a lot easier.</p>
<p>Well, before we wrap, any closing thoughts that we haven’t covered?</p>
<p>Well, one is a little selfless promo for a webinar we’re doing on June 16th on how to defeat zero trust, at least the zero trust that’s been coined in the industry. We’ll have some real world examples of how, call it Fortune 100 type clients could have their current infrastructures bypassed. And some of these have happened in the real world as well. 1kosmos.com, click on the webinar link and sign up and we’ll talk more about it there.</p>
<p>Well, that’s all the questions I have, Mike. I think you dug into the difficult questions that I could throw your way. I appreciate your time this morning.</p>
<p>No, thanks for having me on. Fun as always.</p>
<p>Have a great rest of your day.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>At this year’s European Identity &amp; Cloud Conference (EIC 2022) that we hosted in Berlin from May 10th to 13th, some topics stood out from all the vibrant discussions and enlightening presentations. My #1 topic is the emergence of integration between decentralized identity (DID) - also referred to Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) or as verifiable credentials - and traditional, centralized IAM (Identity &amp; Access Management) and CIAM (Consumer IAM).</p>
<p>DID has been a hot topic at EIC for many years, but more as an innovation that is somewhat separate from traditional IAM. This started to change with last year’s announcement of GAIN (Global Assured Identity Network), which is sort of a semi-centralized (or semi-decentralized) model for identities.</p>
<p>To find out more on these topics, have a look at this blog post entitled: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/guest/decentralized-identity-101-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters">Decentralized Identity 101: What It Is and Why It Matters</a> and this Leadership Brief entitled: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lb81119/gain-explained">GAIN Explained</a>.</p>
 DID and IAM convergence a hot topic 
<p>This year, a lot of talk has been about how to converge these worlds. How to enable authentication with a <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lb81204/guide-to-implementing-decentralized-id">decentralized ID</a> and the proofs in the wallet to an enterprise, be it as employee, business partner, or customer? How to issue proofs for employees and others into their wallets?</p>
<p>Integration is rather straightforward, based on standards such as OpenID Connect and their upcoming extensions. Decentralized IDs can just become another means of onboarding users, based on all the verified information in the wallets, and letting users in, based on a successful, decentralized authentication. This allows for simplification of onboarding by relying on proven data, as well as relying on a strong proof of identities. Process and identity vetting costs can be reduced massively that way.</p>
<p>Beyond that, in policy-based authorizations, the proofs from the wallet can be used for delivering attributes used in decision making. If a proof isn’t valid anymore, this will become effective immediately.</p>
<p></p>
 The journey has just begun 
<p>There are many applications for making traditional IAM more efficient and powerful by integrating the decentralized and centralized identity approaches. That journey has just started, and to me this was the #1 trending topic at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2022/agenda">EIC 2022</a>.</p>
<p>Here are some links to presentations and panel discussions at EIC 2022 that looked at various aspects of decentralized identity:</p>

<p>Notes to readers:&nbsp;</p>
 
 The thinking for this post came as we prepare for the public launch of our AiP 1.0 mobile wallet app – and as we prepare to demonstrate AiP 2.0 compliance. 
 This post assumes that the holder is already in full control of their interactions and relationships. It also assumes that the entire way of delivering digital ID is user-driven. This post is specifically meant to make the reader think about how to create more stickiness around credential issuance implementations. 
 There is a need for better UX in SSI to spur more adoption – and we’re hopeful that “holder-driven credential issuance” can become a more common approach. 
 
<p>—</p>
 <br>
The process of credential issuance should be holder-driven 
<p>The holder must be somewhere in their user journey and have a specific need for a credential. At this point they need to provide some form of eligibility to claim a credential.</p>
<p>In Government-regulated scenarios, eligibility is often covered by foundational ID credentials. For example, “I’m a citizen of a country”, or “I’m of age of majority”.</p>
<p>The type of information exchange, whether as a credential offer received or a proof presented depends on the type of relationship that you wish to establish with the other entity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, you may not want to share your government-issued driver’s licence to all your peers as your proof of identity; you may want to share your digital driver’s licence with a financial institution to open up a bank account, but with others you may trust to share only your utility bill.</p>
<p></p>
 <br>
Relationships and personas 
<p>Even though the proof requests (for your identity) are the same in the above scenarios, the relationships you have with the peer entities (government-issuer and financial institution-verifier) differ for you (the subject).&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can draw a similarity with what email addresses you would use to interact with different relationships of yours. You may use one email address to interact with friends and family, but another one to interact with work colleagues.</p>
<p>By introducing the concept of personas, you can start having separate DIDs for every different type of relationship you seek. You may want one DID for family interactions, another for your financial interactions, another for your work, etc..&nbsp;</p>
<p>You want to separate DIDs by personas because each persona has its own set of rules. And to establish a relationship, you must ensure contextual rules are met. This is how relationships are created and trusted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A wallet’s job in life is to securely and privately intermediate the interactions of a user. From an implementation perspective, every persona could create and be represented by their own wallet. And each wallet could have its separate DID to use to create separate connections. So you choose which persona to use; just like you choose which email address to communicate with another entity.</p>
<p></p>
 <br>
Establishing a connection (onboarding) 
<p>Now the question is how do you get onboarded? If it’s issuer-driven, can you trust a QRCode or any information presented to you if you’re unable to verify the provenance of the QRCode and information related to it? (Note: A QRCode is just an optical interface mechanism. If anything, a wallet should protect against QRCode fishing)</p>
<p></p>
<p>A connection request QRCode sent via email</p>
<p>Another key question is – why are they reaching out to you? People typically prefer to reach out to another entity they wish to engage with. You likely feel that calling your financial institution is much more comforting than receiving a call out of the blue from someone claiming they’re your financial institution.</p>
<p>Therefore rather than being presented with a QRCode, you should go to them, provide eligibility and then claim a credential. To claim a credential, you always need to provide eligibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eligibility is a verified email address, verified government ID, past references, skill-sets, etc.. Just like you go to Amazon, to a Government Service Desk, etc..</p>
 <br>
Managing a relationship 
<p>So now you have multiple personas, which helps you create different types of relationships which comply with the rules governing that relationship.</p>
<p>For example, one of the rules may be connection-based or connectionless-based relationships.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Connection means that you consent to the entity tracking you so that you can build common trust. For example, you need to be tracked over time by a credit bureau for them to establish a credit score on your behalf. If the relationship is about building trust, then you want them to track you to some extent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But when you don’t need to build trust/relationship/tracking, you don’t require a connection, just a one-time interaction.. For example: doing an age check to purchase alcohol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also imagine short-lived connections for short-term relationships. And you can also reset the relationship if you wish to. For example, they may be collecting too much data on you – boom you reset it, create a new DID and your history with them is disassociated from the new connection you’ve established. Hence correlation is limited and in your control. Do you want to be tracked? Do you want your transactions to be correlated? As a holder, the choice is yours.</p>
<p>Within your connection management inside your digital wallet, you should be able to see the relationship level you have with other entities. You should be able to see how much you’ve shared and consented to. Do you want to reset your DID with them? Go for it – up to you, the holder.</p>
<p>All of this is very holder-driven – and during the onboarding process (e.g., creating a DIDComm channel/secure relationship) – the relationship is at 0.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only when you start sharing some eligibility information about yourself and claim a credential can you start establishing a &gt;0 relationship.&nbsp;</p>

   Continual high-profile cyber incidents demonstrate beyond a doubt that cyber risks exist, but most organizations struggle to quantify cyber risk in a useful way. There is an urgent need for IT security leaders to find a common way to express cyber risk in monetary terms, that business leaders understand to enable effective risk management and security investment.

<p>On Wednesday 8th and Thursday 9th June 2022, InfoCert will participate to the 35th EEMA Annual Conference, that will takes place at Microsoft in London and will focus on Securing Identity and its Business Models. EEMA is the leading independent, not for profit, European Think Tank focusing on various topics, including identification, authentication, privacy, risk management, cyber security, the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence and mobile applications.</p>



<p>During the conference, InfoCert will take the lead in debating the impact of proposed changes to the electronic identification and trust services (eIDAS) regulation, and the impact it will have in enabling an interoperable Europe.</p>



<p>Igor Marcolongo – Head of Business Compliance at InfoCert, will chair an international panel to discuss eIDAS, which was introduced by the EU in 2014 to regulate verifying the identity of individuals and businesses online, as well as the authenticity of electronic documents.</p>



<p>Fabrizio Leoni – InfoCert’s Head of Innovation Portfolio, will participate in a session investigating how existing Identity Schemes can create Digital Identity Wallets for Business &amp; Citizens of the future.</p>



<p>Last but not least, on day two, Carmine Auletta – InfoCert’s Chief Innovation and Strategy Officer, will lead a panel titled: Identity as a Business, Investment Decisions &amp; Emerging Marketplaces.</p>



<p>Danilo Cattaneo – CEO of InfoCert, states: “As an EEMA member InfoCert is delighted to be supporting and participating in its educational programme once again. Sponsoring the live webinar series last year gave us the opportunity to engage with large audiences across the EU and beyond. Now we look forward coming together once again in London.”</p>



<p>Director Special Projects at EEMA, Roger Dean, states: “InfoCert has long been an important partner for EEMA. As an organisation they have an eagerness to engage with our international network on a wide range of identity-related topics including sovereign identity, digital wallets, and regulation. Their involvement in EEMA events has become an essential element of our education programme.”</p>

<p>İşletmeler ve kuruluşlar, kişileri tanımlamak için çalışan rozetleri, sürücü belgeleri, pasaportlar, sosyal güvenlik kartları vb. gibi fiziksel kimlik bilgilerini kullanır.</p><p>Bu fiziksel kimlik bilgileri bizlerin kim ve neleri yapmaya yetkimiz olduğuna dair ortaya kanıt sunar. - Bizler, gece kulüplerine gidebilecek, uluslararası seyahatlerde tanımlanabilecek , üniversiteyi bitirdikten sonra işe başvurabilecek yaştayız.</p><p>Fakat artan dijitallizeşme, insanları binlerce işletme ile çevrimiçi bir şekilde iletişime geçmeye itiyor.</p><p>Dijital bir ortama kimlik bilgisi kanıtlamak, yavaş ve zor bir doğrulama sürecini içerir. Bu süreç veri ihlalleri ve sahte kimlik bilgileriyle ilişkili riski artırır.</p> <br>Burda sorun nedir?<br> <p>Belgeleri elektronik olarak yeniden oluşturmaya yönelik mevcut sistem, kimlik bilgilerinin de dijital bir sürümünü oluşturmayı kapsamaktadır. (PDF veya XML belgesi gibi).<br></p><p>Bu süreç (en azından pratikte) gayet basit ve kolayca uygulanabilmektedir.<br></p><p>Ancak bu formatlarda sunulan belgelerin kökenini ve gerçekliğini doğrulamak karmaşıktır. Alttaki maddelerin doğru olması gerekir:<br></p>  Yayıncı Kuruluş, bu kimlik bilgisini etkin bir şekilde düzenlemiştir ve bunu yapma yetkisini sahiptir.  Kimlik bilgilerini sunan kişi, bu bilgilerin gerçek hak sahibidir.  Kimlik bilgileri geçerli olmakla beraber süresi dolmamış veya iptal edilmemiştir.  <p>Bir çok durumda, tasdikleyici kuruluşa ulaşmak gerekir.</p><p>Sertifikaları ve belgeleri taklit etmek ve fotoşoplamak çok kolay hale gelmiştir. Ve bu durum işleri daha kötü hale getirmektedir.</p><p><a href="https://aaar.assembly.ca.gov/sites/aaar.assembly.ca.gov/files/reports/Intro%20to%20Degree%20Mills.pdf">Amerika Birleşik Devletleri'nde yeni bir doktora yaptığını</a> iddia eden insanların yarısından fazlasının sahte sertifikası var.</p><p>Ayrıca bu yöntemler, kuruluşları kullanıcılarının büyük miktarda kişisel verisini depolamaya zorlar. Ayrıca kuruluşlar, kullanıcılarını kişisel bilgilerine kimin eriştiği, belgelerinin nerede saklandığı ve bunların nasıl kullanıldığı konusunda kontrolsüz bırakır.</p><p>Bu noktada, bireylerin kimliklerini güvenilir bir şekilde oluşturmasını ve paylaşmasını sağlayan veri koruma sistemleri ve doğrulanabilir kimlik bilgileri devreye girer.<br></p> Doğrulanabilir Kimlik Bilgileri Nelerdir ve Bize Nasıl Yardımcı Olurlar?<br> <p>Basit bir ifadeyle, doğrulanabilir kimlik bilgileri, kişilerin doğrulama için onlara ihtiyaç duyan üçüncü taraflara sunabileceği, kağıt tabanlı kimlik bilgilerinin dijital bir sürümüdür. Ancak, fiziksel kimlik bilgilerinin ve pdf'lerin aksine, doğrulanabilir kimlik bilgileri kurcalanmaya karşı korumalıdır ve anında doğrulanabilir.</p><p>Kuruluşlar derecelerini, kimliklerini, lisanslarını vb. doğrulanabilir dijital kimlik bilgileri olarak verebilir.</p><p>Insanlar fiziksel belgeler gibi, doğrulanabilir kimlik bilgilerini de dijital bir cüzdanda depolama imkanina sahiptir.</p><p>Dijital cüzdan, insanların telefonlarında, bilgisayarlarında ve hatta bulut tabanlı bir sunucuda mobil uygulama olarak taşıyabilecekleri geleneksel veya fiziksel cüzdanın dijital versiyonudur.</p><p>Doğrulanabilir kimlik bilgileri ve dijital cüzdanlar kullanmak, bugün piyasadaki diğer kimlik yönetimi çözümlerine güvenli ve kullanışlı bir alternatiftir.</p><p>Doğrulanabilir kimlik bilgilerinin tüm dünyada insanlar ve işletmeler arasında giderek daha popüler hale gelmesinin başlıca nedeni, kullanıcı gereksinimleri söz konusu olduğunda birçok hizmete olanak sağlaması ve mevcut kimlik yönetim sistemiyle ilgili çeşitli sorunları ele almasıdır.</p><p>Doğrulanabilir Kimlik Bilgileri, taraflar arasında anında güven yaratır. </p><p>Bir kuruluş, Doğrulanabilir Kimlik Bilgilerini kullanarak, bir belgenin gerçek olup olmadığını ve onu kimin yayınladığını hemen tespit edebilir. Ve bunu yayıncıyla iletişime geçmeden saniyeler içinde yapabilir!</p><p>Doğrulanabilir kimlik bilgileri, doğası gereği dijital olmanın yanı sıra (günümüzde daha fazla ön koşul haline gelen bir husus), veri korumasını desteklemeye yönelik büyük bir adımdır.</p><p>İşte olay;</p><p>Fiziksel bir kimlik bilgisini veya bir pdf'yi paylaştığınızda, gerekli olandan çok daha fazla kişisel bilgiyi ifşa ediyor olabilirsiniz.</p><p>Doğrulanabilir kimlik bilgileri, kişilerin kimliklerini doğrulamasını ve yalnızca bağlamla ilgili bilgileri sunmasını sağlar.</p><p>Fiziksel kimlik bilgileri bu tür bir esneklik sunmaz.<br><br>Ayrıca, kağıt tabanlı kimlik bilgilerini oluşturmak kolaydır.</p> Merkezi Kimlik Yönetim Sistemi Neden Problem Taşımaktadır?<br> <p>Bu konuyu bir örnekle inceleyelim - son COVID19 aşı sertifikası.</p><p>Bir kriket maçı veya uçuş yolculuğu gibi hızlı tempolu bir ortamda kağıt tabanlı veya pdf tabanlı bir aşı sertifikasını doğrulamak genellikle zaman alıcıdır ve hatalara açıktır.</p><p>Dijital bir ekosistemde, bu aşı sertifikaları merkezi bir veri tabanında depolanarak, bu tür senaryolarda doğrulanmaları gerektiğinde onları daha hızlı ve daha kullanışlı hale getiriyor.</p><p>Bununla birlikte, milyonlarca insan hakkında kişisel bilgileri depolayan merkezi bir veri tabanı, bilgisayar korsanları için bir altın madeni gibidir.</p><p>Doğrulanabilir kimlik bilgileri ve blok zinciri tabanlı merkeziyetsiz kimlik yönetimi, insanların kendi verilerini depolamasına ve yönetmesine olanak tanır.</p><p>Dorğulanabilir kimlik bilgileri insanlara verilerini nasıl, ne zaman ve kiminle paylaşmak istediklerine dair karar verme hakkını saklı tutarlar.</p><p>Bu zorlukların üstesinden gelmek için IATA Uluslararası Hava Taşımacılığı Birliği , Doğrulanabilir Kimlik Bilgilerini benimsedi.<br></p> Doğrulanabilir Kimlik Bilgileri Nasıl Çalışır?<br> <p>Doğrulanabilir kimlik bilgilerinin nasıl çalıştığını anlamak için, doğrulanabilir kimlik bilgileri ekosisteminde yer alan temel varlıklar (yayıncı kuruluş, varlık sahibi ve doğrulayıcı) hakkında bilgi sahibi olmanız gerekir.<br><br>Adından da anlaşılacağı gibi, yayıncı kuruluş, doğrulanabilir kimlik bilgileri verme yetkisine sahip bir varlıktır. Bu, kursu bitirdikten sonra size diploma veren üniversiteniz, size ulusal bir kimlik veren devlet kurumları vb. Olabilir.</p><p>Bireyler , kimlik bilgilerinin sahibi olan kişilerdir. Dijital cüzdanlarındaki doğrulanabilir kimlik bilgilerini saklar ve paylaşırlar.</p><p>Son olarak, doğrulayıcı, kimlik bilgilerini doğrulatan veya doğrulayan kişidir. Bu, diplomanızı paylaştığınız bir işe alım şirketi olabilir.<br></p> Peki kimlik nasıl doğrulanır? <p>Yayıncı kuruluş, doğrulanabilir kimlik bilgisini yayınlar ve yalnızca yayıncı kuruluşun kullanabileceği bir şifreleme anahtarıyla dijital olarak imzalar.</p><p>Doğrulayıcı bir kimlik bilgisi aldığında, değiştirilemez ve merkeziyetsiz bir veritabanı olan blok zinciri aracılığıyla orijinalliğini doğrulayacaktır.</p><p>Unutulmaması gereken husus, blok zincirinin aslında kullanıcıların doğrulanabilir kimlik bilgilerini saklamamasıdır. Yalnızca doğrulayıcının kimlik bilgilerinin gerçekliğini doğrulamak için ihtiyaç duyacağı bilgileri depolar. Örnek olarak - verenin kimlik bilgisini imzalayanla eşleştiren genel şifreleme anahtarı diyebiliriz.</p><p>Bu bilgileri kullanarak, doğrulayıcı şunları inceleyecektir:</p><p>1) Yayıncı Kuruluşun bu kimlik bilgilerini verme yetkisi var mıdır?.</p><p>2) Doğrulanabilir kimlik bilgisi hala geçerli midir?

  <p>Cloud adoption continues to increase rapidly worldwide, and not only in the software industry. Every year more and more companies move their applications to the cloud. In the last JHipster community survey, from December 2021, participants valued JHipster’s ability to get them to production faster, and requested more tutorials on deployment to cloud platforms. DigitalOcean is among the most popular “other” cloud vendors, according to some surveys. This post is a quick walk-through of the deployment of a JHipster microservices architecture to a Kubernetes cluster in DigitalOcean’s cloud.</p>

 About DigitalOcean 

<p>DigitalOcean is a cloud services company founded in 2011 by brothers Ben and Moisey Uretsky. Their headquarters are in New York City in the United States, and they also have offices in Massachusetts and Bangalore. Last March 2022, DigitalOcean reached its IPO (Initial Public Offering), and some press articles describe it as the cloud services provider for small businesses: “Cloud services for the Little Guy”.</p>

<p></p>

<p>DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOKS) is a managed Kubernetes service that lets you deploy Kubernetes clusters without the complexities of handling the control pane and containerized infrastructure. Clusters are compatible with standard Kubernetes toolchains and integrate natively with DigitalOcean load balancers and block storage volumes. DOKS offers fast provisioning and deployment, and provides a free high-availability control pane, for reliability management. It can also provide a Cluster Autoscaler that automatically adjusts the size of the cluster by adding or removing nodes based on the cluster’s capacity to schedule pods. Pricing for Kubernetes workloads is based on resources required by the cluster, droplets, block storage, and load balancers.</p>

<p>The company publishes its data center <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/trust/certification-reports">certification reports</a> on its website, and all the data centers have approved two or more of the following certifications: SOC (System and Organization Controls) 1 Type II, SOC 2 Type II, SOC 3 Type II, and ISO/IEC 27001:2013 (Security techniques - Information security management systems). PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry - Data Security Standard) has been certified in all data centers.</p>

 Set up a microservices architecture for Kubernetes 

<p>Before working on the application, you need to install JHipster. The classical way of working with JHipster is to do a local installation with NPM.</p>

   <code>npm install -g generator-jhipster@7
</code>   

<p>If you’d rather use Yarn or Docker, follow the instructions at <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/installation/#local-installation-with-npm-recommended-for-normal-users">jhipster.tech</a>.</p>

<p>For this test, start from the <code>reactive-jhipster</code> example in the <code>java-microservices-examples</code> repository on <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/java-microservices-examples">GitHub</a>. The example is a JHipster reactive microservices architecture with Spring Cloud Gateway and Spring WebFlux, Vue as the client framework, and Gradle as the build tool. You can read about how it was built in <a>Reactive Java Microservices with Spring Boot and JHipster</a>.</p>

   <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/java-microservices-examples.git
cd java-microservices-examples/reactive-jhipster
</code>   
<p>If you inspect the project folder, you will find sub-folders for the <code>gateway</code> service, which will act as the front-end application, and a gateway to the <code>store</code> and <code>blog</code> microservices, which also have their subfolders. A <code>docker-compose</code> sub-folder contains the service definitions for running the application containers.</p>

<p>The next step is to generate the Kubernetes deployment descriptors. In the project root folder, create a <code>kubernetes</code> directory and run the <code>k8s</code> JHipster sub-generator:</p>

   <code>mkdir kubernetes
cd kubernetes
jhipster k8s
</code>   

<p>Choose the following options when prompted:</p>

 
   Type of application: Microservice application 
   Root directory: ../ 
   Which applications? (select all) 
   Set up monitoring? No 
   Which applications with clustered databases? select store 
   Admin password for JHipster Registry: (generate one) 
   Kubernetes namespace: demo 
   Docker repository name: (your docker hub username) 
   Command to push Docker image: <code>docker push</code> 
   Enable Istio? No 
   Kubernetes service type? LoadBalancer 
   Use dynamic storage provisioning? Yes 
   Use a specific storage class? (leave empty) 
 

<p>NOTE: You can leave the Docker repository name blank for running Kubernetes locally, but a repository will be required for the cloud deployment, so go ahead and create a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">DockerHub</a> personal account, and the image pull configuration will be ready for both local and cloud deployments.</p>

<p>Build the <code>gateway</code>, <code>store</code>, and <code>blog</code> services container images with Jib. As Jib will push the images to DockerHub, you first need to do a <code>docker login</code>.</p>

   <code>docker login
</code>   
<p>If you have two-factor authentication enabled, you must generate a token and use it as the password for the login. In the Docker web, go to the user menu and choose Account Settings. Then in the left menu choose Security and New Access Token.</p>

<p>For example, for building the <code>gateway</code> service image:</p>

   <code>cd ../gateway
./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image=&lt;docker-repo-name&gt;/gateway
</code>   
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: Unfortunately the application example does not build with Java 17 at the moment of writing this post. As specified in the introduction, this example was built with Java 11.</p>

<p>Check that the images were uploaded to <a href="https://hub.docker.com">DockerHub</a>, and navigate to the project root folder in the terminal for the next step.</p>

 Configure authentication with OpenID Connect 

<p>One more configuration step before running the architecture locally, let’s configure Okta for authentication.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create jhipster</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
  Accept the default Redirect URI values provided for you.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI streamlines configuring a JHipster app and does several things for you:</p>

 
   Creates an OIDC app with the correct redirect URIs:
     
       login: <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> 
       logout: <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761</code> 
     
   
   Creates <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups that JHipster expects 
   Adds your current user to the <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups 
   Creates a <code>groups</code> claim in your default authorization server and adds the user’s groups to it 
 

<p>NOTE: The <code>http://localhost:8761*</code> redirect URIs are for the JHipster Registry, which is often used when creating microservices with JHipster. The Okta CLI adds these by default.</p>

<p>You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app. It will look like this (except the placeholder values will be populated):</p>

   <code>export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI="/oauth2/default"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID="{clientId}"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET="{clientSecret}"
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#okta">Create a JHipster App on Okta</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Add the settings from the generated <code>.okta.env</code> to <code>kubernetes/registry-k8s/application-configmap.yml</code>:</p>

   <code>data:
  application.yml: |-
    ...
    spring:
      security:
        oauth2:
          client:
            provider:
              oidc:
                issuer-uri: https://&lt;your-okta-domain&gt;/oauth2/default
            registration:
              oidc:
                client-id: &lt;client-id&gt;
                client-secret: &lt;client-secret&gt;
</code>   

<p>Enable the OIDC authentication in the <code>jhipster-registry</code> service by adding the <code>oauth2</code> profile in the <code>kubernetes/registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml</code> file:</p>

   <code>- name: SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE
  value: prod,k8s,oauth2
</code>   

 Run locally with minikube 

<p>Install <a href="https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/">minikube</a> and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/"><code>kubectl</code></a>.</p>

<p>For minikube, you will need at least 2 CPUs. Start minikube with your number of CPUs:</p>

   <code>cd kubernetes
minikube --cpus &lt;ncpu&gt; start
</code>   
<p>minikube will log the Kubernetes and Docker versions on start:</p>

   <code>Preparing Kubernetes v1.23.3 on Docker 20.10.12 ...
</code>   

<p>For the <code>store-mongodb</code> deployment to work, the property <code>Service.spec.publishNotReadyAddresses</code> was required, instead of the annotation <code>service.alpha.kubernetes.io/tolerate-unready-endpoints</code>, as the latter was deprecated in <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.11.md#kubernetes-111-release-notes">Kubernetes release 1.11</a>.</p>

<p>Edit <code>kubernetes/store-k8s/store-mongodb.yml</code> and add the <code>publishNotReadyAddresses: true</code> property to the <code>spec</code> key near the bottom of the file:</p>

   <code>...
# Headless service for DNS record
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: store-mongodb
  namespace: demo
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  clusterIP: None
  publishNotReadyAddresses: true
  ports:
    - name: peer
      port: 27017
  selector:
    app: store-mongodb
</code>   

<p>Then deploy the application to minikube.  In the <code>kubernetes</code> directory, run:</p>

   <code>./kubectl-apply.sh -f
</code>   
<p>Now is a good time to install <a href="https://k9scli.io/topics/install/">k9s</a>, a terminal-based UI to interact with Kubernetes clusters. Then run k9s with:</p>

   <code>k9s -n demo
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://k9scli.io/topics/commands/">commands list</a>, some useful ones are:</p>

 
   <code>:namespace</code>: show all available namespaces 
   <code>:pods</code>: show all available pods 
 

<p>You can navigate the pods with <code>ENTER</code> and go back with <code>ESC</code> keys.</p>

<p>Set up port-forwarding for the JHipster Registry.</p>

   <code>kubectl port-forward svc/jhipster-registry -n demo 8761
</code>   

<p>Navigate to <code>http://localhost:8761</code> and sign in with your Okta credentials. When the registry shows all services in green, Set up port-forwarding for the gateway as well.</p>

   <code>kubectl port-forward svc/gateway -n demo 8080
</code>   

<p>Navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080</code>, sign in, and create some entities to verify everything is working fine.</p>

<p>After looking around, stop minikube before the cloud deployment:</p>

   <code>minikube stop
</code>   

<p>Also delete the minikube cluster to have a clean slate for future tests:</p>

   <code>minikube delete
</code>   

 Deploy to DigitalOcean Kubernetes 

<p>Now that the architecture works locally, let’s proceed to the cloud deployment. First, create a <a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/registrations/new">DigitalOcean</a> account. The registration requires a $5 PayPal payment, or providing a credit card.</p>

<p>Most of the cluster tasks, if not all, can be accomplished using <a href="https://github.com/digitalocean/doctl#installing-doctl">doctl</a>, the command-line interface (CLI) for the DigitalOcean API. Install the tool, and perform the authentication with DigitalOcean:</p>

   <code>doctl auth init
</code>   
<p>You will be prompted to enter the DigitalOcean access token that you can generate in the DigitalOcean control panel. Sign in, and then in the left menu go to API, click Generate New Token. Enter a token name, and click Generate Token. Copy the new token from the Tokens/Keys table.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You can find a detailed list of pricing for cluster resources at <a href="https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/">DigitalOcean</a>,  and with <code>doctl</code> you can quickly retrieve a list of node size options available for your account:</p>

   <code>doctl k options sizes
</code>   

<p>Create the cluster with the following command line:</p>

   <code>doctl k cluster create do1 -v --size s-4vcpu-8gb-intel
</code>   
<p>After creating a cluster, <code>doctl</code> adds a configuration context to <code>kubectl</code> and makes it active, so you can start monitoring your cluster right away with k9s. First, apply the resources configuration to the DigitalOcean cluster:</p>

   <code>./kubectl-apply.sh -f
</code>   

<p>Monitor the deployment with k9s:</p>

   <code>k9s -n demo
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>Once you see the <code>jhipster-registry</code> pods are up, set up port forwarding again so you can also monitor the status of the services in the registry UI.</p>

 Notes on DigitalOcean’s node sizes and volumes 

<p>Deploying to a Kubernetes cluster on DigitalOcean’s cloud can be tricky if you don’t specify enough capacity from the start.</p>

<p>At first, I tested the cluster with the highest size Intel nodes available for my account, <code>s-2vcpu-4gb-intel</code>. I attempted to run the application in the default cluster configuration, a three-node cluster with a single node pool in the nyc1 region, using the latest Kubernetes version. As I started to see pods not running due to <code>insufficient CPU</code>, I increased the number of nodes and got everything working. DigitalOcean’s latest and default Kubernetes version at the moment of writing this post was 1.22.8.</p>

<p>If you need to find out the reason why a pod is not running, you can get the pod events with <code>kubectl describe</code>, for example, for the <code>jhipster-registry-0</code> pod:</p>

   <code>kubectl describe pod jhipster-registry-0 -n demo
</code>   

<p>The output of the command, in the events section, for a pod that has failed due to insufficient cpu, looks like the following:</p>

   <code>Events:

</code>   
<p>If you see a pod failing in <code>k9s</code>, check the events for that pod with <code>kubectl describe pod</code> as in the example above.</p>

<p>To add CPU, increase the number of nodes with <code>doctl</code>:</p>

   <code>doctl k cluster node-pool update do1 do1-default-pool --count 4
</code>   
<p>You don’t need to restart pods when adding nodes.</p>

<p>After I increased CPU (adding one more node to the cluster), some of the pods, in the <code>store-mongodb</code> stateful set with 3 replicas, did not run due to unbound immediate PersistentVolumeClaims. This was reported in the pod events, in the output of <code>kubectl describe pod</code>, for the failing pods. I then inspected persistent volume claims with the following commands:</p>

   <code>kubectl get pvc -n demo
kubectl describe pvc datadir-store-mongodb-2 -n demo
</code>   

<p>The <code>kubectl describe pvc</code> command output was showing provisioning errors, and instructed to contact support:</p>

</code>   

<p>As instructed by the event message, I contacted DigitalOcean support and they fixed it.</p>

<p>Finally, as I first registered for the free trial account, I had to open a second support ticket requesting higher node sizes, so I could use the size <code>s-4vcpu-8gb-intel</code>. Not all the size options were available after signing up for the trial, but that is not the case for a standard account. Billing should be under $10 USD for a short Kubernetes service test.</p>

 Find your gateway’s external IP and update redirect URIs 

<p>Once all the pods are running, find the gateway external IP with the <code>kubectl describe</code> command:</p>

   <code>kubectl describe service gateway -n demo
</code>   
<p>The output will look like this:</p>

   <code>Name:                     gateway

</code>   

<p>Update the redirect URIs in Okta to allow the gateway address as a valid redirect. Run <code>okta login</code>, open the returned URL in your browser, and sign in to the Okta Admin Console. Go to the Applications section, find your application, edit, and add:</p>
 
   Sign-in redirect URIs: <code>http://&lt;load-balancer-ingress-ip&gt;:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> 
   Sign-out redirect URIs: <code>http://&lt;load-balancer-ingress-ip&gt;:8080</code> 
 

<p>Navigate to <code>http://&lt;load-balancer-ingress-ip&gt;:8080</code> and rejoice when everything works!</p>

 Secure web traffic with HTTPS 

<p>Since the gateway service acts as the application front-end, in the k8s descriptors it is defined as a <code>LoadBalancer</code> service type. This exposes the service externally using the cloud provider’s load balancer. DigitalOcean load balancers are a fully-managed, highly available network load-balancing service. Load balancers distribute traffic to groups of droplets, which decouples the overall health of a backend service from the health of a single server to ensure that your services stay online.</p>

<p>The standard practice is to secure web traffic to your application with HTTPS. For traffic encryption, you need a TLS (SSL) certificate. DigitalOcean also provides automatic certificate creation and renewal if you manage your domain with DigitalOcean’s DNS, which is free. But domain registration is not provided.  To use DigitalOcean’s DNS, you need to register a domain name with a registrar and update your domain’s NS records to point to DigitalOcean’s name servers.</p>

<p>Then, for using DigitalOcean’s managed domain and certificate, you must <a href="https://docs.digitalocean.com/tutorials/dns-registrars/">delegate the domain</a>, updating NS records in the registrar. Because of this requirement, you cannot use free DNS services where you cannot set up NS records, like <a href="https://nip.io/">nip.io</a>.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: Before changing the registrar NS records (the nameservers), add your domain to DigitalOcean, to minimize service disruptions.</p>

<p>You can create the certificate and the domain at the same time in the DigitalOcean control panel, when you set up the load balancer HTTPS forwarding.</p>

<p>DigitalOcean load balancers support two main configurations for encrypted web traffic:</p>

 
   SSL termination: decrypts SSL requests at the load balancer and sends them unencrypted to the backend at the Droplets’ private IP address. The slower and CPU-intensive work of decryption is performed at the load balancer, and certificate management is simplified. The traffic between the load balancer and the backend is secured by routing over the VPC network, but data is readable inside the private network. 
   SSL passthrough: sends the encrypted SSL requests directly to the backend at the Droplets’ private IP address, traffic between the load balancer and the backend is secured. Every backend server must have the certificate, and client information contained in <code>X-forwarded-*</code> headers might be lost. 
 

<p>Taking advantage of the simplified certificate management, SSL termination will be configured in the following steps through the DigitalOcean control panel.</p>

<p>Log in to your DigitalOcean account, and in the left menu choose Kubernetes. Then choose your cluster, and on the cluster page, choose Resources. In the LOAD BALANCERS list, choose the single load balancer that must have been created. On the load balancer page, choose the Settings tab. Click Edit in the Forwarding Rules. Add a forwarding rule for HTTPS in port 443, and in the certificate drop-down, choose New certificate.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In the New Certificate form, choose the Use Let’s Encrypt tab, and then in the domain box, choose Add new domain. Then enter your domain name, and list other subdomains to include. Add a name for the certificate and click Generate Certificate.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Back in the Forwarding rules page, check that the generated certificate is selected, and forward the traffic to the droplet HTTP port where the gateway is running. Tick the checkbox Create DNS records for all the new Let’s Encrypt certificates and then Save the forwarding settings.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Finally, in the SSL section of the settings, tick the checkbox Redirect HTTP to HTTPS.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once again, update the redirect URIs in Okta to allow the newly configured domain. Add the following redirect URIs:</p>
 
   Sign-in redirect URIs: <code>https://&lt;your-domain&gt;/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> 
   Sign-out redirect URIs: <code>https://&lt;your-domain&gt;</code> 
 

<p>Test the configuration by navigating to <code>http://&lt;your-domain&gt;</code>. First, the load balancer should redirect to HTTPs, and then the gateway should redirect to the Okta sign-in page.</p>

 Inspect and manage cluster resources 

<p>You can retrieve the cluster associated resources with the following <code>doctl</code> command:</p>

   <code>doctl k cluster list-associated-resources do1
</code>   

<p>The output will list the volumes and load balancers created for the cluster, which generate billing charges besides the cost of the nodes:</p>

   <code>Volumes                                                                                                                                                                                       Volume Snapshots    Load Balancers
[a33dbaba-cb22-11ec-9383-0a58ac145375 a6e18809-cb22-11ec-8723-0a58ac14468c 65fb3778-cb23-11ec-9383-0a58ac145375 ac106c49-cb22-11ec-9383-0a58ac145375 c7122288-cb22-11ec-bd08-0a58ac14467d]    []                  [8ebbcbf2-1e67-46f5-b38a-eddae17f00f3]
</code>   

<p>Unfortunately, there is no way to pause the cluster. According to DigitalOcean, you can power a droplet off, but this does not halt the billing. Billing costs can be reduced by taking a snapshot of the droplet and then destroying it. The snapshot cost is less expensive.</p>

<p>While testing the platform, you can delete the cluster in between sessions, to avoid spending the trial credit while not actively working on it.</p>

   <code>doctl k cluster delete do1
</code>   

<p>Volumes provisioned to the cluster are not deleted with the cluster, and charges are generated hourly. You can delete volumes using the control panel or with the following commands:</p>

   <code>doctl compute volume list
doctl compute volume delete &lt;volume-id&gt;
</code>   

<p>The load balancers are not deleted with the cluster either:</p>

   <code>doctl compute load-balancer list
doctl compute load-balancer delete &lt;load-balancer-id&gt;
</code>   

<p>During registration, a project must have been created, allowing you to organize resources. You can list all the resources associated with a project with the following command:</p>

   <code>doctl projects list
doctl projects resources list &lt;project-id&gt;
</code>

				 <p>If I said that I was disappointed with the Ontario election results, that would be an understatement. I’m not talking about the winning party – I’m talking about the turnout. It’s discouraging to see such low participation.</p>
<p>Elections Ontario <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ont-electoral-reform-1.6480756">reported</a> that 4.6 million out of 10.7 million eligible voters cast a ballot in Thursday’s election.</p>
<p>That’s around 43 percent of eligible voters. Not healthy for democracy.</p>
<p>The 2018 Ontario election results saw 57 percent voter turnout, the highest voter turnout in over a decade.</p>
<p>What happened? There could be many reasons, from people are just done with it all after Covid, voting locations problems to early predictions affecting turnout. Who knows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m not an expert on the Ontario election process, and this is just my opinion. I’ve been lazy in past elections, and I’d be lying if I said I’ve voted in every one. As a citizen, I believe ease and accessibility have a lot to do with it. If I could have voted from home on my phone, I would have voted in every election. Not to mention, from my experience, the voting method is archaic. I’ve heard of these Dominion machines – I’ve never seen one, and I’ve been of legal voting age since 1998.</p>
<p>When I cast my ballot on June 2nd, I made my choice via a sharpie on a piece of card stock paper and put it in a cardboard box, as I have done in every election. As soon as I did this, I thought about how my vote might not be accounted for correctly. Would that cardboard box make it to the counter system? Would my vote be counted accurately? What about human error? And how do I know that someone won’t add ballots for those who didn’t show up? Right now, I can’t see that my vote was counted accurately or even counted at all. All I see are vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>What if you could securely vote from your phone at home? What if you had a choice to continue to vote in person or a new way – via trusted credentials that live in your digital wallet? Even if people are “done” with politics. If people could take 2 minutes and vote from their phones, I believe more would be inclined to vote, thus increasing the turnout.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/The-Current-and-Future-State-of-Digital-Wallets-v1.0-FINAL.pdf#page=19">You Already Have a Digital Wallet</a>, so let’s imagine a scenario where citizens could vote accurately AND know that hackers working for the opposition (or Russia!) aren’t taking over the election.</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			 
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				
				
				 
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				  
 Let’s imagine that <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/bubbas-wallet/">Bubba’s Wallet</a> is the <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/The-Current-and-Future-State-of-Digital-Wallets-v1.0-FINAL.pdf#page=51">trusted digital wallet provider</a>. We trust Bubba’s Wallet because it’s gone through the rigorous vetting processes to be said trusted provider. 
  
			 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
					
					 
						
						 <p>We should have many trusted digital wallet providers for a healthy market.&nbsp;</p> 
					 
				 
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				  
 The election authority could issue citizens (who opt-in) <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/bcgov-verifiable-organization-network/">verifiable credentials</a> stored in Bubba’s Wallet. That credential would be used when citizens vote – and the system would make sure they only vote once. Users would be able to load up a website, and their wallet would make sure it was actually the election authority (e.g. Elections Ontario for the Ontario provincial election). 
 The election authority could also create a voting app compatible with Bubba’s Wallet and other trusted wallet providers. It would be like logging on to a banking app or using Apple or Google pay via Biometrics. 
 To safeguard the system from fraud, the election authority would have to make it so that users cannot log on or access the app unless they have a verified voting credential. Because the verifiable credentials are stored and shared via <a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/156591609?dnt=1&amp;html5=1&amp;title=1&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;autoplay=0">Distributed Ledger Technology,</a> and the credentials are not stored in a centralized manner by the Issuer (e.g. Elections Ontario), they are inaccessible to hackers. 
  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>If the four scenarios above were factual and in play today, citizens would be able to log into the Elections app on voting day, no matter where in the world, and vote for the candidate in their riding. Citizens could instantly see that their vote was accepted for the chosen candidate, assuring that they were counted accurately.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/blockchain/">The technology</a> is there for this to happen, but we need the government and general public to adopt the technology, and I know that’s a big order. We have a ways to go as the trust needs to be rebuilt among many parties.</p>
<p>Digital ID can increase voter participation and improve democracy.</p>
<p>Something to think about.</p>

 Institutional Investment in the Digital Assets Space Still Modest, Regulatory Parity can Change it — BIS&nbsp;Report  The Bank of International Settlements looked into what motivates banks and other financial institutions to enter the crypto market?, and what factors can propel institutional activity in the digital assets industry? So, let’s look at the findings. <blockquote>Key Takeaways<br>- As per the recently published BIS report, most of the recent growth in the digital assets space was attributed to the retail activity in the crypto world, with minimal information on the role of institutional investors.</blockquote><blockquote>- The report further states that major banks have only exposure worth $200 million to digital assets, which is minuscule compared to the total market cap of the global crypto industry.</blockquote><blockquote>- Regulatory Parity between banks and virtual assets service providers (VASPs) will bring more institutional investment into the crypto&nbsp;market.</blockquote><p>A <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/work1013.htm">recent Bank for International Settlements (BIS) report</a> looked at the level of institutional investment in the virtual assets market, which has grown by leaps and bounds in the last couple of years. The report argues that the retail activity in the crypto markets hogs all the limelight, with limited information available on the involvement of traditional financial organizations in the nascent crypto assets industry.</p><p>Thus, BIS decided to research: what motivates banks and other financial institutions to enter the crypto market?, and what factors can propel institutional activity in the digital assets industry? So, let’s look at the findings.</p> The Factors That can Attract Institutional Investors <p>The BIS report states that with growing user numbers, further innovation, economic development, and regulatory clarity, the crypto industry will be able to attract funds from the traditional financial sector successfully. So far, institutional capital has been relatively minimal, which is evident from the fact that major banks have only $200 million of exposure to digital assets. In comparison, the global crypto market at the time of writing is <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">$1.3 trillion</a>. It shows just how inconsequential is the involvement of banks in the virtual assets market currently.</p><p>Even with pretty limited exposure to digital assets, banks seem to prioritize virtual asset exchanges that are at the least lightly regulated. Thus, it goes without saying that traditional financial organizations will always stay clear of any crypto exchanges that aren’t regulated. Regulated exchanges are popular among both retail investors and institutional ones.</p><p>That said, regulatory parity is the need of the hour, considering the difference in the regulatory treatment of banks to that of crypto-based businesses, such as exchanges. Banks have immense support from authorities, which is something that virtual asset service providers don’t get. For instance, the Travel Rule, which was already applicable to the banks, and investment funds, among other traditional financial players, have been extended to the crypto industry, but minus the&nbsp;support.</p><p>The only way that Virtual Asset Service Providers have here is to ensure data privacy at all costs and take appropriate measures to offer the utmost privacy to&nbsp;clients.</p><p>Talking about Travel Rules, how can we miss mentioning “Veriscope”? After all, Shyft’s Veriscope is the best product available to comply with Travel Rule without any hassles. Plus, it solves the much-dreaded “Sunrise” issue that makes compliance with the Travel Rule a tricky&nbsp;process.</p><p>Make sure to visit our <a href="https://www.veriscope.network/">website </a>to get a first-hand look at how <a href="https://www.veriscope.network/">Veriscope </a>can enable your company to stay compliant.

<p>This Dev Pulse unpacks the recently announced Developer Immersive in more detail, but don’t miss the other good stuff at the bottom! There’s a new Holochain Launcher release, some important breaking changes in the Tryorama testing framework, and videos and articles from around the community.</p> Rust Developer Immersive <p>By now you may have heard the news that Holo is <a href="https://press.holo.host/214789-announcing-the-holochain-developer-education-initiative">committing $2 million USD</a> over the next couple years to support developer education. I was pretty excited when I heard the news because equipping developers to be successful is, well, everything. And education is a huge part of that. (And let’s face it, Holochain is a little weird and it’s nice to have as much help as you can get.)</p><p>The first piece of this initiative is a <a href="https://holo.host/holochain-rust-developer-immersive">Developer Immersive programme</a> from July 10th to 22nd. The content builds on the popular Dev Camps — it will introduce developers to Rust and Holochain concepts, then get them involved in writing code — but the format is quite different. This is an in-person event, two weeks of intense, iterative, hands-on learning with three and your peers.</p><p>In the Austrian Alps!</p><p>Yeah, that’s right. The course takes place in a guest house in a mountain village in Tyrol, Austria. Live-in accommodations and supplied meals will free up your time to both focus on your learning and build connections with each other. And I think that connection is one of the beautiful things about the community of devs and supporters in Holochain-land — the way they support each other, to grow not just at their craft but as people too.</p><p>Now, I realise that this format is not going to work for everyone. It’s a very intense programme, you have to commit all of your life for two weeks, and there is a tuition fee. But if these things work for you, I think it will be a transformative experience. It’ll also be transformative for Holo as we learn what approaches work best.</p><p>And because this is a cooperative experience, you’ll be much better equipped to become a skilled distributed app developer by the end of the two weeks. You’re not likely to slip through the cracks when everyone is dedicated to each other’s success!</p> Who’s leading this course? <p><a href="https://www.marcusphillips.com/about-me">Marcus Phillips</a> co-founded <a href="https://www.hackreactor.com/">Hack Reactor</a>, an immersive software engineering school, in 2012. In conversations with him, it was immediately clear to me that he has a deep wealth of skill and wisdom when it comes to learning. He’s evidently passionate about supporting people to succeed — I know I keep using that word; it’s because this isn’t about just teaching a curriculum, it’s about tangible results. Out of all the possible ways to teach people about Holochain, he’s looking for the path that gets them to writing code most effectively and quickly. And he recognises that the curriculum needs to adapt in real-time to the participants. Not only that, but he’s genuinely excited about Holochain. Honestly, I’m stoked that he’s signed up to help lead this course.</p><p><a href="https://guillemcordoba.github.io/about/">Guillem Cordoba</a> is no stranger to Holochain education. In addition to being involved in the last few DevCamps, he’s also created a lot of great learning resources like the <a href="https://holochain-gym.github.io/">Holochain Gym</a> and <a href="https://holochain-playground.github.io/">Playground</a>, helps lead <a href="https://forum.holochain.org/t/about-the-holochain-in-action-category/5448">Holochain in Action</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/GuillemCordoba/videos">Wednesday Workshop</a> sessions, and has created a lot of reusable libraries as well. He’s a skilled and creative developer who writes straightforward, readable code, and he’s also just an all-around good-hearted and humble guy. His knowledge and helpfulness in the Holochain developer community are already renowned.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/liz-penny-7533a6b">Liz Penny</a> has been a tech educator and director of education with Hack Reactor, <a href="https://thelastmile.org/">The Last Mile</a>, and <a href="https://www.galvanize.com/">Galvanize</a>. As Marcus’ collaborator she brings the same desire to see participants succeed. She’ll be involved in designing and coordinating the course and describes her role in programmes like this as ‘leader-student’ and ‘doula’. My colleagues say she’s got a singular focus on making things happen and choosing the right things to make happen, yet in the kindest and most supportive way.<br><br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mmeigooni/">Muhammad Meigooni</a> lives at the intersection of education and technology, having worked as a full-stack software engineer for a number of startups, including Fullscreen and Speakeasy, as well as a Product / Campus owner at MakerSquare, Hack Reactor, and Galvanize. Muhammad was the 'student developer' in our 2-week pre-pilot immersion with Marcus, Guillem, and Arthur Brock.<br><br>I’m excited to see what will happen when the four of them bring their strengths together for this course.</p> Who is it for? <p>We’re looking for people who already have a good amount of experience with full-stack software development. You don’t need to know Rust (that’s the first part of the course) but you should be competent at writing and reading well-structured code.</p><p>Aside from that, the biggest thing we’re looking for is a willingness to dedicate yourself to learning and supporting your peers’ learning in an immersive context.</p><p>It’s not meant to be for everyone, nor can it be. As I mentioned, it’s an on-site course with a pretty intensive schedule, which will allow us to iterate rapidly towards an ideal curriculum for you and future participants. So you’ll be taking the course and helping us design it at the same time. As such, there will be a screening process to determine whether this programme is right for you.</p><p>But this iterative approach means you’ll also be well-supported at every step of the way; Marcus and Liz come from a school with a long and <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-biggest-complaints-from-students-in-Hack-Reactor">acclaimed</a> history of not letting a single person slip through the cracks.</p><p>If you’d prefer taking an online course with others or at your own pace, those are coming soon too. In fact, we plan to use the insights we gain from this course to help construct them as well as future in-person courses.</p> A note on the tuition fees <p>We know this programme costs a lot, and you may not be able to afford it. And the intensity might not be appropriate for everyone. But we don’t want anyone to be shut out simply because they can’t afford it. We all know the tech world suffers from a lack of diversity, and I think it’s a loss for everyone — the valuable everyday experiences and perspectives of women, indigenous people, people of colour, trans people, residents of the global south, and many others are largely missing. I know we can’t change such a complex problem by ourselves, but we do want to do what’s in our power.</p><p>If you’re in a position to take two weeks to travel to this course, please know that scholarships are available. If you don’t see yourself in the criteria, look a little harder. Maybe you’re like me and don’t see yourself as an ‘exceptional’ candidate. I urge you to set that voice aside; you’re more exceptional than you think!</p> What happens once I get back home? <p>Of course, we can’t promise that you’ll get a job with a dev shop or create a wildly successful hApp as soon as you leave the course, but the instructors are dedicated to skilling you up so that your prospects will be high. A growing number of people and companies are adopting Holochain as the toolkit for their applications, and it’s not just crypto stuff. Holochain is good for regular, everyday apps that happen to not need the cloud (although we think it’ll be used for some pretty ground-breaking apps too). Here are some examples:</p>  <a href="https://ethelo.com/">Ethelo</a>, who create collective decision-making and civic engagement software, is planning on <a href="https://ethelo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Ethelo-DAO-White-Paper.pdf">moving</a> their machine-learning back-end to Holochain. They’ve already had experience in the crypto world, having helped GitCoin manage the project screening process.  <a href="https://www.sensorica.co/">Sensorica</a>, a pioneer <a href="https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Open_Value_Network">open value network</a> (like a pre-crypto DAO) that builds scientific instruments, intends to <a href="https://forum.holochain.org/t/digital-environment-for-material-commons-based-peer-production-with-sensorica/5659">rebuild</a> their management software on Holochain using the <a href="https://github.com/h-REA">hREA</a> economic toolkit.  <a href="https://twitter.com/kizuna_fndn">Kizuna</a> is a new private messenger app from scratch using Holochain, and they have a usable demo you can download in the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/tags">Holochain Launcher</a>.  <a href="https://www.fluxsocial.io/">Flux</a> is a ‘community in a box’, a way for clubs, teams, DAOs, and other groups to spin up communication and knowledge sharing software. They have an installable <a href="https://github.com/fluxsocial/flux/releases/tag/v0.2.17">early release</a> you can try; it feels a lot like Discord or Slack.  <a href="https://sprillow.com/">Sprillow</a> is a small dev shop focused entirely on building hApps. Their flagship product is <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/acorn">Acorn</a>, a beautiful app for planning goals together, and they’re also taking on stewardship of hREA.  <a href="https://lightningrodlabs.org/">Lightning Rod Labs</a> is a coalition of developers and designers (some of them Holo alumni) who build interesting local-first hApps and experiments for <a href="https://github.com/glassbeadsoftware/snapmail">self-hosted email</a>, <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/where">group self-awareness</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/notebooks">collaborative document editing</a>.  <a href="https://www.ioen.tech/">IOEN</a> is using Holochain to build cooperative management software for micro-grids powered by renewable electricity.  <p>This course will probably look good on a resume too. And even if you don’t end up creating hApps, Rust is becoming increasingly popular, especially in the DWeb and web3 world, and knowledge of distributed systems is now in demand whether you’re working in decentralised or traditional cloud.</p><p>Can you see yourself becoming a part of this ecosystem? If so, it’s time to get skilled up.</p><blockquote><a href="https://holo.host/holochain-rust-developer-immersive">More info</a> · <a href="https://holochain.typeform.com/to/MFclGDrB">Apply now!</a></blockquote> Don’t miss the next AMA! <p>AMA #51, coming up on Wednesday, June 8th at 16:30 UTC, &nbsp;is going to be all about the Developer Education Initiative. The special guest will be Marcus Phillips, along with Mary Camacho (Holo CEO), Arthur Brock (co-founder of Holochain), and David Atkinson (Holo Commercial Director). So bring your questions about this course and learn about our future plans!</p> Tryorama 0.5.2 <p>Holochain compatibility: 0.0.122 and up<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.118 and up</p><p>Tryorama, the Node.JS-based testing tool for Holochain, has gone through a significant rewrite. Most of this has been simplification under the hood, but the API has seen some breaking changes too. Here are the highlights:</p>  New: More complete typedefs for the parts of Tryorama that you interact with.  New: Complete documentation for the entire Tryorama API. This is exciting! <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/blob/v0.5.2/docs/tryorama.md">Check it out</a>.  New: Use the <code>hc</code> command to manage conductors.  Breaking: Removed middleware feature (previously supported <code>tape</code> and TryCP).  Breaking: Conductor config files are no longer generated and stored; the config is passed to the <code>hc</code> command instead.  Breaking: Removed implicit usage of <code>tape</code> as test harness; it’s now unopinionated and you can use any JavaScript-based testing framework you like.  Maintenance: Greatly expanded test coverage, and tests run on both Linux and macOS to check for OS-specific failures.  <p>You can get it from <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@holochain/tryorama/v/0.5.2">NPM</a> by installing <code>@holochain/tryorama</code> in your test project.</p> Holochain Launcher 0.4.7 <p>Compatible Holochain versions: 0.0.127, 0.0.131, 0.0.136<br>Lair keystore version: 0.1.3</p><p>The three releases since I made a big <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/launcher-launches-new-features/#unboxing-the-user-friendly-launcher-044">noise</a> about Launcher in the last Dev Pulse have been mostly bug fixes — no new conductor versions are included.</p>  Bugfix: Don’t overwrite local RPC and keystore interface settings when saving new config file.  Bugfix: Fix incorrect mimetype for JavaScript assets served to browser.  Bugfix: Fix incorrect compatible HDK version for Holochain 0.0.131.  <p>On a side note, there are now a few more applications for you to download and try from the built-in DevHub, including the Kizuna messenger!</p> Holochain 0.0.140, 0.0.141, and 0.0.142: Maintenance releases <p>HDK compatibility (all three releases): 0.0.129 to 0.0.135</p><p>The only significant change among these releases is more documentation improvements, yay! (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1391">#1391</a>) The admin and app RPC API documentation has gotten a big cleanup; read them <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/0.0.42/holochain_conductor_api/index.html">here</a>.</p><p>Minor updates:</p>  Bugfix (regression): Fix broken tracing (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1389">#1389</a>).  Use Rust 1.60 by default in Holonix shell (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1383">#1383</a>).   Holochain in Action videos  Launcher + DevHub demo <p>A recent Holochain in Action meeting unpacked the newest Holochain Launcher with the built-in DevHub. If you haven’t tried it yet, you can experience it through other people’s eyes here.</p> Profiles module <p>Yesterday’s meeting involved a pair programming session on integrating the <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/profiles/">Profiles module</a> into a basic hApp. Member profiles are of course an important part of almost any app with a social component, so I’m guessing this video will be useful to most of you.</p> Neighbourhoods in the news <p><a href="https://neighbourhoods.network">Neighbourhoods</a>, a sister project building tools for reputation and shared social sense-making, has been getting public lately. Everything they’re sharing is a good window of what they’re planning, and will give you nutritious food for thought in designing your app to foster healthy social interactions. Here are a couple recent things:</p> Articles: Distributed Social Sensemaking, Parts 1 and 2 <p>I’ve been loving this series of articles about ‘distributed social sensemaking’. If that term is unfamiliar to you, it simply means how we make sense of the things we see and hear about, together, without top-down management. There are dysfunctional and healthy ways to do social sensemaking, and in this series Dr Emaline Friedman, Pablo Somonte Ruano, and the rest of the Neighbourhoods team unpack their vision of how tech could help facilitate the healthy kind. Read <a href="https://blog.neighbourhoods.network/distributed-social-sensemaking-part-1-7f2e816d9031">part 1</a> and <a href="https://blog.neighbourhoods.network/distributed-social-sensemaking-part-2-b696b8204e7e">part 2</a> (parts 3 and 4 still to come).</p> Presentation: Social Sensemaking and Governance <p>Two weeks ago the <a href="https://metagov.org/">Metagovernance Project</a> hosted Dr Emaline Friedman and Michael Hueschen from Neighbourhoods. They got the chance to share their plans to build tools for ‘soft’ governance via social norms expressed in day-to-day activities. In other words, the ways our group’s members express themselves in normal interactions shapes the way we make decisions together, and can reduce the need for more formal governance structures like voting, moderation, penalties, token engineering, etc, and can also reduce the need for a “march on city hall” when governance goes wrong, as Emaline says. Sounds like a much gentler approach than much of what’s being explored in the crypto-governance space, although it does seem to be moving rapidly towards this sort of soft governance as it grows up.</p> DWeb Camp returns in August <p>After a long absence, <a href="https://dwebcamp.org/">DWeb Camp</a> is back again, August 24th to 28th in Camp Navarro, CA, US! This weekend event is hosted by the <a href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive</a> and attracts people who are involved in a lot of different DWeb and web3 people, representing everything from traditional HTTP-based approaches like <a href="https://solidproject.org/">Solid</a> and <a href="https://activitypub.rocks/">ActivityPub</a>, to cryptographic protocols like <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> and Holochain (and yes, even a bit of blockchain), to social initiatives like <a href="https://www.humanetech.com/">Centre for Humane Tech</a> and <a href="https://compost.digital">COMPOST magazine</a>. It’s a wonderful mashup of ideas, projects, and personalities; I thoroughly enjoyed the first (and so far only) one back in 2019.</p><p>It’d be great if you could come, and I’d love to meet you in person. I’m not saying we should dominate DWeb Camp or anything, but if Holochain had a visible presence there, would that be a bad thing?</p><p>There are scholarships available if you’d love to go but can’t afford it, and you can also volunteer to help with camp setup, facilitation, and tear-down. If you love giving presentations, you can sign up to give a lightning talk, and if you love hosting workshops, you can do that too. <a href="https://dwebcamp.org">Learn more and sign up here</a>.</p>

				  Personal data between the United States and the European Union might soon be flowing smoothly again after the two jurisdictions agreed in principle to a new privacy framework. 



<p>Data transfers between the EU and the US have been problematic for some time due to a&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">conflict</a>&nbsp;between US surveillance laws and EU data protection and privacy regulations. In&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">July 2020</a>&nbsp;the Court of Justice of the European Union&nbsp;invalidated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome">Privacy Shield</a>,&nbsp;an arrangement that had allowed&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/the-schrems-ii-decision-eu-us-data-transfers-in-question/">more than 5,000</a>&nbsp;US companies to conduct transatlantic trade while complying with EU data protection rules.&nbsp;The landmark ruling, informally known as&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/the-schrems-ii-decision-eu-us-data-transfers-in-question/">Schrems II</a>&nbsp;after Max Schrems, the lawyer and privacy advocate who filed the original complaint against Facebook with the Irish Data Protection Commissioner,&nbsp;struck down Privacy Shield on the basis that US surveillance programs (signals intelligence activities such as wiretapping phone calls, SMS, and any type of data transfer)&nbsp;went beyond what was strictly necessary and&nbsp;EU&nbsp;citizens had no “actionable judicial redress” or effective remedy in the US. In a nutshell, Privacy Shield didn’t protect Europeans from US surveillance.&nbsp;The decision meant companies and regulators have had to approach data transfers on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they’re meeting EU standards, which hampers trade and increases their compliance burden.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Further back from Privacy Shield, though, was Safe Harbor, which Europe’s top court also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/25/eu-and-us-agree-new-data-transfer-pact-to-replace-privacy-shield.html">invalidated</a>&nbsp;over “the same core clash between EU privacy rights and US surveillance laws” following a case also put by Max Schrems.&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">Tech Crunch</a>&nbsp;explained: “Putting a little more meat on the bones, the US’ prioritizing of digital surveillance — as revealed by the 2013 revelations of NSA whistleblower, Edward Snowden; and writ large in the breadth of data capture powers allowed by Section 702 of FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) and executive order 12,333 (which sanctions bulks collection) — collides directly with European fundamental rights which give citizens rights to privacy and data protection, as set out in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights and specific pieces of pan-EU legislation (such as the General Data Protection Regulation).”</p>



<p>Facebook (cited in the Schrems case) and other big data companies like Google were particularly hard hit by the loss of smooth transatlantic data flows.&nbsp;Meta has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/25/eu-and-us-agree-new-data-transfer-pact-to-replace-privacy-shield.html">threatened</a>&nbsp;to shut down Facebook and Instagram in Europe over the data transfers uncertainty in recent years.</p>



<p>At the time of the Schrems II ruling, the International Association of Privacy Professionals (<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/the-schrems-ii-decision-eu-us-data-transfers-in-question/">IAPP</a>) made the point that&nbsp;data protection is incredibly important to global commerce, and privacy professionals play a critical role in implementing protections in line with foreign legal requirements.</p>



 What the new agreement means 



<p>The new privacy framework, agreed to in principle by the US and the&nbsp;<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/index_en">European Commission</a>, brings to a head a couple years of legal wrangling and offers the potential for easier cross-border data transfers going forward, especially for Meta and Google and the thousands of other companies that rely on smooth data flows for trade.</p>



<p>In announcing the new deal in late March, President Biden&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/03/25/remarks-by-president-biden-and-european-commission-president-ursula-von-der-leyen-in-joint-press-statement/">said</a>,&nbsp;“This framework underscores our shared commitment to privacy, to data protection, and to the rule of law,” and that the flow of data would “help facilitate $7.1 trillion in economic relationships with the EU.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/03/25/remarks-by-president-biden-and-european-commission-president-ursula-von-der-leyen-in-joint-press-statement/">added</a>&nbsp;that the new agreement would “enable predictable and trustworthy data flows between the EU and US, safeguarding privacy and civil liberties.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/25/eu-and-us-agree-new-data-transfer-pact-to-replace-privacy-shield.html">Nick Clegg</a>, Meta’s president of global affairs,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/25/eu-and-us-agree-new-data-transfer-pact-to-replace-privacy-shield.html">said</a>&nbsp;the deal “will provide invaluable certainty for American and European companies of all sizes, including Meta, who rely on transferring data quickly and safely.”</p>



<p>Nick Clegg has previously&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/25/eu-and-us-agree-new-data-transfer-pact-to-replace-privacy-shield.html">summarized</a>&nbsp;the data transfers issue in strong terms as “the global internet fragmenting”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Google’s president of global affairs,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/25/eu-and-us-agree-new-data-transfer-pact-to-replace-privacy-shield.html">Kent Walker</a>, also welcomed the development: “People want to be able to use digital services from anywhere in the world and know that their information is safe and protected when they communicate across borders.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But we’re not out of the woods on this issue yet. This new agreement is expected to be heavily tested with legal challenges, some of which Schrems himself indicates he might launch,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/25/eu-and-us-agree-new-data-transfer-pact-to-replace-privacy-shield.html">saying</a>&nbsp;the “final text” of the new agreement would take more time to come through, and that he was prepared to challenge it “if it is not in line with EU law.”</p>



<p>“In the end, the [EU] Court of Justice will decide a third time. We expect this to be back at the Court within months from a final decision,” Schrems said in a&nbsp;<a href="https://noyb.eu/en/privacy-shield-20-first-reaction-max-schrems">statement</a>&nbsp;on the web site of his privacy non-profit&nbsp;<a href="https://noyb.eu/en">noyb</a>.</p>



 The detail as it currently stands 



 In the White House&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/25/fact-sheet-united-states-and-european-commission-announce-trans-atlantic-data-privacy-framework/">fact sheet</a>&nbsp;on the new privacy framework, we glean some of the key detail that was missing when the deal was first announced: 



  The new agreement is officially called the Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework, and promises to be “a durable and reliable legal basis for data flows”, fostering&nbsp;transatlantic data transfers and addressing the concerns raised in the Schrems II decision.&nbsp;  The framework commits the US to “implement new safeguards to ensure that signals intelligence activities are necessary and proportionate in the pursuit of defined national security objectives, which will ensure the privacy of EU personal data and to create a new mechanism for EU individuals to seek redress if they believe they are unlawfully targeted by signals intelligence activities.”  The framework will benefits citizens and companies in both the US and EU. “For EU individuals, the deal includes new, high-standard commitments regarding the protection of personal data. For citizens and companies on both sides of the Atlantic, the deal will enable the continued flow of data that underpins more than $1 trillion in cross-border commerce every year, and will enable businesses of all sizes to compete in each other’s markets.”&nbsp;  



 The White House says the United States has made “unprecedented commitments to: 



  Strengthen the privacy and civil liberties safeguards governing US signals intelligence activities;  Establish a new redress mechanism with independent and binding authority; and  Enhance its existing rigorous and layered oversight of signals intelligence activities.”  



 <br>It gives examples of the new framework’s assurances such as: 



  “Signals intelligence collection may be undertaken only where necessary to advance legitimate national security objectives, and must not disproportionately impact the protection of individual privacy and civil liberties;  EU individuals may seek redress from a new multi-layer redress mechanism that includes an independent Data Protection Review Court that would consist of individuals chosen from outside the US Government who would have full authority to adjudicate claims and direct remedial measures as needed; and  US intelligence agencies will adopt procedures to ensure effective oversight of new privacy and civil liberties standards.”&nbsp;  



<p>The White House says any company or organization that uses the new framework to legally protect data flows must continue to adhere to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=Requirements-of-Participation">Privacy Shield Principles</a>, including the requirement to self-certify their adherence to the Principles through the US Department of Commerce. EU individuals will continue to have access to “multiple avenues of recourse to resolve complaints about participating organizations, including through alternative dispute resolution and binding arbitration.”</p>



 What we think of this development 



<p>This is an important issue to be across if you do business outside the US. We believe this new privacy framework is necessary, and we’re pleased to see progress on this long-running issue.</p>



<p>Reading the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/25/fact-sheet-united-states-and-european-commission-announce-trans-atlantic-data-privacy-framework/">fact sheet</a>&nbsp;from the White House, it sounds like the US had to make concessions in the main areas that the EU court had issues with: US signals intelligence activities and a perception of lack of oversight and proportionality.</p>



<p>The requirement on companies and organizations to continue to self-certify adherence to the Privacy Shield Principles is something Anonyome Labs already does and will continue to do.</p>



<p>We believe Max Schrems and his privacy non-profit&nbsp;<a href="https://noyb.eu/en">noyb</a>&nbsp;will challenge again in the European Court of Justice. And, of course, it’s still for the US to demonstrate in practice that they’ve made real change. We hope this new agreement is not just buying a couple more years on the merry go round.</p>

<p>This week, Verizon released its <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/">DBIR report</a> marking 15 years of the annual report. In the report, Verizon highlighted their analysis of more than 5,212 breaches and 23,896 security incidents to find that attackers have four key paths to enterprise estates; credentials, phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities, and malicious botnets.</p>
<p>They go on to state that hackers exploit the human element (including errors, misuse and social engineering). Combining this element and the entry points above, hackers gain access to organizations to launch their attacks. In fact, Verizon states that 82% of intrusions this year were related to that human element which included – errors, misuse, and social engineering. In addition, the Verizon research broke down the factors leveraged in a breach:</p>
 
 45% were related to credential reuse 
 25% were related to social engineering 
 50% were related to remote access and web applications 
 
<p>The takeaway here is the fact that humans (re. employees) are still the weak link in the security chain. Why? Because users continue to click malicious links, they continue to “lose” or give away their credentials. Users are still making poor security decisions and as a result, hackers are gaining access to applications, systems, and data. While that likely is not a surprise to anyone the numbers make this abundantly clear. As they do most years. And while these reports can be all doom and gloom, fear not, it’s not all bad, because there are ways to fix the problem.</p>
<p>While eliminating the human element sounds challenging for organizations, there are options. Verizon recommends the usual approach to solve some of these problems like deploying two-factor authentication and/or implementing password managers for users, all in an effort to avoid the impact credentials introduce. This approach can reduce the likelihood of attackers being able to exploit poor passwords to gain access to applications, systems, and data. These capabilities have been available and in production for years BUT we are still seeing similar numbers year over year from reports like this year’s DBIR.</p>
<p>Let’s focus on credentials. Why? If you do a quick search for the term in the report it appears 86 times! With that in mind, the report states: “Unfortunately, if you can access the asset directly over the internet simply by entering the credentials, so can the criminals.” So if we can improve upon authenticating users without the use of credentials then I’d argue organizations will be better for it.</p>
<p>How can the use of credentials be improved over the recommendations? Eliminating as many of them as possible. But how? It sounds complicated and even impossible! But that’s simply not the case. Take for instance what 1Kosmos customers can do. Our customers systematically replace credentials with real biometrics that are matched to a verified digital identity and it works across all operating systems including <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/integrations/microsoft-windows-and-windows-hello-for-business/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/integrations/macos/">Mac</a>, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/datasheets/blockid-workforce-for-unix/">Unix</a>, and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/integrations/linux/">Linux</a>.</p>
<p>How can credentials be replaced? With identity. By combining<a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/online-id-verification/"> identity verification</a> with access management organizations can eliminate credentials, especially passwords and therefore, prevent most of the 82% of intrusions caused by humans. This would then free up organizations to place focus on other areas that inject more security risk.</p>
<p>Hopefully, more organizations will take this approach and next year we’ll see a decline in these human-based errors.</p>

<p>Cash back is a way stores reward their customers and clients when they purchase items from them. You can avail yourself of it through your credit cards, debit cards, or by using specific apps and websites.</p><p>A cash back program allows you as a cardholder or account owner to refund a certain percentage of the purchase you have made using a credit or debit card or a personal&nbsp;check.</p> Why Do Stores Offer Cash&nbsp;Back? <p>This marketing strategy encourages account owners to utilize their cards and personal accounts in specific applications to conduct purchases with their cards and apps. In this way, financial transactions stay within the terms of their banking system. This scheme is one of the ways banks advertise their company’s products and services.</p> What Line of Stores Offer Cash&nbsp;Back? <p>E stablishments that fulfil our everyday needs such as grocery stores, gas stations, and even department stores offer cash backs. However, it’s rare to find clothing stores, home goods stores, and home furnishing stores that offer cashback promos to their customers.</p><p>If you want to avail cashback promo, it is essential to fairly be straightforward about your intent of availing cashback before making a purchase. This can definitely put you at the advantage of being aware of the store’s welcoming policies on cash&nbsp;backs.</p><p>Several lines of stores are within the country offer cash backs. They can give you cashback if you use your debit card to purchase from their racks rather than credit cards or&nbsp;bills.</p> How do Customers Benefit from a Cash&nbsp;Back? <p>Cashback brings a host of benefits in terms of saving money or even putting customers up for loyalty programs. The greatest utility is that a part of what you spend is given back to&nbsp;you.</p><p>It also saves the customers from making errands to the nearest ATM and to servicing banks, as the same stores allow them to avail of the cashback with no fees at all. The fee waiver becomes invalid if they transact from differing branches of banks and&nbsp;ATMs.</p><p>In addition, most stores offering cash backs allow you to withdraw from your checking account through their stores. But of course, it has limits. Should you need cash for a family gathering tomorrow, it is best to go to the nearest branch of your bank. These stores often give money back with minimal to no minimum purchase.</p> Stores That Offer Cash&nbsp;back <p>Now that we have a fair idea of how to receive cashback and save bucks, it is helpful to identify some stores that give cashback to its customers for a variety of purchases.</p> 1. Albertsons <p>The store offers cashback to a maximum of $300.00 if you use your debit card for making a purchase.

It can only be in monetary valuations of $10,$20, $40, or $100. They do not allow customers to customize other amounts for cashback; employing this procedure will enable Aldi to maintain their efficient and super speedy check-out counters.</p><p>Their cashback limit stays within the maximum of $100.00, but if you need a higher amount of cash, you can try splitting your purchases into two payments on the counter. Other options are to go to the nearest ATM booth, your bank, or another store that allows higher cashback.</p> 3. Food&nbsp;Lion <p>It is one of the biggest chains of stores in the United States, started in 1957. The store now has more than a thousand branches in ten different states of the US.

			  Thaddee Bousselin is Sales Engineer at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p>My name is Thaddee, I am a 28 year old Frenchman. I am a son, a grandson, a brother, and a partner. I’m also a friend, a travel buddy, and a proud Tokeny coworker!</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>Joining Tokeny was really a logical continuation of my previous experiences. I have traveled my entire life: first following my parents and later for my studies. In total, I spent 10 years in South Korea and China, several years in the United States, and spent my university years in the Czech Republic, Spain, and France. Thanks to these experiences, I learned that diversity and an open-minded entourage are must-haves for me. In high school, I started to notice how technology and new companies were constantly reshaping the way I lived. This inspired me to start studying computer science and entrepreneurship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I started to follow Tokeny and the disruptions happening in finance and real estate while writing my master’s thesis. I was motivated to learn more, and therefore started an internship related to tokenization. After that, I knew that I wanted to continue in this ecosystem. Tokeny was the obvious top choice, and it all happened very naturally.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>It’s certainly an incredibly fulfilling experience! I feel very fortunate working with&nbsp; like-minded team members that are so passionate about our mission. For every start-up, there are internal challenges. And, as we have seen in the past years, there will also be new and unforeseen external challenges. I feel reassured being part of a team that has a proven ability to grow together in the face of adversity.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>The most important thing to me is to always keep learning and get better at everything I care about. I spend quite some time learning about ways to solve issues such as climate change and finding ways to be proactive about them.</p>
<p>Trying to approach life with a philosophy of gratitude is part of my daily routine, like appreciating the ‘little’ things, good and bad. Of course, I am always looking forward to good times with friends and family. I love listening to and playing music, and on the weekends, you might see me enjoying the thrill of motorcycle driving!</p>
 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>Hard question! I’d say being able to look back at my life with a smile, knowing I made the ones around me happy and had even a small but positive impact on society.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What advice would you give to future Tokeny employees? 
<p>Welcome aboard 🙂 Getting started can sometimes feel overwhelming. Here are a few things that help me daily: setting priorities, planning the day ahead, asking for help, taking the time to learn things step-by-step, and putting everything into perspective. You will see that learning more about blockchain and technology is really part of everyday life at Tokeny, and it keeps us on our toes!</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>So many different things! Most of all the mix of people working here and the incredible service we provide. In my opinion, tokenization will become mainstream, as what we offer is mind-blowing compared to the traditional approach. Being on the forefront of such an evolution and participating in shaping a better tomorrow for entire industries is, for me, a dream come true.</p>

    &lt;artifactId&gt;helidon-microprofile-jwt-auth&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Add a <code>HelloResource</code> class that returns the user’s information: [<code>h-hello</code>]</p>
 
 
 <code>package com.okta.rest.controller;

import io.helidon.security.Principal;
import io.helidon.security.SecurityContext;

import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Context;
import java.util.Optional;

import static javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN;

@Path("/hello")
public class HelloResource {

    @GET
    @Produces(TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String hello(@Context SecurityContext context) {
        Optional&lt;Principal&gt; userPrincipal = context.userPrincipal();
        return "Hello, " + userPrincipal.get().getName() + "!";
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Add a <code>HelloApplication</code> class in <code>src/main/java/com/okta/rest</code> to register your resource and configure JWT authentication: [<code>h-app</code>]</p>
 
 
 <code>package com.okta.rest;

import com.okta.rest.controller.HelloResource;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.auth.LoginConfig;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Application;
import java.util.Set;

@LoginConfig(authMethod = "MP-JWT")
@ApplicationScoped
public class HelloApplication extends Application {

    @Override
    public Set&lt;Class&lt;?&gt;&gt; getClasses() {
        return Set.of(HelloResource.class);
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Add your Okta endpoints to <code>src/main/resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties</code>.</p>
 
 
 <code>mp.jwt.verify.publickey.location=/oauth2/default/v1/keys
mp.jwt.verify.issuer=/oauth2/default</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Run and test your Helidon REST API with HTTPie 
 
 
 
<p>Start your app from your IDE or using a terminal:</p>
 
 
 mvn package &amp;&amp; java -jar ./target/helidon.jar 
 
 
 
 
<p>Test your API with an access token.</p>
 
 
 http :8080/hello Authorization:"Bearer $TOKEN" 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Build a native Helidon app with GraalVM 
 
 
 
<p>Compile your Helidon app into a native executable using the <code>native-image</code> profile:</p>
 
 
 mvn package -Pnative-image 
 
 
 
 
<p>Start your Helidon app:</p>
 
 
 ./target/helidon 
 
 
 
 
<p>Test your API with an access token.</p>
 
 
 http :8080/hello Authorization:"Bearer $TOKEN" 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Startup time comparison 
 
 
<p>I compared startup times between frameworks by running each image three times before recording the numbers. Then, I ran each app five more times and averaged the results. I gathered these numbers on a 2019 MacBook Pro with an SSD, 2.4 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 processor, and 64 GB of RAM.</p>
 

 

 
 
 
<p>Versions used: Quarkus 2.9.0, Micronaut 3.4.3, Helidon 2.5.0, and Spring Boot 2.6.7 with Spring Native 0.11.5.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Memory usage comparison 
 
 
<p>I tested the memory usage (in megabytes) of each app using the command below. I ran it right after I started the app, after a single authenticated request, and after five authenticated requests.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>ps -o pid,rss,command | grep --color &lt;executable&gt; | awk '{$2=int($2/1024)"M";}{ print;}'</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The chart below shows the memory usage after five requests.</p>
 
 

 
 
 What about the MacBook Pro M1 Max? 
 
<p>My MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2021) with Apple M1 Max builds much faster, apps start up 2x faster, but they use more memory.</p>

<p>The United States is home to <a href="https://advocacy.sba.gov/2021/08/31/advocacy-releases-2021-small-business-profiles-for-the-states/">32.5 million</a> small businesses, which amounts to 99.9% of all <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/small-business/state-of-small-business-now">businesses</a> in the country. They employ just under half of the workforce, and are responsible for 44% of <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/small-businesses-really-mean-us-220028160.html#:~:text=A%20new%20report%20also%20shows,portion%20of%20overall%20GDP%20contribution.">total GDP</a>. Clearly, supporting the growth of small-to-midsize businesses is essential to the lifeblood of the economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The important role of the small business in the economy isn’t always reflected by lending guidelines that work for the small business owner, however. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business-loans/problems-getting-a-small-business-loan/">Thirty percent</a> of businesses that apply for credit through traditional lenders are denied, or only qualify for a portion of the funds they need. These numbers drop <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2019-november-consumer-community-context.htm#f4">even further</a> for minorities looking for the operating capital they need to grow their businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an increasingly data-driven, digital economy, there’s room for additional choice. Innovative lending solutions can give every owner an equal opportunity to make their business dreams a reality.&nbsp;</p>
 Open Banking is Giving Lenders and Small Business Owners More Choice 
<p>According to Mastercard’s <a href="https://www.finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking-sme/">Rise of Open Banking study</a>, 74% of small-to-midsize business (SMB) owners would share business performance data if it meant that they could better demonstrate their ability to pay back a loan and have more choice in lending options. Black, hispanic and millennial owners are even more enthusiastic about sharing financial data, if sharing it means being presented with better loan terms and options. Over 80% responded positively to data sharing in each of those demographic categories.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Owner-permissioned data through Mastercard’s open banking platform can power apps and services with up to 24 months of rich cash flow attributes. This can inform better, more accurate insights which lenders can use to make financial decisions. Approvals, credit increases, leases and other small business needs can be granted with reduced risk of bad debt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data can be used to develop new lending models and underwrite new lending products. This opens up access to capital with terms and options that can be crafted to fit unique SMB needs. Funding is an ongoing issue for small business owners. Eighty-five percent are looking for faster, easier access to capital, and 62% have received a business loan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether it comes from public-facing consumer retail, ecommerce, professional services or seasonal businesses, owner-permissioned open banking data is the launchpad for a fast-growing ecosystem of effective financial tools that simply didn’t exist in the pre-digital era.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rather than basing lending decisions on <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business-loans/problems-getting-a-small-business-loan/">metrics</a> like personal credit scores, business credit scores and time in business, lenders are using open banking data points and analytics to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/11/05/how-fintech-lending-trends-benefit-small-businesses/?sh=32ecff9368fa">unlock capital</a>. Businesses that may have been impeded by traditional guidelines that aren’t aligned with the modern economy now have new options for funding. They’re benefiting from advances in open banking data technology, and they’re asking for the financial opportunities and insights that data can provide.</p>
 Small Business Owners Want to Grow With Tools and Allies 
<p>Despite the challenges of rising costs, talent acquisition, supply chain issues, cybersecurity and a host of other concerns, owners are optimistic and ready to grow. Forty-seven percent say they’re in growth mode, and looking for allies to help them scale up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over 80% of owners say they want a partner to help them find access to capital and to loans that fit the needs of their specific business. This is where open banking solutions stand out, and where innovators are expanding the lending ecosystem with data-driven loan products, like:</p>
 
 Low-interest loans 
 Micro-loans 
 Credit card options 
 Niche lending 
 
<p></p>
<p>In just a three-month period at the beginning of 2020, U.S.-based fintech <a href="https://www.lendio.com/">Lendio</a> helped over 100,000 small businesses <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/perspectives/2021/how-open-banking-is-giving-a-san-diego-coffee-roastery-the-jolt-of-capital-to-thrive/">connect to over $8 billion</a> in <a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/covid-19-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program">U.S. Paycheck Protection Program loans</a>, using owner-permissioned open banking data to analyze cash flow and other alternative lending metrics.</p>
<p>Small business specialists like Lendio have been a badly-needed lifeline during the pandemic and beyond. An open banking platform makes it possible to close the smaller loans that financial institutions don’t typically originate, and to do it more quickly. The manpower needed to run open banking-powered apps and services is less intensive than what is required to handle the traditional underwriting process at larger institutions. The amount of work that it takes to underwrite smaller loans has made them less appealing to some lenders in the past.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This has caused some business owners to be left behind, particularly women and minorities seeking less capital to fund their enterprises.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Open banking provides real-time data that helps lenders understand a small to mid-sized business’ creditworthiness, letting them more quickly and easily approve loans, no matter the size. With small business loans ranging from <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/loans/small-business-loan-amounts/">$5,000 to $1.2 million</a>, it’s clear there is a wide range of opportunities to ally with owners by offering specialized lending products.&nbsp;</p>
 Addressing a Growing Need in the Small Business Sector 
<p>There’s a growing list of lenders covering every need and every niche that the market is asking for, and demand has never been higher. According to the <a href="https://www.finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking-sme/">Mastercard study</a>, eighty-seven percent of owners already use or would like to use open banking-powered fintech apps and services to secure funding for their businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Small businesses are still recovering from the effects of the pandemic, with the percentage of cash-strapped enterprises <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/loans/2022/federal-reserve-bank-of-philadelphia-report-finds-fintech-lending-crucial-for-smbs/">moving up slightly</a>, from 15% to 18%. Innovators have an opportunity to create solutions that help owners who need reserves and operating capital, but who may have a short tenure in business, a thin credit file or low FICO scores.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Owners want to secure and refinance loans. They want allies to help them make informed decisions. Ninety-six percent of them are linking their accounts and sharing their data. Alongside the desire for funding, 85% are looking for the customized financial recommendations that can come from sharing data with open banking apps and services. They want access to capital, and they want it quicker and smarter, to keep pace with an unpredictable consumer marketplace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the next installment of the Rise of Open Banking series, we look at how open banking is transforming the payments experience for the SMB. Click <a href="https://www.finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking-sme/">here</a> to download the full study.</p>

<p>Mastercard’s open banking platform (provided by Mastercard’s wholly-owned subsidiary, <a href="https://www.finicity.com/">Finicity</a>) offers pre-close reports that provide just the right data that GSEs need for 10-day verification of employment. Today, <a href="https://www.freddiemac.com/">Freddie Mac</a> announced the acceptance of our Verification of Employment (VOE) Reports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In adding the VOE Payroll and Transactions reports to our <a href="https://www.finicity.com/mortgage/">Mortgage Verification Services</a> (MVS) product, we have enabled lenders to receive only the data GSEs require for the 10-day verification. Lenders can use these reports to view only your borrower’s employment status, rather than refreshing the full reports that contain more data than required for an employment verification. This minimizes the introduction of new income data or other redundant and unnecessary underwriting changes that could delay the loan closing or cause additional work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two available reports provide different types of information. The VOE Transactions report contains 120 days of refreshed transactions with dates and description, but no amounts or totals so income is not reassessed. It shows the latest direct deposits in the income streams, to confirm the&nbsp; borrower is still being paid on their regular cadence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another option is the VOE Payroll report. This contains only employment status and details—no income or other data—so lenders can see that the individual is still employed according to their payroll provider.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These two reports are part of MVS at no extra charge and are currently available for lenders connecting directly to Mastercard and through <a href="https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/">Ice Mortgage Technology.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The VOE Transaction and Payroll reports can help lenders improve accuracy and simplify the process of verifying employment within ten days of closing, removing more friction from the loan origination process without increasing risk. With one click, a GSE-accepted VOE report is available in moments, avoiding the lost time and the uncertainty of tracking down verbal verifications from employers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can you access these 10-day pre-closing reports?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To pull the VOE reports today, your team will need to code directly to the endpoints or add this functionality through Encompass LOS from Ice Technology. You can find documentation <a href="https://docs.finicity.com/refresh-reports-2/?_ga=2.113730375.1120103029.1652973413-1532333468.1650401033&amp;_gac=1.185664347.1651010851.CjwKCAjwsJ6TBhAIEiwAfl4TWICAsHgsgrPcIj2ND4TdBsNQLGC5c9HN9lh-6TI1W3zokTiGR_pSKhoCvBwQAvD_BwE">here</a>.

<p>Each year, new platforms and businesses join the ecommerce arena, making it more crowded. This eventually leads to an increase in the cost of clicks and conversions, which is why it is far more economical to get existing consumers to place a repeat purchase than it is to acquire new&nbsp;buyers.</p><p>However, have you ever evaluated your marketing techniques and engaged with your customer base to entice them to return to your store? If you believe you have not done enough, now is an excellent opportunity to develop comprehensive customer retention management strategies. Let’s start with the&nbsp;basics.</p> What is Customer Retention Management? <p>The concept of customer retention management centers around how a customer continues to engage with a business and how that business may gain additional value from its returning customers. According to experts, learning how to manage client retention is critical to a company’s long-term viability.</p><p>Customer retention is important in both contractual and non-contractual relationships. Client retention in a contractual relationship is defined by whether or not the consumer agrees to renew the arrangement, whereas the customer has the flexibility to just stop transacting with a business in a non-contractual relationship.</p><p>In a nutshell, customer retention management is ensuring that the consumers you fought so hard to stick with you, have a high level of customer satisfaction, and continue to cherish your products and services. In some circumstances, it may also entail ensuring that the consumer does not flee to your competitor.</p><p>Churn, on the other hand, is the polar opposite of customer retention. This is when a customer decides to stop doing business with a company. When it comes to retention management, churn is your number one&nbsp;enemy.</p> What Metrics Help You Measure Customer Retention? <p>Measuring customer retention is crucial for businesses since it helps anticipate how long someone will be a loyal client and, ultimately, calculates a company’s long-term profitability and value. It can also be used to assess the health of a business.</p><p>There are different formulas used by experts for measuring retention. However, the traditional equation focuses on the number of customers at the beginning (CS) and end of a period (CE), as well as the number of new customers you get&nbsp;(CN).</p> Customer Retention Formula <p>The formula for calculating customer retention is as&nbsp;follows:</p><p>((CE-CN)/CS)) X&nbsp;100</p><p>Don’t be concerned if you’re not a math genius. We will use a short case study to assist you to learn how to use the&nbsp;formula.</p><p>Assume you own a barbershop with 200 repeat clients at the start of last year. Throughout the year, you notice that 20 of those customers are missing, but you also have 40 new customers that come to your place every month. This means you’ll have 220 loyal clients by the end of the&nbsp;year.</p><p>Let’s do the math and enter the numbers into the&nbsp;formula</p><p>((220–40)/200)) X&nbsp;100</p><p>You should get a 90 as the answer, which indicates your customer retention rate for the period is 90%. Is it suitable for a barbershop? It all depends on the industry and the data from previous&nbsp;years.</p> Important Factors for Customer Retention <p>Measuring customer retention is important because if you cannot measure it, it simply means you cannot manage it. However, besides the formula, below you will find some other important factors when measuring your customer retention strategies.</p> 1. Product engagement <p>Customer retention is heavily influenced by how frequently and intensely your consumers buy your service or product. As a result, the greater the frequency and intensity, the higher the product engagement will&nbsp;be.</p><p>Big companies like Facebook and TikTok rely heavily on product engagement to maintain a high number of loyal customers. They accomplish this by creating habit-forming technologies that are intrinsically engineered to keep people encouraged to&nbsp;return.</p> 2. Service&nbsp;quality <p>Service quality is the next most significant element influencing customer retention. While quality is a somewhat subjective concept, certain characteristics, such as a smooth shopping experience and a high level of customization, can positively influence it.</p><p>Customers in the ecommerce industry are concerned not just with the things they purchase, but also with the process of purchasing them, which is why a pleasant shopping experience is essential. To put it another way, the fewer steps required to purchase the product, the more likely the client will&nbsp;return.</p><p>Customers also like it when a company understands exactly what they are looking for. If you’ve ever wondered why large ecommerce companies invest so much money to create an algorithm that knows what someone is looking for, this is the&nbsp;answer.</p> 3. Relationship quality <p>Quality relationship development begins the first moment a consumer walks into your store. Luckily, a warm greeting, a discount coupon after purchase, or even a simple “thank you” should help you make a lasting, positive impression.</p><p>Of course, you should deliver excellent service along the way. Offering multiple communication channels, training your personnel to execute operations effectively, and never ignoring any customer request are some of the keys to accomplishing this.</p><p>Having a specialized customer service team will greatly assist you in creating strong bonds with your client base. This team should not only ensure that the consumer is satisfied, but should also look for ways to win the hearts of your customers.</p> 4. Branding <p>One thing any entrepreneur should understand is that people tend to stick with brands they are familiar with. This is why putting significant effort into your branding should help you get more repeat consumers.</p><p>Clearly presenting your brand helps people in determining whether or not they would think about buying your items. Aside from that, branding will help clients understand what your company advocates for. As a result of these elements, many buyers can make a more informed purchasing decision.</p><p>Knowing how to develop compelling and educational material is also critical. It keeps your clients up to date on your products and, hopefully, keeps them engaged in a continuous and participating cycle.</p> 5. Switching cost <p>If it costs a fortune to get an alternative to your goods, a customer will not move to another brand. Maintaining a loyal consumer should not be difficult if an entrepreneur can give great products, quality service, and strong branding while keeping costs reasonable.</p> Best Practices to Improve Your Customer Retention <p>Every new consumer represents a potential long-term customer. Even if a customer does not return, you should make every effort to leave a positive impression. Certain best practices below can help put you and your company up for success in terms of customer retention.</p><p>The first practice is to make it a priority for your team to maintain and improve the customer experience. It is never only about how much your clients can spend on your products; it is also about what your staff can accomplish for&nbsp;them.</p><p>Your business plan should also be more focused on becoming scalable and capable of supporting the company’s shifting objectives. You must develop ways of measuring the impacts of these adjustments and continue to respond as needed. More importantly, your staff must be adaptable to these developments.</p><p>After you’ve determined what your team is capable of and what your company’s goals are, it’s time to streamline your company’s operations. After streamlining processes, your team should have consistent measures in place for everything from acquiring new customers to minimizing churn.</p><p>Finally, to build a consistent client base, you must maintain customer ties. In terms of shopping habits and experience, you should always be aware of where your buyers are as well as where they are going. This will assist you in ensuring that their path does not take them out the&nbsp;door.</p><p>Integrating these tried-and-true practices into your daily operations should help you prove to your consumers that you are the smartest option. Seek out developing technologies that provide early warning signals for red flags in shopping behavior and recommend appropriate next measures for the best&nbsp;results.</p> The 15 Best Customer Retention Management Strategies for Businesses <p>You should never underestimate the value of a devoted consumer base. According to studies, loyal customers account for 68 percent of sales, so maintaining existing clients should be your top priority. Read on for the greatest strategies for maintaining a high level of customer&nbsp;loyalty.</p> 1. Set realistic expectations for your customers <p>It can be unlikely to please someone you hardly know at times, so you may think it’s normal to create high expectations for them. However, if you want to set and satisfy client expectations, it is best to be truthful while making a&nbsp;promise.</p><p>Only guarantee what you can do and give your customers expectations that you can meet. If you are unable to fulfill expectations, apologize and recompense your customers.</p><p>If a customer expects a high-quality product and service but receives a subpar product, the disappointment will linger for a long time. They will eventually find it impossible to forget false promises and, worse, will leave negative reviews about your&nbsp;company.</p> 2. Build trust slowly and carefully through relationships <p>Customers agree that trust is a crucial aspect of their judgment when making a purchase. However, developing trust is not a process that any company can undertake overnight.</p><p>You allow new and existing clients to trust you when you create interactions with them. Unfortunately, if clients realize you’re not trustworthy, they’ll go to your competitors.</p><p>After all, consistency in offering value to customers is a major aspect of creating trust, so your business should be persistent in meeting customer needs. As previously said, continuously delivering on your marketing promise over time will influence whether or not your clients see your company as trustworthy.</p> 3. Improve your customer service department’s KPIs <p>Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are measurable benchmarks that show how well a company is able to meet corporate objectives. These criteria are necessary so that businesses can assess their progress in meeting&nbsp;targets.</p><p>KPIs can be thought of as a road map to your goals. They assist you in seeing what the future brings for your company and the path you should&nbsp;take.</p><p>Developing working KPIs for your customer service division quantifies a variety of criteria depending on your sector. However, they mostly involve response time, conversion rate, and funnel drop&nbsp;rate.</p><p>The results will astound you once you start measuring these KPIs. It will be easier to determine how to better engage customers and what actions must be&nbsp;taken.</p> 4. Make use of customer feedback&nbsp;surveys <p>Client feedback surveys may appear boring, and their response rate is not always high, yet they can offer you valuable customer input. It can be a great instrument for increasing customer interaction and driving business&nbsp;actions.</p><p>Hearing personally from clients about how they feel about your offerings is a terrific approach to strengthen the connections that already exist. When people are given the opportunity to communicate themselves, they share their thoughts and opinions about your&nbsp;brand.</p><p>It is critical not to frown when your consumers complain. Learn about their dissatisfaction and be perceptive enough to discover their pain points. Making changes in such areas will assist you in improving customer relationships.</p> 5. Develop real-time customer engagement protocols <p>One of the most renowned client retention tactics is to use real-time customer engagement solutions. Live sessions have been shown to have a significant influence on customer satisfaction, and quick response decreases the number of client touchpoints.</p><p>Some financial organizations, for example, have co-browsing and video chat solutions in place. Their primary objectives are to promote user involvement through internet banking activities and to provide a cutting-edge digital banking experience.</p><p>Face-to-face interactions also promote individualized conversations with customers. Interestingly, research has shown that video chat solutions also help anxieties and concerns settle faster, allowing you to develop personal and dependable relations with&nbsp;clients.</p> 6. Try to outperform your&nbsp;claims <p>The secret to not disappointing your customers is to under promise and over deliver. When you follow this approach, you are surpassing customer expectations, giving your company the opportunity to gain a more loyal customer&nbsp;base.</p><p>It is critical to keep your promises and to dare to exceed them. Never miss a chance to delight your consumers. Treat them as special individuals, and you will undoubtedly increase customer retention.</p><p>Be aware that the initial purchase of your product is a delicate stage. When they are disappointed, they can become hostile. So, something as easy as delivering your product a few days sooner than promised will make your consumer delighted.</p> 7. Make a schedule for customer interactions <p>You use a communication calendar to stay in touch with your consumers on a routine basis. Even if your clients do not provide feedback, your team should be assertive in interacting with&nbsp;them.</p><p>The calendar is essentially a pre-programmed series of phone calls, events, and so on. Through continuous contact and exchanges, it is expected that doubts will be removed, trust levels will be increased, and the consumer will be persuaded to&nbsp;return.</p><p>Luckily, you can now effortlessly automate frequent contacts with your consumers. There are various communication calendar solutions available online today that enable you to deliver unique offers and appreciation messages to customers on a certain schedule.</p> 8. Learn something from any customer complaint <p>Only bad business owners feel the urge to flee from complaining customers. If you want to be a successful businessman, you should go for these clients since they might be your most valuable marketing asset.</p><p>Complaints highlight what you should change and what you need to discard in your company. You may learn what your consumers care about and what they anticipate from your services by analyzing client complaints.</p><p>Some consumers leave without leaving a comment, which is bad for your business. Encourage people to share their concerns because this is how you learn about flaws in your products and services.</p> 9. Figure out the CLV of your&nbsp;business <p>Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is one of these critical key performance metrics that demonstrates the importance of your clients over time. For example, if you provide subscription-based online courses, your primary focus should be on each customer’s lifetime&nbsp;value.</p><p>Some of your consumers have contributed more than others. Those who consistently purchase your stuff should be considered VIP customers.</p><p>This is because they not only provide you with continuous income, but they are also the same clients who will promote your business to others. They tell their peers about their experience, which helps your brand’s credibility.</p> 10. Consistently deliver valuable information <p>Just because a customer has made a transaction with you does not suggest you should abandon your efforts to seal the deal. Because people have more alternatives than ever before, go the additional mile and provide them with something meaningful.</p><p>Education is one of the most significant services you can provide to your customers. The goal here is to advise and engage people until they are ready to buy your&nbsp;product.</p><p>It provides clients with knowledge and insights into the product to help them comprehend it. Once they become loyal, they can also turn into your brand advocates.</p> 11. Re-engage customers by leveraging automation technologies <p>It takes time to manually check and keep your consumers informed. There are numerous actions that must be performed daily to keep your brand relevant in the minds of your customers. This is where automation technology can come in&nbsp;handy.</p><p>They enable software to handle parts of your processes automatically. You may manage your customer contacts, continue giving education letters, schedule marketing offers, and send other notifications using automation.</p><p>Not only will you notice an improvement in conversion rate as you engage clients automatically, but you will also be able to form stronger ties. Moreover, making these processes more efficient will allow you to deliver on the promises you make to your&nbsp;clients.</p> 12. Monitor and evaluate churn&nbsp;metrics <p>Businesses that want to optimize retention efforts must understand how to analyze and measure churn data. You should be measuring and evaluating the number of consumers who churn as well as the reasons why they&nbsp;churn.</p><p>You can improve the customer experience by learning why consumers leave and how they leave. More importantly, it teaches you how to keep your current consumers from&nbsp;leaving.</p><p>Customer churn will come regardless of your best attempts. When this occurs, you should take advantage of the chance to investigate what you can do to prevent a comparable customer from leaving for the same reason in the&nbsp;future.</p> 13. Provide customized, one-of-a-kind services to loyal customers <p>Scientists believe that surprise is beneficial to the brain. It provides enjoyment and spice to one’s life. So, instead of waiting for your clients to make a request, go ahead and delight them with personalized service.</p><p>Unexpected offers can give your clients the impression that they are a part of something special. Therefore, if you want your clients to stick around and love your brand, you should go above and beyond the standard service that you&nbsp;provide.</p><p>A well-designed client retention campaign can be a fantastic idea. By rewarding your consumers with one-of-a-kind discounts and prizes, you make them feel good about their purchases and encourage them to&nbsp;return.</p> 14. Use newsletters to keep in touch with customers <p>Generating email newsletters is still the most effective client retention method. It is one of the most effective strategies to stay in touch with consumers and develop long-term connections with&nbsp;them.</p><p>It is essential to follow up with new clients and email subscribers after the initial interaction. If you want to cultivate client loyalty, you must keep your subscribers up to date on the latest and hottest information from your&nbsp;brand.</p><p>Email newsletters enable you to convey relevant information to your intended audience. You can categorize the list based on characteristics such as buying habits and age demographics, and then tailor the newsletter to each category.</p> 15. Create a community to improve customer interactions <p>Creating a forum on your webpage is an easy approach to fostering engagement and community. Having a forum allows your customers to discuss your products, services, and everything else about your&nbsp;brand.</p><p>One example of a very active platform used by store owners to communicate with customers is a discussion board. The platform allows users to post challenges, questions, and fresh ideas. This media can also be used to share information about new product features, promotions, and expansions.</p><p>You may even spice up the conversation by rewarding your most active users. This would encourage more active engagement, which would increase your customers’ loyalty to your&nbsp;brand.</p><p>Look around and you’ll find that prosperous digital companies got there not only because of their excellent services, but also because their customers collaborated. They employ community platforms to connect with customers, eventually transforming them into brand advocates.</p><p>However, you will almost certainly come across bad remarks or complaints. When you find one, don’t dismiss it; instead, confront it. Users will learn, respect, and trust your brand this&nbsp;way.</p> Conclusion <p>Now that you’re armed with a list full of useful retention management strategies, which would you go for first? There is no one-size-fits-all solution that will work for every business, but as long as you keep the customer’s interests in mind, they will&nbsp;return.</p><p>To proactively treat customers, you must provide excellent customer service and build interpersonal kindness. With well-designed client retention strategies, you will better understand your consumers’ needs and enhance&nbsp;loyalty.</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/customer-retention-management/">https://www.monetha.io</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re a long-time reader of this blog, you’ll know that Anonyome Labs supports the ongoing development of decentralized identity through:</p>



  Products&nbsp;– building decentralized identity capabilities in the&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>, which enterprises can leverage&nbsp;  Utilities&nbsp;– helping to run three decentralized identity-focused blockchains  Standards&nbsp;– being an active contributor to the decentralized identity standards area  Open Source&nbsp;– contributing source code back to the decentralized identity open source community.&nbsp;  



 Anonyome Labs supports decentralized identity blockchains 



<p>Anonyome’s is helping to run decentralized identity blockchains – the foundation for any decentralized identity-based applications.</p>



<p>Anonyome Labs became part of the Sovrin blockchain in 2019. Sovrin is a public utility blockchain for decentralized identity based on Hyperledger Indy technology. As a Founding Steward, Anonyome has run a validator node for Sovrin since its inception.</p>



<p>In 2020, Anonyome Labs was asked to help run the Indicio network. This is another Hyperledger Indy-based decentralized identity blockchain. Anonyome labs runs a validator node on the MainNet for Indicio.</p>



<p>In 2021, Anonyome Labs was approached to help run the cheqd network. This is a new decentralized identity network based on COSMOS/Tendermint. Anonyome runs validator nodes on both the MainNet and TestNet for cheqd. The most interesting aspect of the cheqd network is its introduction of a financial model and cheqd token.</p>



 We participate in standards groups 



<p>Decentralized identity is an evolving area that has a strong focus on producing standards. These standards will ensure that Anonyome Labs’ decentralized identity software is interoperable with the standardized decentralized identity software created by other vendors. At Anonyome Labs we contribute to various decentralized identity standards efforts:</p>



<p>Sovrin&nbsp;is a public foundation for looking after the Sovrin network – the only public utility for decentralized identity based on Hyperledger Indy. Anonyome Labs is a contributor to the Technical Governance Board and the Stewards Council.&nbsp;</p>



<p>HyperLedger&nbsp;is part of the Linux Foundation and focuses on standards around blockchains. The decentralized identity based Hyperledger Indy, Aries and Ursa projects are hosted at Hyperledger. Anonyome Labs contributes to the Aries Working Group.</p>



<p>Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)&nbsp;is home to many working groups that provide both standards documentation and code prototypes through GitHub:</p>



  identifiers and discovery  DID authentication  claims and credentials  DID communication  Sidetree  secure data storage  Keri  wallet security  applied crypto.  



<p>Anonyome Labs is co-chair of the DID Communication (i.e., DIDComm) working group and is a member of the DIF Technical Steering Committee.</p>



<p>Trust Over IP (ToIP)&nbsp;is also part of the Linux Foundation. It bring together the disparate standards into a comprehensive technical and governance model. Anonyome Labs is part of the Steering Committee and the Technology Stack Working Group.</p>



<p>W3C&nbsp;is the home of the decentralized identity identifier (DID) and verifiable credentials standards. This is probably the most-high profile of the standards groups. Anonyome Labs closely follows the work of both these groups.</p>



 We contribute to decentralized open source communities 



<p>Anonyome Labs contributes back to the open source community by providing source code, bug fixes, and to the core ACA-PY: Aries Cloud Agent – Python service. This is a cloud agent that provides verifiable credentials issuer and verifier capabilities, endorser (capability to write to various blockchains), and more.</p>

<p>As you’d be aware, two of the most widely discussed software/service requirements are&nbsp;security&nbsp;and&nbsp;interoperability. Whether it be for user-level data protection or government-mandated legislative compliance, enterprises require innovative security solutions that help them meet emerging threats.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Decentralized security solutions are built on security and privacy-focused paradigms, such as Ann Cavoukian’s&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/how-we-apply-the-7-principles-of-privacy-by-design/">Privacy By Design</a>, which emphasize end-to-end encryption, least privileges (for data access), etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interoperability has also become a business necessity. While email is a ubiquitous interoperable standard, the more recent secure encrypted messaging systems have emerged as single company controlled “walled gardens” that create vendor lock-in rather than introducing new types of interoperable service offerings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The standardized decentralized identity service offerings will enable business to attain both strong security and cross-platform interoperability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve previously&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/07/the-business-benefits-from-using-decentralized-identity-technologies-for-customer-identity-management/">noted</a>&nbsp;on this blog that businesses that seize the opportunity to implement emerging standardized decentralized Identity technologies will create a long-term competitive advantage that will enable them to get ahead of the competition and maintain these advantages far into the future.</p>



<p>For proactive organizations, decentralized identity technologies will:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  reduce the need for centralized databases (and the data items they contain) to the absolute minimum (e.g. for regulatory purposes) and thus give customers complete control and ownership over their personal data&nbsp;&nbsp;  reduce vulnerability to data misuse by those charged with managing it, and to cyberattacks, fraud and other financial crimes&nbsp;  make customers’ lives easier by eliminating passwords for login and ongoing authentication&nbsp;  generate unprecedented levels of human trust between the organization and its customers and partners&nbsp;&nbsp;  reduce the compliance burden of managing customers’ personal data in services&nbsp;  allow participation in an open, trustworthy, interoperable, and standards-based identity management ecosystem&nbsp;&nbsp;  enable exciting new business alliances within which partners can communicate and exchange information securely to deliver services (e.g. in medical or education).&nbsp;  



<p>As we said at the start of this article series, Big Tech is scooping up users’ digital exhaust like candy and using it to generate massive profits. Big Data analytics technology is being used to commercialize knowledge of user behavior and influence their digital activities. The privacy crisis is real.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">Consumers want a solution</a>&nbsp;– and businesses, largely due to regulatory requirements, also want to increase user privacy and protect data entrusted to them by their customers. As businesses provide customers with innovative privacy-preserving solutions, customers will reward them with their loyalty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We believe the solution lies in returning control over personal information back to users through digital identities and decentralized identity technologies – the future of privacy and identity management on the internet.</p>



<p>Building on the Sudo digital identity and the Sudo Platform privacy and cyber safety capabilities – which contain integrated decentralized identity enhancements – enterprises can rapidly develop and deploy branded privacy and cyber safety solutions to their customers and create a significant competitive advantage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Talk to us about how we can help you.</p>



<p>Next week, in the final part of this series, we’ll explain how we are actively contributing to decentralized identity development.</p>

				 <p>By Kim Ebert</p>
<p>Identity has to be mobile. It makes no sense to talk about verifying and sharing data if you can’t do either through a mobile device. But this simple requirement can be a technical challenge when, as with mobile devices, IP addresses aren’t permanent. </p>
<p>This is why you need a Mediator Agent. A Mediator Agent provides a cloud-based connection point that will hold and receive messages for Mobile Agents. <br></p>
<p>Given how critical mediation is to decentralized identity adoption, Indicio <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-tech-advances-decentralized-identity-with-release-of-critical-open-source-technology/">built</a> on the work of the open-source community to make mediation interoperable and vendor agnostic. We developed a robust Mediator Agent and contributed it to Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py) and the Aries Toolbox. </p>
<p>As a result, mediation can be managed and debugged through ACA-Py’s built-in Admin REST API.</p>
<p>But we also host a <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-public-mediator-2/">public version</a> on the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-networks/">Indicio Network</a>, our Hyperledger Indy-based global network for decentralized identity.</p>
<p>Use the Indicio’s free hosted Mediator Agent for testing <br>If you’re building solutions that need a Mediator Agent, you can use Indicio’s hosted version for testing, development, and demonstrations. </p>
<p>This will shorten the time to develop proof-of-concept and pilot solutions and help with ensuring interoperability. You can access the Indicio-hosted Public Test Mediator Agent <a href="https://indicio-tech.github.io/mediator/">here.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also run a Mediator Agent Training <a href="https://indicio.tech/product/mediator-agent-training/">workshop</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mediation doesn’t have to be a struggle<br>We know mediation is a concern, and we know some have struggled with it; but it’s a problem that has been solved. The Hyperledger Aries Mediator Agent works—try it, use it, and if you have any questions, <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">we’re here to help</a>.</p>

<p>“Hybrid” is everywhere today, whether it’s vehicles, work or infrastructure deployment – you can’t help noticing the rise of hybrid. Identity and Access Management (IAM) deployments are no different, but why is hybrid cloud and on-premises important for IAM, and when might you need it? In this blog we’ll take a brief look at these questions and give you our view on the state of IAM deployments today and where hybrid is heading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The paths to hybrid 
<p>We’ve all got a pretty good idea of what we mean when we talk about a hybrid ‘thing’: a system that uses different (heterogenous) parts, a mixture of various items. Less immediately obvious is that we have two paths to transitioning to hybrid.</p>
<p>The first path is an evolutionary one, where new, different parts are added as part of a longer roadmap to achieve a specific end-state. A good example here is hybrid vehicles. Originally, internal combustion engines were the main power source. The value of electric power was easily recognised but battery technology lacked the convenience of ‘wet fuel’, so the hybrid vehicle was born. As battery technology improved, pure electric vehicles became more common. Here, hybrid is an evolutionary steppingstone.</p>
<p>The second path is a symbiotic one, where two differing things/approaches are combined to deliver a better, broader outcome. Let’s take the work example. Pre-pandemic, we had a global ‘in-office’ culture. Corporations would give many reasons for employees to be present, on-site each day. Then the pandemic hit. As a result, organisations were forced to transition to a home working approach. With the slow return to ‘normal’, it has become clear to many organisations that there are significant benefits (as well as some challenges) to various aspects of home working, and so are now adopting a hybrid approach to maximise the benefits of both options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Hybrid IT deployments 
<p>The world of IT and infrastructure is no different to any other eco-system. The common element is the variety of systems and deployment models that exist.</p>
<p>Cloud deployments models are the norm, with many systems being consumed ‘as a Service/aaS’. Cloud deployments effectively outsource the physical infrastructure issues, and the ‘aaS’ layer further outsources the management and maintenance of the platforms. Combined, IaaS, PaaS and SaaS have massively lowered deployment costs and time to ‘live’.</p>
<p>Whilst the benefits of cloud deployments are well understood, there still exist disparate cloud platforms and legacy systems that are fundamental to the complete business needs.</p>
<p>From an evolutionary point of view, the majority of business began with on-premises platforms and, over time, replaced many of their systems with cloud-based platforms. The interim, and even final state in many cases, is hybrid combining multi-cloud and on-premises systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Hybrid IAM 
<p>The IAM platform is no different to any other IT platform. IAM is commonly found at the core of Zero Trust initiatives and underpinning workforce and customer access to various systems. It is the breadth of integrations that shape the deployment models selected for an IAM platform.</p>
<p>Some IAM vendors offer IDaaS (Identity as a Service), with the IAM capabilities delivered as a service from a cloud. Some offer on-premises in the customers data centre. And some, such as Ubisecure, offer both options.</p>
<p>We’ve already acknowledged that ‘aaS’ brings efficiency and timeliness, so why would an organisation want to continue with on-premises? The answer tends to fall into one of three categories:</p>
 
 Security 
 Regulation 
 Legacy 
 
<p>The security category is always one up for debate. However there are organisations, typically governments and very large enterprises that, by policy, require deployments on-premises in their data centres, managed by their staff.</p>
<p>Regulation, typically national ‘data residency’ based, can require user attributes and data to be hosted in the user’s home country. Of course, this does not preclude a cloud deployment in that country, but there could be circumstances where that is not the most viable solution and so an on-prem solution is implemented.</p>
<p>Legacy integration can impact many architectures. And if the user directory itself originates from an on-prem legacy system, the IAM platform will have to be closely coupled to that system.</p>
<p>Hybrid solutions – a combination of cloud and on-prem components – can provide an effective architecture to the above situations. Placing the majority of the IAM features in the cloud and connecting to an on-prem IdP (user directory) can realise the benefits of both deployment models.</p>
<p>For organisations with multiple identity sources, using a cloud IAM deployment as a central brokering/integration point can simplify integration. This model also applies to multi-national companies operating across data residency boundaries (for example, EU-Russia-China-Brazil).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Some examples of hybrid IAM 
<p>We have written previously about <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/customer-iam/ciam-mergers-acquisitions/" title="the value of IAM for assisting integration following M&amp;A activity">the value of IAM for assisting integration following M&amp;A activity</a>. Running an evolutionary hybrid model that connects the various identity sources from the acquisitions provides an efficient mechanism to perform initial technical integration. With a suitable cloud deployed, fine grained access management platform, such as Ubisecure IDaaS, disparate systems can be quickly connected and securely accessed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>From a regulatory perspective, we need to be mindful of data storage vs data processing. An experienced Data Protection Officer is a must these days. However, the ability to connect a number of separate identity stores, manage the identities locally whilst managing the stores centrally, and provide a single standards compliant interface to the various relying parties within the organisation’s IT domain, delivers substantial savings to the organisation.</p>
<p>A typical example of this is a large multi-national with employees or customers spread over multiple regions with differing data residency requirements. Deploying local user directories, aggregated and accessed via a cloud deployment, provides a hybrid mechanism to centralise capability whilst distributing user data.</p>
<p>Finally, the ability to integrate user directories from legacy systems, often with non-standards-based interfaces, is key to an organisation’s evolution. Using a cloud-based IAM platform that supports custom interfaces with standard protocols like <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/authentication/open-id-connect-ciba/" title="CIBA">CIBA</a> provides a lower risk alternative to a big bang replacement project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Ubisecure IDaaS 
<p>The Ubisecure IAM platform is available as IDaaS and on-premises from a single core set of software. The IAM platform caters for all of the above scenarios and can be connected to third party on-prem systems, or even deployed as on-prem software, to encapsulate various use cases whilst still providing relying party connectivity via the cloud instance.

  <p>I recently got back from a series of events filled with lots of interesting discussions around various OAuth-related topics. At the official IETF meeting in Vienna back in March, I presented the latest work on OAuth 2.1 and we discussed and made progress on some of the current open issues. At the OAuth Security Workshop a few weeks later, I presented a session on client authentication for mobile apps, and there were many more presentations on a huge variety of topics. Many of us went straight from there to the European Identity and Cloud Conference to continue those discussions the next week.</p>

<p>One recurring theme that came up across the series of events concerned the idea of OAuth client impersonation and authentication.</p>

 What is OAuth client impersonation? 

<p>In short, OAuth client impersonation is when one OAuth client pretends to be another, usually to take advantage of any capabilities that the legitimate client may have that are not granted to other clients.</p>

<p>In OAuth terminology, a “Confidential Client” is an application that is issued credentials by the authorization server and can use these credentials to authenticate itself to the OAuth server when doing things like requesting access tokens. The credential can be a simple client secret or a more secure option such as a private key used to sign a JWT. The benefit of using client authentication of any sort, assuming the client properly protects its credentials, is that the OAuth server knows that any requests made with those credentials are from the legitimate client, and client impersonation isn’t possible.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a “Public Client” is an application that doesn’t have credentials, hence cannot prove its own identity when contacting the authorization server for tasks such as requesting access tokens. Usually this is because it would be impossible to deploy such an application with credentials in a way that would remain secret. Common examples of public clients are single-page apps and mobile/desktop apps. In both cases, if you were to try to include a client secret in the app, it would be possible for anyone to extract the secret, which means it would no longer be secret. For this reason, it has always been the case that OAuth flows for public clients are done with entirely public information.</p>

<p>Originally, the Implicit flow was recommended for both SPAs and mobile apps. Proof Key for Code Exchange (also known as PKCE) was later introduced as an additional security feature for the authorization code flow, primarily targeted at mobile apps. As browsers evolved, it eventually became possible to do the authorization code flow with PKCE from single-page apps as well. The current draft of the OAuth Security Best Current Practice deprecates the use of the Implicit flow, and recommends using PKCE for both SPAs and mobile apps, as well as web server applications. That said, this recommendation has nothing to do with client impersonation. PKCE solves a number of different attacks, and even solves attacks that are still possible with a client secret, but it is not a form of client authentication so it doesn’t solve client impersonation attacks for public clients.</p>

<p>For public clients, both the Implicit flow and Authorization Code flow with PKCE are done with only the publicly-known information about the client: the <code>client_id</code> and <code>redirect_uri</code>. Since there is no client authentication used, it is possible for anyone to take that information and pretend to be that client by doing an OAuth flow that looks identical to the real app.</p>

 Should I be worried about client impersonation? 

<p>Maybe and maybe not! Whether client impersonation can be used for any ill purpose depends on how you treat OAuth clients in your system. Many companies aren’t concerned with this problem at all. There are plenty of situations where being able to impersonate a client doesn’t actually benefit an attacker at all.</p>

<p>Let’s take a closer look at some of the things an attacker might be interested in doing if client impersonation is possible.</p>

<p>The authorization server is where all the decisions around issuing tokens are made, things like how long tokens should last and what claims should be added to a token. Sometimes these decisions involve policies that depend on the identity of the client application that will be receiving the access token. If an attacker impersonates a valid client, the authorization server would be using the policies of the valid client for the requests coming from the attacker’s client.</p>

 Bypassing the consent screen 

<p>One example is the decision of whether or not to show a consent screen to inform the user of which application they are logging in to. For third-party apps, the consent screen is a critical part of the flow, communicating which app is requesting access to the user’s account and what information will be shared with the app. For first-party apps, where the app is the same brand as the data being accessed, it doesn’t necessarily make sense to ask the user for this permission. It would be awkward, for example, if the Twitter app asked you for permission to access your Twitter data. For this reason, many companies want to bypass the consent screen for first-party apps. With this policy in place, and with public clients, impersonating a first-party app means bypassing the consent screen and immediately issuing tokens to the impersonating application.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This accomplishes basically nothing if you do this to your own account on your own device, but is potentially more interesting if you can accomplish this on someone else’s device.</p>

<p>A typical sequence when logging in to an application is to click the “log in” button, enter your credentials, be prompted with a consent screen, and be redirected back to the application.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The authorization server may choose to skip the credential prompt if the user is already logged in. The authorization server may also choose to skip the consent screen if the user has already consented to this application before or for first-party apps. In that case, the redirect would be immediate, which is good for user experience, but bad if client impersonation is possible. Again, this isn’t a concern for confidential clients since client impersonation isn’t a concern if the client can authenticate. But for public clients, since the OAuth flow is done with only public information, client impersonation is definitely possible. That said, the original OAuth 2.0 specification actually calls this out explicitly in the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-10.2">Security Considerations Section 10.2</a>. The recommended mitigation from the original spec is to require redirect URL registration and to avoid skipping the consent screen. This gives the end user a chance to spot any attempts at tricking them into authorizing a malicious application.</p>

 Gaining privileged API access 

<p>Some services may restrict certain APIs for use only by specific clients. If the service has some APIs that should only be called from a particular mobile app, the service may want to reject requests made from other apps that are accessing other parts of the system. Additionally, some services may set different API rate limits for different clients depending on the trust level of the developer or whether the client is a first-party or third-party client.</p>

<p>In order to do this, the API needs to know which client an access token was issued to. Typically, the authorization server will embed the application’s client_id in one of the claims of the access token. In this way, the client_id is accessible to the API when it validates the token. Of course, this information is only as good as the authorization server’s confidence that it was really that app making the token request. Again, if the client can authenticate itself, then this is reasonably reliable. But for public clients, there is much less certainty.</p>

<p>Keep privileged access in mind when you’re building APIs that limit features based on the application.</p>

 Frequently asked questions 

<p>With these concerns in mind, let’s answer a few quick questions about OAuth client impersonation.</p>

 Is client impersonation a new problem? 

<p>Not at all! In fact, client impersonation <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-10.2">was mentioned in the original OAuth 2.0 spec</a> RFC 6749 in 2012! The next year, the “Threat Model and Security Considerations” document was finished and became RFC 6819. This document has <a>a large section</a> dedicated to the topic of client impersonation. That section is worth a read for more information on various ways to mitigate this risk.</p>

 Is client impersonation a problem unique to OAuth? 

<p>Client impersonation is relevant to OAuth for the reasons previously mentioned, but those issues may also be relevant to systems that don’t use OAuth at all.</p>

<p>This is a pervasive problem with mobile app games. Let’s take a simple example of building a leaderboard service for a mobile game application. For the sake of the example, let’s assume the app doesn’t have any concept of user accounts, and wants to show a high score leaderboard in the game from all users of the app worldwide. In order for the game server to collect the high score data, it provides an API endpoint that the game can report scores to. The API would like to only accept POST requests from real instances of the game app, and not people who are trying to cheat and send fake scores to the API.</p>

<p>Without the support of the mobile operating system, there’s nothing in the API call that can authenticate the mobile app, since any HTTP request the app makes would be possible for anyone to mimic outside of the application.</p>

 Does PKCE solve client impersonation? 

<p>Nope! This is a common point of confusion, likely because of how PKCE was originally developed and rolled out. PKCE was originally described as a way for a mobile app to do the authorization code flow safely. But keep in mind this was back in 2015 when mobile apps were still advised to use the Implicit flow or the authorization code flow without credentials.</p>

<p>Despite PKCE being originally described as a technique for mobile apps, it is not an alternative to client authentication and doesn’t ever attempt to pretend it is. PKCE prevents a few specific attacks, mainly authorization code interception and authorization code injection. And interestingly, authorization code injection is also possible even if the app does use a client secret or other client authentication. That’s the reason PKCE is now recommended for all types of OAuth clients, regardless of whether they are a mobile app, a SPA, or a server-side app with credentials.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, PKCE is not a form of client authentication, so it doesn’t solve the client impersonation problem. PKCE is still a good idea to use since it prevents other notable attacks.</p>

 Are there any solutions for client impersonation? 

<p>As of today, there aren’t any reliable mechanisms for authenticating pure SPA clients in a browser. Anything the browser can do can be mimicked outside the browser. Google Chrome even has a developer tool that lets you copy any request the browser makes as a cURL command to be replayed on the command line.</p>

<p>For mobile apps, there is more hope. Apple has an API known as “App Attestation”, and Google has a similar API called “Google Play Integrity”. Both APIs work similarly, with a few technical differences. At a high level, both of them involve the application making a request to the operating system to sign some data. Then the app includes that signed string in the call it makes to the developer’s API. The API can validate the signature against the public key from Apple and Google to determine its confidence level that the API request is made from a real version of the mobile app.</p>

<p>The intent of these mobile operating system APIs is to give the developer a way for a web service to validate that a request is being made on a non-jailbroken device with a legitimate app store instance of an application. Interestingly, in both cases, Apple and Google have specific language in the documentation that suggests these should be used as hints, but not guarantees, of app integrity.</p>

 Does the BFF pattern solve client impersonation? 

<p>The BFF pattern, short for “backend for frontend”, is the idea of running a backend service to supplement a single-page application. There are multiple variations of how this can be deployed, some of which are documented in the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-browser-based-apps#section-6">OAuth for Browser-Based Apps</a> draft specification.</p>

<p>The key difference this makes with regard to OAuth client impersonation is that your backend can be the OAuth client and can use client authentication. If the backend holds the tokens without sending them to the SPA at all, then the tokens can never leak to an impersonating application. While this might sound good at first, your backend has no assurances that any requests made to it are from the legitimate SPA, so the problem is only half solved. This does makes the problem less severe, since someone trying to take advantage of client impersonation wouldn’t be able to actually get the access token itself, but would only be able to trick the backend into making API requests with that access token.</p>

 Future solutions for client impersonation 

<p>I mentioned this had been a recurring theme in the recent discussions within the OAuth community at the last several events. I presented a session about client impersonation specifically in mobile apps at the <a href="https://oauth.secworkshop.events/osw2022">OAuth Security Workshop</a>. The session wasn’t recorded, but <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/aaronpk/app-integrity-attestations-for-oauth-oauth-security-workshop-2022">I posted the slides here</a>. In that session, I suggested the idea of leveraging Apple and Google’s app attestation APIs as a form of client authentication. In a side discussion after the talk, we heard from a group who had actually implemented that for a client recently, which was a nice  validation of the concept. Separately, George Fletcher <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5063/2">presented a session at EIC 2022</a> the following week about nearly the same topic! I’m glad to see this recognized as a need for mobile apps.</p>

<p>As far as browsers go, I think we’re farther off in finding a similar solution, since browsers don’t have the same level of tie-in with the operating system that mobile apps do. With the advent of modern browser APIs like WebCrypto and WebAuthn, it’s possible we may see something similar in the future.</p>

<p>Is client impersonation something you should be concerned about? It really depends on your situation, in particular whether you have any policies in place that treat particular public clients differently from others.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>Today, Microsoft announced a new name for their identity product family which encompasses familiar capabilities alongside new capability launches. Microsoft Entra covers identity, including Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), Permissions Management, and Verified ID.</p>
<p>Azure AD is a familiar offering and will remain available stand-alone. But it is now accompanied by a Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM) offering and a decentralized identity offering.</p>
<p>At first glance, Microsoft Entra Permissions Management has a smattering of interesting functionality like visibility on permissions across cloud environments including AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure. It works to counteract permissions sprawl, enforce the least privilege, monitor and detect anomalies. For more information on CIEM, read this edition of the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/ashford/navigator-ciem">KC Navigator</a>.</p>
<p>Verified ID is Microsoft’s implementation of Verifiable Credentials, a standard for issuing and verifying decentralized identity credentials. This allows identity credentials to be issued by identity providers (IdPs) outside of an organization’s ecosystem, and still be accepted with confidence and verifiability – hence the name. Verified ID serves some interesting use cases such as remote onboarding, secure access, and streamlined account recovery. It will be generally available in August 2022. For more in-depth reading on verified identity, read this <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/mc80521/providers-of-verified-identity">Market Compass</a> and be on the lookout for the update in Summer 2022.</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra also includes an administrative portal, available as of today. Existing portals are still accessible, and the transition to this new portal may be done at will.</p>
<p>Takeaways</p>
<p>The change of branding on existing capabilities is indicative of the importance Microsoft is giving to new capability launches, like those of Verified ID and Permissions Management; they carry the theme of “securing access to everything for everyone”. Verified ID allows enterprises to handle identities from external identity providers (IdPs) while still maintaining trust in the individual, embracing the “everyone” while Permissions Management spans the “everything” of multi-cloud.</p>
<p>This launch is cognizant of the changing security and collaborative environment, where identity plays a major role in facilitating secure and smooth interactions.</p>

 Considering all the issues that the proposed EU-wide law on virtual assets will present, it would have been better to regulate virtual assets under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) framework, essentially considering them as financial instruments. <blockquote>Key Takeaways</blockquote><blockquote>- The Luna-UST debacle has led to increasing calls for regulating the nascent digital assets industry globally.</blockquote><blockquote>- Today, the European Union’s “Markets in Crypto-assets Regulations” draft is among the most comprehensive regulatory frameworks. It aims to put an end to the free-run enjoyed by digital assets industry in the political and economic union of 27 countries.</blockquote><blockquote>- Despite what experts may say, the EU’s “Markets in Crypto-assets Regulations” is far from perfect. For instance, if the proposed law comes into effect, it will ensure that the only digital assets available in the European Union are the ones that have received authorization from relevant authorities.</blockquote><p>Amid the current crypto market turmoil in the face of the unraveling global economic crisis and the LUNA-UST debacle, the need for strong regulatory measures is being felt globally.</p><p>At the same time, keeping in mind the growing demand for virtual assets, the European Union will soon be releasing a concrete framework around digital assets. Now, some in the crypto regulatory circles view it as much needed exercise to prevent unscrupulous elements from exploiting the nascent industry. Yet, the reality is altogether different.</p><p>In fact, the proposed law is far from being a remedy to bring virtual assets under the regulatory net. For instance, under the proposed rule, the only virtual assets that can be offered to investors in the European Union are the ones that have received permission from relevant authorities in the European Union member&nbsp;states.</p><p>Thus, Bitcoin, Binance Coin, Ethereum, and some of the top-most virtual assets may have to apply for authorization if the proposed bill receives a green light in the EU. Another thing to consider here is that many crypto founders have chosen to remain anonymous, such as Satoshi Nakamoto of Bitcoin. So, who will apply for EU authorization in such cases? Will Satoshi Nakamoto apply for the approval? Well, there are bleak chances of it. Mutual recognition of virtual assets across jurisdictions, too, is out of the question, as governments’ view on digital assets varies drastically worldwide.</p><p>Then there is the issue regarding supervisory authority, which is too tangled to differentiate the role of regulatory bodies within the member states and the EU-wide authorities. Such is the extent of complexity of the proposed law that launching a virtual asset exchange is far easier than launching a traditional exchange governed under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) framework.</p><p>Less said, the better when it comes to the rules around market manipulation and insider trading of digital assets. The truth is that the rules are not comparable to the current EU rules. Among all these issues, the most affected party will be none other than the consumer, as they will be the ones receiving the shorthand of the&nbsp;stick.</p><p>Considering all the issues that the proposed EU-wide law on virtual assets will present, it would have been better to regulate virtual assets under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) framework, essentially considering them as financial instruments.</p><p>All in all, crypto businesses must comply with the stringent requirements that traditional financial institutions and companies already comply with. Anything less is unacceptable for the greater good of the nascent virtual assets ecosystem.</p><p>There is no doubt doing so will draw complaints from crypto asset companies saying that such measures would throttle the industry’s growth. But why should regulators cut them any&nbsp;slack!</p><p>That said, virtual asset service providers have nothing to worry about. Shyft knew the day would come when VASPs would have to comply with regulations. Thus, we have developed solutions to smoothen the transition from “No Compliance” to “Full Compliance” for VASPs. Shyft’s Veriscope, for example, makes it easy to comply with FATF’s Travel Rule. It is also the only official solution against the much-dreaded “Sunrise Issue” that VASPs face while complying with the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>So, visit our website to know more about <a href="https://www.veriscope.network/">Veriscope </a>and learn how it can enable your company to stay compliant.

Rapid digitalization to re-capture post-pandemic growth coupled with an uncertain geopolitical climate requires security leaders to rethink their cybersecurity strategy. Despite the increased in cybersecurity spend, businesses continue to fall prey to cyberattacks. To stay ahead of cybercriminals, “knowing the enemy and knowing yourself” is key to building effective defenses. Organizations must have full visibility to their external threat landscape and be aware of potential attacks targeting them. This predictive capability allows organizations to focus on the biggest risks and avert the most damaging fallout.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the first installment of We Are Mastercard, a series of blog posts highlighting the fintech innovators behind our platform. Mastercard’s open banking solutions are powered by thousands of connections to financial institutions, layers upon layers of security and groundbreaking artificial intelligence-driven analytics.</p>
<p>However, what truly sets our technology apart is the people who create it, like Rachel Burnett. She’s a software engineer at Finicity, a Mastercard company, and a 2020 graduate of the University of Utah.</p>
 What’s your position at Finicity? And what are your responsibilities? 
<p>I’m a software engineer on the Connect services team. We support Finicity Connect, an application that allows users to connect to their bank and pull their financial data.</p>
<p>My team manages a service that maintains and serves financial institution data. Everything from the physical location of the institution to the routing number, branding files and a lot more. We store that information and then serve that up to Connect.</p>
<p>One of the major challenges is how to make the users’ flow in Connect as efficient and successful as possible. Another challenge is market expansion, looking at how we’re moving our products and services into different countries.</p>
 How does Finicity give you the resources to solve those problems? 
 <p>Teddy frequently reviews Rachel’s code while she’s working from home.</p> 
<p>As an early career software engineer, I have a passion for technology and am always looking to learn and grow as much as possible by reading about new technologies or practicing coding languages I might not use regularly.</p>
<p>Every other Friday afternoon, we have “innovation time,” where we have the freedom to research or play around with side projects to grow and practice our skills as software engineers. It’s awesome that we can have that freedom and flexibility to work on those skills and learn more. I feel like I’ve grown a lot since I’ve been here.</p>
 What’s the culture like on your team? 
<p>I have really great teammates who have a lot more experience than me. They’re incredibly knowledgeable. And they’ve been incredibly patient and generous in sharing their expertise and helping me with problems along the way. They are such a valuable resource. Just being able to Slack them questions or ask them to pair-program with me has been incredibly helpful.</p>
<p>On our team, you’re not expected to have everything perfect the first time. Teammates offer to do code reviews, help you test across environments, and genuinely want you to succeed because that’s what will make the team succeed.</p>
 How does your team exemplify Mastercard values? 
<p>Ownership is really important and something that our team really values—making sure that our code is thoroughly tested and that we hold each other accountable with code reviews as a team, together. We make sure that we ask the right questions to verify that there aren’t any gaps and that we’ve thought about the different use cases and scenarios.</p>
<p>Even if something seems trivial, we take accountability so that we can see it all the way through to how it might affect the end user.</p>
 What does working at Finicity enable you to do in your spare time? 
 <p>One of Rachel’s hobbies is hiking with Hazel on mountain trails just minutes away from Finicity’s headquarters in Murray, Utah.</p> 
<p>My dog loves hiking, so that’s always fun. Just spending time with friends and family, camping, that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>We have a good work-life balance for sure. If we ever need to take time off to recharge or go see family outside of Utah or anything like that, we’re definitely supported and encouraged to do so.</p>
 Why should someone consider joining the Mastercard open banking team? 
<p>I think it’s really exciting to be working in an industry that is so important. I mean, it’s awesome to see the impact of the work you do because banking has a place in all of our lives. That’s exciting.</p>
<p>Also, Mastercard has awesome values and we have great benefits. We have 5 paid volunteer days per year, “work from anywhere” days and <a href="http://mastercard.us/en-us/vision/who-we-are/careers/life-at-mastercard.html">the Mastercard Cares program</a>. It’s a great company that really cares about the employee and the individual. You know, they want to see us succeed and be happy. And then, on top of that, I think it’s fun and engaging work.</p>

 Why Implement Biometric MFA? 
<p>We are all aware of the risks associated with password-based authentication. The proof is in the seemingly endless list of password-based breaches that we see in the news every day. Some companies have attempted to mitigate password risks by adding two-factor authentication (2FA), pesky one-time codes sent via email or text.</p>
<p>The truth is, if you authenticate users who access your systems by way of username-password combinations, even if enhanced by so-called 2FA or MFA methods, then you could improve security a lot, reduce user friction, and cut operating expenses by implementing a biometrics-based solution.</p>
<p>While some solutions claim to solve these problems, many are only exchanging the password for FaceID/TouchID. These legacy apps fail to do the one thing that they are supposed to do – prove who the user is.</p>
<p>Imagine if you could prove each user’s identity every time they logged into a resource. That makes all of the other pillars much easier.</p>
<p>1Kosmos offers identity based Zero Trust- with real biometrics and cryptographic proof of possession and audit.</p>
 Identity Is One of the 6 Pillars of Zero Trust 
<p>Take this diagram:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Other solutions base the “binding” on a username and password exchange which can be done by anyone. This is a problem because when an issue like a lost phone occurs, other solutions fall back to a username, password, 2FA as the bootstrapping process to re-enroll. What do you think the bad guys are going to do with this recovery process? That’s right, exploit it.</p>
 How Does 1Kosmos Prove Identity? 
<p>When a user downloads the BlockID app and enrolls, they will take a live selfie – This is part of our LiveID. Then, we ask the user for that selfie and compare it to their photo in government issued documents like a passport or a driver’s license. 1Kosmos matches the selfie with the documents, and gives the user a digital certificate that verifies their identity and it binds the account to the proven identity. When users authenticate through LiveID we compare the live selfie with the one taken at enrollment to prove identity and grant access.</p>
<p>To summarize, proving identity and reaching Zero Trust requires one platform that<br>
1)&nbsp; Establishes user-controlled identity<br>
2) Proves authentication with that previously established identity</p>
<p>There are two standards for identity and authentication: NIST 800-63-3 for ID enrollment and strong ID usage, and FIDO2 for passwordless. No platform besides BlockID has combined both of these into one experience. When done right, this single experience can replace many legacy processes and provide a seamless user experience.</p>
<p>In addition to <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/trust-registry/trust-status-list/#full-services">NIST 800-63-3</a> and <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/company/1kosmos/">FIDO</a>, BlockID’s live biometrics are <a href="https://www.ibeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1Kosmos-Biometric-Subsystem-Certification-Report-V2.0-1.pdf">iBeta</a> certified which validates the reliability of BlockID for accurately performing live biometrics for identity proofing.</p>

 Following the merger with ARIADNEXT, the joint group reports a successful first quarter 



<p></p>



<p>Munich, May 31th, 2022,&nbsp;IDnow group, a leading European provider of&nbsp;&nbsp;identity proofing and document signing, reports&nbsp;a rising demand for the joint portfolio in the first quarter of 2022. The company has confirmed an increase in order intake by 95%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By offering the broadest portfolio in Europe via a single platform, the IDnow group is at the forefront of current market trends: the acceleration of advanced digital business models has led to a shift in demand, from single-product identity verification towards more comprehensive identity proofing and document signing platforms such as IDnow’s.</p>



<p>Andreas Bodczek, CEO at IDnow, comments: “By combining IDnow, ARIADNEXT and IdentityTM, the IDnow group has emerged as one of the strongest players in Europe as we offer business customers a range of solutions for various use cases and jurisdictions, all from a single source. This is reflected in both our financial performance as well as in our order book. Following a string of M&amp;A transactions over the last 18 months, I am excited to see the company off to a flying start into its first year as a consolidated group and am looking forward to continued joint success.”</p>



<p>The group’s automated identity verification solution has also had a strong first quarter, with an increase in revenue of 134%. Automated identity verification has been a key trend in Europe for some time and it is receiving regulatory approval for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) use cases in an increasing number of European countries. The revenue growth for IDnow’s automated solution is expected to continue, as the group forecasts an 80% increase of order intake.</p>



<p>IDnow group has made a series of senior hires across Europe to support the company’s rapid growth. Mario Fassbender has joined as Vice President Marketing while Stefan Kauhaus has been recruited as Director Product Management Digital Identity. Mike Kiely has also joined IDnow’s UK team as Head of Financial Services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the second half of 2022, IDnow is looking to expand the platform for identity proofing with additional services. The group is anticipating further certifications to be granted in its role as a remote identification service provider. The group’s automated and expert-assisted solution&nbsp;in the French market are ready to receive a ‘prestataire de vérification d’identité à distance’ (PVID) certificate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, the group anticipates entry into the Romanian market with the Authority of Digitization of Romania (ADR) certification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow group’s automated solution, coupled with a Qualified Electronic Signature (QES), already offers a global solution for remote onboarding for industries under AML regulation.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p> Pathlock’s acquisition tour is changing the market dynamics 
<p>A few days ago, Pathlock, one of the leading providers in the market for <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/ashford/navigator-access-controls-for-business-applications">Access Control &amp; Risk Management for Business Applications</a>, has announced a merger with Appsian and Security Weaver, and the acquisition of CSI Tools and SAST Solutions. With that, five of the vendors in this market segment, become one. In our recent <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80517/access-control-solutions-for-sap-and-other-business-applications">Leadership Compass on Access Control Solutions for SAP and other LoB (Line of Business) Applications</a>, we had covered overall 23 vendors. With five of these merging into one, it becomes apparent that this step of Pathlock will change the dynamics in this market segment.</p>
<p>The market segment contains solutions that help organizations in analyzing and managing the access controls and access risks in business applications such as ERP solutions. This includes managing entitlements and roles, defining and managing SoD (Segregation of Duties) controls, managing privileged access such as emergency access, and other capabilities.</p>
 Relevant players in the market 
<p>Pathlock, which also received a funding in the $200m range, is building on its already strong position in this market and becomes one of the largest players serving this market segment. Aside of Pathlock, there is SAP, which is starting to serve not only the SAP domain, but also other solutions with its Cloud IAG (Identity Access Governance) offering. SAP still has a dominant role in SAP-centric environments. Pathlock, on the other hand, offers both depth for SAP environments as well as breadth for multi-vendor environments, including business applications delivered as SaaS.</p>
<p>When it comes to breadth in coverage of applications, two other large players in this market are SailPoint and Saviynt, both having their roots in IGA (Identity Governance &amp; Administration). SailPoint has acquired ERP Maestro, another specialist vendor for Access Control &amp; Risk Management for Business Applications, back in 2021, while Saviynt has focused on own capabilities in this area from the start of the company. Several other IGA vendors such as One Identity, IBM, or EmpowerID, to name just a few, also come with a good level of support for access controls management in business applications.</p>
<p></p>
 Market evolves out of a niche into a larger market segment 
<p>It will be interesting to observe how fast Pathlock manages the organizational and technical integration of all the entities that now come together, with technologies ranging from ABAP-based solutions to SaaS platforms. However, taking the breadth and depth of the combined capabilities, Pathlock surely is a vendor that must be evaluated when looking for solutions to manage access controls and access risk in business applications, be it in the SAP domain or in a heterogeneous multi-vendor environment.</p>
<p>With this acquisition, the recent ERP Maestro acquisition by SailPoint, and the investments of SAP into their Cloud IAG offering, this market is clearly evolving out of a niche into a larger market segment.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Warwick Ashford</a></p><p>In the digital era, being able to manage and control access to services, data and other resources by employees, partners, customers, and devices (things) is extremely important, and a key element of that is identity. Having a comprehensive Identity and Access Management (IAM) capability, therefore, is essential for any modern business.</p>
<p>In fact, the management of identities and permissions in digital transformation is the key to security, privacy, compliance, governance, and audit, as well as system usability and user satisfaction. Traditional IAM systems meet only a fraction of current requirements, and therefore a new, modern approach is necessary.</p>
<p>At KuppingerCole, we believe that the best approach to enabling a comprehensive, IAM capability for the digital era is to build it on a modern, modular architecture that supports an integrated set of Identity Services that deliver the capabilities required for providing seamless, controlled, and secure access for everyone and everything from anywhere to every service.</p>
<p>Because this model of IAM involves the combination of multiple isolated but corresponding elements that are “woven” into an integrated, seamless whole, we use the shorthand term of “Identity Fabrics” when talking about this paradigm for architecting IAM within enterprises to deliver the full range of identity services required by an organization.</p>
<p>The Identity Fabrics concept is aimed at enabling access for all, from anywhere to any service, while integrating advanced features such as support for adaptive authentication, auditing capabilities, comprehensive federation of services, and dynamic authorization.</p>
<p>Most organizations using the Identity Fabric paradigm tend to build on a strong core platform for delivering major features and complementing this with other solutions. These core platforms typically deliver a broad range of IAM capabilities, including a good level in both Identity Governance and Administration, and Access Management by providing a comprehensive set of APIs for consuming these services.</p>
<p>Core platforms that support the Identity Fabric paradigm should deliver these capabilities in a modern architecture, using microservices architectures and container-based deployments. They should also support different deployment models and all types of identities, including employees, partners, customers, devices, and services.</p>
<p>In building an IAM capability that is fit for doing business in the digital era, enterprises need to deploy solutions that not only deliver functionality and support for all types of identities, but also meet the requirements of the Identity Fabric paradigm regarding the architecture, deployment model, and interoperability with traditional applications, cloud services, and new digital services.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The market for Identity Fabrics is evolving quickly. The number of vendors has grown significantly, as well as the maturity of solutions. However, the market is still not at the level of maturity as IGA or Access Management, for example. Positively, we observe significant innovation happening in this market segment.</p>
<p>— Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst, KuppingerCole Analysts.</p>

<p>All of our shopping habits revolve around convenience. Consumer spending has shifted dramatically due to considerable changes in living, working, and learning settings. Everything is done via online shopping, from buying groceries to toilet paper to apparel and health care products.</p><p>The average person buys year-round but by spending less each time. People are getting less loyal to individual stores, with<a href="https://www.chainstoreage.com/heres-how-shopping-habits-are-changing#:~:text=But%2062%25%20of%20them%20said,week%20and%2017%25%20they%20are"> 65%</a> admitting that if their favorite brands are sold out or low in stock, they will buy the next best alternative.</p><p>As a result, retailers need to rethink their tactics to adapt to changing consumer behavior, expectations, and shopping&nbsp;habits.</p><p>If you adapt quickly to new market trends while staying relevant to your audience, your company will likely be one of the first to take advantage of the online shoppers’ demands and&nbsp;needs.</p><p>People are ready to spend-let us learn how to target shoppers to your sites instead of your competitors.</p> 1. Online sales are increasing <p>Online shopping has become more popular than ever before. People can purchase quality goods and get value for money (more discounts on online shopping platforms than in-store shopping channels) and from the convenience of their homes. And the attention spans of online shoppers are getting shorter. So, suppose you possess an ecommerce business and want consumers to buy from you, you must be able to instantly capture their attention-and make the purchasing experience enjoyable and straightforward.</p><p>Here’s how you can do&nbsp;it:</p>  Ensure your website is compatible with both desktop and mobile app versions and has adequate speed and fast&nbsp;loading.  Remember that a good photo is worth a thousand words (and maybe a thousand dollars).  When it comes to content, keep in mind that less is often&nbsp;more.  Include feedback from consumers.  Catalog and categorize your merchandise and make the user interface easily navigable.  Tell shoppers if an item is in stock or when it will be back-ordered on the product&nbsp;page.  Make it simple for customers to get in touch with you or subscribe to your email&nbsp;list.  Allow consumers to save their carts and make checking out straightforward.  As long as you can afford it, provide free shipping.   2. But physical retail is still important <p>While online shopping is becoming more popular, in-store shopping still appeals to customers. According to research, most customers <a href="https://www.chainstoreage.com/heres-how-shopping-habits-are-changing">(88%)</a> still do their grocery shopping in&nbsp;stores.</p><p>As a result, merchants that have physical storefronts shall continue to invest in there for the following reasons:</p>  Consumers who pick up their orders in a store often purchase additional things.  A product that a customer has seen in person is more likely to be purchased. This can also lessen the likelihood of a product being returned due to size, color, or other&nbsp;issues.  Personalized customer experience promotes&nbsp;sales.  A physical store gives you a chance to create a memorable brand experience.  By observing people buy and engage with the space and items, retailers may gain free market research about their preferences and habits (you can<a href="https://www.verfacto.com/blog/behavioral-data/real-time-customer-profiler/"> analyze customer behavior in online shops</a>&nbsp;too).  Online retailers receive more traffic from physical&nbsp;stores.   3. Users want more flexibility and&nbsp;control <p>According to research, online consumers also demand complete freedom and control over when and how their packages are delivered. It also revealed that consumers have strong opinions on delivery costs and timelines. They also demand more efficient services and the option to follow their online orders and packages throughout the delivery&nbsp;process.</p><p>To keep up and compete in a world where the competition is fierce, and the stakes are high, online retailers must genuinely comprehend the ever-changing face of the buyer and must constantly develop their strategy.</p> 4. Mobile-first is here to&nbsp;stay <p>The way we shop on the internet is evolving. Smartphone sales have risen considerably, indicating that customers are adjusting to the connectedness that their cell phones&nbsp;provide.</p><p>Furthermore, search engines favor mobile websites, with Google’s mobile-first index demonstrating their popularity. Google considers the speed of sites to be one of the most crucial factors for ranking. Image dimensions, file sizes, and site code scripts can significantly slow down websites; therefore, a mobile audit is worthwhile.</p><p>If it isn’t already, your website should be mobile-friendly to make it as simple as possible for clients to purchase things with a smartphone tap.</p> 5. Voice search is important <p>Smart speakers and voice searches on smartphones have quickly become a must-have accessory. According to reports, <a href="https://ng.oberlo.com/blog/voice-search-statistics#:~:text=Summary%3A%20Voice%20Search%20Statistics,-Here%27s%20a%20summary&amp;text=40.2%20percent%20of%20the%20United,consumers%20owned%20a%20smart%20speaker.">135.6 million</a> individuals in the United States now utilize voice search&nbsp;tools.</p><p>Voice searches are inclusive and allow those with visual impairment to better access your platforms and make purchases, thus increasing your sales and popularity among online shoppers.</p><p>Optimizing your Google My Business listing for location and hours of operation responds to frequently asked questions like “where is the nearest spa?” and helps people find&nbsp;you.</p> 6. Customer loyalty is&nbsp;evolving <p>According to <a href="https://fitsmallbusiness.com/online-shopping-statistics/">statistics</a>, 263 million Americans (or 80% of the population) enjoy shopping online. 55% of internet users prefer to shop online, and 80% shop at least once a month. This goes on to illustrate how vital convenience and comfort are to consumers. If loyalty marketing isn’t already part of your strategy, here are some pointers to help you get&nbsp;started:</p>  Learn everything you can about your consumers in their environment: It has become more vital than ever to have the data and resources you need to listen, engage, and provide a valuable experience to your customers.  Consistency and authenticity inspire client trust: Authenticity breeds confidence. People are drawn to brands that have a unique story to tell. Every interaction with your customer should be consistent in tone and significance.  Don’t be scared to become emotional: It’s crucial to remember that emotions significantly impact purchasing decisions. If marketers can master the art of telling emotional tales, they can transform ordinary customers into loyal customers.  Make everything seem effortless: It’s all in the details. It’s not just about pleasing your consumers; it’s also about making it easier for them to solve a&nbsp;problem.   7. AI, AR, and VR will impact how people&nbsp;shop <p>Mintel, a market research firm, predicted that virtual and augmented reality technologies would permeate our homes, affecting how we shop, the brands we prefer,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Consider the impact that technology can have on purchasing habits if you consider the possibility of obtaining your things via drone rather than the good old parcel delivery driver. AI-powered chatbots promote a better consumer experience and help provide intelligent suggestions to end-users based on their browsing experience and past purchases.</p> 8. Users want instant customer&nbsp;support <p>Consumers don’t require go-betweens to help them with simple functions in the self-service internet age. People have come to anticipate self-service, and if you allow them to get to the point where they need to contact you, you’ve stifled usage and adoption. Here are some suggestions for how to improve your customer service strategy:</p>  Ascertain that your squad has the necessary equipment: When it comes to providing exceptional customer service, dedicated CRM software is typically the best&nbsp;option.  Provide self-service support: Most consumers want to be able to fix most problems on their&nbsp;own.  Ensure you have a knowledge base with solutions to frequently asked questions and how-to articles that walk clients through the procedures necessary to address common&nbsp;issues.  Optimize your content for search engines to simplify end-users to locate solutions to their questions.  Patience, alertness, the ability to communicate properly, a willingness to learn, and empathy are all essential qualities to look for when hiring customer support personnel.  Responding to inquiries in time is important.  Make it simple for consumers to reach you by placing your contact information in strategic locations throughout your&nbsp;website.   9. Customers are using social media to&nbsp;purchase <p>There are now tons of alternatives for purchasing items online via social media. Small businesses especially use social media for marketing their products. Affiliate and influencer marketing help drive sales among their followers.</p><p>When consumers were questioned, “Have you ever bought something directly from a social media platform?” Approximately 55 percent of consumers affirmed that they had bought products on at least one of these platforms:</p>  Facebook Shops: Facebook Shops allows admins of business pages to create a “Shop” with a list of products or product collections. Social media helps create brand loyalty and even established brands and new brands see huge revenue being generated from their social media&nbsp;pages.  Instagram: To take advantage of Instagram shops, simply connect your online shopping site and Instagram Business pages. You may also use the Instagram Shoppable Posts functionality to link your Instagram feed posts and photographs to the product’s Instagram Checkout page. You can use Instagram tools like Instagram Stories, Instagram Live, and Instagram Reels to promote your brand’s offerings.  WhatsApp: As WhatsApp keeps expanding its business features, it’s worth keeping an eye on if you’re looking to build a chat-based community while also generating social&nbsp;revenue.  Pinterest: Pinterest is used by many audiences to develop inspiration boards with products or items they might want to buy. Pinterest data also suggests that visitors enjoy searching for and learning about things on the&nbsp;site.   Conclusion <p>Online buying habits are constantly changing and evolving. Retailers are striving to keep up and anticipate buyers’ behavior. Consumers are spoilt for choice, switching from one merchant to the next at the touch of a&nbsp;button.</p><p>To keep up and prosper in a world where the competition is fierce, and the stakes are high, everyone has to be constantly on their toes to survive, from big box retailers like Walmart and Target to new-age startups.</p><p>Companies can break through the noise and foster loyalty, engagement, and trust by providing extraordinary client experiences.</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/ecommerce/shopping-habits/">https://www.monetha.io</a>.</p>

<p>Una nuova importante certificazione per il mondo dei servizi fiduciari si va ad aggiungere alle altre conseguite negli anni da InfoCert, a conferma del ruolo di European Champion of Digital Trust.</p>



<p>InfoCert, infatti, ha recentemente ottenuto da AgID il riconoscimento di Provider dei servizi di: “Convalida Qualificato di Firma Elettronica Qualificata e Sigillo Elettronico Qualificato” (Qualified validation service for qualified electronic signature, Qualified validation service for qualified electronic seal).</p>



<p>Si tratta di una certificazione di recente introduzione, nata per rispondere ad una necessità del mercato di garantire a grandi organizzazioni (principalmente governi centrali, pubblica amministrazione e aziende operanti nell’ecosistema bancario) di poter verificare con assoluta certezza la validità e l’integrità di una firma apposta su un contratto o un documento, sia che essa sia stata apposta da una persona fisica (QESig) che da un ente (QESeal).</p>



 InfoCert sempre più European Champion of Digital Trust 



<p>Grazie a questo nuovo riconoscimento, aziende e pubbliche amministrazioni in Europa potranno facilmente integrare questa nuova soluzione completamente basata su API, ed affidarsi ancora una volta al più grande QTSP in Europa.</p>



<p>Il servizio di validazione delle firme è da sempre parte del portfolio dei servizi InfoCert, e finora era disponibile all’interno di GoSign Desktop, l’applicazione di firma più utilizzata in Italia: chiunque poteva caricare in GoSign un documento firmato e verificarne la validità, sia in Italia che in uno dei paesi europei dove il certificato veniva emesso.</p>



<p>Oggi tale servizio, certificato da Agid, diventa <a href="https://developers.infocert.digital/signature-validation/">disponibile anche via API</a> e i clienti InfoCert avranno l’opportunità di integrare lo step di convalida delle firme e sigilli in modo automatico all’interno dei propri processi di business.&nbsp; Tale verifica è effettuata in tempo reale e consente di validare i file firmati in qualunque formato, come ad esempio PDF, P7M, XML e JSON.</p>

 The Perils of Pre-Copernican Data&nbsp;Strategy <p>It’s an oft-told story but it has a new relevance. Back in the middle ages, people believed that the earth was the centre of the universe so that everything else, including the sun, circled round it. When they tried to track the movement of the planets through the sky they were presented with a puzzle. The planets’ motions didn’t represent a simple orbit. At certain times, they seemed to go into reverse, creating a complex jungle of ‘epicycles’ that astronomers struggled to explain. Their mappings of the movement of the planets, as seen from the earth, are shown on the left hand side of Figure 1. An extremely complex picture that is very hard to&nbsp;fathom.</p><p>Then came Nicolaus Copernicus. He said the sun was the centre of our universe, and that the earth orbited the sun. A simple switch of perspective — from earth-centric to sun-centric — created the enormously simplified picture of the planet’s movements shown in the right hand side of the&nbsp;figure.</p>Figure 1. Pre- and Post-Copernican views of the planets’ movements<p>Today, something similar is happening with data sharing. Back in the days before Copernicus, ‘everyone’ including the great, the good, the clever and the powerful, ‘just knew’ that the earth was the centre of the universe and that everything else, including the sun, revolved around it. Today, ‘everyone’ including powerful actors and decision-makers like the UK Government ‘just know’ that organisations are the centre of the personal data universe, and that everyone else including citizens revolves around these organisations.</p><p>That’s why the UK Government is <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/one-leap-forward-46b8b9942fe5">pressing ahead with organisation-centric plans</a> for the future of data sharing. Plans that, if implemented, will create a picture far more complicated than that shown on the left hand side of the illustration; a complexity catastrophe on multiple fronts: costs, data security, interoperability, governance and&nbsp;trust.</p> The complexity catastrophe <p>Let’s take a look at how this data sharing complexity catastrophe will&nbsp;unfold.</p><p>There are basically two ways to share personal data. The first is an ‘organisation-centric’ one: direct from organisation to organisation, with the data never being handled by the citizen the data relates&nbsp;to.</p><p>The second is a person centric one, where organisations deposit copies of details they hold about people in their personal data store, so that the citizen can forward share this data as and when&nbsp;needed.</p>Figure 2: Different models of data&nbsp;sharing<p>What is the difference between the two? If you look at Figure 2, which shows how the two models work, you may not think there is much difference. On the left hand side, if there are three organisations involved in data sharing, three connections between them are required: one each to the other two.&nbsp;Simple!</p><p>The person-centric approach to data sharing shown on the right hand of the diagram also requires three connections. But why bother adding a completely new entity — the citizen’s personal data store — into the equation? Doesn’t that just add cost and complexity?</p>Figure 3: What happens as data sharing&nbsp;scales<p>Now take a look at Figure 3, which shows what happens if eight organisations are now sharing an individual’s data. On the organisation-centric left hand side, the number of connections has grown to 28, whereas if the data is shared via the individual’s personal data store, the number of connections has grown to just eight. Instead of each organisation having to connect with every other organisation involved in data sharing (who they have never done business with before), the person-centric approach only requires one connection per organisation — with the citizen’s personal data store. This connection is with somebody they already have a relationship with: the&nbsp;citizen.</p><p>Figure 3 three shows that as the organisation-to-organisation approach to data sharing scales, its complexity grows exponentially. And data sharing between eight organisations is just beginning.</p><p>How many Government services currently collect and use personal data? Well, you can get to a list of eight very quickly. How about DVLA (driving licence data), the Passport Authority, the Money and Pensions Service, the Disclosure and Barring Service, the Department of Work and Pensions, HMRC (tax data), the Ministry of Justice (for services such as Lasting Powers of Attorney), the Home Office (residency and citizen status). That’s eight. Without drawing a breath. And without even thinking about all the different parts of the National Health Service, care services, local authorities, and education authorities that also collect and use citizens’ data. And completely ignoring the third and private&nbsp;sectors.</p>Figure 4: The complexity catastrophe sets&nbsp;in<p>If we take the number of organisations involved in sharing data about individuals to fifty, the number of connections now needed by the organisation-centric approach rises to 1225. (See Figure 4) Whereas, if the data is shared via the individual’s personal data store, it rises to 50 — still tracking the number of organisations involved.</p><p>Which sort of system do we want to create? The organisation-centric approach to data sharing which creates a picture of pre-Copernican complexity or the person-centric approach which creates a picture of post-Copernican simplicity?</p><p>Perhaps pre-Copernican complexity would be justifiable if it brought tremendous benefits while the person-centric approach brought tremendous risks and harms. But the opposite is&nbsp;true.</p> Where the catastrophes lie <p>The pre-Copernican organisation-centric approach to data sharing doesn’t create just one complexity catastrophe. It creates many, involving costs, security, interoperability, governance and&nbsp;trust.</p><p>Costs Let’s assume for the sake of argument that the costs of an organisation sharing data with another organisation and with an individual’s personal data store are the same. (As we show below, this is a bad assumption to make, because the costs of sharing data between organisations is actually much higher.) But keeping to that assumption for a moment, if 50 organisations are sharing data under the pre-Copernican approach, with the exponential rise in connections involved total costs across the system are around 25 times higher than with the person-centric approach. That’s because each organisation has to manage dealings with 49 other organisations instead of having to deal with just one other organisation — the personal data store provider.</p><p>Security The databases of organisations like the Department of Work and Pensions and Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs Service (taxes) were designed to operate like moated and walled data castles, working on the principle of perimeter-based protection. They were designed to keep outsiders out. Rightly so. They were designed to protect the data of the people inside: citizens.</p><p>But with data sharing, organisations have to open their systems up — and the greater the number of connections they create, the greater the security risks. Once they are sharing data with 50 or more other organisations, their carefully built castle walls begin to look like a piece of Swiss gouda cheese: full of holes. But when sharing data with a personal data store, they only have to create one carefully managed and scrutinised API connection with the PDS platform.</p><p>Interoperability Because of the way our data systems have evolved, every organisation has its own, different software systems, formats, languages, standards and so on. For one organisation to become adept at sharing data with 49 other organisations it needs to become an expert not only at its own data systems but with 49 other organisations’ systems&nbsp;too.</p><p>It’s not going to happen. And if it does, it’s going to be extremely costly and time-consuming. That’s because this interoperability problem doesn’t have to be solved just once. Each of the 50 organisations involved in data sharing has to solve it again, for themselves, separately and independently — reinventing the same wheel 50 times over, once again multiplying total system costs many times&nbsp;over.</p><p>Whereas, when sharing data with a personal data store, the organisation hardly has to think about software systems, formats, languages and standards at all. That’s because it simply shares the data using the systems it already has. It is then up to the personal data store provider to manage these interoperability challenges. The big benefit here is that the PDS provider only has to solve these problems once for the solution to work with all 50 organisations.</p><p>Governance Who decides what data should be shared with who, for what purposes? Under the <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/one-leap-forward-46b8b9942fe5">Government’s current proposals</a> this is left down to ‘senior leaders’ (e.g. civil servants) within Government departments. Will these ‘senior leaders’ ask citizens if they want their data to be shared? If not, what right do they have to make the decision?</p><p>With PDS-based data sharing, most requests for data to be shared come directly from individuals seeking to access or use a service. The governance, consents and permissions challenges of data sharing are addressed almost automatically as a by-product of the&nbsp;process.</p><p>Trust For all of these reasons, the pre-Copernican approach to the sharing of personal data is highly likely to generate its own knock-on trust catastrophe. But that’s just the beginning. Under the current system, when individuals share data with an organisation, they have at least some idea of what data they are sharing with who, for what purposes (unless something underhanded, devious and illegal is going&nbsp;on).</p><p>With the pre-Copernican organisation-to-organisation approach to data sharing, it becomes practically impossible for citizens to keep track of who has access to their data, for what purposes. The ideal of citizens being able to exercise control over their data becomes practically impossible and goes out of the window. Whereas, with a personal data store, citizens are provided with their own consents and permissions dashboard which enables them to see everyone they have shared what data with for what purposes, and can exercise control (changing these consents and permissions) easily, from within this dashboard.</p> Less than half the&nbsp;picture <p>The above analysis of pre- and post-Copernican data sharing only addresses operational issues. They are less than half the picture. The organisation-centric approach focuses only on what organisations need to do with personal data they hold. It ignores the challenges facing citizens when applying for, accessing and using services — challenges which personal data stores address by making citizens’ data available to citizens themselves.</p><p>It also ignores the immense potential benefits of making citizens the point of integration of data about themselves. What would happen if 50 or more different organisations each deposited data they hold about the citizen in that citizen’s personal data store? A totally new-to-the-world personal data asset would be created: one which starts to generate a complete picture of that individual. These new personal data assets could become the engines of most if not all data-driven innovation of the future — a driver of economic&nbsp;growth.</p><p>But if Government persists in its organisation-centric approach to data sharing, this opportunity will never be created because their data will remain dispersed across multiple service providers.</p> Conclusion <p>In machine learning, deep assumptions such as ‘the sun orbits the earth’ or ‘organisations are the only entities that collect and use personal data’ are commonly called ‘priors’. A prior is an initial set of beliefs that people bring with them to the experiences and challenges that they face. They are the lenses through which we see the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Pre-Copernican astronomers studied the workings of the heavens as closely as those that came after them. But because it never entered their heads that the earth might orbit the sun, every conclusion they drew was wrong. Today’s data strategies and policies are being made by a Government with the wrong, pre-Copernican prior belief that organisations are the centre of the personal data universe. As a result its policies are way off the&nbsp;mark.</p><p>Organisations are not the centre of the personal data universe. Citizens are. If Government put citizens at the centre of its data policies, the simplicity and power of the post-Copernican perspective would shine through everything it&nbsp;did.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-perils-of-pre-copernican-data-strategy-974827845585">The Perils of Pre-Copernican data strategy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 One leap forward&nbsp;… <p>The UK Government has just published a landmark policy on data sharing. It represents a breakthrough in thinking, policy and strategy. Not just a step forward, but a genuine leap&nbsp;forward.</p><p>At the same time however, Its new <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-sharing-governance-framework/data-sharing-governance-framework">Data Sharing Governance Framework</a> is badly bungled. So badly bungled that, if implemented as it stands, it would actually result in three leaps back. Fortunately, this damaging outcome can be&nbsp;avoided.</p> The positive&nbsp;bit <p>The genuine leap forward is that the Government has, at last, recognised that a personal data ecosystem based solely on different, separate organisations each collecting and using data for their own purposes, in isolation to one another, guarantees that the full potential of this data will never be unleashed. It has recognised that we need to move from an outdated ‘One User, One Use’ approach to personal data to a <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/how-to-unleash-the-full-potential-of-data-3676db8d7c03">‘Many Users, Many Uses’ approach</a>.</p><p>Some passages in the Framework couldn’t be better written. Here’s an&nbsp;example:</p><blockquote>“Data is essential to delivering good public services, developing and evaluating policy, and a wide range of government operations. The data needed to do this well is often held in different parts of government and needs to be shared so that it can be used&nbsp;… clear and common governance standards are needed to deliver data to the right place at the right&nbsp;time.”</blockquote><p>Clear, simple and absolutely spot on (as far as it&nbsp;goes).</p><p>The Framework also introduces a series of practical measures that are essential if data sharing is to be improved. These include organisations committing to developing data sharing strategies (instead of ignoring the issue as most have done until now), making it easy to start data sharing (by providing a first point of contact for example), building data inventories so that others can see what sorts of data you are holding, and developing common standards so that data sharing is made&nbsp;easier.</p><p>In our own work for the Scottish Government, on its <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/How_data_portablility_can_transform_public_services/How_data_portability_can_transform_public_services_Smart_Entitlements_Overview.pdf">strategy for Smart Entitlements</a>, we recommended the same sets of measures. So far, so&nbsp;good.</p> Three leaps&nbsp;back <p>The three leaps backwards are as follows. First, the Government’s vision of data sharing is purely inter-organisational. Personal data held by one organisation will be shared with another organisation without any citizen involvement. At first glance, direct organisation-to-organisation data sharing might seem sensible. But it’s not. It’s a recipe for a cost, complexity, security and trust catastrophe.</p><p>That’s because, in any system of organisation-to-organisation data sharing, as more organisations take part, the number of connections that are needed between them rises exponentially. If just three organisations are involved, data sharing between them requires just three connections. That’s manageable. If 8 organisations are involved, the number of connections jumps to 28. If 50 organisations are involved, the number of connections that are needed jumps to 1,225. Completely unmanageable. <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-perils-of-pre-copernican-data-strategy-974827845585">This blog</a> outlines the logic and the risks of inter-organisational data&nbsp;sharing.</p><p>If the UK Government continues with this approach, it will quickly discover that as it attempts to make it scale it runs into a nightmarish thicket of complexity. We’ll be publishing a White Paper on this and the design requirements of a positive way forward in the next few&nbsp;weeks.</p><p>Second, the Framework does not mention citizen consent. It does say that Government departments should comply with data protection regulations. But what it doesn’t say is that with its ‘bold’ plans to reform these regulations, it intends to all but <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/data-a-new-direction-but-which-direction-da547b886ac0">abolish citizen’s rights</a> to be asked for consent before their data is shared. If the Government’s plans for data protection reform go through, it’s not even clear that citizens would even be informed that their data is now being shared willy-nilly across Government departments. This is a recipe for a catastrophic loss of&nbsp;trust.</p><p>Third, the Framework is silent about the actual purposes for which citizens’ data should be shared. The Government says civil servants working for Government departments should “make sure that you are sharing data responsibly” but (as with its proposals in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/data-a-new-direction-but-which-direction-da547b886ac0">Data: A New Direction</a>) it never defines what ‘responsibly’ might mean. In doing so, it places 100% of the burden of deciding what is ‘responsible’ on ‘senior leaders’ in Government departments. Civil servants. That’s not fair and is a recipe for ducking, diving and confusion.</p> A better way&nbsp;forward <p>There is a simple way for the UK Government to preserve its genuine leap forward without also making three leaps back — and that is to organise data sharing via the citizen whose data it&nbsp;is.</p><p>If Government shared the data it holds about citizens with these citizens by placing their data in citizens’ own independent personal data&nbsp;stores:</p>  the cost, complexity and security catastrophe created by inter-organisational data sharing would be&nbsp;avoided  citizens would remain in control of who they share their data with (thus enhancing rather than destroying trust)  citizens could decide what purposes they want to put their data to (thus taking the burden of making these decisions off civil servants in Government departments).  <p>This is the approach already embedded in the Scottish Government’s planned Scottish Attribute Provider Service — which represents a genuine leap forward without any of the drawbacks. As it stands, the UK is in danger of turning what could have been a genuine breakthrough into a damaging&nbsp;debacle.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/one-leap-forward-46b8b9942fe5">One leap forward&nbsp;…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 New technical capabilities allow influencers and communities to turn social tokens from one-dimensional curiosities into widely usable currencies carrying reliable real world value, that are far better positioned to capture additional value for their issuers and others through building substantial and automated economies centered around the&nbsp;token.   social tokens offer the promise of branded digital currency that allows creators to capture the value created by their community  in the first generation of social tokens, technical features are one-dimensional, allowing for sending back and forth and to be included in liquidity pools like Uniswap — they can be related, with hard work, to off-chain economic activity but have no on-chain economics — actual value is aspirational, not provable, reliable or predictable  social tokens hold promise but have yet to really take off like they should — leading platforms require programming or a permissioned facilitator, have limited capabilities — there’s no long tail&nbsp;activity  additional capabilities and low-cost permissionless, easy launches will unleash potential — built-in direct liquidity, stable and predictable values, attached namespaces to create a full spectrum digital goods economy centered on the token; real value creation that is direct and measurable through directly connected on-chain economic activity like nfts, fan profiles, memorabilia, tickets, discount codes, coupons, log-in unlock, etc; measurable economic activity with clear results attracts speculators who can measure and predict engagement that inevitably leads to real&nbsp;value  the Verus project, in non-stop development for five years, has built-in blockchain primitives that make these capabilities a reality now, offering more functionality, to more people — smart contract platforms cannot match these capabilities today absent an enormous engineering effort in bringing together multiple interoperating complex smart contracts  additional capabilities include privacy enhancement, moral hazard resistance, easy group&nbsp;dynamics  provable decentralized bridges to ethereum give the best of both worlds — intelligent next generation social tokens that can also emerge automatically, without programming, as&nbsp;ERC-20s  experiments to prove these concepts require no programming, are risk-free and extremely low cost — core protocols exist now, tooling and apps still require build-out in a collective effort   Social Tokens — the&nbsp;Promise <p>Googling the term “social tokens” brings a host of articles discussing socal tokens as the next big thing. The idea has been around for a while since ERC-20s mainstreamed the idea of token creation riding on top of a base layer blockchain. Creating digital scarcity and expressing that as a transferable token was now possible without creating an independent blockchain; it could be done at relatively low cost and with low maintenance. Soon, people began thinking about tokens where an influencer, brand or community creates a branded token, pre-mines a little bit of it, gets their fan-base/customers/community to transact in it and, presto, the token will start to gain a little bit of&nbsp;value.</p> The First Generation <p>Early market leaders soon arrived, such as <a href="https://tryroll.com/">tryroll.com</a> and <a href="http://rally.io/">rally.io</a>. These platforms are well-funded venture businesses that managed to onboard perhaps thousands of creators into their own social tokens. Despite some fanfare though, there’s not much to these tokens other&nbsp;than</p>  enforced digital scarcity — they help creators create and issue ERC-20s (or Solana now, for Rally), helping them through what is an otherwise arduous process requiring some&nbsp;skill  automated market making — they help set up Uniswap-like liquidity provision, but to gain actual liquidity creators must, in the words of the Roll website: “encourage their communities to contribute liquidity”  handing creators a roadmap and examples to “build value” — this generally involves activities, services or products that creators will offer to their fans so that they can get their communities to buy the token and then trade the token for these goods — the idea is to generate real-world demand for the&nbsp;tokens  <p>On the roll website, this last concept is pitched as: “After minting, you determine all the ways your token will be distributed and used across platforms, closing the loop that gives your social token its own independent value and starts your social token economy.”. But, as described in <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/09/the-social-token-network-rally-friends-with-benefits-and-the-future-of-branding/">this article</a>, “I discovered that it’s just a sh**tload of work to keep a token&nbsp;going”.</p><p>The end result is that value in social tokens remains fleeting or aspirational. Liquidity through liquidity provision in automated market makers can be a big problem. For a liquidity provider, risks are high, probably untenable since impermanent loss risk in an AMM with a fragile token approaches 100%. It turns out that liquidity provision in this context is a wholly altruistic activity, or worse, done by people who are unaware of the enormous risks. WIth minimal liquidity provision comes little market depth and unstable&nbsp;value.</p><p>Also, value for the token is tightly locked to a creator’s ongoing real world efforts to provide experiences, or events, or products, in order to drive continuous demand for the currency. There are no automated economic activities. If the creator’s activity stalls, or dries up, the token will lose value rapidly. Predictably, the vast bulk of these currencies peter out, and are forgotten, living on as zombie ERC-20s on ethereum.</p> No Long&nbsp;Tail <p>Anyone that’s really interested in creating a social token is met with an odd reality in the “decentralized” blockchain world. Both Roll and Rally, the social token leaders, require creators to go through a detailed application process, and then wait for approval. The Rally website says they’re looking for: “1) Evidence of a significant community size,&nbsp;… 2) Evidence of current transaction activity within your community&nbsp;… 3) Evidence that you have strongly considered the role that a social token economy would play in your ongoing projects.” Creators then wait for a review before being approved. Roll’s business model is to take a portion of the creator’s token for themselves. Rally’s is a little more sophisticated, attempting to have value created in their own token and sidechain in the&nbsp;process.</p><p>This makes sense for Roll and Rally because there is significant engineering and other work required to get the contracts up and running that define the social token and provide it liquidity. Creators who want to “do it themselves” are met with an arduous and limiting process — essentially, they need to be decent developers to get their tokens going. And to do all that for a one-dimensional token that can only be sent back and forth or placed in an AMM seems to be an unattractive proposition.</p><p>The result is that social tokens have yet to fulfill their promise. There’s no easy way for just anyone to do permissionless experiments at little cost, and little risk. And, when they do experiment, there is only the hope that by tying real world activities to their token, they might generate some value there, at least while they continue to offer those activities. This purported value is difficult to measure, and tough to capture, and exhausting to maintain. So there’s no real innovation and no “long tail” that allows unexpected modes of organization and value creation to&nbsp;emerge.</p> New Capabilities <p>What would it look like if there were new capabilities around social tokens? What are some of these, and how would they function?</p><p>Easy launch — low cost, permissionless, easy launch through point and click or simple commands. This would lower barriers and allow for just anyone to try out social token experiments. The law of large numbers tells us that some would stumble into real success, perhaps in ways, and through methods, we don’t yet understand.</p><p>Built-in Direct Liquidity — five years ago, the Bancor project pioneered <a href="https://blog.bancor.network/smart-tokens-101-63edc2cc5a89">smart tokens</a>, which they called “money that holds money”. Bancor seems to have abandoned this concept in favor of competing with Uniswap, but the idea has real merit. A social token with this property would not need an automated marketmaker to be able to be a liquid token. Instead, users could convert into and out of the token directly, after first being “seeded” by the founder. This eliminates liquidity provider risk — and, in essence, every single holder of the token ends up providing liquidity, automatically. This leads to more market depth, and thus more stability and predictability in value. The fact that each token is “money that holds money” leads to provable value, and these tokens will be treated with care, as near money. Another result of this capability is that social tokens would have dynamic supply, where more tokens are automatically minted in response to increasing demand, and burned if the demand reverses.</p><p>Attached Namespaces — tokens have names, of course. If these are cryptographically unique names (like, for example, crypto addresses), they can be the root of a namespace. ERC-20 names are not unique and so cannot be namespace roots (unless referred to by their contract number). A different model for tokens, where their friendly names are defined in the protocol and processed as UTXOs just like native blockchain currency, points to whole new capabilities. For example, if someone called “Influencer” creates a social token called “Influencer”, they will have also defined a namespace called “Influencer”, opening up unique digital goods opportunities.</p><p>Digital Goods — a namespace on a blockchain protocol renders unique power; a simple model for digital goods on a namespace would&nbsp;include:</p>  object definition — a protocol could allow unique friendly name identifiers within the namespace, meaning fans could register identities/names that are associated with the namespace, eg. “fan.influencer@”, or an influencer could assign meaningful names to digital goods attached to their namespace, eg. “ticket0001.influencer@” or “coolnft.influencer@” or “schedule.influencer@”  object control and transferability — a protocol could allow defined objects to be controlled by private keys and to be transferable from one set of private keys to another, either by command, or in an atomic swap transaction, eg. fans could transfer their objects to and from each other at will, or on automated marketplaces without intermediaries  objects as destinations/addresses/endpoints — as addresses on a blockchain protocol, these objects could receive, send and hold funds, or control other objects; eg. money could be sent to or from “fan.influencer@”; also, objects could be endpoints, and so could receive messages or be unique points in a communications network  object metadata — objects could contain space for metadata, and leverage data structures and off-chain storage (either centralized or decentralized, like arweave) to allow for arbitrary and updateable data to be associated with the object. Coupled with #3 above this allows objects to exist as NFT art, or <a href="https://verus.io/verusid-lookup/mike@">verifiable online&nbsp;profiles</a>  object signatures — being cryptographically unique, objects could provide verifiable signatures to arbitrary data, thus allowing for applications like sign-on/access, or&nbsp;voting  <p>Immediately we see that meaningful digital goods economies could spring up around successful influencers. Examples of such digital goods would&nbsp;be:</p>  Fan IDs — the simple act of creating a fan ID/address for just a few dollars could be seen as a show of support, or status symbol in an influencer community; or fans could create and trade meaningful IDs  Nfts — influencers, or even their fans, could create digital collectibles/art/memorabilia to be auctioned, sold or given away to&nbsp;fans  Fan Profiles — updateable, verifiable fan profiles are&nbsp;possible  Ticket — an object could represent a ticket to an&nbsp;event  Coupons/gift cards — an object could represent a right to buy&nbsp;merch  Discount Codes — an object might give a right to get ongoing discounts on merch or&nbsp;events  Memberships — an object can provide exclusive membership to influencer clubs or&nbsp;forums  Log-in/access — an object can give rights to enter websites or other digital&nbsp;arenas  Voting — objects could be used to signal support for an initiative, idea or&nbsp;proposal  <p>This is far from an exhaustive list, and the “long tail” will surely draw out ideas which we’re not even capable of conceiving right now. Many of these goods would be automatic or community created and so could thrive even without continuous activity from the issuer. This is important for the longevity of the social token economy. It’s not difficult to see how strong community-created activity could thrive and&nbsp;persist.</p><p>An Economic Model for the Digital Goods — to capture value for the issuing influencer (and others), there is no necessity ever to sell tokens directly to the public (which might bring securities laws into the issue anyway). The social tokens would always be just a commodity/good/coupon that can be acquired to show support, or to be used (exclusively) to acquire digital goods like those described above. An issuer would always, likely, issue “free” tokens to themself as part of the creation process (a “premine”), or retain the right to issue new tokens at will (perhaps only after the passing of a period of time). They would also need to “seed” the token with a little bit of real world money to provide initial value to the token. Note that this seed money would never actually be at risk of loss, and could always be recovered; in fact, recovery (and more) would be quite easy in the case of thriving token economies. Once this is done, then fans could acquire the tokens (directly, without an AMM) by converting their currency, like USDC, into the social token. Every time a fan does this, they increase the supply of the token a little bit, and they also drive up its value. When they spend the token on digital goods (like ID creation, buying a NFT, getting a membership, etc.) the amount that they spend gets burned from the supply of the token, which reduces its supply and further drives up its value. During this process, too, the robustness of the reserves of “real” currency are improved, providing more depth and stability to the token’s value. It will become easier and easier for the issuer to start selling down their “premine”, or to issue themself new tokens, and thus capturing the created value, without crashing the value of the&nbsp;token.</p><p>With this model, further value enhancement might come from speculators who see that an influencer is growing in power. Speculators like these would be analogous to collectors who have an eye for talent, and that can spot trends. All they need to do to profit is to get in early on the right tokens by the right influencers with the right potential economic activity that would *inevitably* drive value increases. In this way, market dynamics might allow influencers to capture future value&nbsp;today.</p> This Exists Today — the Verus&nbsp;Project <p>This is not just theory, but is about to be put into practice. Five years in development, and with a working network (minus these token capabilities) for the last three years, the <a href="http://verus.io/">Verus Project</a> has built the protocols. Verus aims to be a public good. There are no VCs funding the project and so no returns on investment that need to be drawn from users to pay back investors. It is a community developed FOSS blockchain protocol. The only fees involved in creating and using social tokens on Verus will be paid, as in bitcoin, to miners who power the&nbsp;network.</p><p>These capabilities as described do not exist on smart contract platforms today. Perhaps they could be engineered on a case by case basis by a team of competent smart contract developers. But, this would require complex interconnecting smart contracts to deal with all of the disparate elements. It would be an enormous engineering effort, fraught with risk and complexity. On Verus, using primitives as building blocks, these tokens can be issued in just a few minutes, with bespoke variables, by non-programmers, and at little&nbsp;cost.</p> Additional Capabilities <p>Apart from the core functionality of social tokens described above, there are also some interesting capabilities that enhance the concept. First, as a fork of zcash, Verus offers private transactions on its native currency. And, as a UTXO blockchain, wallets control multiple addresses which cannot necessarily be traced to the same wallet. This gives the ability for intelligent apps to protect user’s privacy as they interact with social&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>Also, on-chain escrow mechanisms allow for issuers to timelock their holdings for arbitrary periods. This helps reduce potential moral hazard where fans and speculators might be concerned about issuers dumping their holdings and “rugging” their community. Roll has always been concerned about this possibility, and that led them to provide centralized escrow services for their issuers. Unfortunately, a <a href="https://tryroll.com/security-incident/">security incident</a> at Roll led to these “escrowed” amounts being stolen and liquidated.</p><p>Social tokens might be tied to entire groups, rather than a single influencer. In this case, Verus protocols allow multisignature approvals for the issuance or sale of the tokens. Multisigs can be up to 13 of 25 different participants.</p><p>Finally, Verus testnet currently includes a provable decentralized bridge to and from the ethereum network. This bridge allows any token created on the Verus network to be bridged to ethereum, where it *automatically* emerges as an ERC-20 token, without any additional programming required. This is a crucial element, as ethereum is currently where the users are. Once created on Verus, an influencer can bridge tokens over to ethereum, where it can be used for giveaways, liquidity provision, or any other purpose for which social tokens are used today by Roll or Rally. Similarly, tokens can be bridged from ethereum, meaning that USDC, ETH, WBTC and other valuable currencies will exist on the Verus&nbsp;mainnet.</p> Status <p>These protocols exist now on the Verus testnet and are scheduled for imminent release to the Verus main network. As a community project, and FOSS project focused on core protocol development as a public good, Verus community members have not yet advanced consumer-ready tooling and apps that can take full advantage of these core capabilities. Nevertheless, forward-thinking influencers can start now, since experimentation is inexpensive, permissionless and easy, and some of the tooling and apps do exist for capable users. More importantly though, there is a business opportunity here for companies or entrepreneurs to leapfrog Roll and Rally, or for those companies themselves to pivot to, or supplement their current offerings with, a more capable rent-free platform. The Verus community stands by to assist anyone who would develop tools and applications and businesses leveraging the protocols.</p><p><a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">Discuss and explore all Verus has to offer on&nbsp;Discord</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/VerusCoin">Follow on&nbsp;Twitter</a></p><p><a href="http://www.verus.io/">Go to&nbsp;verus.io</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/the-coming-of-age-of-social-tokens-518aed68c8f2">The Coming of Age of Social Tokens</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin">Verus Coin</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>At the Gartner IAM European Summit in London a couple of weeks ago, Simon Wood, Ubisecure CEO, had the opportunity to share the stage with Lauri Immonen, Telia Company’s Head of Identity. Together they would provide insights to the audience on how the Ubisecure-Telia partnership has enabled strong reusable identity throughout Europe. The live session can be replayed for attendees in the Gartner Conference app, but for the benefit of our wider audience, I have summarised the session below.</p>
<p>As a background, Ubisecure and Telia have a unique relationship. Ubisecure is a European identity services provider, and Telia is a leading Nordic telco. Together the companies developed a solution (the <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Telia-Identification-Broker-Service-Ubisecure-Case-Study.pdf" title="Telia Identification Broker Service">Telia Identification Broker Service</a>) that connects Service Providers to the European strong reusable identity ecosystem. The ecosystem, while rich in high assurance Identity Providers, won’t reach its full potential until its issues around complexity are solved.</p>
<p>This blog talks through the why, the how, and what this solution delivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The three identity waves 
<p></p>
<p>To understand strong reusable identity, we first need to look at its evolution, or as <a href="https://www.fintechtalents.com/third-wave-in-digital-identity/">Rod Boothby coined</a>, the “waves of identity”.</p>
<p>Wave 1 refers to workforce identities. Companies give their employees identities and passwords to access work networks. The identities reside in enterprise directories and HR systems. Sometimes these identities can be federated and used on external services, but ultimately they remain controlled by the company.</p>
<p>Wave 2 refers to the identities businesses give to their Customers. Customers now have hundreds of identities. A particularly popular type of wave 2 identity is the social identity like Facebook, Google etc. These identities are low assurance, or perhaps better said as ‘self-assurance’, but highly prevalent. The user’s identity became the product.</p>
<p>Wave 3 refers to strong trusted identities. These identities are highly assured – issued by a bank, government or mobile provider. They deliver high value because they can be trusted. They are designed to replace many of the wave 2 identities by offering Customers a single, secure and privacy enhanced method of registering and authenticating to a service. But currently the strong identity ecosystem, particularly in Europe, contains many disparate identity providers – some regional, some national. They need connecting together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What defines a strong reusable identity? 
<p></p>
<p>Firstly, it cannot be self-certified, it must originate from a certified, trusted identity service. In our society we see three organisation types issuing the majority of such identities – banks, governments and mobile providers. All perform KYC (Know Your Customer) as they onboard their Customers or Citizens to digital services.</p>
<p>The identity must allow the Service Provider to authenticate and identify the user. This doesn’t mean attributes should be shared, in fact quite the opposite. A good identity service will share assertions and claims rather than actual personal data, and the identity owner will maintain total control over what specific data is ever shared. Think about the case of buying alcohol. The store clerk needs to know that the buyer meets the legal age to buy alcohol, not their actual birthday. This is the key difference between sharing personal data vs making a trusted claim. This in turn helps the Service Provider to build trust with the Customer over time, requesting identity assurance only when it is needed.</p>
<p>Finally, it should also follow a Zero Trust model of “never trust, always verify”. Once the “always verify” concept can be automated without causing friction on the user, Zero Trust can dramatically step up the anti-fraud benefits for both the Customer and the Service Provider.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why would a Customer or Service Provider want to use strong reusable identity? 
<p></p>
<p>We all have dozens, if not hundreds of accounts. There is considerable fatigue in being asked to create yet another account. Being asked to share private details yet again in the hope they will be adequately protected and not illicitly shared. And creating yet another password, or maybe reusing existing passwords (not a good idea, ever). Then, assuming we finish yet another registration process, we still have to remember or dig out the credentials every time we want to log into the service again. It’s time consuming and frustrating.</p>
<p>Customers want a simple registration process that is standardised, familiar and easy to use. One that allows single sign-on across connected applications. They don’t want to remember yet more passwords, and they want to control what data is shared, and why. Strong reusable identities deliver all this to Customers.</p>
<p>Service Providers have similar requirements. They want assurances that both new and returning Customers are who they say they are. Sometimes, for more valuable transactions, they might even want further assurances the Customer is really the Customer (step up authentication).</p>
<p>It’s notoriously hard getting people to sign up to new services. It’s incredibly frustrating, and wasteful, when a potential Customer abandons the registration process halfway through – which happens far more often if the process is lengthy or provides friction beyond reasonable security requirements.</p>
<p>If there’s a way to just get the Customer onto the system quickly and easily, churn can be reduced, and marketing investments maximised. Strong reusable identities deliver all this, and more, to Service Providers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 European Strong Identity 
<p></p>
<p>Now we know that strong reusable identities have a lot to offer both Customers and Service Providers, let’s review what is available in Europe.</p>
<p>The European identity ecosystem is very rich. It contains dozens of initiatives managed by both public and private entities. Plus, there are some public-private partnerships. All, however, are anchored on nationally issued identities, making them extremely high assurance and perfect for cross-border transactions and trust.</p>
<p>As disparate as it may be, the pool of identities is plentiful – covering millions of individuals throughout Europe. As attractive as the pool may be, with such a plethora of initiatives, and no (at least yet) harmonisation between the identity providers, if you are a Service Provider looking to support multiple providers, there are serious challenges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The challenges within the current European Identity ecosystem 
<p></p>
<p>The Customer perspective is easy to understand. They simply want their strong IDs to accepted in as many places as possible. They don’t care if the Service Provider is in Finland, or in Sweden etc. They just want to authenticate themselves to gain access to the service, with a consistent and familiar user experience.</p>
<p>Service Providers look at the current ecosystem and see opportunity, but also complexity. They see complexity in integrating many different Identity Providers (IdPs) to their service(s). And, they see complexity in having to manage many contractual relationships with the IdPs, especially banks in different regions. Finland is a good example here. To offer all bank-issued reusable IDs, a Service Provider would need to maintain contractual relationships and technical integrations with 14 different banking entities! The ecosystem is rich, but it is overwhelming, and few organisations have the resource to get it right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The strategic drivers for Telia Company 
<p></p>
<p>Service Providers want to tap into all the benefits of the strong identity ecosystem, but they don’t want the technical and commercial complexity of doing so. They want just one contract, and one single integration. They want a service that solves the problems, and opens up the ecosystem.</p>
<p>This is where the Ubisecure &amp; Telia partnership offers value. Telia is responding to its enterprise Customer (Service Provider) needs, while complementing other Telia identity services such as e-signing (AATL).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Telia Solution – One contract, one integration 
<p></p>
<p>One contract, one integration. This critical approach has opened the European identity ecosystem up to many more Service Providers than would otherwise have been able to use it. 200 Service Providers are now connected to 20 different identity providers, all through a single integration delivered as either an OIDC (OpenID Connect) or SAML API.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How the Telia ID Broker works 
<p></p>
<p>The Ubisecure Identity Platform powers the 24/7, highly available ID broker system. In 2021 alone, over 58m strong authentications were brokered. The usage of the system is growing, with 40% YoY growth for Swedish and Finnish eGovernment services alone. All from a single integration, and a single contract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Future – eIDAS 2.0 
<p></p>
<p>So far we have examined the strong identity ecosystem from the Nordic and Baltic perspective. We should note that the system has been largely successful due to political pressure in these regions. Where such political appetite does not exist, we see fewer programmes that are less successful (such as in the UK). To help solve these regional differences, the European Commission is close to finalising a pan-European eIDAS 2.0 framework to:</p>
 
 Ensure that people and businesses can use their own national electronic identification schemes (eIDs) to access public services available online in other EU countries; 
 Create a European internal market for trust services, by ensuring that they will work across borders and have the same legal status as their traditional paper-based equivalents. 
 
<p>With the eIDAS 2.0 specification due to be released imminently (May 2022), we are just around the corner from a true European ‘network of networks’. eIDAS 2.0 will enable so much more than just strong reusable identity for authentication. It is planned to also include identity wallets that can manage both identities and documents, such as driving licenses, medical data and more. This puts the identity holder in complete control over what is shared and how, while retaining a trusted cross border ecosystem.</p>
<p>By 2024, eIDAS will also support Organisation Identity – an underserved aspect of identity. As the #1 issuer of strong organisation identities through our Legal Entity Identifier business unit, Ubisecure naturally supports and contributes to enabling use cases where organisation and individual identity can be linked and expressed as a trusted relationship. More on this aspect in the future!</p>
<p>Identity brokering platforms will be essential in the success of such initiatives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Future – GAIN 
<p></p>
<p>The hope of eIDAS 2.0 is to open up the European strong identity ecosystem. The hope for GAIN (Global Assured Identity Network) sets its sights on the entire globe. If successful, GAIN will be a true global network of networks, mapping the trust between all the regional initiatives. It’s a lofty goal, but one that has a good chance of success thanks to the involvement of several key individuals and organisations, such as the IIF, OIX and GLEIF (Global LEI Foundation).</p>

 Web3 Architecture and Tech Stack&nbsp;: A Beginners Guide <p>If you’re a beginner in the Web3 space, the initial inertia of understanding things might be overwhelming for&nbsp;you.</p><p>I wrote this blog around three months ago when I started to get a gist of what Web3 is and how everything works coming from a Web2 world. I was bewildered about studying what, how, and whatnot when I started up. Some people say this blockchain is better, and others say another. Some include many products into their architecture, making it so complicated that it looks like a different world altogether. Just Google around looking for the Web3 tech stack — everyone gives you an explanation of what it is in their perspective, and a typical marketing blog is what I always find, I’d&nbsp;say.</p><p>So when I started writing this blog, my focus was just one thing — let’s transition our knowledge from Web2 to Web3 and know which technologies support what. Once that is figured out, it will become far easier to choose and start our developer journey into it. This blog will generally be over the top, although that’s what you need as a beginner, right?</p><p>But first, we need to understand what we mean by Web3 — the idea people might change the internet as we see&nbsp;it.</p> What is&nbsp;Web3? <p>One of my friends recently mentioned that Web3 is just another fancy name for the blockchain ecosystem. He’s partially correct, at the same time, wrong on a whole different level.</p><p>Although the foundation of Web3 is centered around blockchain, when you start developing over it, you’ll realize that blockchain is just a part of it. To draw a comparison, a blockchain in a Web3 app might be similar to how a database might be for a typical web app (Web2) you might develop. As a comparison, we&nbsp;take:</p><p>Web1 = the internet of information; i.e., The HTML CSS websites you cannot interact&nbsp;with.</p><p>Web2 = the internet of interactions; i.e., Modern platforms like Facebook, Twitter, etc., that allow you to be connected end to end with&nbsp;others.</p><p>Web3 = the new internet of value, i.e., the internet where centralization of information is eliminated.</p><p>So if we try to define Web3, we can say that it is the concept that aids the development of decentralized applications(dApps). Yes — the same decentralized internet we heard from <a href="https://silicon-valley.fandom.com/wiki/Richard_Hendricks">Richard in Silicon&nbsp;Valley</a>!</p><p>However, we do not have a compression engine platform like what he had built to build this. Instead, we have a range of protocols and platforms that enable this development system. These protocols are a set of rules that govern how your application works, while multiple platforms facilitate the creation of your application.</p><p>Okay, fine, but why do we need dApps in the first&nbsp;place?</p><p>The most significant benefit of creating a dApp is Ownership and Identity. Ownership of data, content, literally everything with your self-identity — a concept that got blurred with the coming of age of these top institutions like Google and Facebook.</p><p>Another significant benefits people talk about is Composability, one of the central pillars of&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>Every single software company out there right now is focused on collecting user data, which is their single biggest asset and differentiates them from one another. Not the product but the data they hold. Companies competing with each other, with similar UI/UX and slightly different business logic, are valuable independently because of the “data” they have aggregated.</p><p>This is what Web3 will disrupt, making every application composable by sharing &amp; consuming their data between different applications. Think about a metaverse where you can buy things from Meta and use them in the Microsoft ecosystem. This is the most exciting and interesting aspect of Web3. It is making the web genuinely composable!</p><p>But that’s not all; with the high amount of trust and reliability these applications bring in, the possibilities are endless; we haven’t even imagined what the future might look like with dApps being omnipresent. I feel Web3 might start the same revolution that open-source brought into the developer ecosystem.</p> Understanding the Web3 Architecture <p>Now that we have defined Web3, we need to understand how these protocols and platforms work together to help us build these&nbsp;dApps.</p><p>When we imagine a general web app, we envision an architecture constituting the&nbsp;follows:</p>Basic Web2 Architecture<p>Although I’ve not depicted things like caches, queues, etc., a general over-the-top architecture looks like&nbsp;this.</p><p>For a Web3 app, The frontend will remain the same, but some exciting changes start to happen on the backend side of things. Let’s see how that&nbsp;works:</p>Basic Web3 Architecture<p>If we compare Web2 and Web3, the Blockchain Node is doing the heavy lifting and managing our data, which is decentralized into a network of blockchains. Since it is expensive to store directly on the chain, we have some off-chain File Storage and a P2P Database facilitating data storage. Finally, to build a secure layer, we have a Wallet or a Private Key-based Authentication to verify the individual’s identity.</p><p>Please note that this is just an over-the-top depiction of the architecture. In reality, we have much more complex applications and need architectural parameters from both Web2 and&nbsp;Web3.</p> The Web3 Tech&nbsp;Stack <p>So far, we have learned what a Web3 architecture generally looks like. Now, let’s deep dive into each of these components to better understand the tech&nbsp;stack.</p><p>So let’s start from the&nbsp;bottom:</p> Blockchain <p>If I talk about selecting a blockchain to build upon, it is one of the most challenging tasks one needs to decide on. There are many factors at play here; decentralization, transaction throughput, gas fees, ecosystem/interoperability, and many more, and we won’t be debating them all as it’ll never end. It is like choosing your programming language. Every single one works; a few are better in specific cases and others for other use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>Although, as a beginner, I might recommend starting with <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/">Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)</a> with <a href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/">Solidity</a>. This is because of the massively present developer community around&nbsp;it.</p><p>EVM acts as the virtual machine, the bedrock of Ethereum’s entire operating structure. Ethereum brought in the concept of smart contracts and is the most used blockchain out there. Solidity is the language used to make smart contracts. It is very similar to JavaScript in syntax, which might be helpful if you’re a Web2 developer. Under the hood, Solidity is compiled into low-level instructions called <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/opcodeshttps://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/opcodes">opcodes</a> for the EVM to interpret.</p><p>When you’ve learned this, it will be easier to understand the concepts of other technologies in the ecosystem, like:</p>  <a href="https://solana.com/">Solana</a>: Another blockchain like Ethereum focuses on providing faster transaction times and cheaper fees. The smart contracts can be written in Rust, C, and&nbsp;C++.  Layer 2’s (L2): L2 refers to a secondary protocol built over an existing blockchain system, generally Ethereum, borrowing the main chain’s consensus security. There are many options here, but the top ones remain <a href="https://polygon.technology/">Polygon</a>, <a href="https://arbitrum.io/">Arbitrium</a>, <a href="https://starkware.co/starkex/">StarkEx</a> &amp; <a href="https://starkware.co/starknet/">StarkNet</a>, <a href="https://www.optimism.io/">Optimism</a>, etc.  Application Chains: Although you won’t require this as a newbie, I feel this is the most exciting option out there. You can build your own blockchain/consensus system with platforms like <a href="https://tendermint.com/">Tendermint</a>/<a href="https://cosmos.network/">Cosmos</a>, <a href="http://polkadot.network">Polkadot</a>, etc.   Blockchain Node <p>For deploying an application in production, you need a server. A blockchain node does this job for blockchains. Blockchain nodes are network stakeholders or devices running the “blockchain software”. Hence, they are authorized to keep track of the distributed ledger, serving as communication hubs for the network tasks. A P2P (Peer to Peer) protocol allows nodes to communicate within the network and transfer information about transactions and new&nbsp;blocks.</p><p>You can self-run blockchain nodes or get a Node service provider like <a href="https://www.quicknode.com/">Quicknode</a>, <a href="https://moralis.io/">Moralis</a>, <a href="https://infura.io/">Infura</a>, etc., that offer APIs to create automated flows. For self-hosting, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blockchain/">AWS Cloud</a> and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/solutions/blockchain/">Azure</a> have images for you to spin up for the more popular chains. Otherwise, most chains make it easy for you to run your nodes/validators. The only thing that can be a hassle is to ensure uptime and maintenance, which depends on your&nbsp;network.</p> P2P Database <p>The first question that anybody would ask here is: Why do we need a database when we’re using blockchain in the first place? Additionally, will it not hinder our idea of a&nbsp;dApp?</p><p>As a simple answer to that, storing data on a blockchain is slow and expensive. We need an additional database to access data off-chain, ensuring that we’re not accessing the chain again and again. To have that decentralization part of it, we use peer-to-peer or P2P databases that store and host all of the data in streams to eliminate centralized database servers, blockchains, or local storage. Think about how your torrents get downloaded!</p><p>The <a href="https://ceramic.network/">Ceramic network</a> is the most common decentralized database provider out there, as I know of personally.</p> Decentralized File&nbsp;Storage <p>Like every other application, we need a dedicated file storage system (similar to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> for Web2 applications). Databases essentially are tabular data, while file storage is that folder-based data you need to store your large media files. <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a> is the most common P2P file system protocol with excellent community support. <a href="https://www.arweave.org/">Arweave</a> is another option focused on keeping data permanently. You can use platforms like <a href="https://docs.filecoin.io/about-filecoin/what-is-filecoin/">Filecoin</a>, <a href="https://siasky.net/">Skynet</a>, <a href="https://storj.io/">Storj</a>, and <a href="https://0chain.net/">0Chain</a> to host these file storage&nbsp;systems.</p> Authentication in&nbsp;Web3 <p>In my honest opinion, authentication is one of the most essential aspects of Web3. Without logging in users into the smart contract, one cannot access their wallets and make the most straightforward transactions. You should note that signing a transaction enables every interaction with a blockchain.</p><p>Looking at traditional login methods in the Web2 world, we have a simple form structure where the user details are stored in a database and cross-checked for verification. Additionally, services like Google &amp; Facebook offer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth</a>, enabling access to some basic information to the app directly, making the process seamless. Although this approach is convenient, this cannot be now used in a dApp since you need a private key to sign a transaction.</p><p>In Web3, we do not have the user’s data, but actually, we have wallets (which are essentially a wrapper around a private key), wherein cryptographic signatures are used to prove ownership of those blockchain addresses. It is essential to know how to access and interact with a user’s address and private key as a Web3 developer.</p><p>The fascinating aspect of owning a blockchain wallet is that once a user loses their <a href="https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/public-private-keys-cryptography">private key</a> to the wallet address, no one can recover it for them. This is useful and scary at the same time. There are plenty of <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/12/13/half-a-billion-in-bitcoin-lost-in-the-dump">stories of crypto millionaires</a> who have lost it all by storing their private keys in a lost hard&nbsp;drive.</p><p>Many projects have tried different ways to go around this and help users recover that key, the most common of them being Seed Phrases. The most famous wallet out there, <a href="https://metamask.io/">MetaMask</a>, uses the concept of 12 word Mnemonic Phrases, which goes through a <a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/mnemonic-generation-bip39-simply-explained-e9ac18db9477">BIP39 Algorithm</a> to generate the array of unique wallet addresses and private keys for you stored in your MetaMask account. But then again, remembering 12 randomly generated words in proper order for each wallet account group a user owns is difficult.</p><p>While trying to figure out a solution to a lousy UX like this, I encountered <a href="https://web3auth.io/">Web3Auth</a>, and interestingly enough, I ended up joining them within the next two months. Web3Auth is one of the most popular solutions for new users, bridging the Web2 and Web3 worlds. A simple auth infrastructure that gives those OAuth capabilities to Web3 applications in a self-custodial way for the user. By self custodial, we mean that the user has custody of the key and not the application or Web3Auth. This is done through a unique MPC architecture, and hence the private key is never stored in a single server/ node or method with complete access. Read more about the infrastructure <a href="https://docs.web3auth.io/overview/key-management">here</a>.</p><p>I think it can be a massive thing for a project onboarding process. I would recommend checking it&nbsp;out.</p> Implementing the&nbsp;Frontend <p>Many developers might not know, but the frontend technologies for Web3 and Web2 are the same. The only difference is where you need to reimagine the UX of the application because the authentication, processing in the blockchain, and general flow of the application are slightly different from Web2 applications.</p><p>I would recommend going on with <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> &amp; <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> since most developers are currently using this in the Web3 world. I might be biased, but almost every other project presently features a React integration. If you’re using Webpack 5, make sure that there are certain polyfills you need to take care of while developing an application; the rest of everything is generally the&nbsp;same.</p><p>For the client-side backend, things get a bit different. Here is where you need to understand how to interact with the blockchain you’ve created. Web3 Interaction libraries help you with that, but you need to know how they work and interact with the blockchain properly.</p> Blockchain Interaction (Web3) Libraries and development tools: <p>Web3 libraries allow you to interact with nodes using HTTP, IPC, or WebSocket. These libraries help developers write intuitive, one-line methods to initialize the JSON RPC requests (under the hood) that interact with whichever chain you’ve&nbsp;chosen.</p><p>On Ethereum, some of the Web3 Libraries are <a href="https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/">Web3.js</a>, <a href="https://docs.ethers.io/">Ethers.js,</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openethereum/js-libs/tree/master/packages/light.js">Light.js</a>. On top of that, many chains have developer tools that provide features that allow for much faster iteration than public testnets. Tools like <a href="https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache">Ganache</a>, <a href="https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle">Truffle</a>, <a href="https://hardhat.org/">Hardhat</a>, and <a href="https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Brownie</a> are examples&nbsp;here.</p><p>For starting up with Ethereum development, I’d highly recommend checking out the <a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/">Remix IDE</a> — it is the best place for a beginner to learn Solidity and Ethereum concepts. You can easily directly interact and test out your code without setting up all these libraries.</p> Wrapping up <p>In all, I believe Web3 comes with an exciting opportunity for new developers out there to try out something different and break away from the traditional aspects of software development. At the same time, drawing this comparison and understanding where to start is extremely necessary for anyone looking to build decentralized applications since there will always be a combination of both in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Web3 is here to stay, but this does not mean that the concepts of Web2 are dead. Learning the new tech stack while understanding its key usage and characteristics is the only way a developer can pioneer this new industry.</p><p>I hope this blog might have helped you understand some key aspects of how a Web3 app is put together. Please do let me know if I’ve missed or messed something up because I’m still a learner trying out different stuff in this new world&nbsp;:)</p><p>Cheers!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/a-beginners-guide-the-basic-web3-architecture-and-tech-stack-81f2061d263c">A Beginners’ guide the basic Web3 Architecture and Tech Stack</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

According to it, a blockchain-based system cannot be decentralised, private and scalable at the same time. Instead, insists the trilemma, trade-offs must be made. So when a blockchain protocol claims to have solved the trilemma, it is worth listening to. MetaMUI is an identity-based blockchain that dispenses with intermediaries, protects private information and is capable of settling millions of transactions per second. And to use it, nothing more elaborate than a smartphone is required. Which is why MetaMUI is attracting interest from issuers of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), security tokens and Non-Fungible Tokens(NFTs). Its creators also think it holds the key to the Metaverse. Its secrets? Parallel transaction processing plus tying digital assets to digital identities.….”</p><p>Read more here:<br><a href="https://futureoffinance.biz/2022/05/19/article-metamui-uses-digital-identity-to-invent-a-fast-scalable-blockchain/">https://futureoffinance.biz/2022/05/19/article-metamui-uses-digital-identity-to-invent-a-fast-scalable-blockchain/</a></p> About MetaMUI <p>MetaMUI is the world’s 1st Identity-based blockchain to truly enable regulated Peer_to_Peer (P2P) transactions. It can be used as the cornerstone for most financial offerings. Its high versatility and support for custom-developed use cases enable Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) implementation and issuance on the MetaMUI CBDC platform.<br>MetaMUI is built around Self-Sovereign Identity (SSID) technology. MetaMUI has created a new identity-based CBDC system by combining the SSID and blockchain token mechanism. It can protect users’ privacy while providing an identity-based transfer system that can satisfy travel rules and other regulatory requirements such as Know your customer (KYC), Anti-money laundering (AML), and Counter Financing of Terrorism (CFT).</p><p><a href="https://sovereignwallet.network/">Website</a>/<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/metamui/">Linkedin</a>/<a href="https://twitter.com/MUIcommunity">Twitter</a>/<a href="https://t.me/muicommunity">Telegram</a>/<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SWNGlobal">Youtube</a>/<a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/">Medium</a></p>

<p>Andras Dorka – International Account Manager at InfoCert for the Hungarian market – will talk at 15:35 (CET) about the topic “Digital Trust in Onboarding Processes: how to reach new customers enhancing security and experience&nbsp; ”, during this speech he will approach topics like the role of a QTSP and the outsourcing of liability, the balance among user experience, security, legal value, and regulatory compliance, and also the evolution of customer journeys thanks to new technologies and regulations.&nbsp;After that he will share the stage with an important Banking Institute, CIB Bank Zrt, that will share an use case built with the cooperation with InfoCert.</p>



<p>It is&nbsp; evident that we are moving into the age of hyper-automation, when banks and corporations prefer to automate and digitise every work process. What change management is required for this and which technologies may be of help? Data-driven operation has also become a hot topic, for which IT-support must be complemented with the transformation of bank management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The conference will cover the type of apps and digital products the banks enter the digital space with, also considering the new trends of business driven IT developments.</p>

			 Stablecoins Were Not Made to Go to the Moon 
<p>As you may have heard, the recent news about TerraUSD (UST)’s major losses the past two weeks has generated much criticism and worry around the solidity of stablecoins.</p>
<p>In last month’s newsletter, I mentioned how stablecoin awareness and regulation have become a priority for regulators. In the weeks that followed, one of the main stablecoins in market cap de-pegged and crashed the whole crypto market.</p>
<p>It’s easy to say after the fact, but I wasn’t surprised that the UST fell apart. However, I had neither anticipated such spotlight from the financial and mainstream media, nor such impact on the crypto market. In my opinion,&nbsp;UST was clearly a stablecoin for speculation&nbsp;as the majority of buyers were using it to get the 19.5% APY on the Anchor protocol.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, on the Anchor website, it was clearly highlighted that the amounts lent were much higher than the amounts borrowed. There was bound to be a problem somewhere, and many forgot the crypto saying: “Do your own research”. Terra’s business model did not seem to be built for digital payment purposes. Instead, they emphasized incentivization for holders. Terra was actually betting on the success of the LUNA coin to compensate for UST’s stability. This ultimately led to an implosion within the LUNA ecosystem that, even with $3 billion injected from their reserves, could not prevent a collapse.</p>

			<p>This episode in the history of blockchain adoption reinforces our point of view:&nbsp;The future of stablecoins is probably permissioned, fiat-backed, and issued by regulated entities.</p>
<p>Only stablecoins issued by credible entities will survive, and governments are already thinking about how to regulate these issuers. We believe that all existing banks and payment service providers should be able to issue stablecoins. Hence, everything will be transparent on chain.</p>
<p>Also, keeping large reserves of various assets that are too volatile or not liquid enough will no longer be enough to convince stablecoin users. They will look for stablecoins for which it is possible to monitor the underlying assets in real time. Fiat-backed tokens will be easier to understand and use.</p>
<p>Regarding payments, the responsibility and system maintenance should lie with an entity that can help in the event of an error. Today, if you lose your wallet key or someone else accesses it, you will lose your USDC and there is nothing anyone can do about it. With a permissioned stablecoin, you could get your money back by proving your identity.</p>
<p>Our recent collaboration with&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/jewel-chooses-erc-3643-and-tokeny-to-issue-bank-grade-stablecoins-on-polygon/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_X6oTtD5pGdbz_MbGqx6e7tZKWlnuzUr-qXoCGztLo84TL6SiHW33UaE3eFe6zbgLd98Zz">Jewel,</a>&nbsp;a digital asset banking platform,&nbsp;further cements our belief in the positive utility of permissioned stablecoins for payments and settlement.&nbsp;Jewel aims to offer a stablecoin-as-a-service solution to financial institutions, cryptocurrency exchanges and governments. It was clear to them that&nbsp;issuing permissioned stablecoins is the only way that fits into the concept of enforcing compliance and ensuring necessary controls over their bank-grade stablecoins.</p>
<p>Hopefully, you were not impacted too much by the recent crash. Crypto-believers will say that it is during bear markets that the best innovations are born. We’ll see 🙂</p>

<p>In short, Identity Brokers allow Service Providers to offer a selection of <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-provider/what-is-an-identity-provider-idp/" title="Identity Providers">Identity Providers</a> (authentication methods) to their customers via a single integration. An Identity Broker is an intermediary proxy service that connects multiple Service Providers (SPs) with multiple Identity Providers (IdPs). It offers a one-stop shop for SPs to integrate several authentication methods to their service(s).</p>
<p>The main benefit of using an Identity Broker is that SPs only need to integrate and manage a single integration and contract to be able to leverage numerous authentication methods for their users.</p>
<p>Without an Identity Broker, the SP needs to do this several times over, which would be complex and time-consuming. So complex and time-consuming, in fact, that many SPs simply wouldn’t attempt it – meaning they are far more limited in what authentication methods they will offer. However, offering more authentication methods is a huge customer experience and security win, as it makes it more likely for a user to be able to re-use an identity they have already created, without having to create another set of login credentials.</p>
<p>Within Europe, particularly in the Nordics, banks are the predominant IdPs. For example, Swedish banking customers can log into several third-party services with their BankID. And in some countries like Estonia, governments are very progressive in issuing digital identities. In some countries, it is the telcos and, in others – like Finland, it is a mix of these. Identity Brokering services solve the complexity involved in the usage of these different eIDs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Examples of strong identities available in Europe</p>
 
 Regulatory context for European Identity Brokers 
<p>eIDAS (electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services) is an EU regulation aimed at harmonising the cross-border authentication of citizens and increasing transparency. The EU achieves this by requiring member states to create a common framework that recognises eIDs from other member states, and ensures their authenticity and security. For transparency, eIDAS aims to provide an easily accessible list of trusted services that may be used within the centralised signing framework.</p>
<p>Typically, Identity Brokers offer strong customer authentication methods, where the identity has been pre-verified to a standard of Know Your Customer (KYC). Thus, the traditional username and password, or social media IdPs (such as Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter etc.) might not be included in the concept.</p>
<p>As an example, in Finland, there is a law that requires private sector SPs to use the <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/authentication/finnish-trust-network-ftn/" title="Finnish Trust Network">Finnish Trust Network</a> (FTN, ”Luottamusverkosto”) service to provide strong authentication methods (including bank and telco IDs). The FTN consists of IdPs and IdP Proxy operators (Identity Brokers). For public sector services, there is an identity broker service called Suomi.fi.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Components of the Finnish Trust Network</p>
 
 Example of an Identity Broker 
<p>Generally speaking, Finland is quite a unique country in the sense that it has 13 commercial IdPs and one governmental IdP through which you can get a strong digital identity. The 13 commercial IdPs include 10 banks and 3 mobile operators. The government IdP provides an eID that citizens can utilise with their ID cards. SPs can reach all these different IdPs via an Identity Brokering service.</p>
<p>For example, in Finland, the Telia Identification Broker Service (TIBS) is one such service from incumbent Telco, Telia Company. TIBS is an identity proxy service that does not store users’ SSN (Social Security Number) or other identity attributes. It only relays the necessary information between the eID vendors (IdPs) and the online services (SPs).</p>
<p>It solves several issues related to applying a strong digital identity, with several benefits such as:</p>
 
 Only one commercial contract – saving costs compared to setting up several contracts with each IdP 
 Only one technical integration – less complicated and saves time for developers 
 Solves lifecycle management issues when there are changes in the different IdP APIs at different times – much simpler to manage, as there’s no need for a separate IdP level project to fix issues related to changes 
 SP can reach almost the whole Finnish population with one contract 
 
<p></p>

 How to leverage Identity Brokering for your organisation 
<p>Reliable, trustworthy, strong customer authentication is required not only by regulation, but also as a customer experience and security driver for all sectors of business and government services – including B2B, B2C, G2B, G2C etc. A good example of this is physical shops which increasingly require an online presence. This increases the need for robust authentication services where not only the citizens of that particular country, but also customers from different countries, can access the online service and purchase products.</p>
<p>For this purpose, service providers need to be able to integrate seamlessly with different Identity Broker services. For this, the best option is to use an advanced Customer Identity and Access Management (<a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/customer-iam/what-is-ciam/" title="CIAM">CIAM</a>) system, such as Ubisecure’s <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-platform/customer-iam/" title="Identity Platform">Identity Platform</a>, that allows communication between the different IdPs and your services.</p>
<p>Identity brokering services can also be built on a CIAM system. In the above example, Telia Company hosts its Identity Broker service on Ubisecure’s Identity Platform – European built and focused CIAM software. This allows Telia to buy ID transactions from all the legal eID vendors in Finland and combine them into one service. Find out more about why and how Telia Company built its identity brokering service in this <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Telia-Identification-Broker-Service-Ubisecure-Case-Study.pdf" title="case study">case study</a>.</p>
<p>For operators providing identity proxy services such as FTN and others, Ubisecure’s Identity Platform offers an ideal platform to federate all the required IdPs to offer strong digital identities and authentication methods.</p>

  Sign-In with Ethereum opens a path where large corporations can no longer strip a user's ability to access services or spy on their actions. It opens the door for a massive amount of impact in web2 apps and services.

<p>Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE) is a game-changer for user choice on the Internet. It opens a new path where the user doesn't have to go through an Internet giant to access services, but instead owns the relationship directly. While web3 dapps are expected to benefit most dramatically and immediately from SIWE (as evidenced by ongoing adoption), it also opens the door for web2 applications to figure out their web3 strategy for their specific user demographics.</p><p>If you haven't read part 1, which explains why Sign-In with Ethereum is important for web3, check out the following post: &nbsp;</p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/sign-in-with-ethereum-is-a-game-changer-part-1/">  Why Sign-In with Ethereum is a Game-Changer - Part 1  Sign-In with Ethereum is a game-changer for user choice on the Internet. Instead of submitting to “Big Login,” users can now login using the same keys controlling their blockchain accounts--without an intermediary.  SpruceRocco    </a><p>Most dapps today cannot augment the user experience with saved preferences (light mode or dark mode), drafts of user-created content, or anything best not stored on a public blockchain for privacy, scalability, or access control. These are table stakes to provide an excellent UX frequently encountered in web2.</p><p>Fortunately, Sign-In with Ethereum has standardized the way that Ethereum users can enjoy all of these features via securely logging in to services with their existing wallets, all without a password to remember. After users log in to dapps, they can then enjoy rich contextual interactions with UX that rivals web2 applications. Dapps can now remember a user as more than just a public key, and bring profiles, credentials, preferences, and more to a session after users authenticate. </p>Wallets, but SIWE-powered<p>Using these new capabilities, it's now possible to bridge the gap between web2 and web3, with Sign-In with Ethereum as the first major entrypoint for how decentralized services respectfully deal with user data. With that, here are some of the advantages for web2 organizations to adopt Sign-In with Ethereum.</p> Sign-In with Ethereum is Free  <p>One of the simplest and low-risk ways that web2 companies can meaningfully engage the web3 ecosystem is through Sign-In with Ethereum. Sign-In with Ethereum serves as an integration path for web3 components that doesn't compromise on user experience nor relevance across an entire user base. It's secure, doesn't affect existing users who aren't interested in web3, and provides important user research that directly informs a web3 strategy for any web2 company.</p><p>In order to best illustrate this point, we can narrow it down to a simple message:</p>Minimal Assembly Required<p>SIWE costs nothing to end-users because they are just signing a message. There is no blockchain transaction required, and no gas to be paid to miners. SIWE is just a user confirming that they are logging in, and signing in order to do so. </p><p>With Sign-In with Ethereum, you can also let your existing users associate their Ethereum accounts, and use that as their means of authentication. In this case, the user is receiving a new form of passwordless login and can switch to an identifier that they control in the process. On top of all of this, existing users that aren't familiar with web3 need not worry because nothing that they already do is affected by this integration. They can continue to use the application or service as originally intended, without anything changing from the core user experience. </p><p>Sign-In with Ethereum simply adds an additional login option and offers users slightly more flexibility on how they engage with you. As a web2 company, you will have the opportunity to be a user's first touchpoint into web3, and to help them on their journey to control their own digital identity. This can naturally lead to increased user trust and growth for your brand.</p> Sign-In with Ethereum Powers Up Users  <p>Additionally, when users sign in with Ethereum, they may voluntarily introduce a bit more about themselves to your service, depending on the account they chose to login with. This can potentially come with an on-chain history (or not) which may enable you to offer additional benefits based on those facts. This gives rise to a new form of power user who has both history on an existing service, and new interests indicated by on-chain activity.</p><p>It's important to stress the fact that this depends on whether or not the user decides to share that particular history with a service, and we encourage services to make users aware of this fact. It should always be completely opt-in, and services should let users know that they can use fresh new accounts if desired. </p><p>Users can always generate new accounts to log in with, or log in with existing accounts featuring on-chain activity.</p>If you haven't met Session Sam, <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/sign-in-with-ethereum-is-a-game-changer-part-1/">check out the original post</a><p>When users can log in with their wallets or link them to existing accounts, they are able to share more with your organization on their terms, and this can add a lot of value for both parties. For example, a company can create gated experiences based on NFT holdings, DAO membership, or even DeFi activity depending on what they wish to incentivize, or what programs they wish to create. For example,</p>  Longtime fans of an artist holding their NFTs can purchase early discounted concert tickets before scalpers swarm the sales.  A special server hosting package may be made available for members of a DAO focused on developers.  Power users of decentralized exchanges may be given premium features at a financial services firm, such as leverage, credit, or a dedicated account manager.  <p>This also opens the door for companies to create new web3 experiences for their users, such as an NFT drop or POAP distribution to existing accounts that may have logged in using Sign-In with Ethereum. </p><p>In addition to providing direct benefits to users, organizations can also use SIWE to orchestrate network effects across all their digital properties, removing interoperability barriers across departments and external partners. For example, a sports event ticket stub can be represented as an NFT, and due to the significance of the event (e.g., championship victory), that same NFT lets users wear a virtual cosmetic item in a AAA video game.</p> Sign-In with Ethereum Equals New Users <p>Finally, as a champion of user-controlled identity and data, you can now introduce your product to millions of users excited to use services that care about them: web3 users.</p><p>This isn't just adding a feature for your existing user base, but introducing your service to millions of users that care about the web3 decisions you make. These users live by the ethos of web3, are crypto native, and are willing to at least try any service that increases their autonomy.</p><p>By introducing Sign-In with Ethereum, you are demonstrating that you are a web3-forward organization, and are taking the first steps to show that you care.</p> <p>Thanks to EIP-4361, we have a standard way of authenticating users using their Ethereum accounts. This doesn't just bring web3 functionality to web2, but introduces web3 users to web3-friendly traditional organizations. &nbsp;If you're interested in introducing all of this to your service, <a href="mailto:hello@spruceid.com">we're always here to help</a>.

Vitalik spoke about Key Management, many users were left upset at our booth (read to know more) and there were countless integrations with Web3Auth! Amsterdam Calling <p>Team Web3Auth was recently in Amsterdam participating first in Ethereum Foundation’s DevConnect and then later at ETHGlobal’s ETHAmsterdam. The venue for both events was the iconic Beurs Van Berlage, the former commodity exchange building.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1516702166353911808">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote><p>Devconnect is a week-long in-person gathering that featured independent Ethereum events, each with a unique focus. The goal was to focus on depth-first sessions rather than size, and to bring the Ethereum community together in smaller groups to talk, learn about, or make serious progress on specific subjects. ETHAmsterdam is a hackathon gathering some of the top minds building on Ethereum with integration bounties being offered by some leading entities in the ecosystem.</p> When Vitalik opened the event and we couldn’t be more&nbsp;pleased <p>The opening of the event saw Ethereum founder Vitalik share insights on various topics pertaining to different aspects of the Ethereum ecosystem including the much awaited “merge”. Vitalik also jokingly predicted that Ethereum coins would touch 12,000 in value, but he did leave the currency unspecified. However, it was his insight on the importance of private keys that particularly struck a chord with us. Vitalik emphasized social recovery, an implementation where one has the ability to share a part of their key with people they trust, which is what the vision is for the <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/introducing-the-auth-network-b8fab1b5e1f6">Auth Network</a> as&nbsp;well.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1518209570648244224">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote> What Happens in Amsterdam… <p>Our booth at the event caught quite some attention for its magical theme. Our team had developed a “horcrux” inspired mobile application to demo how our private key sharing infrastructure works.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1517472026239328256">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote><p>However, the “horcrux” demo was not the only attraction athe booth. We had a special attraction at the booth that left a lot of visitors rather upset. Why is that? Find out for yourself!</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1519716765990891520">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote> The Team conducted workshops… <p>Our Head of Engineering Chaitanya Potti and Sr Software Engineer Subham Rathi conducted workshops on “how to Plugin self-custodial social logins into your app/wallet via MPC with Web3Auth”. Both workshops were attended by developers who were quite surprised to know that it is possible to use social log-ins to onboard users while continuing to keep the solution self-custodial.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1517544150723350529">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/ETHGlobal/status/1517601383762907136">@ETHGlobal</a></p></blockquote> We did a UI/UX&nbsp;AMA <p>Our UX Team had offered free UX consultation for those who looked to increase their visibility and outreach. The consultancy booth was swarmed with visitors spending an average of 35 mins getting their queries patiently answered.</p> What if Elon Musk took over&nbsp;Twitter? <p>There were over 700 wonderful devs at the event and we caught them off guard with a few fun questions including what would they want Elon Musk to change about Twitter after purchasing it.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1518634766572138496">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1517795743863562240">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote> Web3Auth was widely integrated and we offered over $8500 in&nbsp;bounty <p>Over 700 devs submitted 165 projects in the course of the hackathon and many of these projects had integrated with Web3Auth.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1518231615004106755">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1518234728284966912">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote> Until next time, Amsterdam! <p>All in all, DevConnect and ETHAmsterdam brought together some of the brightest minds in the Ethereum ecosystem who were acquainted with Web3Auth’s state of the art self-custodial private key management infrastructure in a fun and appealing way.</p> Stay in touch with&nbsp;Web3Auth <p><a href="http://web3auth.io/">Website</a> | <a href="https://docs.web3auth.io/">Docs</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/web3auth">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://t.me/web3authdev">Telegram</a> | <a href="http://discord.gg/web3auth">Discord</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/web3auth">Linkedin</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/what-happened-ethamsterdam22-89562c5e8d18">What Happened @ ETHAmsterdam’22?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  A currency gains value from its use — call it Community Contributed Value  National currencies aggregate this contributed value and centralize the benefit to the government and adjacent&nbsp;actors  People see this, and Community Currencies have been attempted to capture this value locally, instead of sending it on to financial centers and&nbsp;capitals  Community Currency experiments have generally failed for various reasons — difficulty of creation/use, lack of transparency or auditability, moral hazard, lack of immediate convertibility, instability of value, inability to see, measure and capture Community Contributed Value  Blockchains have shown a pathway to overcome some, but not all, of these roadblocks; until now, no successful local currency projects on blockchain  A new set of blockchain protocols has emerged in the Verus Project, which is developing rent-free public blockchain infrastructure — use of these open protocols allows for low risk, low cost experiments such as Community Currencies that overcome traditional roadblocks  Without programming, a community can quickly create a made to suit local currency that is easy to use, is transparent and auditable, defeats moral hazard, allows for instant conversion into other currencies, has a stable and predictable value, and can measure and capture Community Contributed Value, to be used for the betterment of the community  Adding intelligent namespaces to Community Currencies gives the potential to experiment with additional value enhancing opportunities, creating digital goods economies attached to the Community Currency  At this time, Verus is a project where developers are focussed on the core protocols. Rolling out a Community Currency for broad use would still require some additional work on user-facing apps.   The Problem <p>Like any other good, money is ruled by the laws of supply and demand. A currency in high use requires a constant float of supply to be circulating through its system. In the case of a fiat currency, the demand for holders to hold the currency gives it its value. In other words, as users of a currency, we collectively give value to that currency by our use. For something like the United States Dollar, its value comes from use in its domestic economy, as the global reserve currency, as the petrodollar, as the primary numeraire in financial markets, as the base currency for most foreign and corporate debt, as a predominant store of value, etc. etc. If we live in the United States and we zoom in, looking at our own local community, we can see that we are providing some small fraction of value to the overall value of the USD through our community’s aggregate use and holdings. However small that might be in relation to the global forces of supply and demand, it might still be a relatively large amount of value when considered from the community’s point of view. Little work has been done in quantifying this actual value provided by a community through its demand for a prevailing currency, but new technical tools might allow us to see this more clearly through actual experience. That’s what this sample case study is about — let’s call this value created by a community, “Community Contributed Value”.</p><p>Observing this in the world today, the first thing we see is that, at the local level, we have zero control of our own Community Contributed Value, nor do we experience much, if any, local benefit from it. The aggregate of all Community Contributed Value, worldwide, is centralized in the hands of the US government. In the fiat period, as the master of the global reserve currency, the US government has proven that this aggregate value is enormous, allowing the government and country to run persistently high budget and trade deficits, and expand the money supply at will, while still maintaining a strong&nbsp;dollar.</p><p>In addition, although specific research is hard to find on this issue, it does seem as if powerful private forces that are adjacent to the United States Government, such as Wall Street and the Defense Industry, are conferred certain advantages through their proximity to the controller of the USD. Connected and powerful people and corporations may be, directly or indirectly, tapping into this Community Contributed Value.</p> Solutions — pre-Blockchain <p>All of this is obvious enough to have given rise to a long history of efforts to start local community currencies, to keep some of this contributed value in the community. Prior to the development of the blockchain, these efforts really seem to have been doomed from the start. Currency issuance in the paper money world is difficult to control and has huge security and moral hazard issues (counterfeit, over-issuance, etc). These currencies cannot easily be made transparent, or auditable. The funds can’t be reasonably saved or protected in banks. There is no plausible way to have readily available conversion at market rates between the community currency and the USD, nor is it plausible to keep a local currency at a stable and predictable value. For users, using community currency was hard, and for communities, making community currency was hard — and so, except for a handful (or less), every effort ran&nbsp;aground.</p> Solutions — in the Dawn of the Blockchain Era <p>Interest in community currencies perked up in the blockchain era, as it became clear that auditable, transparent tokens could be created at will (eg. ERC-20s), and the tokens could be securely stored and controlled through digital wallets. Bitcoin itself is an example of a type of community contributed value, where demand to use and hold gives it its value, to the benefit of a worldwide virtual community of early adopters. Ease of creation and use has been enhanced as against paper currencies, at least for the technically adept. Still, no longstanding successful cases of broad local community use have emerged. In fact some, such as CityCoins, have been notorious failures.</p><p>It seems that auditability, transparency and digital wallets are not enough. Other key issues&nbsp;are:</p>  community currencies still require some sophisticated engineering capability to implement  there is no method for easy, reliable convertibility into the prevailing fiat currency, nor can conversion rates hope to be predictable or stable, even in the short&nbsp;term  there is no easy way to safely and measurably capture the Community Contributed Value  there are no additional enhancements to community or the currency through attached digital goods and a new digital goods&nbsp;economy   New Solutions — Bancor; Verus, public blockchains as a&nbsp;service <p>It is likely that, were these problems solved, and ease of digital wallet use addressed (along with personal privacy), motivated communities would find it far easier to bootstrap use of a community currency {“CommCurr”}. Imagine being able to spend your CommCurr anywhere in the community, from the babysitter to the gas station to the bank, and have it accepted with ease because the recipient knows that they can convert it easily and immediately, and without a counterparty, at the push of a button, to the USD, on a 1:1 basis (or very near thereabouts). And if community members could measurably observe the amount of Community Contributed Value that was emerging through widespread and persistent use, CommCurr would be easy to promote, and hard to&nbsp;resist.</p><p>One of the best efforts to deal with convertibility in community currencies is the project Bancor. They pioneered onchain reserves as part of a currency’s definition, dynamically expanding and retracting supply, tied to use, and the ability to convert directly to and from other currencies, using locked onchain reserves as a fractional backing. This proof of concept has existed since the first version of Bancor, as a smart contract capability on Ethereum. For any community, each particular implementation of a smart contract would need to be designed, engineered and audited by experts, in this case Bancor developers. But Bancor is a heavily funded venture business at root, having raised hundreds of millions of dollars in an ICO. Development of community currencies doesn’t pay, unlike commercially-driven defi, so Bancor soon abandoned any focus in this&nbsp;area.</p><p>At about the same time as Bancor emerged, former Microsoft fellow Michael Toutonghi, and some associates, released a vision paper focused on making public blockchain infrastructure that can be used by the world. Inspired by bitcoin’s approach to re-imagining money, they aimed for the development of usable blockchain primitives that could form the basis of distributed network applications that provide people a real chance of self-sovereignty and new ways to self-organize in many areas of&nbsp;life.</p><p>They began developing software and protocols, basing off Bitcoin and Zcash, and bootstrapped a worldwide network of self-interested miners and stakers who power a network that is capable of providing public blockchain infrastructure. Fast forward five years, and a good portion of the network has been running for years, providing the first parts of the system. Now, the rest of the full vision (and more) is about to transition from testnet to mainnet, and new capabilities for blockchain are about to become publicly available, including the ability to run advanced Community Currency experiments that are virtually risk-free for communities, can be carried out at low cost, and have several elements that will make them attractive and safe for broad community use.</p><p>Two key points to note about the Verus protocols, software and network&nbsp;are:</p>  no venture capitalists or investors have been involved in its financing or development, so there is no need to extract rent or payment from users to pay back investors — it is rent-free technology, the only payments necessary are network fees to provide sufficient incentive for outsiders to provide their compute resources to power the network;&nbsp;and  Verus does not use smart contracts — it is based on more traditional and longstanding distributed computing paradigms, and users access the software for basic primitives, which they then put into use and combine however they see fit. No contract programming or special blockchain engineering skill is required to carry out sophisticated actions. Recently, on the Verus testnet, one community member (a non-programmer) implemented a powerful community currency example in less than ten minutes with a few simple commands.   Currency Reserves — Convertibility <p>Verus provides the ability to define new tokens/currencies at will, without programming. Various options are available, as tokens carry a multitude of possible uses, from voting to tickets to currencies. For community currency experiments, one of the key options is to lock in reserves that are attached to, and back the value of, the newly issued currency. And, since Verus is bridgeable to and from the Ethereum network, you could back a new currency with ethereum or USDC or any other valuable currency from that&nbsp;network.</p><p>If a CommCurr is defined with reserves backing it, then users can freely mint new currency by converting their USDC, for example, directly to CommCurr. This would build up the locked reserves of CommCurr. Or, they could go the other way around, converting CommCurr into USDC immediately by converting it into its reserves, without any need to find a counterparty. This would reduce the locked reserves. The conversion rate in these situations is driven by Automated Market Maker (AMM) technology, similar to Uniswap, although providing a MEV-resistant fair conversion experience for all users at the lowest possible&nbsp;fees.</p><p>Reserve backing in the Verus protocols is user-selected upon the creation of a currency, ranging from a 5% backing to a 100% backing, Multiple currencies, with arbitrarily selected weights can be used. There is a requirement to use the Verus coin as at least one of the currencies backing CommCurr, or any currency — it needs to represent at least 5% of the backing. This is due to interoperability goals, to ensure that networks built using the Verus protocols stay connected, as a worldwide network of value, where currencies connect to each other throughout.</p><p>These few simple options make for a host of use cases, which will not all be explored here. Instead, we’ll focus on CommCurr and note that a decent implementation might have backing consisting of two currencies — USD (represented by USDC bridged from the Ethereum network), and Verus, weighted 95:5 in favor of&nbsp;USD.</p><p>As a result of having valuable reserves, CommCurr is guaranteed to be valuable, and users can instantly convert in and out of it by simply sending it to themselves, or another person, choosing a conversion option. If a user sends USD and receives CommCurr then the reserves for USD will go up, and two things will happen to CommCurr — it will issue a little bit of new supply, and its value will go up. On the other hand, if a user goes the other way, sending CommCurr for USD, then some CommCurr supply will be automatically burned, and the value of CommCurr will decrease a little. In other words, CommCurr has a dynamically expanding and retracting supply, and a floating conversion rate, depending on the demand for the currency.</p> Capturing the Contributed Value <p>When creating CommCurr the best way to capture value for the community will be to create the currency so that it is only partially backed. For this sample case study, let’s say it’s backed at 80%. A community can easily engineer this precise amount of backing (which never changes, as a percentage, through the life of the currency) by choosing an initial supply of CommCurr, say 1 million, and then contributing 760,000 USD as reserves, and 40,000 dollars worth of Verus as reserves. We’ll avoid going into detailed mechanics here but the result would be that, upon the launch of the currency, the community currency issuer would own 1,000,000 CommCurr, which is 80% backed by real value, but is convertible, as its initial price to acquire or to sell, 1:1 with the&nbsp;USD.</p><p>Now, as we described above, if the issuer just starts converting their initial holdings of CommCurr (1 million units) into USD, they’ll start depleting the reserves and driving down the value of the currency. In fact, if they just dumped it all, they’d get all their initially contributed reserves back and the currency would be rendered virtually worthless. So, instead of doing that, they’ll encourage use by the community. Perhaps they’ll simply promote its use, or maybe they’ll offer small discounts on community services, and encourage others to do so, to bootstrap use. The overall idea would be to encourage use by the community at large. If use emerges, and people start to acquire the currency (by contributing USD into the reserves), and the issuing community does not sell any of its initial holdings, the value of CommCurr will begin to creep up (provided that not all of this currency is immediately converted back by the recipients). Under these circumstances, It should be easy enough for community members to become comfortable with the value of CommCurr, as they see that it can always be acquired and disposed for USD, immediately, and at a predictable and stable price. It’s important to note that if the issuing community doesn’t sell/convert any of its holdings it is *impossible* that the value of CommCurr would fall below its initial value of 1:1 vis-a-vis the&nbsp;USD.</p><p>If regular use persists, there will be constant demand for the currency and a certain float will begin to remain in circulation. In our example, let’s say the community reaches the point where 100,000 CommCurr is more or less always outstanding, in some form of transit circulating through, or being held by, the community. This would tend to increase the value of CommCurr some amount. But, instead of allowing the currency to appreciate, the Community could begin to draw down on some of the 1,000,000 of initial supply that it holds in its reserves. In fact, in this example, they’d need to convert 100,000 of that supply into USD just to keep the price pegged 1:1 with the&nbsp;USD.</p><p>So now we would have an exact measure of Community Contributed Value — in this case it’s 20% of $100,000 = $20,000. If the demand in the community created a persistent float of $1 million, the issuer could draw down their entire supply converting it into USD, and it would still be backed at its original amount, and still be convertible 1:1 with&nbsp;USD..</p> No Free Lunch (well, maybe a free appetizer) <p>Did the issuer just make $1 million? No. Remember they had to commit $800,000 of value in the first place to set this up. And, although that investment is never at risk (they can always just convert everything into the reserves at any time to recoup them), there is a certain upfront capital cost there. However, they did clearly make $200,000, which, in this case would be a measurable amount of Community Contributed Value that they captured. There are also some minimal network costs to set this up on the Verus network, which is paid to the miners and stakers, as block rewards, for mining the Verus blockchain, and powering all the community’s transactions. At current rates, it would amount to less than $200. Overall, the cost/risk/reward matrix is attractive.</p><p>It is important to remember that all of this is transparent and auditable, being on a public blockchain. Community members would be in instant possession of all relevant information about currency supplies, reserves, spending, conversion, etc. by the CommCurr creators.</p><p>Community members would have transparency on their spending too, which is unfortunate. However, as a fork of zcash, Verus does offer private transactions on its native currency, Verus, and so there would be methods for users (or preferably, their apps) to help protect the spending privacy of community members.</p> Governance <p>There are other blockchain primitives that Verus enables which enhance CommCurr as an attractive and low-risk method to create Community Contributed Value. First, the protocols allow for virtually unlimited flexibility with respect to the governance of who is in control of the initial holdings of CommCurr. Multiple signatures could be required, up to, for example, 13 of 25, to authorize any spending or conversion activity. This would allow for fairly sophisticated approval mechanisms and safeguards for communities that are implementing this type of experiment.</p> Moral Hazard — Escrow <p>Another blockchain primitive is the ability to provably and irrevocably lock digital wallets for an arbitrary period of time (up to 21 years). In this way, a community issuer could reduce concerns about the moral hazard of dumping their holdings and crushing the value of a growing CommCurr. They can choose to stagger escrows, making, say, 10% freely spendable now, and then unlocking 10% a year after that. One aspect to consider is that, if a lock is made irrevocable, it will build in capital cost risk for a community. Ie. if the experiment is a failure and there’s no adoption, they wouldn’t have access to their original capital until the unlock period&nbsp;passes.</p> Wait, There’s More — Enhancing the Community Currency through New Capabilities for a Digital Goods Economy that Directly and Tangibly Benefits the&nbsp;Currency <p>Possibly the most forward-thinking element of a Community Currency is the ability to build a real digital goods economy around it. The Verus protocols make this possible through the issuance of what are called SubIDs. SubIDs are multi-use friendly name “identities”. Community members can register these names by paying a set amount of CommCurr, for example, 10 CommCurr per registration. This increases the value of CommCurr because any amounts paid for the “identities” are burned, thus increasing the value of the currency for all holders thereof (including the original&nbsp;issuer).</p><p>Community members might seek to register identities for many&nbsp;reasons:</p>  to signal support for the community  to have a recognizable or branded community-oriented name to receive funds, eg. “member.CommCurr@”  to create a NFT or public profile attached to the name (“identities” are capable of being expressed as nfts, artwork, public profiles, etc.)  to be a ticket for an event or a discount code for purchases, or a membership in a&nbsp;club  To be attached to a physical item, like a community landmark, where it can represent a public profile or description, fundraiser, message board,&nbsp;etc.  <p>These are just some of the virtually unlimited examples of digital goods that could be created, all of which would require CommCurr to acquire, this creating a real demand for the currency.</p> Conclusions <p>These are new blockchain capabilities. They do not currently exist on Ethereum or other smart contract blockchains because the interplay of such different elements would seem to create overwhelming complexity, requiring the use of multiple inter-operating contracts to implement. Certainly, such comprehensive and flexible solutions could not be carried out in minutes through the use of a few simple commands.</p><p>Currently, all of these capabilities exist in the Verus protocols and are in use on testnet. A mainnet activation is imminent, and communities can soon start to experiment, at the smallest initial scales they desire. It’s important to note, however, that additional software development would be required to make some of these elements easy and safe to use for the broader community. As a FOSS project, Verus encourages communities to work together, and with the Verus developer community to create open source apps that leverage the protocols, so that all communities worldwide can benefit from the resulting development.</p><p><a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">Discuss and explore all Verus has to offer on&nbsp;Discord</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/VerusCoin">Follow on&nbsp;Twitter</a></p><p><a href="http://www.verus.io">Go to&nbsp;verus.io</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/community-currencies-a-case-study-to-explore-new-technical-possibilities-ede897433b55">Community Currencies: A Case Study to Explore New Technical Possibilities</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin">Verus Coin</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The road to zero trust can be bumpy for nearly any organization. While CISOs need to make data and services accessible to their users, they also need to protect the same data and services in order to prevent breaches. This means that security leaders need to balance the risk between easy access and advanced controls when moving toward a zero trust architecture.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it only takes one point of access for a bad actor to gain access to critical company systems. For example, recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/robinhood-data-breach/">Robinhood</a> discovered that millions of its customers’ names and email addresses were stolen in a data breach after a cyber criminal socially engineered a customer service representative via phone to gain access to customer support systems.</p>
<p>Similarly, on March 18th 2022, <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/en-us/march-2022-security-incident">Hubspot</a> reported that a malicious actor compromised a Hubspot employee account and leaked customer contact data.</p>
<p>As we can see from these recent incidents, user credentials are still the attack vector of choice for many cybercriminals. While most organizations have implemented 2FA, MFA and passwordless solutions to harden security, hackers and their attack methods are becoming even more sophisticated. Here is a non-exhaustive list of ways that hackers could get around 2FA, MFA and some passwordless solutions:</p>
 
 SIM swap to steal <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/whitepapers/2fa-and-mfa-capabilities/">2FA</a> codes 
 Convince a phone company to change a phone number associated with an account 
 Email helpdesk and request a phone number change 
 Target systems that are difficult to harden security 
 Convince user to link biometrics to criminal’s phone 
 
<p>All of these attacks are impossible to defeat without proving identity with real biometrics. Proving identity and to help meet Zero Trust guidelines requires a solution that:<br>
1) Establishes identity<br>
2) Proves authentication with the established identity</p>
<p>With this identity-based approach to authentication, identity is at the forefront of security so that organizations implementing a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/whitepapers/zero-trust/">Zero Trust</a> infrastructure know with certainty who is accessing IT assets and online services.</p>
<p>When users have a quick and convenient way to self verify their identity using government, telco, and banking credentials, they can use their verified digital identity at login or transaction approval. This identity pre-proofing injects a level of trust into the Zero Trust implementation and provides users with a frictionless experience. Organizations will implement their Zero Trust deployment with a significantly improved access user experience and a high level of assurance for the identity on the other side of the digital connection.</p>
<p>However, security leaders need to remember that not every system is created equal. While SSO can be used on many systems, they will still require additional security to prevent breaches. 1Kosmos BlockID will harden the security on these systems by adding passwordless, identity-based authentication and a secure password reset if or when needed.</p>
<p>In the instances where applications and systems don’t allow for an identity-based, passwordless experience a password is obviously still required. To help protect these systems, 1Kosmos offers an integrated password reset capability that eliminates the need for any assistance from the helpdesk. Through the 1Kosmos BlockID app or user portal, users can easily reset their passwords if and when needed. Integrating a password reset into our technology helps organizations deploy a strong and continuous authentication platform and meet the requirements of a username and password.
