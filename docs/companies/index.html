<p>Data has driven incredible improvements in the way people have experienced financial services over the last decade. Services that once could only be done at bank branches can now be easily accessed online. And people now have powerful financial information, products, and management tools at their fingertips via their mobile devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The expansion of open banking is creating a new turning point in the money experience. Open banking allows consumers to share their financial data with third-party developers and fintechs in exchange for new services—unlocking the potential of financial data to catalyze another generation of innovation across the industry. Services such as providing financial data to build credit and gain immediate access to capital, initiating a direct payment to a business or individual, and managing household expenses and budgets fundamentally change the boundaries of banking relationships.</p>
<p>Responsible data practices are required for participants to best take advantage of this technology. The key differentiator that sets the world of open banking apart from previous innovation environments is the requirement for consumer consent in data sharing and adherence to core data principles: control, access, transparency, traceability, and security (CATTS).</p>
<p>In order to enable open banking and empower customers, data access agreements (DAA) must be in place to ensure access to financial data that financial service providers need to innovate and provide new services and benefits in a digital world. These agreements define common rules for how two parties—usually an open banking platform or financial data aggregator and a financial institution—will communicate and exchange financial data. More secure data access agreements mean more connections that financial service providers can use to empower consumers with greater control over their financial health.&nbsp;</p>
 Finicity’s Market Leadership in Financial Data 
<p>Finicity’s connections cover 95% of direct deposit accounts in North America. And thanks to 20 signed direct access agreements with some of the nation’s largest financial institutions, we support 60% of our traffic with direct API access. We expect that direct-API traffic share to grow to over 80% by the end of 2021, greatly reducing the use of user credentials and screen scraping in the financial services market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since 2017, we have led in signing data access agreements with the top FIs including Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Chase, Fidelity and many others.&nbsp; And, in just the past year, Finicity has worked to strengthen the open banking ecosystem by creating stronger, more secure data access agreements and partnerships with key financial institutions and fintechs, including Charles Schwab, TD Bank, Citi, Brex, Chime, US Bank, and BMO Harris.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And where Finicity has been leading, the market is following. Along with an increasing number of financial institutions and other financial service providers, more payroll providers are recognizing that consumers can benefit from the data they hold. As a result, these providers are adopting API connections to open banking platforms that expand the use of financial data in lending, tenant screening, background checks, government verification and personal financial management.&nbsp; Finicity announced a Direct Access Agreement with the leading payroll provider in September 2020, representing 16% of the payroll provider market.</p>
<p>DAAs provide the broader fintech and financial services community with access, through Finicity, to consumer-permissioned financial data that enables a variety of apps and services across financial management, payments, lending, and beyond. And a key result for all parties is enhanced data stability, accuracy and improved security through reduction of user credentials.</p>
<p>A direct access agreement with Finicity ensures the most reliable data security for financial institutions while still enabling fintechs and financial service providers to deliver solutions that empower consumers and foster financial inclusion.

<p>*SATIRE WARNING*</p>
      
<p>Our April 1st platform update brings increased performance, noticeably faster speed, and groundbreaking security enhancements.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>The highly anticipated No-Factor Authentication (NFA) feature is the pinnacle of cybersecurity innovation. It removes the hassle of logging into workstations and applications by eliminating the need to log in…altogether. </p>
      
<p>That’s right — we’ve gotten rid of the login screen completely, so there is no barrier to entry.*&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      
<p></p>
      

      
 Instant Access for Anyone, Anywhere 
      
<p>No-factor login means you don’t need to prove who you are. By eliminating the authentication flow, your teams will enjoy an unrivaled sense of freedom when logging in. Just sit down at your computer, and begin using it. Nothing else is required —&nbsp;no password, token, biometric, nothing. </p>
      
<p>Arguably, this approach is more secure than a password.</p>
      
<p></p>
      

      
 Easy Logout 
      
<p>Logging out has never been easier. You don’t need to log out, because you were never really logged in. Feel free to get up from the computer, walk away from it (leaving it in any state), and when returning it is simply open and available to you.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>A seamless logout experience is only possible with No-factor authentication.</p>
      
<p></p>
      
 How It Works: Bleeding-Edge Technology 
      
<p>From machine learning to Zero Trust architecture to immutable blockchain-based identity stores, NFA combines the latest buzzwords to achieve bleeding-edge innovation. </p>
      

      
<p>All the user needs to do is show up. HYPR’s NFA architecture handles the rest. Our R&amp;D team has been working tirelessly on eliminating login and what you see today is the culmination of decades of hard work.</p>
      
<p></p>
      

      
 Super Low Pricing 
      
<p>Looking for great ROI when sourcing a security product? How about one that requires no investment?  </p>
      
<p>If you’ve come this far, then by now you’ve probably realized that this feature doesn’t exist, so you’ll never have to pay for it. Happy April Fool’s Day 2021.</p>
      
<p>* Electricity and internet connection are still required.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cisco has released its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/doing_business/trust-center/docs/cisco-privacy-benchmark-study-2021.pdf">Data Privacy Benchmark Study 2021</a>&nbsp;and it’s got some revealing insights for enterprise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly,&nbsp;this&nbsp;year’s study is framed&nbsp;around&nbsp;COVID-19&nbsp;and&nbsp;reveals the pandemic has&nbsp;significantly&nbsp;elevated the importance of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>&nbsp;as a business priority.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cisco&nbsp;says: “The reaffirmation of privacy’s value even during the pandemic positions it as a priority for years to come. Privacy is no longer an afterthought; it is core to how we work and interact with each other. The Age of Privacy has arrived.”&nbsp;We wholeheartedly&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/">agree with these sentiments</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cisco’s Data Privacy Benchmark 2021 is a significant study. It’s an annual survey which, for this&nbsp;2021&nbsp;installment,&nbsp;anonymously&nbsp;surveyed more than 4,700 security professionals from&nbsp;25 geographies&nbsp;in mid-2020.&nbsp;Respondents&nbsp;represented&nbsp;all major industries and organization size. It also&nbsp;drew&nbsp;on&nbsp;data&nbsp;from Cisco’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/doing_business/trust-center/docs/cisco-consumer-privacy-infographic-2020.pdf">2020 Consumer Privacy Survey</a>, which was completed in&nbsp;mid-2020 by 2,600 adults in 12 countries.*&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The&nbsp;four key&nbsp;messages that flow from&nbsp;Cisco’s Data Privacy Benchmark 2021&nbsp;are&nbsp;important&nbsp;for enterprise:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Privacy&nbsp;is helping&nbsp;organizations to overcome the challenges of the pandemic.&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Cisco reports 93 percent of organizations&nbsp;used&nbsp;their privacy team to help&nbsp;navigate and manage&nbsp;their pandemic response&nbsp;in 2020, particularly the rapid shift to remote work and&nbsp;balancing&nbsp;individual rights&nbsp;and&nbsp;public safety. Private and secure remote work access and systems and policies for&nbsp;when and how to share employees’ personal information and to limit access to and use of that data&nbsp;are&nbsp;urgent priorities&nbsp;in the pandemic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Investment in privacy&nbsp;has increased&nbsp;and&nbsp;ROI is positive.&nbsp; 



 &nbsp; 



<p>As you’d expect in a pandemic, the study shows&nbsp;privacy budgets&nbsp;across all organization sizes&nbsp;roughly&nbsp;doubled in 2020.&nbsp;The&nbsp;average&nbsp;privacy spend is now USD&nbsp;2.4 million.&nbsp;While&nbsp;ROI&nbsp;on this spend&nbsp;was slightly down compared&nbsp;with2019,&nbsp;it&nbsp;tracked similarly to 2020 and remained&nbsp;solid.&nbsp;Thirty-five percent&nbsp;of respondents&nbsp;reported&nbsp;benefits&nbsp;at least two times&nbsp;their investments&nbsp;in areas such as mitigating losses from data breaches,&nbsp;spurring&nbsp;innovation, achieving operational efficiency, and building trust with customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Tighter privacy laws&nbsp;are welcomed and positively regarded.&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>We recently told you about the new&nbsp;“privacy actives”, a term Cisco coined&nbsp;following&nbsp;its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/global/en_uk/products/collateral/security/cybersecurity-series-2019-cps.pdf">2019&nbsp;Consumer Privacy Survey</a>.&nbsp;‘Privacy actives’ are highly motivated privacy-aware individuals&nbsp;who&nbsp;care about privacy,&nbsp;are willing to act to protect theirs, and&nbsp;are proactive&nbsp;about it.&nbsp;The latest Cisco data shows organizations are recognizing and responding to this new influential demographic and accept that consumers won’t buy their products and services if they perceive a risk to their personal information&nbsp;from the company’s data practices and policies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As such,&nbsp;the steady tightening of privacy laws globally,&nbsp;which&nbsp;promote&nbsp;greater transparency, fairness and accountability,&nbsp;are being welcomed and positively regarded by&nbsp;both&nbsp;enterprise and consumers. Cisco&nbsp;reports&nbsp;that 79 percent&nbsp;of organizations indicated&nbsp;privacy regulations&nbsp;are having a positive impact (and only a&nbsp;5&nbsp;percent&nbsp;negative impact).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read more about&nbsp;how&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/privacy-regulations-are-picking-up-pace/">privacy regulations&nbsp;are&nbsp;picking up pace</a>&nbsp;at the state level in the US and around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Privacy is&nbsp;becoming&nbsp;even more&nbsp;critical to the bottom line.&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Cisco has several key findings in this area:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  90&nbsp;percent of respondents agreed&nbsp;that external privacy certifications, such as&nbsp;ISO 27701, APEC Cross-Border Privacy Rules, and EU Binding Corporate Rules,&nbsp;are an important buying factor when choosing a product or vendor.&nbsp;  Organizations with more mature privacy practices are&nbsp;enjoying greater&nbsp;business benefits than average and are&nbsp;in a stronger position&nbsp;to handle new and evolving privacy regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;  More security professionals&nbsp;say&nbsp;data&nbsp;privacy&nbsp;is now a core requirement of their role, and&nbsp;93&nbsp;percent of organizations&nbsp;are reporting&nbsp;privacy metrics&nbsp;such as&nbsp;privacy program audit findings, privacy impact assessments, and data breaches to their&nbsp;board.&nbsp;  



<p>All these findings&nbsp;point to the fact the pandemic has strengthened&nbsp;the commitment to privacy&nbsp;globally.&nbsp;As the report summarizes: “Privacy budgets have increased over the last year, organizations have more resources focused on privacy, and privacy investments going above and beyond the law are translating into real business value. Privacy legislation and external certifications are providing assurance in a business environment where it’s hard to know whom to trust. Consumers are exercising their privacy rights and demanding enforcement of existing privacy protections.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed,&nbsp;Cisco could not be plainer in its assessment of privacy’s importance to business&nbsp;as we move further into 2021:&nbsp;“Organizations that get privacy right improve trust with their customers, operational efficiency, and both top-line and bottom-line results.”&nbsp;</p>

 Already integrated by SAP and rfxcel, the Spherity Credentialing Service is now ready to be shipped to the&nbsp;market <p>Spherity announces the launch of its new product: The Spherity Credentialing Service, which sets the benchmark for compliance solutions in the field of trading partner verification and is available from today. The product establishes trust in digital interactions between trading partners in pharmaceutical supply chains and ensures compliance with the U.S. Drug Supply Chain Security Act&nbsp;(DSCSA).</p>Spherity Credentialing Service — Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@aronvisuals?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Aron&nbsp;Visuals</a><p>We are proud that Novartis, as an innovation leader, is looking to adopt the Spherity Credentialing Service. David Mason, Regional Serialization Lead at Novartis says that “Using credentialing is the first proven digital solution for our industry that addresses the ATP compliance gap of knowing if the counterparty is an Authorized Trading Partner. This is a foundation to meet DSCSA requirements by&nbsp;2023.”</p><p>SAP and <a href="https://rfxcel.com/rfxcel-adopts-open-credentialing-initiative-oci-meet-dscsa-authorized-trading-partner-atp-requirements/">rfxcel</a> have integrated the Spherity Credentialing Service within their verification routing service solutions to be able to share and verify the Authorized Trading Partner (ATP) status in product verifications. Herb Wong, Vice President of Marketing &amp; Strategic Initiatives at rfxcel says “The Credentialing Service is the most comprehensive effort to address the upcoming Authorized Trading Partner requirement for DSCSA. rfxcel was impressed to see how seamlessly it integrated with our solution.” Dr. Oliver Nuernberg, Chief Product Owner at SAP says “For SAP, one of the key requirements was to ensure that the existing returns verification process is not impacted by adding credentialing. By making the credentialing optional, we further ensure that our customers can add this capability over time without disrupting existing processes.”</p><p>The <a href="https://spherity.com/credentialing-service/">Spherity Credentialing Service</a> enables supply chain actors to verify in real time that they are only exchanging information with Authorized Trading Partners (ATP), as per DSCSA requirements, even when they do not have a direct business relationship yet. The Spherity Credentialing Service integrated Legisym as credential issuer and is based on the ATP architecture that was tested by an industry wide pilot. Beyond DSCSA compliance, Spherity leverages process efficiencies of exchanging data with indirect business partners by avoiding manual and time consuming due diligence processes. Saving significant time and money for all participants in the ecosystem.</p><p>To drive the utilization of decentralized digital identity technologies across the industry, Spherity participates in the newly founded Open Credentialing Initiative (OCI). As an industry consortium, this initiative incubates the ATP architecture and governs further standardization efforts.</p><p>“Using ATP credentials for product verification interactions is just the tip of the iceberg. The established enterprise identities and associated verifiable credentials will leverage efficiency to exchange data in regulated environments”, says Georg Jürgens, Manager Industry Solutions at Spherity.</p> About Spherity <p><a href="https://spherity.com/">Spherity</a> is building decentralized digital identity management solutions to power the fourth industrial revolution, bringing secure identities to enterprises, machines, products, data and even algorithms. We provide the enabling technology to digitize and automate compliance processes primarily in highly-regulated technical sectors like pharmaceuticals, automotive and logistics.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/fisher">Paul Fisher</a></p><p>I have been covering cybersecurity issues, first as a journalist then as an analyst, since 2006. In that 15 years I have heard the mantra that security is a boardroom issue hundreds of times. The subject has filled countless conference talks and media articles.</p>
<p>It appears that the message is still not getting through if a <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/ncsc-ceo-first-speech" title="speech by the new CEO of the UK National Cyber Security Centre">speech by the new CEO of the UK National Cyber Security Centre</a> (NCSC) anything is to go by. In her first public speaking engagement in March this year, Lindy Cameron, said, you guessed it folks, security must be given more attention in&nbsp;the boardroom.</p>
<p>“Cybersecurity is still not taken as seriously as it should be, and simply is not embedded in UK boardrooms. The pace of change is no excuse — in boardrooms, digital literacy is as non-negotiable as financial or legal literacy,” she said.</p>
<p>“Our CEOs should be as close to their CISO as their finance director and general counsel, and we want to help them to develop this knowledge, as we’re all too aware that cyber-skills are not yet fundamental to our education — even though these are life skills like wiring a plug or changing a tyre as well as skills for the future digital economy.”</p>
<p>Fine words and reported diligently by a few security media outlets in between the latest sensational cyber-attacks. But why has it not changed – and more importantly, does it even matter?</p>
 Have a cigar? 
<p>I take issue that cybersecurity is “not taken seriously” by CEOs etc. I believe they are more than aware of the risk of cyber-attacks. But there is a crucial difference between taking an issue seriously and making it a regular “embedded” boardroom issue - one discussed and approved by directors at all time. This is what many aspire to and to get there, security people are told they must speak the “language of business” for budget approval and to get things done.</p>
<p>I am not sure those who want a seat at the table will ever find one. Perhaps security is not a regular boardroom issue because the board simply expects the CISO and everyone in the hierarchy beneath them to get on with the job. It also betrays a lack of awareness by the “cyber is a boardroom issue” lobby as to <a href="https://hbr.org/2008/04/leading-from-the-boardroom" title="what board meetings consist of">what board meetings consist of</a>.</p>
 Mind your language 
<p>Very often this debate is framed around language – the Board does not care because CISOs only talk in technical terms they do not understand. If security people can frame security needs and projects with “normal” business language, then more budget may be forthcoming or new policies could be approved. I’m not so sure this makes a difference.</p>
<p>Other than reducing people-based incidents such as phishing through awareness training (not usually successful in the long term), reducing cyber risk is almost 100% based on the successful management of policies, IT and software. Therefore, it is not unreasonable for a CEO and the board to consider it primarily an IT issue.</p>
<p>There are articles, books even, which explain how to get boardroom buy-in – yet the amount of activity and social interaction that these entails would preclude the CISO from doing much else. Other organizations are simply too small to have an expensive and dedicated CISO function – so they rely on managed security services. The board then simply expects that company to do what it says on the tin.</p>
<p>Unlike finance, HR, marketing, R&amp;D and other LOBs, IT security is a function of risk and event management and not one of creative development - it is a negative asset- one that organizations would gladly pay less for if they could. Security does not lead to innovation, create new markets, design new products and services or consider the impact of M&amp;A, ROI, or P&amp;L. It is however a cost entry in the auditor’s report.</p>
 Focus on technology not theory 
<p>For her first speech, Linda Cameron would have done to better to focus on how advanced technology, automation and better deigned security tools are doing more keep organizations safe than trotting out a tired line about security’s battle to be taken seriously by the board.</p>
<p>Outside of this diversion the best CISOs, CIOs and IT managers are putting in place security technologies that focus on the end user by working with vendors and analysts to find the right solution. They are making employees lives easier by deploying solutions that provide privileged access, single sign on, secure remote access etc without security controls getting in the way. This is surely making security a business issue -without needing boardroom approval.</p>
<p>Given the workload of most CISOs right now, not having to worry about speaking to the board would probably come as a relief. Of course, the one time a CISO may be summoned to the board is when there is a serious breach, but no-one ever said life was fair.</p>

   Getting these elements right can be the dividing line between IoT chaos or control 

<p>Too many vendor-based IoT blogs and articles go like this:</p>

  AMAZING STATISTIC on the exponential growth of IoT! (Hint: It’s huge!) 
	 SCARY STATISTIC on how out of control the situation is. (Note: It’s very, very out of control!) 
	 (ANOTHER) SCARY STATISTIC on how a single compromised device can imperil your entire organization. 
	 CONCLUSION: Buy our stuff. 
 <p>These basic tenets are obvious and generally well understood by anybody in the orbit of IT. Missing here, however, is what are the essential elements that are needed to get your Internet of Things (IoT) project off the ground. What should you be looking for or careful not to miss? Based on my conversations with many customers in all industries and in all phases of their IoT projects, I’ve put together six must-haves that need to be in any IoT plan.&nbsp;</p>

 Must-Have #1: Support for Smart Devices 

<p>IoT devices come in several different flavors. A common one is the “smart device.” Smart devices are small computers: they are IP addressable, have a microprocessor, communicate using a protocol (Wi-Fi, Z-wave, or other), and have memory storage for an X.509 certificate, which is a public key cryptographic document used to secure the device. A smart IoT device can perform some complex tasks, and some even have a user interface (UI) that can be accessed. Your IoT plan needs to make provisions for how to manage these smart devices, including how to update software, if allowed. Your plan should also take into account how to install and refresh a security certificate. And, it should address how to manage these devices like any other computer on your network. But aren’t all IoT devices “smart” you may ask? Read on to find out.</p>

 Must-Have #2: Support for Constrained Devices 

<p>Not all IoT devices are “smart”. In fact, quite a few are just inexpensive, single-purpose devices that sit at the edge of the network and communicate through a gateway. These are known as “constrained” devices because they are limited – or constrained – in how much you can interface with the device or customize it for your environment. An example is a simple temperature sensor. But that doesn’t mean you can ignore them. The truth is you’ll have both smart and constrained devices on your network, and you need a solution that can manage both.</p>

 Must-Have #3: Support for Offline Capabilities 

<p>Think of where IoT devices are installed. While most are operating within the comfortable confines of the network WiFi, many others are mobile or far afield in places like factories, oil platforms, utility buildings, cars, and the like. Communications may be intermittent. A critical, often overlooked element in IoT plans is how do you support the offline nature of IoT devices? In particular, how do you authenticate devices to ensure they can continue to do their jobs while momentarily unable to connect to the network? A well-executed IoT plan should account for how offline devices can be secured and authenticated while off the network. Also needing to be accounted for is what happens when they rejoin the network in terms of synchronization with policy changes and event logs.</p>

 Must-Have #4: Manage IoT and Humans With a Common Platform 

<p>Who wants one more platform to manage? My guess is nobody. In that case, you need to manage your IoT devices like you do your users – with the same<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform"> identity platform</a>. This can be done because the users and devices share similar management and lifecycle needs. Just as you have users join your organization, gain various levels of access, and eventually leave, you also need to verify your IoT devices, authenticate them, give them various levels of access, and then eventually terminate their access and retire them. After all, the principles of least privileges and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/what-entitlement-creep">entitlement creep</a> apply to non-human identities as well. Doing this on a common platform will allow you to manage both human and IoT assets through a common interface.</p>

 Must-Have #5: Integration with Leading IoT Platforms 

<p>The leading cloud platform providers – Google, Amazon, and Microsoft – all have their IoT management features. Best of all, their basic capabilities are often low-cost or even free to use. This is great, but it’s just a starting point. While those vendors offer deep analytics capabilities, they stop where real <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-management">identity management</a> capabilities are needed. The cloud providers hand these capabilities off to the IoT application that can manage and secure the IoT devices. That’s why selecting a vendor that has tight integration into your chosen cloud vendor’s platform is essential.&nbsp;</p>

 Must-Have #6: Automatic Authentication, Authorization, and Registration 

<p>Just as it is increasingly difficult – or almost impossible to manually manage the sprawl of identities in your environment – it is nearly impossible to manage all the IoT devices connecting to your network on a daily basis. Once devices are known on the network, a good IoT platform can automatically register devices when they turn on and automatically authenticate them. Automation is the only way to handle IoT projects. Make sure you include vendors who have an automated approach.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/iot">ForgeRock IoT</a> can provide all the must-haves on our list. Getting your IoT projects off the ground and doing it right the first time with these critical capabilities can mean the difference between having a smooth, automated, secure IoT infrastructure that drives your business forward with confidence, or one that takes you into chaos. <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/contact">Contact ForgeRock</a> to learn more about how our experts can help you with your IoT projects.</p>

 Protecting Your Driver’s License — A Use Case for Verifiable Credentials <p>A driver’s license may seem like a simple card that you carry around with you every day, but it can have serious consequences if it falls into the wrong&nbsp;hands.</p><p>Well, let’s imagine for a moment that your wallet containing a few credit cards, your driver’s license, and some cash, is stolen. You would immediately call the credit card companies and let them know about the theft. But what about the driver’s&nbsp;license?</p><p>It can be a time-consuming process to report the theft by which time the thief would have impersonated you with your Personally Identifiable Information!</p><p>What’s a better way to avoid this situation?</p><p>Go for self-sovereign identities (SSI) and <a href="https://medium.com/affinidi/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credentials</a> because they are private, immutable, secure, and available only in your digital wallet, so you can access it at any time and share it with anyone without ever worrying about losing&nbsp;it.</p> Driver’s License and&nbsp;SSI <p>Let’s take a peek into how you can apply, share, and safeguard your driver’s license through&nbsp;SSI.</p><p>In this example, let’s assume that the applicant wants to use the driver’s license to rent a car from a car rental&nbsp;company.</p><p>There are three parties involved, and they&nbsp;are:</p>  Issuer — A startup company that issues standard and interoperable driver license Verifiable Credential (VC) after validating the government-issued driver’s&nbsp;license  Holder — An individual applying for the interoperable driver license&nbsp;VC  Verifier — The car rental&nbsp;company  Creating and Managing a Driver’s License&nbsp;VC<p>Here’s the step-by-step process.</p>  The holder goes to the issuer’s portal to submit the details to get the verifiable credential for the driver’s license. He/she fills up the form and submits&nbsp;it.  The issuer checks the application and issues the verifiable credential to the&nbsp;holder.  The issuer sends the verifiable credential in the form of a QR code, by mail, to the&nbsp;holder.  The holder gets the QR code, scans it using the Wallet application, and saves it to his/her&nbsp;wallet.  The holder goes to the verifier’s website or office and scans the QR&nbsp;code.  The holder checks the Credential Share Request and approves it to share his/her Verifiable Presentation to the verifier, and waits for the confirmation.  The verifier logs into the admin account, checks the list of applications, and verifies the credentials. On confirmation, the verifier rents a car to the&nbsp;holder.  <p>As you can see, the biggest advantage of such an SSI-based driver’s license is that there’s absolutely no possibility of loss. Furthermore, there is no question of your PII on the license to fall into the wrong hands because the holder has complete control over how it is used and with whom it is shared. So, no more worries about losing your driver’s license and facing its repercussions.</p><p>At the same time, it’s simple to implement, foolproof, and saves time and effort for everyone.</p><p>So, are you ready to leverage this power of SSI? Reach out to <a href="mailto:contact@affinidi.com">contact@affinidi.com</a> to explore how we can help you in this exciting&nbsp;journey.</p><p>You can also join our <a href="https://affinidipocathon.devpost.com/">PoCathon</a> to build a similar Proof of Concept using Affinidi’s resources.</p><p>Hop on the bandwagon and be a part of a new revolution in privacy and trust generation.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/affinidi/protecting-your-drivers-license-a-use-case-for-verifiable-credentials-25d22aeac05b">Protecting Your Driver’s License — A Use Case for Verifiable Credentials</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/affinidi">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Mathieu: Jimmy, thank you for&nbsp;doing this with me.</p>
<p>Jimmy: Thank you for having me on; I’m looking&nbsp;forward to it.</p>
<p>Mathieu: We’re doing some&nbsp;cool stuff in the self-sovereign identity space,&nbsp;and we’ll get to that&nbsp;in a few minutes. I was curious — I know&nbsp;you come from the crypto space. It seems that a lot of people in the&nbsp;self-sovereign identity community come from crypto backgrounds. Conversely, there are a lot&nbsp;of people in the self-sovereign&nbsp;identity community who try to&nbsp;distance themselves from crypto, but&nbsp;there is some tie there.&nbsp;Did you come from the crypto space?</p>
<p>Jimmy: I’d say,&nbsp;technically, yes. Although, at this moment,&nbsp;all of that is very nuanced. It’s logical&nbsp;that a lot of people come from a crypto background, because the whole&nbsp;idea of decentralization and everything&nbsp;associated with it, is the same&nbsp;mentality that’s carried over. I think it’s good that&nbsp;crypto and SSI have been parting ways a bit.</p>
<p>I entered the crypto space in 2015-2016 through Bitcoin&nbsp;and then Ethereum; mostly being super-interested in the technology, and just geeking out, diving into it. At some point, I met my&nbsp;co-founders from <a href="https://tykn.tech/">Tykn</a>, and they came from the same space.&nbsp;We saw this big identity problem,&nbsp;and I thought, “Okay, can we marry&nbsp;this idea&nbsp;of decentralization with the problem of identity and&nbsp;privacy and everything?” That was at a&nbsp;very naive stage in early 2017, when everything to do with self-sovereign identity and decentralized identity began to emerge. All those&nbsp;ideas&nbsp;are still very rudimentary; you just hash a certain identifier, and&nbsp;you put that on the chain. No one had said, “Maybe that’s a privacy concern&nbsp;and a correlation concern.”</p>
<p>Everyone was very excited about the potential of these&nbsp;ideas. We built some early proofs-of-concept on Ethereum; at a time when&nbsp;you didn’t have ERC 725, it was&nbsp;just ESC 20s. We saw that this is a lot&nbsp;more complicated than it should be when you’re talking about&nbsp;people needing to have tokens in their&nbsp;wallets to interact with this. The UX was truly a nightmare, even conceptually.</p>
<p>At the time, people also had this idea of verifying credentials when paying for things like gas, which didn’t seem like a very good idea. At a certain point, we saw a group of like-minded&nbsp;people within Sovrin, which had&nbsp;only a couple of other stewards at the&nbsp;time&nbsp;(I think we were the ninth when we onboarded in June or July 2017).&nbsp;They’d been working on&nbsp;this concept of self-sovereign identity for a while. We hooked in on that; we saw,&nbsp;“Okay, these&nbsp;guys have done a lot of work&nbsp;that we thought we still had to do.” So, we dove&nbsp;into that and started flying the&nbsp;sovereign/SSI flag. Shortly after that, we started&nbsp;working with The Netherlands’ Red Cross through the&nbsp;510 data team. For us, that was a very valuable experience in needing&nbsp;to make these things work for people&nbsp;on the ground floor and for high-stakes situations. That was&nbsp;very valuable from the perspective of privacy and the implications. We didn’t want to have any perverse incentives,&nbsp;which you also see in certain models. For example, this is one that’s still&nbsp;around: it’s the idea of data marketplaces. In the humanitarian&nbsp;sector, at least, people were pitching&nbsp;this idea of data marketplaces, where refugees and people who’d been&nbsp;struck by disaster&nbsp;could sell their data. They&nbsp;would get money for it, and then they&nbsp;could use that to sustain themselves.&nbsp;That sounds&nbsp;good, in the sense that, “Oh, you’re&nbsp;empowering people with the&nbsp;power of data; we are giving all&nbsp;this data away anyway, and now — power to&nbsp;the people who can use this to get financial&nbsp;freedom.” But, when you’re&nbsp;talking about people who have been put into such a&nbsp;situation, they will, of course, always sell their&nbsp;data. That’s a perverse incentive, because, at that point, they don’t really have a&nbsp;choice — which&nbsp;doesn’t scale very well. Coming&nbsp;face to face with those realizations&nbsp;was very good for us early on.</p>
<p>Mathieu: We came from the&nbsp;crypto space as well; it was similar to Tykn, in that&nbsp;we had done some early POCs on Ethereum and on some other chains. It was the same problem back in the early days: “Yeah, let’s just throw everything on&nbsp;here, let’s disregard anything else. Yay for immutability,&nbsp;yay for not being able to rewrite&nbsp;data and history, let’s go!”</p>
<p>Then, you realize&nbsp;quite quickly that this doesn’t work. It doesn’t even work for&nbsp;a use case of buying gas, or going to buy a bottle of alcohol. It is interesting; people who come from that space,&nbsp;they get decentralized identity, or they&nbsp;<a href="https://northernblock.io/">get self-sovereign identity</a>. It’s&nbsp;more the concept, and not necessarily&nbsp;the implementation, the technology, or the&nbsp;governance, or everything that you could go&nbsp;into. Conceptually, it makes&nbsp;sense. I believe that many people who are advocates for crypto get that right. You gave a presentation earlier this year at the <a href="https://www.btcmiami.com/">North&nbsp;American Bitcoin Conference</a>.&nbsp; I attended&nbsp;that conference in December 2017, which was when the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/initial-coin-offering-ico.asp">Initial Coin Offerings</a> (ICO) were peaking, and it was crazy.</p>
<p>Jimmy: We were there at the same time, then. It&nbsp;was probably January 2018, the one in Miami.</p>
<p>Mathieu: It was&nbsp;crazy! There were close to 100 presenters at that conference,&nbsp;and half of them were ICO pitches. It was unbelievable.</p>
<p>Jimmy: That was nuts. We were actually one&nbsp;of the companies presenting, but we&nbsp;weren’t presenting an ICO,&nbsp;and so we stood out in that&nbsp;way. We actually had a booth&nbsp;there as well, and that was the conference&nbsp;where we unveiled&nbsp;our collaboration with the 510 global initiative of the Red Cross, which was done the month before. There were so many ICOs. I was there with Khalid, and I remember the guys next to us. They didn’t really feel&nbsp;right to me; there was something about how&nbsp;they interacted with people that was very&nbsp;defensive. Two months later, they were&nbsp;indicted for&nbsp;securities fraud for 40 million&nbsp;or something.</p>
<p>Mathieu: You can still see&nbsp;some of those classic memes today in crypto: there’s a guy at a party with a Bitcoin&nbsp;Christmas sweater and a guy with an&nbsp;Ethereum&nbsp;sweater, that comes from around that timeframe. It was just pure craziness.</p>
<p>Jimmy:  That was peak madness, because&nbsp;that’s when the market had topped the week before. It was just all-round “Lambo&nbsp;Moon” hype madness.</p>
<p>At the same time, barring those projects, a lot of good things have come out of&nbsp;this as well. What was&nbsp;exciting about that time to me, is&nbsp;that I looked around and saw, “Okay, most of these projects; it’s&nbsp;ridiculous, and they shouldn’t exist.” At the same&nbsp;time, I saw that the underlying technology was still&nbsp;so early, and in a way, it was&nbsp;really shitty; there wasn’t much you could do&nbsp;with it. But to me, this was something that’s super early&nbsp;that’s still going to evolve a lot. You could start to ideate what things might look like in five to ten years.&nbsp;So, in that sense, I’ve tried to remain&nbsp;optimistic but also neutral. I can tell you that a lot of the information is pure hype, and in the short term, that’s going&nbsp;to go very wrong.&nbsp;But then, in the long term, there’s&nbsp;an element of this that’s going to&nbsp;survive, and that element is going to be super&nbsp;interesting.</p>
<p>It’s the same with <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/non-fungible-tokens-nft-5115211">Non-Fungible Tokens</a> (NFTs) — a huge hype. A lot of it doesn’t make sense, in that it’s&nbsp;non-persistent. Much of this art is&nbsp;hosted on&nbsp;centralized domains, and the tokens&nbsp;themselves just contain pointers to the&nbsp;centralized domain.&nbsp;If that domain goes down, or if some of these marketplace startups&nbsp;shut down&nbsp;in five to ten years, then your art is gone,&nbsp;and your token’s worthless. That doesn’t&nbsp;make any sense to me.&nbsp;There’s an underlying idea that some of this art that’s created is generative and some not, but it’s actually stored on chain, which is a lot more persistent. I find it interesting that some art will be fully persistent. If we think about how much we are interacting on Zoom and other platforms nowadays, it’s not weird to think that in five years, we’ll get into this “metaverse” idea.</p>
<p>Jamie Burke from Outlier Ventures&nbsp;wrote about the “Open Metaverse”&nbsp;and being involved in these virtual&nbsp;worlds. Of course, having scarcity there is a&nbsp;good idea, just like in the real world.&nbsp;Then that idea becomes appealing, but at the same&nbsp;time,&nbsp;a lot of it is now is hype and it&nbsp;shouldn’t really&nbsp;exist. To clarify, I don’t mean it shouldn’t&nbsp;exist at all; of course, it should, but it doesn’t have persistent, lasting value, and will go through the same cycle.</p>
<p>Mathieu: If you’re thinking about the NFTs&nbsp;today, it’s the same thing as the ICOs were,&nbsp;three years ago. The&nbsp;properties behind it are amazing; the&nbsp;ability to be able to tokenize&nbsp;and create liquidity around pretty much&nbsp;any type of unique asset is quite interesting. Forget “just art”: imagine being able to&nbsp;borrow against it, and to lend against it.&nbsp;There are so many cool things you could do&nbsp;with that.&nbsp; When you went back to&nbsp;the virtual conference this year, you pitched self-sovereign&nbsp;identity&nbsp;to the crypto crowd: How did you&nbsp;approach that?</p>
<p>Jimmy: I try to approach it from a&nbsp;neutral point of view. Oftentimes at these&nbsp;conferences, people pitch their own&nbsp;project or at least shill it, and there’s&nbsp;some financial motivation behind it. The organizers have said, “Don’t do that; try to keep it&nbsp;informational and educational.” That’s what I tried to&nbsp;do. In a couple of slides, I talked about some of the&nbsp;stuff Tykn’s been doing, just from a use case perspective. Really trying to keep it straightforward, as&nbsp;an explanation of&nbsp;how this really works from a high&nbsp;level: how credentials flow, and data flows, and what hits the underlying ledger, and what&nbsp;doesn’t. But then, you already saw in the comments, people asking, “Oh, what’s this project? What’s the&nbsp;token?” No token, no ICO.&nbsp;Just a tech company, building tech&nbsp;stuff.</p>
<p>Mathieu: But, by the way, it could&nbsp;bridge a significant gap between the&nbsp;institutions and crypto, so you want to pay attention.</p>
<p>Jimmy: I wonder when that’s really going to&nbsp;happen. I thought maybe&nbsp;that in this cycle, there would&nbsp;be more of this linkage between&nbsp;the crypto space and SSI space because&nbsp;they’ve separated. I thought maybe some of these <a href="https://northernblock.io/self-sovereign-identity-use-cases-in-fintech/">SSI use cases</a> would start to drip into the crypto space, even just for KYC (Know Your Customer).&nbsp;But now, because of more decentralization&nbsp;in the crypto space, with decentralized&nbsp;exchanges and such, you see that, in fact, demand&nbsp;for KYC is becoming less and less — they’re&nbsp;actually moving away from it. For instance, ShapeShift moved to working with decentralized exchanges. Is there really a demand for&nbsp;that now in the crypto space?</p>
<p>I don’t know. Maybe by the time&nbsp;where you have to&nbsp;essentially dox all your wallets, then&nbsp;it might become more interesting. Maybe once it’s necessary to prove that you own certain wallets that becomes interesting, but so far I haven’t really seen that — which is&nbsp;slightly surprising to me. On the other hand, throughout the bear market, blockchain&nbsp;crypto had a&nbsp;bad rep; so, perhaps it’s good that SSI moved itself away from that. In my opinion, that was rational and a good move, because blockchain and that idea of SSI were so strongly connected. There were many misconceptions. There were journalists writing about us,&nbsp;who vaguely understood&nbsp;blockchain and they vaguely understood&nbsp;the premise of SSI. They made assumptions that you could take someone’s identity and put it on a blockchain,&nbsp;and then it can’t be lost anymore, and it’s there forever.</p>
<p>Of course, that isn’t how it works, and that’s not a good message to&nbsp;perpetuate. We got flack&nbsp;from people, saying, “Ah, Tykn’s&nbsp;putting personal information on channels.” No. This is the opposite of what we do. I would be calling&nbsp;these journalists asking, “Oh, could you&nbsp;please amend this in the article?&nbsp;Thank you for writing about us, but could&nbsp;you please correct this?”</p>
<p>Mathieu: But, people get stuck here. I see this often: as soon as the word blockchain enters&nbsp;someone’s mind, they really get stuck on blockchain. It’s&nbsp;not unimportant, but it’s not what you should be focusing on when&nbsp;we’re talking about decentralized&nbsp;identity or self-sovereign identity.</p>
 Digital Identity for At-Risk Populations 
<p>Mathieu: Let’s go back in time to the founding of Tykn: You, Khalid, and there was a third&nbsp;person, I believe.&nbsp;A lot of companies come&nbsp;out of a real -problem. It seemed like this one was a perfect example of a real-world&nbsp;problem; an early&nbsp;contributor to the project,&nbsp;who&nbsp;lost his identity. Would you mind talking through that, and how&nbsp;Tykn came about?</p>
<p>Jimmy: Yes, that was one of the motivations.&nbsp;He struggled through this problem&nbsp;himself; being a refugee and coming&nbsp;to The Netherlands, without having a birth&nbsp;certificate or anything to prove his history. As a refugee in The Netherlands, there are certain processes with many steps that are required. You go through ten, eleven&nbsp;different&nbsp;kinds of interviews, with different&nbsp;institutions. You have this whole&nbsp;sheet of interviews that you go&nbsp;through to establish things such as your&nbsp;age and everything else.&nbsp;He&nbsp;did have a passport, so he could still have something to show, but for most of the requirements, he didn’t. That&nbsp;lack of track record did impede his ability to integrate&nbsp;better, and to&nbsp;get access to certain&nbsp;opportunities along the way. Of course, while he was within these&nbsp;refugee camps, he saw that there were many people&nbsp;who were worse off, who just had&nbsp;nothing to prove about themselves. Perhaps from a place of&nbsp;good-natured naiveté on our side, we thought — okay, we can solve this.</p>
<p>I feel that a lot&nbsp;of companies are born out of the idea of underestimating how big the problem&nbsp;is: “Oh,&nbsp;we can do this!” Of course, the problem is way bigger than one&nbsp;company could&nbsp;strive to solve, but it did put us&nbsp;on that right track. What’s important for me,&nbsp;and what’s always been important, is to&nbsp;at least make some sort of impact on the status&nbsp;quo to make it better than it is. Maybe we can’t retroactively give billions of&nbsp;people an identifying document — you can’t retroactively give&nbsp;someone a birth certificate. But, you can try to help those&nbsp;people to have a higher degree of access&nbsp;to the current systems without&nbsp;needing that document. To me, that has become an important part of the motivation&nbsp;within Tykn. Of course, there are big regulatory, legal, policy&nbsp;implications. When you’re talking about legal&nbsp;documentation, it’s very hard to change. It will happen eventually; at least, I think that it will happen&nbsp;over time, but&nbsp;that’s not something you can change&nbsp;within the timeframe of five years.&nbsp;Over the past four years, we’ve spoken frequently with policy-makers&nbsp;within different governments. We have worked with different&nbsp;governments through giving&nbsp;awareness sessions,&nbsp;and with large institutions within&nbsp;the ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross) and IFRC (International Federation of Red Cross), with the United Nations, the&nbsp;Dutch government, the Turkish government. We’ve tried to at least&nbsp;create that awareness and create a&nbsp;discussion. On that front&nbsp;already, it’s done quite a bit of good.</p>
<p>What we were talking about,&nbsp;at the time,&nbsp;was really the far end of the scale for&nbsp;them: the idea of&nbsp;self-sovereignty&nbsp;and coming from a very puristic point&nbsp;of privacy&nbsp;and data control. Some of the&nbsp;things that stuck practically, were the&nbsp;ideas of things such as data minimization. There is a looming idea of what they&nbsp;call ‘surveillance humanitarianism.’ It’s growing to be a more important term and&nbsp;idea, as the opposite of&nbsp;‘surveillance capitalism.’ It’s&nbsp;the idea that by digitizing a lot of these&nbsp;humanitarian aid processes, you are also gathering&nbsp;a lot of data about different people who are at risk of being exposed. You can get a lot of insights into these populations, which can be dangerous. You’ve&nbsp;seen it with the Rohingya people; through&nbsp;the best humanitarian efforts, they&nbsp;became&nbsp;a lot easier to identify. I don’t&nbsp;think that was even a tech problem, but just because of the humanitarian&nbsp;intervention, suddenly, these people&nbsp;became very centralized&nbsp;in certain areas, and they had identification cards. Suddenly, they were an easy target&nbsp;for genocide.&nbsp;That’s of course on the worst end of&nbsp;the spectrum, but it’s also&nbsp;not strange to think that&nbsp;a lot of this tech is being tested in&nbsp;the field. I feel that we’re putting privacy concerns on the back&nbsp;burner, coming from an idea of, “Oh, these people&nbsp;don’t have much anyway”; they are&nbsp;almost entirely digitally excluded. So it&nbsp;doesn’t really matter that much&nbsp;if we don’t safeguard their privacy&nbsp;optimally, or if we&nbsp;store all their information in a central&nbsp;database, or collect their biometric&nbsp;information.&nbsp;That scales very poorly,&nbsp;especially when you’re talking about&nbsp;Sub-Saharan Africa which is digitizing&nbsp;at lightning speed. Over the course of twenty years, it becomes quite dangerous. For us, that’s why that sense of control, data minimization, privacy has to be there as a first building block. Seeing that the conversation has started flowing over the past&nbsp;couple of years, that makes me feel&nbsp;good at least, because it’s a&nbsp;conversation that we didn’t see four&nbsp;years ago. We are definitely not the only ones that have been pushing this.</p>
<p>There are a lot of&nbsp;activists in that space that have&nbsp;been&nbsp;contributing to making this impact. I have personally seen that ‘click’ once we’ve&nbsp;explained it, but at least those core&nbsp;principles got stuck somewhere and are identified as something we have to take&nbsp;seriously. So at least the idea of&nbsp;self-sovereign identity can already produce quite a bit of&nbsp;good.</p>
<p>Mathieu:&nbsp; I guess that&nbsp;naive optimism when jumping into anything is probably not a bad thing, because if&nbsp;you knew the complexity&nbsp;underneath, you might have stayed&nbsp;away from it, right?</p>
<p>Jimmy: Yes, I think about that a lot. If I had known&nbsp;what was coming and what was ahead in&nbsp;2017,&nbsp;I’d probably have said, “I’m going to do something else, and just sit on my crypto.” Honestly, I would have been&nbsp;better off if I did that.&nbsp;But I have no regrets at all.&nbsp;We actually talked about that this&nbsp;morning during our stand-up. Of course, in the beginning we had to bootstrap a&nbsp;lot before we started raising&nbsp;funds, and even then, we barely paid ourselves out in terms of salary or anything. I was compensating for that&nbsp;within crypto,&nbsp;and even through the bear market, I sold a lot.&nbsp;I’m thinking now that I could have probably just retired at 25, which I don’t think is a good thing, necessarily.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I think you guys are clearly trying to&nbsp;make a social impact here, and it’s&nbsp;quite important. Anything that falls outside of that, it’s nice to think about; maybe, it hurts&nbsp;sometimes to think about&nbsp;the missed opportunities.</p>
<p>Jimmy: Yes. I don’t think about it&nbsp;too much. What we’ve been doing with&nbsp;Tykn&nbsp;is much more fulfilling to me,&nbsp;and I wouldn’t trade it&nbsp;for a second. So, no regrets.</p>
<p>Mathieu: When I think about privacy, I like to break it down into just two pieces:&nbsp;one being&nbsp;control, or having the ability to control what happens. The second piece is all about&nbsp;transparency or traceability. That could happen with centralized&nbsp;systems but it could also happen&nbsp;with decentralized systems, as well.</p>
<p>Going back to the early days of&nbsp;Tykn; you’re looking to empower&nbsp;people&nbsp;to have control, and transparency&nbsp;and to own their identity. Is that the&nbsp;project that you guys did with the Turkish&nbsp;government?&nbsp;Was that along the&nbsp;same lines?</p>
<p>Jimmy: Exactly. We put that press&nbsp;release out a couple of weeks ago.&nbsp;This is a project that we started in 2019,&nbsp;at least in the research and conceptual phase.&nbsp;We&nbsp;took part in this UN/Turkish government-led accelerator for&nbsp;identity companies&nbsp;to tackle some of the aspects of the&nbsp;refugee crisis&nbsp;in Turkey. Turkey has taken in a lot of&nbsp;Syrian refugees,&nbsp;and they want them to integrate into&nbsp;society. Of course, there are several different facets to different&nbsp;problems within that whole sphere. We went to Turkey multiple times; we&nbsp;went from&nbsp;Istanbul to Gaziantep, which is very&nbsp;close to&nbsp;the border. In Gaziantep, out of the 2.5 million people that live&nbsp;there, 500,000 are refugees. Surprisingly few&nbsp;are still in refugee camps; they’ve put in a lot of effort to&nbsp;be able to integrate them into society.</p>
<p>We went there with a bunch of&nbsp;assumptions, and again, with a certain degree of naiveté. They have this temporary protection&nbsp;card. We know it’s hard for them to move across different geographical areas and to do certain&nbsp;things because they need to get this&nbsp;card updated, and sometimes, they don’t have the&nbsp;mobility.&nbsp;We knew that smartphone&nbsp;penetration&nbsp;was very high amongst the refugee&nbsp;population; a lot higher than people&nbsp;assume. It’s about 94-95 percent, and a lot of&nbsp;families have multiple devices: iPhone,&nbsp;iPad, they love Apple products.&nbsp;We thought, “Okay, we’ll just digitize&nbsp;this temporary protection card and&nbsp;that’s a job done. They can receive the&nbsp;money on their phone, and&nbsp;they can update it remotely, etc. etc.”</p>
<p>However, we got to&nbsp;talk to the refugees on the ground floor, and the people around that; with people from government to local&nbsp;NGOs to&nbsp;United Nations (we try to&nbsp;talk with everyone).&nbsp;Then, we saw that this didn’t&nbsp;even come close to being&nbsp;the actual most pressing issue. They thought the card&nbsp;was annoying, because it’s a piece of&nbsp;plastic that’s just a bit too big to put&nbsp;in your pocket.&nbsp;Further, they said, “that’s annoying, but I don’t really care&nbsp;about that; I have bigger things to&nbsp;worry about. I can’t get a job on paper; my eight-year-old&nbsp;daughter&nbsp;is working full-time in a textile&nbsp;factory&nbsp;for 30 euros a month,” and so on. Those were very&nbsp;heavy and shocking conversations, as they always are. I had a conversation with a&nbsp;colleague about this: the difference between knowing, and&nbsp;understanding. You can know a&nbsp;lot of these facts, and read them from reports and articles, and see them on&nbsp;the news. Understanding: we probably never&nbsp;will, because&nbsp;we’ve never had to go through those experiences. At the least, we can approximate understanding once you have those&nbsp;conversations face-to-face, and when&nbsp;you sit at the table&nbsp;with people and they tell you their&nbsp;eight-year-old daughter is working almost full-time in a textile&nbsp;factory.</p>
<p>We started to look at, and think&nbsp;about this. We saw that one&nbsp;of the pain points was that&nbsp;there’s a work permit application&nbsp;process that employers need to go&nbsp;through in order to employ a refugee.&nbsp;This process is a&nbsp;bit cumbersome; quite long, usually. What often happens,&nbsp;is that the employer passes this&nbsp;process onto an accountant. You have to pay an initial fee for this&nbsp;work permit,&nbsp;and then you have to pay a recurring fee,&nbsp;and then&nbsp;the accountant also charges markup. The way that the accountant does this&nbsp;application process, is that the employer basically gives their&nbsp;information from their&nbsp;portal. Essentially, they give government identity portal&nbsp;login information to the&nbsp;accountant, who also has a lot of other data. The accountant charges a surplus&nbsp;on top of it.</p>
<p>This is not very legal, but what&nbsp;we saw happening&nbsp;often, is that the costs of this work permit were being&nbsp;passed on to the refugee. We started working it&nbsp;out, and we’ve found that&nbsp;for a refugee, oftentimes they end up&nbsp;with less money&nbsp;if they actually work on paper.&nbsp;Of course, that’s a huge&nbsp;disincentive to work, when you can still get your emergency social credit every month,&nbsp;and work under the table and&nbsp;get paid more,&nbsp;because you need to sustain your family. So, we thought maybe&nbsp;we shouldn’t work with the refugees directly, but maybe we should focus on this part&nbsp;with the employers.&nbsp;If we make this work permit application process easier for them to&nbsp;do,&nbsp;then it would give more incentive to&nbsp;hire refugees, and they&nbsp;would be the primary social benefactor.&nbsp;The UN really liked that idea, and the Turkish government really&nbsp;liked that idea.</p>
<p>We started working that out with our product Ana,&nbsp;and we ran a pilot on that in Istanbul, with the Istanbul chamber&nbsp;of commerce, INGEV (a local NGO),&nbsp;and the Ministry of Labour. Essentially, we made&nbsp;it super easy for an employer to receive a certificate of business ownership, and&nbsp;then use that&nbsp;with a statement from an accountant, to&nbsp;be able to apply&nbsp;for a work permit within the application. The pilot was received very&nbsp;well, and it’s now escalated to&nbsp;the top of the presidency office, where we’re now talking about how we can&nbsp;move this forward within their digital&nbsp;transformation&nbsp;framework.</p>
<p>Turkey is very advanced in terms of&nbsp;its digital infrastructure. For some reason, that is not on a lot of&nbsp;people’s radar. For example, Tubitak, which is the research arm of the Turkish government:&nbsp;they’ve been working on indie&nbsp;wallets&nbsp;and sovereign desk networks since 2018.</p>
<p>Many other governments are not thinking about it even now, and they were already looking at that three years ago. So, in that sense, they are very advanced. That’s why it’s been such a pleasure to work with them, because they already know everything. I remember meeting their chief researcher at a UN function somewhere in Ankara, and I was talking to someone else. I was talking <a href="https://northernblock.io/resources/glossary/">about self-sovereign identity</a>, and trying to obscure the terminology a bit to make it easier to understand, like “explain it like I’m five.” This guy came over and said, “Hey, are you talking about self-sovereign identity? Are you talking about Sovrin? Because then we need to talk.” I said, “Yes, absolutely,” which was a really nice moment.</p>
<p>Mathieu: It’s nice when&nbsp;you can skip that education&nbsp;part; when people are already&nbsp;sold on the concepts. Now, we could focus on what the economics are, and what&nbsp;the business case is.</p>
<p>It seems that going on the ground there really helped&nbsp;you guys understand the dynamics&nbsp;within that ecosystem; to figure out&nbsp;how the economics work. That’s&nbsp;the crucial piece to figure out, if&nbsp;you’re going to make anything work. There’s another key piece too. I know you guys put a lot of focus&nbsp;on UX and design&nbsp;as a company. There are many&nbsp;conversations happening&nbsp;around design in the SSI space. Even just around wallets:&nbsp;more specifically, how do you&nbsp;internationalize wallets?&nbsp;It’s more than just having a switch&nbsp;that you flip the language;&nbsp;people use things differently in&nbsp;different countries. I’m sure that was noticeable as well in Turkey, or with Syrian refugees, around how they use technology. Even looking at intricacies within the apps; how can you make it a better experience, get more&nbsp;engagement, and get more usage?</p>
<p>Would you mind&nbsp;speaking about the&nbsp;importance that you guys place on that,&nbsp;and then&nbsp;how it’s resulted in Ana? I know&nbsp;we’ve talked before, about cloud&nbsp;products and browser products. How&nbsp;does that all tie together for&nbsp;you guys?</p>
<p>Jimmy: It’s a shame Khalid isn’t here, because&nbsp;he’s the chief UX-er. There are some huge things&nbsp;that we’ve seen there, which&nbsp;were very valuable in terms of&nbsp;learning. Like a lot of other <a href="https://northernblock.io/about/">SSI companies</a>, we went being a bunch of geeks working on the whiteboard, to actually having to&nbsp;speak with people and understand, “If we built this, could you use it?” Oftentimes, in the&nbsp;beginning, the answer was “no.” Then, you find out that across population&nbsp;groups, there are a lot of user experience assumptions that we make&nbsp;nowadays. Many things are very intuitive and natural for us now, because&nbsp;the digital products that we’ve been&nbsp;using for the past&nbsp;ten years have certain&nbsp;interactions that&nbsp;are just completely logical to us: filling out a form, scrolling, having it go back using a button. All those things seem very&nbsp;natural to us, but&nbsp;it isn’t inherently&nbsp;natural for a lot of other population&nbsp;groups. When you actually go to test&nbsp;those designs, you see people get stuck.&nbsp;One thing we saw within the Syrian refugee population was that they are a lot more tech-savvy. As I said, a lot of them have iPads; they have iPhones. Syria was&nbsp;generally a technologically advanced&nbsp;society, so they understand those interactions a lot&nbsp;more and there isn’t as much of a gap.</p>
<p>However, with&nbsp;some of the design work with the Red Cross, we did see people for whom it&nbsp;wasn’t ‘intuitive’ when having to scroll&nbsp;and fill out certain forms. You have to think hard about,&nbsp;“Okay, how can I make this as intuitive as&nbsp;possible,”&nbsp;and that also inspired some of the&nbsp;designs for Ana. This probably won’t&nbsp;come as a big surprise,&nbsp;but a service or product that is used almost ubiquitously across&nbsp;population groups&nbsp;is WhatsApp and Facebook. Even people who didn’t understand any&nbsp;other apps; they understood WhatsApp, they&nbsp;understood&nbsp;texting people, and they understood&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;and Facebook groups. Many other areas are sometimes quite abstract,&nbsp;and didn’t quite ring globally. Some of the interface within Ana, we try to make it seem like it’s a WhatsApp flow: when you go&nbsp;through certain parts of the onboarding, for instance. It was the same with one-to-one, which the&nbsp;Red Cross project ultimately ended up&nbsp;being called: one-to-one,&nbsp;or cash-based aid.</p>
<p>From an SSI perspective, we took a lot of&nbsp;learnings from that, because we came face-to-face with some of the&nbsp;realities of&nbsp;having to go into the field and making it useful for people. We saw pretty early that the puristic view of SSI, in terms of having everything&nbsp;stored on edge wallets — when you go to somewhere in Sub-Saharan&nbsp;Africa, that’s going to be pretty&nbsp;difficult, when there’s maybe one phone in a&nbsp;village&nbsp;and it’s not&nbsp;even necessarily a smartphone.&nbsp;It’s very easy to say,&nbsp;“Oh yeah, but within SSI, everything has to&nbsp;be stored on the edge wallet.” What we saw was&nbsp;that if you make that this hard&nbsp;requirement, and keep working from that, then&nbsp;all these population groups are just&nbsp;going to be left behind&nbsp;more and more.</p>
 SSI for Privacy and Security Concerns 
<p>For those cases, perhaps it makes more sense to&nbsp;take some of those qualities of SSI in&nbsp;terms of having a higher degree of&nbsp;control and being able to guard that,&nbsp;and&nbsp;have these guardianship models where the information isn’t per se stored locally. For instance, that would allow them to use a feature phone, which is what we’ve been working on: being able to accept credentials and verify credentials using a feature phone, which inherently needs some sort of <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-enterprise-cloud/">SSI cloud infrastructure</a>. Obviously, the credential isn’t stored on the feature phone, on the edge in that case. That does open up a lot of these interactions and use cases to these population groups. It’s also better than the status quo, which is something we feel strongly about. Perhaps it’s not in the puristic sense of ‘pure SSI,’ but it is much better than the status quo.</p>
<p>As long as you take certain aspects into account, such as: not having that degree of correlation, still having that degree of&nbsp;privacy, operating from a starting point of user control, and&nbsp;data minimization — they still have the portability. From that point of view, it&nbsp;is a lot better than the status&nbsp;quo, and it’s important to be able to&nbsp;see that nuance across different&nbsp;sectors and within SSI. We’ve&nbsp;also seen it from the other side, within enterprises where they didn’t&nbsp;especially want to have something&nbsp;pure SSI, because they wanted to get&nbsp;certain insights. That’s not a popular idea within SSI for good reason, I think, because&nbsp;that’s something we ultimately want to&nbsp;move away from.</p>
<p>Mathieu: That doesn’t apply for business reasons or&nbsp;for regulatory reasons; there’s no reason&nbsp;why data could not be received&nbsp;and stored and used. Going back to what you’re saying, about removing certain correlations, minimizing&nbsp;the data,&nbsp;and ensuring the user control and&nbsp;transparency, and the different privacy&nbsp;properties, and&nbsp;all the other principles we live by. As&nbsp;long as that’s built into the&nbsp;architecture of what you’re doing; if you want to do&nbsp;business with a bank or with an employer&nbsp;and they need&nbsp;certain information — it’s up to you,&nbsp;to&nbsp;opt into it.</p>
<p>Jimmy: Yes. Opt-in, and be able&nbsp;to opt-out, as well. That’s&nbsp;important to me, within SSI as well as complying with GDPR. It’s good that&nbsp;we can request our data back, and request it to be forgotten.&nbsp;I don’t know about you, but I don’t&nbsp;have a list anywhere&nbsp;of companies who have my data, or that I’ve&nbsp;interacted with. So, even being able to have that, and&nbsp;having a ‘nuke’ button&nbsp;that says, “Okay, opt out of all&nbsp;of these,” that would already be pretty&nbsp;great.</p>
<p>At a minimum, becau se of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylWKrg3FjBE">principles of SSI</a>, I think that things like that will become a lot easier within the next five years or so. Ultimately, perhaps it’ll even become a requirement.</p>
<p>Mathieu: On the consumer side, I like what you said about taking&nbsp;messaging into consideration, inside of the user experience. Messaging is the killer application of mobile&nbsp;technology; there’s nothing more used&nbsp;than that. So, I love&nbsp;that this makes sense to&nbsp;literally everyone in the world. If you could try to incorporate a bit of these digital credentials within a messaging experience,&nbsp;it’s very intuitive. It makes sense, and&nbsp;doesn’t force someone to learn&nbsp;something new or get used to using&nbsp;something new, it’s just&nbsp;easy.</p>
<p>Jimmy: That’s something we need to&nbsp;build on. We’ve all become&nbsp;very excited about SSI because of its potentially&nbsp;disruptive properties.&nbsp;You start&nbsp;ideating about what society would&nbsp;look like, in a perfect utopia where this is the norm. You have the people who go a step further, and they’re suggesting, “Oh, maybe we don’t even need&nbsp;governments anymore, because we could&nbsp;just attest to our own existence.” But, at the end of the day, if you build something that’s so&nbsp;completely different, the regular person will just&nbsp;not understand how to even use it, or&nbsp;why I would want that.</p>
<p>A lot of&nbsp;people say, “Oh, but I trust my&nbsp;government,” or “Oh, but I trust my bank, why would I want&nbsp;to step away?” We still see it&nbsp;in crypto: it’s “Oh, I don’t feel comfortable with that. I like having everything in my bank,” and that’s super&nbsp;logical. However, I think that working within SSI, it becomes very easy&nbsp;to have your nose to the whiteboard, and forget&nbsp;that there are other people out there&nbsp;who aren’t as intimately familiar with&nbsp;the technology,&nbsp;its propositions, and the ideology around it. Most&nbsp;people simply want things to work more smoothly, and perhaps as a secondary goal, they want to&nbsp;be less at risk.</p>
<p>This is something that we’ve also seen.&nbsp;In a lot of SSI companies, including us in the beginning, much of what&nbsp;we were saying&nbsp;was based around privacy and security.&nbsp;To many people, that&nbsp;isn’t an appealing value&nbsp;proposition.&nbsp;That assumption is baked-in to a lot of products when you use your bank. They assume with all these&nbsp;regulations it’s all good; it’s a bank, it’s&nbsp;secure and private&nbsp;until proven otherwise. For a lot of&nbsp;people, it’s never proven otherwise.&nbsp;Many people don’t get their identity&nbsp;stolen, so they’re sure it will all be fine. That’s the&nbsp;paradox in The Netherlands; they did some&nbsp;research on it, and found that there’s this privacy paradox of people. Everyone’s&nbsp;concerned about their privacy,&nbsp;but no one necessarily takes the proper&nbsp;actions to ensure that degree of privacy&nbsp;and online security, and even things like password management. I still meet people&nbsp;who&nbsp;have no idea that they shouldn’t reuse&nbsp;passwords. These are people my age,&nbsp;and they just have no idea why&nbsp;that would be risky.</p>
<p>That’s something we&nbsp;have to&nbsp;consider as well. When&nbsp;you put this out there,&nbsp;a lot of people simply want things to&nbsp;go more smoothly,&nbsp;and they don’t necessarily have a strong&nbsp;opinion on how that happens. Many&nbsp;people don’t understand why biometrics may be bad, especially if we consider what’s happening in China. It has taken quite a lot of education&nbsp;of the tail risks of implementing&nbsp;something like that;&nbsp;of having all your biometrics&nbsp;in a central database that can be&nbsp;accessed by governments and who knows else. They only see, “Oh, but wouldn’t it be&nbsp;great to walk through the&nbsp;airport, and they scan your face, and you&nbsp;get on the plane.” From a user experience&nbsp;point of view that could be pretty great,&nbsp;but then from a point of view of&nbsp;privacy and security,&nbsp;maybe not.</p>
<p>Mathieu: At our company,&nbsp;we laugh every time we ask a company&nbsp;we’re talking to about their&nbsp;security. “I don’t know, we hash our data,&nbsp;and we do this and&nbsp;it’s quite funny, To&nbsp;your point here, it comes down to the lowest&nbsp;friction and the most utility. I saw numbers the&nbsp;other day: today there are 2.8 billion&nbsp;people who use Facebook products,&nbsp;and they’re awesome to a lot of&nbsp;people. Why would they not want to&nbsp;use them, when there’s so much utility to it?</p>
<p>Jimmy: That’s also a point. It’s really hard to get away&nbsp;from that&nbsp;grip now. Even if I think&nbsp;about it myself; I still have a Facebook&nbsp;profile,&nbsp;just because my grandparents have a Facebook profile. Especially now, because my&nbsp;grandfather’s&nbsp;pretty sick and it’s magic; it’s the only way for him to see me,&nbsp;and my sister in the UK,&nbsp;and my parents in Spain. We can all&nbsp;see him at the same time&nbsp;while he’s in bed. To him, it’s magical.&nbsp;For me, that’s huge, so it does bring a lot of good&nbsp;things to people’s lives. But then, most people don’t&nbsp;understand the potential risks of having that&nbsp;power within Facebook. We spoke&nbsp;briefly about things like the Open Metaverse in the future.&nbsp;Facebook is already making a big bet on that with Oculus and all these other devices that you’ll need a&nbsp;Facebook account to use. They’re already extending that&nbsp;control&nbsp;which in the long term is very scary. A lot of people don’t&nbsp;inherently care about that, because they&nbsp;just want to receive that&nbsp;utility, which is logical.</p>
<p>Mathieu:&nbsp;For sure. We’re having these utopian&nbsp;conversations about&nbsp;self-sovereign identity and how&nbsp;everything’s going to be on the edge; everyone’s going to own their keys,&nbsp;everyone’s going to own their&nbsp;credentials.&nbsp;There are similar conversations if we jump back on&nbsp;the crypto side; we want to&nbsp;have the right principles baked in.</p>
<p>Over the past&nbsp;decade, the rise of cloud, mobility, and connectivity have&nbsp;created&nbsp;so much usability and so much utility. It’s lowered friction for so many&nbsp;things that you have to use these products. Again,&nbsp;to your point earlier about still interacting with banks: banks are custodians of your money,&nbsp;your fiat money.&nbsp;There are several issues with banks, but they do provide very valuable&nbsp;services. The same thing should be true&nbsp;when we talk about identity and&nbsp;credentials. It’s crazy to think that people are&nbsp;going to store their credentials&nbsp;on an edge wallet, similar to the way the&nbsp;maximalists&nbsp;store their crypto on an edge wallet. That’s such a small&nbsp;percentage of the population, and&nbsp;it doesn’t work well. So,&nbsp;how do you bake the correct principles that we’re&nbsp;advocating, into existing models and augment them? We’re not jumping from 20 percent to 100 percent, but we’re jumping from 20 to&nbsp;25; we have some goals to get to 30,&nbsp;and to keep improving that. I love what you guys are doing and&nbsp;how you guys are thinking about that, with your product suite and&nbsp;your vision for the future.</p>
<p>Jimmy: We’re totally aligned on that. I think ultimately, as you said, it’s a very puristic view that’s&nbsp;come from the crypto space, where it’s&nbsp;natural. You have&nbsp;to manage your own keys, unless you want to keep it on&nbsp;a centralized exchange— which historically&nbsp;hasn’t gone very well. Then, you have&nbsp;these hardware wallets and&nbsp;where you store it, which is essentially on the&nbsp;edge, or at least your keys. If that’s for a regular&nbsp;user, that’s not going to fly, it’s not going to&nbsp;happen.</p>
<p>I have many friends and&nbsp;family who&nbsp;are now diving head-first in crypto — of course, because things are at&nbsp;all-time high. I even have to persuade them to&nbsp;spend 80 euros on&nbsp;a hardware wallet, so that it’s not on&nbsp;an exchange and&nbsp;they’re not at risk of huge loss. When you have something like that,&nbsp;but storing it in something like MetaMask, they already find that&nbsp;more comfortable. Ideally, you would&nbsp;use MetaMask with&nbsp;a hardware wallet. That way, you could have it&nbsp;in your browser, but you can still sign&nbsp;it with your hardware wallet, that is, your&nbsp;physical wallet.</p>
<p>I think for identity, something will&nbsp;need to happen where I can at least sign it with my phone,&nbsp;perhaps. Most of the applications&nbsp;are just browser-based, even&nbsp;for different use cases. We talked about this last time, in&nbsp;terms of different stakes and levels of&nbsp;assurance needed. For certain use cases you wouldn’t even&nbsp;need to sign it off. I would love it if&nbsp;a “one-password solution” were able to&nbsp;integrate verifiable credentials. I would simply use my&nbsp;one password, and be able to&nbsp;access all these services. In a way, you could say that approach defeats the point of decentralization, but&nbsp;for a lot of use cases that makes a lot&nbsp;more sense.&nbsp;There’s so&nbsp;much nuance in this, because it’s such&nbsp;a new space.</p>
<p>I think we’ve&nbsp;only seen the tip of the iceberg of the change that this technology&nbsp;will provoke. Take the example of your diploma: we use our diploma&nbsp;to get access to certain job opportunities. You use the presentation of your diploma to provide that you’ve put in the work. But, what we mostly use it for, is signalling; we put that information on our&nbsp;LinkedIn profile. It’s the same with our job history. I might use an employment&nbsp;statement to&nbsp;get a mortgage or something, but&nbsp;mostly, it’s on my LinkedIn profile for&nbsp;signalling.&nbsp;That is data that I want to be&nbsp;public information, and what most of us&nbsp;want to be public information.&nbsp;So, we should have an&nbsp;option to make certain credentials public. I should&nbsp;have the power for myself, to turn that&nbsp;off and make it private again. I should have the option to&nbsp;not disclose that to anyone at all, but&nbsp;then I also should have the option to&nbsp;make that public.&nbsp;A lot of those things, it’s&nbsp;still relatively new&nbsp;and we’re only just thinking about this.</p>
<p>It’s the&nbsp;same with peer-to-peer credentials. I started&nbsp;thinking about that, when my girlfriend was from Canada. She said that in Canada (and you probably know&nbsp;more about this than I do) if you want to&nbsp;get a new passport,&nbsp;you need to get a bunch of people from&nbsp;your circles to attest that you exist.&nbsp;You need to get five people to say, “Oh yes, I know&nbsp;Mathieu. He’s my brother, or he’s my&nbsp;colleague, or he’s my friend, or he’s my&nbsp;neighbour.”&nbsp;Of course, for some applications, p2p credentials would be quite interesting. There are&nbsp;so many other uses that we haven’t even&nbsp;thought of yet. So, yes, I think within that&nbsp;nuance, we’re going to see a lot of billion-dollar companies&nbsp;spinning up within these little corners. This is what excites me about SSI, because it’s still so new. It’s so young and so early, relative to what it&nbsp;will look like ten years from now.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Yes, I totally agree with you. I would&nbsp;love to have a further conversation&nbsp;with you; there’s a bunch of other stuff we could&nbsp;talk about. I think&nbsp;the whole concept of <a href="https://northernblock.io/verifiable-credentials-for-fintech/">using verifiable&nbsp;credentials</a> for signalling is quite a funny one, if you look&nbsp;ahead. I love that idea. Thinking about&nbsp;the peer-to-peer credential: you start&nbsp;talking about the value of relationships,&nbsp;and how that could start building&nbsp;up. I think we could go on for a long&nbsp;time on these subjects, but Jimmy, I want to thank you so much for doing&nbsp;this with me today.</p>
<p>Jimmy: It was&nbsp;a pleasure, it was really nice.&nbsp;Maybe we do need to have a part two, someday. Let’s plan for that.</p>

Remember when the U.S. used to be way behind in digital payments? <p>That’s no longer the case, <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/03/25/america-used-to-be-behind-on-digital-payments-not-any-more">according to The Economist</a>:</p><blockquote>It has been a while coming. In 2018 Ant Financial, China’s payments giant, raised private funds at a valuation of $150bn. It was common then to hear Chinese executives say that America, land of the posted cheque and the hand-signed credit-card receipt, was years behind, held back by a cosy club of banks and credit-card firms.</blockquote><blockquote>Now investors have decided the moment has come. Take PayPal, a digital-payments firm set up in 1999 to allow users of Palm Pilots, a forebear of smartphones, to “beam” each other money. It was later bought by eBay, an online marketplace, which spun it out in 2015 for $45bn. Today it is worth $275bn, more than Citigroup or Wells Fargo. It is also more valuable than Ant, which has fallen out of favour with regulators in China and has been forced to cancel its initial public offering.</blockquote><blockquote>Enthusiasm for digital-payments companies has been whetted by the pandemic. The share price of PayPal has jumped 186% in the past 12 months while shares in Square, an American rival, have more than quintupled and those of Adyen, based in Amsterdam, have nearly tripled. The digital boom is luring credit-card colossi and tech titans, such as Visa and Google, to online payments.</blockquote> 3. Speaking of Visa, they let you settle in crypto&nbsp;now <p>“This is huge.” — <a href="http://global.id/pstav">/pstav</a></p><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/visa-uses-anchorage-to-settle-usdc-transaction-on-ethereum-in-further-crypto-push">The news</a>:</p><blockquote>Visa has processed a cryptocurrency payment directly on the Ethereum blockchain as part of a new service the payment giant plans to introduce to its partners later this&nbsp;year.</blockquote><blockquote>The move, the latest sign of increased adoption of digital currencies by the old-guard financial industry, bumped the price of bitcoin (BTC, +2.57%) and ether (ETH, +6.05%) roughly 5%&nbsp;each.</blockquote><blockquote>Per a press release shared with CoinDesk, Crypto.com sent a USDC (-0.06%) stablecoin transaction on Ethereum to an account at Anchorage custody under Visa’s name. Crypto.com issues “crypto-backed” Visa cards that allow its users to spend the coins in their Crypto.com wallet.</blockquote><blockquote>United States dollar coin, or USDC, is a stablecoin pegged 1-to-1 with the dollar. It is the second-largest stablecoin with an $11 billion capitalization.</blockquote><p>“Yep.” — <a href="http://global.id/shadi">/shadi</a></p><p>All the other fintech&nbsp;stuff:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/germany-central-bank-tests-blockchain-solution-counter-cbdc">Germany’s Central Bank Tests Blockchain Solution to Counter CBDCs — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/covid-fraud-costs-americans-382-million-dollars.html">Covid-related fraud has cost Americans $382&nbsp;million</a>  <a href="https://hackernoon.com/fintech-how-covid-affected-payments-and-the-underbanked-7q2233xm">Fintech: How COVID Affected Payments and the Underbanked | Hacker&nbsp;Noon</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/federal-reserve-s-digital-dollar-momentum-worries-wall-street?sref=daDAhXzz">Federal Reserve’s Digital Dollar Push Worries Wall&nbsp;Street</a>  <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/03/25/america-used-to-be-behind-on-digital-payments-not-any-more">America used to be behind on digital payments.

This week in tech&nbsp;policy: <p>On <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-00b41ffa-8aac-4433-ac3f-efc4ea32ecc6.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslogin&amp;stream=top">new tech&nbsp;laws</a>:</p><blockquote>Why it matters: Democrats, empowered in Congress and enraged by misinformation over vaccines and the election, agree it’s time to legislate on tech policy, including updating the key law that shields them from liability from user-generated content. The path to passing a bill is a little clearer, and there have been signs that the largest tech platforms are ready to embrace some&nbsp;changes.</blockquote><blockquote>Driving the news: Pallone said he wants to take aim at online platforms’ financial incentives to amplify misinformation and extreme&nbsp;content.</blockquote><blockquote>“The more outrageous and extremist the content is, the more engagement and clicks they get, and therefore the more advertising dollars they get,” Pallone told Axios. “If nothing else, I’d like to create a disincentive for these companies to amplify this content that leads to violence.”</blockquote><blockquote>In an op-ed ahead of the hearing, Facebook disputed the notion the company has a financial interest “in turning a blind eye to misinformation,” saying, “We have every motivation to keep misinformation off of our apps and we’ve taken many steps to do so at the expense of user growth and engagement.”</blockquote><p>On <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-950953c7-ec6d-4280-86a7-8b5206cde00f.html">last week’s&nbsp;hearing</a>:</p><blockquote>Lawmakers at Thursday’s hearing on misinformation were less interested in getting answers from the CEOs of Facebook, Twitter and Google than in warning the social media giants that a legislative hammer is about to land on them, Kim, Ashley and Margaret&nbsp;report.</blockquote><blockquote>Driving the news: In a gruelingly long session conducted entirely by video conference, members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee told the CEOs their businesses prioritize ad revenue and engagement over rooting out misinformation and content that harms users, especially children.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: The relatively consistent lines of questioning, sometimes crossing party lines, displayed a new unity among members of Congress in their concern about the companies — and a stronger likelihood that they might pass punitive&nbsp;laws.</blockquote> 5. The rise of the Sovereign Writer <p>Here’s <a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/sovereign-writers-and-substack/">a cool Stratechery piece</a>, highlighted by <a href="http://global.id/anej">/anej</a>, who&nbsp;noted:</p><blockquote>Ben Thompson made a good piece on so-called sovereign writers that thrive off of Substack and he makes a good point with “the problem with the social networks is that they want to own the reader, but the entire point of the sovereign writer is that they own their audience. “</blockquote><blockquote>With the feed and publishing capabilities and addition of wallet we can easily compete in that space as well. Email per se is still just a&nbsp;channel.</blockquote><p>And <a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/sovereign-writers-and-substack/">here’s Ben on The Sovereign Writer</a>:</p><blockquote>I am by no means an impartial observer here; obviously I believe in the viability of the sovereign writer. I would also like to believe that Stratechery is an example of how this model can make for a better world: I went the independent publishing route because I had no other choice (believe me, I&nbsp;tried).</blockquote><blockquote>At the same time, I suspect we have only begun to appreciate how destructive this new reality will be for many media organizations. Sovereign writers, particularly those focused on analysis and opinion, depend on journalists actually reporting the news. This second unbundling, though, will divert more and more revenue to the former at the expense of the latter. Maybe one day Substack, if it succeeds, might be the steward of a Substack Journalism program that offers a way for opinion writers and analysts to support those that undergird their&nbsp;work.</blockquote><blockquote>What is important to understand, though, is that Substack is not in control of this process. The sovereign writer is another product of the Internet, and Substack will succeed to the extent it serves their interests, and be discarded if it does&nbsp;not.</blockquote> 6. And If you want more thinky&nbsp;stuff: <p>Here’s <a href="https://thepointmag.com/examined-life/the-logic-of-the-like/">a longread about&nbsp;Likes</a>:</p><blockquote>And yet, as new communication technologies expand and come to structure more and more of our interactions, it is hard to avoid feeling there is something lost in living by the Logic of the Like. We reach for terms like “homogeneous,” “simple” or “flat” in order to express some truth about life in a world reduced to vectors of attraction and revulsion. Homogeneous, because of the tendency to steer ourselves toward others who already view the world as we do. Simple, in that complex emotional life is compressed into a single scale with only two sides: like and not like. Flat, because it seems to reduce the depth and texture of&nbsp;life.</blockquote><blockquote>But these terms fail to capture what is perhaps the most potent feature of the Logic of the Like, which is its seeming inescapability. It is similar to Thomas Hobbes’s theory of religion. We create a God whose needs and desires in turn come to control us. And the Logic of the Like is a jealous God. It admits nothing outside of itself, even its own negation. For example, suppose you decided to reject homogeny and seek out difference, contingency and surprise. A noble pursuit, perhaps, but easily assimilable: “I think we should expose ourselves to difference” is exactly what someone like you would say. It is a self-organizing system but also a self-enclosing one.</blockquote><p>And another one <a href="https://prospect.org/power/islands-in-the-stream-spotify-youtube-music-monopoly/">about the plight of musicians</a> (in a world full of monopolies).</p> 7.

At the same time, ID.me’s digital calling card can be reused wherever the company’s got a contract, meaning the same DMV visitor in California could drive to Las Vegas and use it to check in at the MGM Grand casino, skipping the front desk. “Portable logins aren’t trusted, and trusted logins aren’t portable,” Hall&nbsp;says.</blockquote>  Via <a href="http://global.id/pstav">/pstav</a> — <a href="https://pitchbook.com/newsletter/idme-brings-in-100m-at-unicorn-valuation">ID.me brings in $100M at unicorn valuation | PitchBook</a>  Via <a href="http://global.id/antoine">/antoine </a>— <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/idemia-brings-mobile-id-technology-to-arizona-301255469.html">IDEMIA Brings Mobile ID Technology to&nbsp;Arizona</a>  Via <a href="http://global.id/anej">/anej </a>— <a href="https://www.protocol.com/amp/slack-messaging-connect-2651183388?__twitter_impression=true">WhatsApp for work: Slack is turning into a full-on messaging app</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-153-the-age-of-the-digital-wallet-has-arrived-76e32a1aba69">The GiD Report#153 — The age of the digital wallet has arrived</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>È la visione del Gruppo Tinexta illustrata da Danilo Cattaneo, Amministratore Delegato di InfoCert, durante l’evento del Centro Economia Digitale sulla Sovranità Tecnologica</p>



<p>Roma, 30 marzo 2021 – Tinexta Group, tra gli operatori leader in Italia nelle aree di business Digital Trust, Credit Information &amp; Management e Innovation &amp; Marketing Services, sta partecipando all’evento organizzato dal Centro Economia Digitale per la presentazione di un nuovo position paper sulla Sovranità Tecnologica, alla cui realizzazione ha contribuito con le competenze della propria controllata InfoCert, la più grande Autorità di Certificazione a livello europeo</p>



<p>Di fronte a un <a href="https://www.centroeconomiadigitale.com/sovranitatecnologica/">parterre</a> istituzionale ed imprenditoriale d’altissimo profilo, ad esporre la visione di Tinexta su un tema così strategico è Danilo Cattaneo, Amministratore Delegato di InfoCert: “L’emergenza pandemica ha accelerato il processo di digitalizzazione per cittadini ed aziende e il loro ricorso a soluzioni di Identità digitale, firma elettronica, PEC, conservazione dei documenti. D’altronde, il Digital Trust, cioè la fiducia digitale, sta diventando uno dei fondamenti del funzionamento di tutte le società moderne. Per l’Europa sarà strategico, oserei dire vitale, assicurarsi e mantenere una solida sovranità tecnologica in un ambito così determinante per l’intero sistema economico, politico e sociale. È indispensabile tenere presente che il Digital Trust implica il controllo delle identità digitali e delle firme digitali e, quindi, la gestione di dati sensibili. Per di più, abilita processi molto critici: sottoscrizione di contratti, apertura di conti correnti, accesso a posizioni previdenziali, prescrizioni mediche e molto di più. Di conseguenza, il mantenimento della sovranità tecnologica è irrinunciabile per garantire la protezione dei dati dei cittadini da possibili intrusioni o manipolazioni e assicurare la continuità di servizi fondamentali.”.</p>



<p>Miliardi di transazioni digitali al giorno determinano la trasmissione via web o sul cloud di dati personali e commerciali: la perdita totale o significativa di sovranità si tradurrebbe in minacce per aree delicatissime quali la Difesa, la segretezza industriale, la privacy e la sicurezza dei cittadini. Si pensi, ad esempio, che l’Europa rappresenta solo il 4% delle piattaforme business digitali nel mondo, con il resto dei dati che transita su infrastrutture nelle mani di operatori extra UE.</p>



<p>“È importante mantenere il controllo sulla gestione e la residency dei dati digitali. Così come prevenire i rischi che scelte commerciali di aziende straniere – o addirittura decisioni politiche di Stati esteri – provochino impatti devastanti sulle attività e sulla stabilità di un Paese, ad esempio sospendendo l’erogazione di servizi quali i processi di firma digitale ai propri utenti europei. In questo senso, sarebbe opportuno avere strumenti di governance per quelle aziende ad alta rilevanza strategica per dati trattati o ruolo nella catena del valore. E, non ultimo, è indispensabile che le soluzioni di Digital Trust siano caratterizzate by design da livelli di sicurezza informatica adeguata” ha sottolineato Cattaneo.</p>



<p>Già da anni Tinexta effettua investimenti mirati in Ricerca e Innovazione che le hanno consentito di acquisire lo status di Digital Champion europeo, offrendo al mercato la possibilità di affidarsi a un player continentale allineato alle normative UE in tema di data privacy e digital trust. In questo solco, ha scelto di puntare anche sulla cybersecurity, acquisendo recentemente tre società qualificate del settore con circa 700 persone in organico: l’obiettivo è integrarne esperienze e competenze nel Gruppo e così rafforzare ulteriormente la propria offerta di Digital Trust, peraltro già pienamente conforme ai rigorosi parametri normativi del regolamento europeo eIDAS.</p>



<p>“La volontà di integrare gli aspetti di certificazione fiduciaria e di&nbsp; e sicurezza dei dati &nbsp;rappresentano un &nbsp;passo decisivo in un rapido percorso verso un posizionamento esclusivo e di leadership nella creazione di infrastrutture digitali sicure e con piena validità legale” ha commentato Danilo Cattaneo a margine del suo intervento.</p>

 Providing further clarity on circulating supply during the first month, and supply schedules.  From the Shyft Network&nbsp;Team: <p>Hi everyone, as we begin to distribute and hand over the core protocol to the ecosystem and community, we wanted to quickly put out a high-level breakdown to provide more context, as well as a better high-level view of how we see economic circulation and productive supply across the Shyft&nbsp;Network.</p><p>We also want to notify anyone inspecting the contract’s values moving here and there, that we will be shortly moving assets to Cold&nbsp;Storage.</p><p>The way to look at Shyft Network’s economics is through streams of productivity and how those tranches are formulated, what they are intended to achieve, and what role they play across the macroeconomics as well as micro operational needs of any ecosystem or use&nbsp;case.</p><p>Circulating supply and total supply are often black and white, and the numbers are meant to be a macro snapshot of the entire universe. Within this universe, are a variety of asset tranches that are not meant to be a part of the active circulating supply, but are regulating pools of liquidity that were designed for certain use cases and network-effect-specific outcomes.</p><p>Below is a high-level breakdown that should help our community understand the distinction between Active Circulating Supply, Inactive Supply, and Total Supply, and how self-regulating asset pools play into&nbsp;this.</p> The sum of all liquidity in the&nbsp;universe <p>Let’s start by describing what self-regulating asset pools are. These pools are, primarily, use-case-controlled circulating reserves that become a part of the percentage of circulating supply, but are pre-programmed into smart contracts that have specific use cases and are autonomous applications (pre-built in-system use&nbsp;cases).</p><p>These tranches are designed to regulate and accelerate economic activity as cross-protocol total supply balancers. They are not meant for operational disbursement and are not allocated to participants of the ecosystem, but are liquidity pools that act to autonomously expand, decrease, accelerate or slow down the total usage and supply of the overall ecosystem. These asset pools were designed as mechanisms to help regulate and keep the ecosystem functional, plus incentivizing stability and longevity. Here are some examples of these self-regulating pools (for more information on these tranches, please see our <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/shyft-network-token-distribution-and-economics-d2d9a146504e">Token Economics blog&nbsp;post</a>):</p><p>1. Synthetic Asset Wrap Rewards<br>2. LP Pool &amp; Liquidity Rewards<br>3. Economic Metagame<br>4. Next-Gen&nbsp;DEFI</p><p>What goes into the Active Circulating Supply? The following buckets and tranches are considered active or can be active when deployed (some will remain inactive for a long period of time), and can be counted towards the Active Circulating Supply when deployed on the&nbsp;network.</p> Operational Liquidity. <p>Over the next 7 years, these tranches and allocations are defined and allocated across the distribution schedules for the network’s operational activities. These are asset pools that can become active when they enter circulation. They are meant to provide liquidity to new projects, like <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/is-compliance-the-next-wave-for-defi-a4baf6c0e70c">compliant DeFi</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/oasis-protocol-project/shyft-network-to-build-opt-in-compliance-primitives-on-the-oasis-network-393388c51f71">strategic partnerships</a>, marketing activities, and community DAOs that incentivize the growth of our developer community. Here are some specific tranches that work within this&nbsp;bucket:</p><p>Ecosystem Development (Support): To be used on operations, liquidity, partnerships, federation bootstrapping, marketing, foundation &amp; DAO creation.<br>1. Public Distribution<br>2. Shyft Network Treasury<br>3. VASP Initializer</p> Purchaser, Team &amp;&nbsp;Advisors <p>These are the incredible people who have made this global ecosystem possible by supporting it, advising, or directly working on it for the last 4 years, and who are committed to continue working alongside all of you as an open community over the coming&nbsp;years.</p><p>1. Ongoing Technical Partnerships<br>2. Purchasers (earlier purchaser private sale)<br>3. Strategic Partnerships (The latest strategic purchaser private sale)<br>4. Core&nbsp;Team</p> So, let’s add it up and see what it looks like for the first month after&nbsp;launch. <blockquote>Active Initial Circulating Supply = Community + Team &amp; Active Liquidity Management</blockquote><blockquote>Estimated Month 1 = 10,700,001 SHFT Active Initial Circulating Supply<br>(until Mainnet *subject to liquidity provisioning requirements*)</blockquote><p>Community<br>2,500,000 (Polkastarter sale)<br>1,616,666 (Marketing, primarily over 4 months, using linear distribution contracts)<br>— — — — — — -<br>4,116,666 (Total Active Tokens in the community)</p><p>Team &amp; Active Liquidity Management<br>5,000,000 (Initial LP Pools)<br>1,583,334 (Marketing/Team budget)<br> — — — — — — -<br>6,583,335 (Total Active Tokens for active&nbsp;usage)</p> Inactive Liquidity <p>All remaining tokens will either be in cold storage (unless otherwise notified with due time through a major wide-access information platform) or placed into contract storage for autonomous applications to utilize as our technical production schedule progresses.</p><p>As liquidity requirements increase through use case demand, treasury reserves will be unlocked and allocated accordingly for liquidity provisioning partnerships.</p><p>These are all the tokens in circulating supply until the Shyft Mainnet launches (eta April, depending on federation members’ go ahead as, at this point, the network is not under the control of Shyft Network&nbsp;Inc.).</p><p>Following Mainnet Launch, the following buckets will form part of the Active Circulating Supply:</p>  Federation Node Inflation (up to 2% of 2.5 billion tokens, per year, as economic requirements dictate);  Community Grants Programs (up 2% of 2.5 billion tokens, per year, as economic requirements dictate);  Shyft Network’s <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/fatf-travel-rule-solution-the-2020s-vision-8500eeb0a750">Veriscope </a>— there are liquid tokens available to partners that will be utilizing them within Veriscope as network&nbsp;gas.  <p>We will describe in Medium posts any additional buckets that become active shortly before the Shyft Mainnet launch.

					 One woman’s open-source journey to decentralized identity—with the help of Indicio.tech 
				 
				
			 
				
				
			   
				
				
				
				
					 
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Noha Abuaesh, a Bahrain-based computer scientist, has been exploring decentralized identity for the last year, often with assistance from Indicio.tech’s open-source tools and free communications channels. She took a moment to answer some questions about her work and her journey in the decentralized identity space.  
			   
				
				
				 <p>(The conversation has been edited for length and clarity)</p>
<p>What’s your background and how did you come to be interested in decentralized identity?</p>
<p>I graduated computer engineering in 2007. My graduation project was in robotics. I worked as a technical writer for a while before I completed a master’s in computer science in 2014. My thesis was on embedded systems. Then, I became a dedicated homemaker until late 2018, when I decided to explore my career possibilities.</p>
<p>I felt like one of the seven sleepers, (who slept for about 300 years to avoid persecution; they appear in both the Quran and Christian tradition —ed.) if you know their story. Because in the insane world of computer science, if you snooze for four years—or even less—it can feel like you have been sleeping for centuries! I really didn’t know where to start. Long story short, I took a couple of professional courses, then a nanodegree on blockchain development. I built some projects on Ethereum and Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it wasn’t until last year when I came through a LinkedIn post on self-sovereign identity. I was intrigued. So, I started reading about it, took an edX course on self-sovereign identity and Hyperledger technologies. I was blown away with the potential of this field. I knew I wanted to continue there. I thought, if I am to plan for the next five years of my career, I want to be in this area.</p>
<p>What kind of decentralized identity work are you doing now?</p>
<p>I am now building my first SSI wallet using Hyperledger Indy, experimenting with what can be done with it and exploring its possible use cases. It is command line-based, just a proof-of-concept kind of a thing. I can work on the interface later (or maybe never). There are many cool general-purpose SSI wallets out there with pretty cool user interfaces.</p>
<p>What are your goals in exploring decentralized identity?</p>
<p>Anyone who learns about decentralized technology knows the enormous potential it has in many different applications. Decentralized identity will touch the lives of billions of people in the future. It promises to be the magic wand to a lot of the problems many people are living with now. Who doesn’t want to be part of that? I am looking to be a field expert in this area, inshallah. I am really hoping I can do something with it for the good of humanity.</p>
<p>What Indicio resources have you used in your explorations?</p>
<p>I used Indicio’s TestNet. They have a strong support system. They also have documentation with very clear steps for what to do and what to expect when you run your software development kit. I couldn’t find that anywhere else. I made use of that and other articles as well. At some point, I left a note on their website, not really expecting anything. I was surprised to find their response in my mailbox a couple of days later. They offered a FREE 30-minute session to answer my questions!</p>
<p>What have been your challenges or obstacles to overcome?</p>
<p>Installing the Indy SDK on Windows was challenging for me. Either because it is the very first thing I faced when I decided to work on this, or because it really is a cumbersome process. Nevertheless, I got that working at the end, thank God.</p>
<p>The community is relatively small. At first, my questions didn’t seem to get any attention when I posted them in the public help group. When you compare that with other developer communities that, sometimes, answer your questions within an hour or two, well — it was disappointing. It is really tough when you are new to something and you don’t know where to go for assistance. However, Indicio’s engineering team, I have to say, are doing a great job serving the community in this area.</p>
<p>Another challenge I faced was outdated documentation. It took me some time to get some of the information together. Also, some features are not very well-documented. At times, I had to refer to Jira threads to know what is going on. I am so glad they are keeping these public!</p>
<p>What’s next for you as the field continues to accelerate?</p>
<p>Well, to be honest, I really am not sure what my next step will be. But I am certain that the future holds good things both for me, and for decentralized identity.</p>
<p>*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  *</p>

<p>Martedì 30 marzo, Danilo Cattaneo – InfoCert CEO – interverrà all’evento virtuale dal titolo “La sfida della Sovranità Tecnologica: una strategia per l’Italia e l’Europa”, organizzato dal Centro Economia Digitale. A partire dalle ore 11:00 si susseguiranno interventi di alto profilo con importanti ospiti istituzionali, operatori leader in Italia nelle aree di business Digital Trust, Credit Information &amp; Management e Innovation &amp; Marketing Services e rappresentanti delle maggiori realtà imprenditoriali italiane. Danilo Cattaneo parlerà dell’importanza della sovranità tecnologica e della sicurezza associata al Digital Trust.</p>



 “La sovranità tecnologica e la sicurezza del Digital Trust sono fattori sempre più strategici per l’Europa” 



<p>Di fronte a un parterre istituzionale ed imprenditoriale d’altissimo profilo, Danilo Cattaneo, Amministratore Delegato di InfoCert (Tinexta Group) esporrà la visione di Tinexta su un tema così strategico quale la Sovranità Tecnologica, sarà un intervento che parlerà delle evoluzioni che cittadini e imprese hanno dovuto affrontare in maniera ancora più repentina a causa della situazione pandemica, dell’importanza del ruolo delle istituzioni nel creare un ambiente di scambio normato e sicuro e delle prospettive future..</p>



<p>Miliardi di transazioni digitali al giorno determinano la trasmissione via web o sul cloud di dati personali e commerciali. La perdita totale o significativa di sovranità si tradurrebbe in minacce per aree delicatissime quali la Difesa, la segretezza industriale, la privacy e la sicurezza dei cittadini. Si pensi, ad esempio, che l’Europa rappresenta solo il 4% delle piattaforme business digitali nel mondo.</p>



 Martedì 30 marzo 2021, dalle ore 11:0 0 – <a href="https://www.centroeconomiadigitale.com/sovranitatecnologica/">evento su libera iscrizione</a> 



<p>Durante l’evento di presentazione del Position Paper su “La sfida della Sovranità Tecnologica: elementi per una strategia italiana ed europea”, con istituzioni, mondo economico e accademico, verrà posto l’accento sulla definizione, gli obiettivi, le tecnologie critiche e le linee di policy per le nuove competizioni globali.</p>



<p>Intervengono:</p>



  Giancarlo Giorgetti, Ministro dello Sviluppo Economico  Vittorio Colao, Ministro per l’Innovazione Tecnologica e la Transizione Digitale  Enzo Amendola, Sottosegretario agli Affari Europei  Antonio Parenti, Capo Rappresentanza in Italia della Commissione Europe  



<p>E i protagonisti dell’Italia che innova:</p>

 Introduction <p>With their recent <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1376143875312607235">appearance on SNL</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token">NFTs</a> have definitively crashed into the mainstream. This is great news for helping creators get paid! And for driving blockchain adoption.</p><p>However the label “NFT” holds a frustrating but solvable problem. Let’s start with nerd favorite #43 — UFOs.</p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/22/us-government-ufo-report-sightings">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/22/us-government-ufo-report-sightings</a><p>Just as there are ‘difficult to explain’ UFO sightings, NFTs also have ‘difficult to explain’ fungibility sitings. For example, is RAC’s tape token “NFT”? Unisocks? What about limited editions “NFT”, which appear to be interchangeable? Is ERC1155 “NFT”, given that it supports fungibility?</p><p>This essay explores these questions. It then proposes a modest answer, hoping to alleviate frustration among nerds (myself included) and open the door to less-explored opportunities.</p> The “fungible” in “non-fungible” <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAC_(musician)">RAC</a> is a Grammy-winning musician operating in the realm of NFTs. In early 2020, he released <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/64760/ethereum-tokenized-cassette-dj-rac-zora-grammy">$TAPE</a>&nbsp;. There are 100 TAPE tokens. You can redeem 1.0 of them for exactly one physical cassette tape of RAC’s “BOY” album. 1 TAPE is currently trading at <a href="https://store.zora.co/rac/tape">$4200</a>, easily the most expensive cassette tape&nbsp;ever.</p><p>“NFT”, right? Well, you can substitute 1 TAPE for any other TAPE token; they are mutually interchangeable. This is the very <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fungible">definition</a> of fungible (not non-fungible). Hmm. Furthermore, TAPE are implemented in ERC20 — the standard for fungible tokens (not non-fungible). And you can even interchange a fraction of TAPE too. “NFT”?&nbsp;🤔</p><a href="https://store.zora.co/rac/tape">1.0 TAPE for 1 “BOY” cassette tape by RAC [Image from&nbsp;zora.co]</a><p>Let’s consider <a href="https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1126506339075641344">Unisocks</a>, ticker $SOCKS. There are 500 SOCKS tokens. You can redeem 1.0 of them for exactly 1 pair of physical socks. 1 SOCKS is currently trading at <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/unisocks">$86K</a>, having peaked at $164K. You could trade a pair of socks <a href="https://twitter.com/mikedemarais/status/1360446856392810497">for a Tesla</a>! <a href="https://twitter.com/mikedemarais">Mike Demarais</a> is a self-proclaimed <a href="https://twitter.com/mikedemarais/status/1220875073252401153">SOCKS shill</a>&nbsp;🧦.</p><p>Here’s how I like to think about Unisocks. In 19th and early 20th century, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faberg%C3%A9_egg">Fabergé egg</a> sculptures were the precious art pieces sought after by Russian royalty, with only 69 made. Given crypto’s bias to hilarity and memeability, Unisocks emerged as 21st-century precious art pieces sought after by the crypto community. Unisocks are the Fabergé eggs of&nbsp;crypto.</p>Unisocks are the Fabergé egg of&nbsp;crypto.<p>“NFT”, right? Well, SOCKS are implemented in ERC20, the standard for fungible tokens (not non-fungible). 🤔</p><p>Let’s contemplate “NFT limited editions”. Consider the <a href="https://nbatopshot.com/listings/p2p/c561f66b-5bd8-451c-8686-156073c3fb69+f2a3c763-f7ff-4342-a209-44a34cdf1d02">“Damian Lillard Dunk” NBA Top Shot NFT</a>. There are 6 editions. There may be unique serial numbers but those numbers matter so little that they’re not even reported on the GUI. You can swap one of these NFTs for another; they are mutually interchangeable. Oops, that means fungible.</p><p>Consider ERC1155 token standard. If you mint one token, it’s non-fungible, since there’s just one. But mint a second token, and now you have fungibility, oops.</p> Towards a&nbsp;Solution <p>So are TAPE and SOCKS “NFT” or not? [0] And what do we do with “NFT limited editions” or ERC1155? It appears to be a contradiction.</p><p>There’s a way, inspired by the history of the label “blockchain”. In 2014–2015 as “blockchain” started to get traction, many argued whether some particular system was a “blockchain”. The Bitcoin maximalists would say “only Bitcoin is a blockchain”. Others had more permissive definitions like “it’s a chain of blocks” (where block N stores the hash of block N-1) or “it’s a replicated database with no leader” (using a consensus protocol like <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.04098.pdf">BFT, PoW, or PoS</a>)&nbsp;[1].</p><p>These arguments were never resolved per se. Rather, they simply faded as “blockchain” got treated more <a href="https://medium.com/@trentmc0/blockchain-as-a-field-47c9f4589418">like a field</a>. The definition went meta! There was no huge push, it just happened.</p><p>So now, we have two meanings for “blockchain”:</p>  The technical definition for the database-like artifact that includes a chain of blocks, replicated, etc.  The field or movement that’s applying the technology.  <p>Understanding that (2) exists softens the debate, and in fact is highly empowering because it opens the door for new ideas around&nbsp;(1).</p><p>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">AI</a>” is similar. There used to be huge battles among the tech nerds — myself included — about whether something was “AI”. But the AI field got strong, and now pragmatically “AI” means two things [2]: the technical definition (with much debate!) and the&nbsp;field.</p> A Modest&nbsp;Solution <p>“Blockchain” and “AI” both emerged with technical definition(s), and a field definition. We can do the same thing for “NFT”! We can have the technical definition, and the field. The latter is a subfield of blockchain. Upon examination, we actually find two subfields: one covering the creative part, and one covering non-fungible items. Let’s put it all together:</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/trentmc0/status/1369750239649882118">@trentmc0</a></p></blockquote><p>Let’s review each in more&nbsp;detail.</p><p>NFT Definition 1: Technical standard for unique-snowflake</p><p>A unique-snowflake token standard is a standard simply for tokens that can’t be swapped interchangeably with each other. <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/">ERC721</a> <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721">is</a> the most famous example. It’s not restricted to Ethereum; standards on Bitcoin or any other blockchain fit as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Note that I purposely do not use the phrase “non-fungible” here, because that’s what’s causing confusion!</p><p>It also includes <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155">ERC1155</a>, at least for tokens that are unique snowflakes.</p><p>NFT Definition 2: Blockchain subfield for creative&nbsp;work</p><p>This includes all the work in blockchain on digital art, physical art, photographs, music, etc — generally speaking, anything involving creative work that outputs intellectual property&nbsp;(IP).</p><p>This means it may use “unique snowflake” standards, but critically, it doesn’t need to. It can also use ERC20, or whatever it&nbsp;wants.</p><p>This resolves our core problems:</p>  $TAPE (music) fits within this definition of&nbsp;“NFT”.  $SOCKS (physical art)&nbsp;fits.  “Limited edition NFTs”&nbsp;fit.  And ERC1155 for &gt;1 minted token fits&nbsp;too.  <p>NFT Definition 3: Blockchain subfield using unique-snowflake standards</p><p>This third definition covers blockchain applications that use ERC721 etc. that aren’t in the “creative” realm, such as real estate or financial supply chains (e.g. Centrifuge). It also covers applications that use ERC721 etc that are creative, which means partial overlap with (2), and that’s&nbsp;ok!</p><p>The following image illustrates.</p>“NFT” means 3 things. Here’s how the definitions relate to each other in terms of token standards (top), and fields (bottom). Conclusion <p>This essay started with a frustrating problem: the ‘difficult to explain’ fungibility sightings in NFTs, in everything from SOCKS to “limited-edition” NFTs. It then proposed a modest solution: simply acknowledging that “NFT” is not only a technical standard, but also a field. (And in fact two fields.) The framing melts the frustration away, at least for&nbsp;me;)</p><p>Finally, stay tuned for more NFT&nbsp;fun…</p> Notes <p>[0] FWIW I think RAC is awesome and SOCKS are hilarious.</p><p>[1] See “Ways to Frame Blockchain” in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nature-2-0-27bdf8238071">“Nature 2.0” post</a> for many pragmatic definitions</p><p>[2] See “Ways to Frame AI” in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nature-2-0-27bdf8238071">“Nature 2.0” post</a> for many pragmatic definitions</p><p>Thanks to Wilkins Chung for pointing out the need for NFT meaning (3), to complement the other two meanings.

 T-REX Factory Enhancements 
<p>T-REX Factory is a process management tool, which we rolled out last year, and is specifically designed to support multi-issuers (or agents supporting them) to issue T-REX Tokens in a very automated way and, possibly, a very repetitive way.</p>

		 
	 
                          <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in March 2021.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>As you might already know, T-REX Factory is a process management tool, which we rolled out last year, and is specifically designed to support multi-issuers (or agents supporting them) to issue <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex/">T-REX Tokens</a> in a very automated way and, possibly, a very repetitive way. It allows issuers (or their agent), literally in a few clicks, to provide basic information related to a token, upload a list of investors that have been white-listed by the issuer for that token, as well as the tokens positions to be allocated to them.</p>
<p>T-REX Factory then automatically deploys the whole suite of related smart contracts on the blockchain, creates a digital identity (“ONCHAINID”) for the investors who don’t have one, and finally allocates the tokens they are entitled to receive. It can be used at the end of the subscription period into a newly issued digital security or to replicate (“mirror”) on the blockchain the register of an already existing financial instrument.</p>
<p>We have recently enhanced T-REX Factory with a few additional features:</p>

		 
	 
         Set compliance rules for the security token  <p>While the T-REX Protocol takes care of enforcing basic compliance rules of a security token, the compliance smart contract allows more complex or more general compliance rules to be added. The compliance smart contract of the token can now be configured online very simply by the issuer whenever they define the general parameters of the token. At this stage the issuer can define the eligible countries for the token as well as periodic limits in terms of tokens transfers. Other or more complex compliance rules will still need the Tokeny team to design an ad-hoc compliance smart contract as before, but additional compliance rules will be added to the T-REX Factory interface in the coming week in order to minimize those interventions;</p>
                 Email Notification  <p>At each stage of the T-REX Factory issuance process (token deployment, investors whitelisting and tokens allocation), the issuer will be notified by email and receive all details of the step executed;</p>
                 Automatic transfer the ownership of the smart contract  <p>At the end of the T-REX smart contract deployment process, the T-REX Factory now automatically transfers the ownership of the token smart contract to the issuer’s wallet (this was a manual process so far).</p>
        
	 
		 
			<p>With these various improvements, T-REX Factory further facilitates the life of multi-issuers and makes it even easier to industrialize the issuance process of security tokens on the blockchain.</p>

<p>Thursday, 25 March, 2021<br>Gibraltar<br>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p><p>In a big step forward for the P2P web, Holo Limited was granted a US patent for the rrDHT networking innovations within Holochain. rrDHT is a peer-to-peer networking design implemented in Holochain that describes a system of nodes communicating according to a relaxed, agent-centric distributed hash&nbsp;table.</p><p>Holo is owned in full by the Holochain Foundation, a non-profit organisation based in Gibraltar, and formal transfer of this patent to the foundation will be completed this&nbsp;month.</p><p>You can read more about the patent (number 10,951,697) in the original documentation: <a href="https://uspto.report/patent/grant/10951697">United States Patent and Trademark Office&nbsp;website.</a></p> So why file a&nbsp;patent? <p>Holochain in an open-source project — so why would we spend the time and money to file for a patent? The reality is that projects can be stopped in their tracks while using their own innovations if others are granted patents for the technology. In other words, this is a defensive patent. It is our intention to use this innovation and share it openly within the context of the Holochain open-source framework.</p><p>This patent is a critical component of the open source license used for Holochain. The Cryptographic Autonomy Licence (CAL) was approved by the OSS in 2019 and it makes Holochain widely available to not only developers, but it also protects end-user data rights. Licenses are only powerful as they relate to the intellectual property laws they are based on. The CAL’s protections for Holochain and users of distributed apps built with Holochain are fully enforceable and this patent enables that enforcement both through copyright and also through patent&nbsp;law.</p><p>Van Lindberg, the IP attorney involved in writing the CAL and the patent application shares&nbsp;this:</p><blockquote>“Patents protect how innovations can be used. In our case this patent is intended to protect the Holochain open-source project from trolls who could file patents on our technical innovation and then use them to prevent us from implementing it. The patent is also a critical component of the Cryptographic Autonomy License. Licenses are only powerful as they relate to the IP laws they are based on. Having this patent ensures the CAL is fully enforceable — which means it will protect the rights of end users to have sovereignty over their&nbsp;data.”</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.taylorenglish.com/people-van-lindberg-intellectual-property-copyright-open-source-and-government-policy-and-practice-attorney.html">- Van Lindberg, Taylor&nbsp;English</a></p> What is the technology innovation of the patent, for a layperson? <p>In simple terms this patent represents an easy way to represent complex distributed data models, and manage them with high resilience. While it is possible to design computing systems that don’t use state, many problems — particularly those that are designed to reflect human interactions and the physical world — are easier to model when the computing system has state. The patent focuses on the methods for saving, storing and retrieving data in a multi-node computing system where no single node has a comprehensive index of nodes or content managed by those&nbsp;nodes.</p><p>As you can see in the diagram below, rrDHT gets efficient sharding and storage redundancy by many nodes with overlapping ranges of data they’re responsible for. We get fast lookups by being able to jump to known peer addresses across the circle. And we have a simple way of representing who is responsible for holding data. This model turns out to be very efficient for managing a self-healing DHT.</p> The team behind Holochain and the people behind this&nbsp;patent <p>Our team and community is deeply appreciative of the work that Arthur Brock, David Braden and Jamison Day have put into this achievement. They are the authors of the innovation upon which this patent is based. Arthur is the co-founder of Holochain. David Braden is a leader on the Holochain core development team who is instrumental at implementing peer-to-peer networking innovations in the framework. Jamison Day is an architect and team lead who worked deeply with the Holochain team for several years to iterate and improve the&nbsp;designs.</p> About Holo <p>Holo is a distributed cloud hosting network and marketplace that enables peer-to-peer Holochain applications to be used by regular web users. Holo does to app hosting what Airbnb did to hotels; anyone can use a spare computer to become an app host and get paid in HoloFuel for hosting distributed applications. Each host on the Holo network sets their own prices and preferences for the apps they want to host, and each app publisher sets the hosting specifications required for their Holochain application.</p> About Holochain <p>Holochain is an open-source framework and network protocol for developing peer-to-peer scalable and efficient applications. It is fast, secure, and versatile, which makes it perfect for a wide range of everyday apps. Its long list of uses include social apps, team collaboration, Internet of Things, currencies, and much more. Holochain is a peer-to-peer innovation beyond blockchain that can actually deliver on blockchain promises.</p> Licensing and&nbsp;legal <p>Holochain is the only implementation of the rrDHT P2P networking innovation that we are aware of. Others interested in implementing based on it should contact <a href="https://holo.host/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">[email protected]</a></p> Contact info for Press&nbsp;Release <p>More info available at <a href="https://holo.host">https://holo.host</a><br> For more information please contact: Jarod Holtz at<a href="https://holo.host/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">[email protected]</a></p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://holo.host/holochain-patent/">https://holo.host</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/press-release-u-s-patent-granted-for-holochain-distributed-app-framework-a05d0cf8d6af">Press Release: U.S. Patent granted for Holochain Distributed App Framework</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o">HOLO</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This is the fifth in a series of blogs which provide edited extracts of key points made by Mydex CIC in its response to the UK Government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/uk-national-data-strategy-nds-consultation">consultation around a new National Data Strategy</a>.</p><p>This blog focuses on the main ingredients needed to unleash the full potential of personal data — in addition to personal data&nbsp;stores.</p><p>Previous blogs focused on <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/how-to-unleash-the-full-potential-of-data-3676db8d7c03">how to unleash the full potential of personal data</a>, why <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/how-to-unleash-the-full-potential-of-data-3676db8d7c03">every citizen should be provided with their own personal data store</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/transforming-the-system-a-roadmap-for-practical-implementation-411e8821ed19">how to achieve these changes at scale</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/misconceptions-that-kill-progress-in-personal-data-4736b1d883c6">common misconceptions that derail progress</a>.</p><p>To catch up on progress on our Macmillan My Data Store Pilot <a href="https://medium.com/macmillan-my-data-store-pilot">click&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>If you’ve read the other blogs in this series you might think everything we’re saying boils down to a single recommendation “provide every citizen with their own personal data&nbsp;store”.</p><p>That’s definitely pivotal. But it’s not the whole story. Empowering citizens with their own personal data stores only works in the context of a broader ecosystem, where other parties contribute other functions.</p> Adding genuine personalised value <p>The most obvious of these is bona fide service providers, who use data to provide valued services. A personal data store is a generic enabler; a piece of infrastructure. Every bona fide service provider is a domain expert in their particular field. That is why they exist. To provide their services they need to access and use the right data, and they need their own systems to do this. Personal data stores do not eliminate or replace existing organisation-centric systems. They add another complementary layer. We explore some of the implications of this&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/mydex/how-data-sharing-really-works-239fd187c8a8">here</a>.</p><p>A second obvious fact is that value isn’t generated by personal data in isolation. Usually, it’s generated the right connections between and combinations of personal and non-personal data. A simple example: information about the weather is utterly impersonal. But a weather service that provides a forecast for where I am right now, and where I intend to travel tomorrow may use personal data to add value: my location and my future&nbsp;plans.</p><p>Many of our problems today are created by providers of such services using the need to connect personal with non-personal data as an excuse to grab personal data that they can monetise for other purposes. Manipulation of the content and presentation of privacy policies and terms and conditions for these ends has to stop. But the personal data-driven connections and combinations are essential to ongoing value creation.</p><p>This is generating the need for two important bit of enabling infrastructure:</p>  ‘smart directories’ that create connections between the individual’s personal data (my particular circumstances, interests, plans etc) and external data about the world out there, so that all possible extraneous noise is filtered out and only the right information is presented. This is the essence of data logistics: exactly the right information flowing to and from the right people at the right&nbsp;times.  ‘smart search’. Currently, search services are driven primarily by search term plus (perhaps) a tiny bit of filtering that a search engine conducts using information it has gathered about you. Usually, this filtering isn’t done to help you find what you want, but to herd you in the direction that is most profitable for the search engine. Smart search is a genuine service to the individual, using information about the individual that the individual is happy to volunteer (and only that information, almost certainly behind a shield of anonymity) to help filter search results so that the individual finds exactly what they are looking for as quickly as possible. Smart search is a big ask that would turn the existing industry on its head. But it is desperately needed, and only made possible by the prior existence of a personal data store infrastructure.   Additional enabling infrastructure <p>For such services to work efficiently and effectively, further enabling infrastructure needs to be developed.</p> Data directories <p>In <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/how-to-unleash-the-full-potential-of-data-3676db8d7c03">a ‘MUMU’ world</a>, where there are many users of data using data from many different sources, service providers need to know what data exists and where to find it. For this, we need data directories.</p><p>Personal data directories create their own special design requirements: they need to protect rather than abuse individuals’ data and invade their privacy. They should not hold the data itself, but provide the routing to that data along with information relating to the nature and type of data that is available.</p><p>In the context of public services, in the long term this directory should list all of the personal data held by the Government and where this data is held. It should also specify what level of assurance relates to that data (for example, was it generated for the purposes of an email newsletter or to verify a person’s identity?)</p><p>The directory should be seen as a service to both service providers and citizens, being used to to signpost citizens to where they can obtain the attributes they need to complete applications and other processes where they need to provide or point to&nbsp;data.</p><p>Many technicalities need to be addressed. For example, a data directory might not point the searcher to the original source of the data, but to another place where the data is easier to access. The directory will need to make clear how, and on what basis, the attribute in question remains up to date and valid (e.g. is updating automatic, periodic or occasional?). A Personal Data Store itself could publish its own directory entries, the same approach could apply for any data&nbsp;source.</p> Metadata standards <p>For data’s full potential to be unleashed, it must be reliable and trustworthy. This creates the need for large amounts of ‘metadata’ — data about the data that is being presented and used. For example, a data user may want or need to know how the data was collected, created, protected and verified. At all times, users need to have confidence that the data they are using is correct and verified and not modified since generated, in storage or transit. They also need to know how to link it with other data and if necessary synchronise the times lines of&nbsp;data.</p><p>To avoid the huge costs and complexities created by the need to check these things — or to regenerate data where it is not possible to check these things — we need metadata standards: mechanisms by which ‘data about this data’ flows with the data to establish its trustworthiness and reliability.</p><p>As with data directories, many technicalities need to be addressed. Data points need to be defined unambiguously and precisely targeted to the context of the transactions they are used in. The metadata should be machine readable and avoid concatenation of data rather dealing with specific attributes and composite attribute structures. (For example, machine readable date of birth as opposed to a composite of date of birth, postcode and full address.) There needs to be clear, standardised processes and procedures for accessing attributes. And so&nbsp;on.</p><p>If you are interested, the strategy report Mydex CIC wrote for Scottish Government on its proposed Smart Entitlement’s programme <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/10/Smart-Entitlements-Research-Recommendations-and-Report-for-the-Scottish-Government-FINAL.pdf">examines these technicalities in detail</a>. There is even work being undertaken on this as part of the Identity and Attributes Trust Framework Alpha in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/attributes-in-the-uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework/understanding-attributes">policy paper understanding attributes</a> which must surely be influenced by and influence the national data strategy.</p> Real as opposed to ‘faux’ strategies <p>Successful strategies do many things. They have a clear idea of what ‘good’ looks like and of how to get there including who needs to do what and how these different parties’ contributions are going to be realised and coordinated. They need a sense of order — identifying those things that need to be put in place first, thereby enabling other things to happen later. They need to be crystal clear about what is not in scope or allowable as well as what&nbsp;is.</p><p>Yet all too often, we are presented with faux ‘strategies’ that are nothing more than pious wish lists of things that would be nice along with some vague descriptions of resulting things that would need to happen. Often they are worded in deliberately vague ways so as to please as many parties and create as much wriggle room as possible. If you want a good example, take a look at the UK Artificial Intelligence Council’s <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/949539/AI_Council_AI_Roadmap.pdf">‘AI Roadmap’</a>.</p><p>The UK’s citizens need and deserve a genuine personal data strategy, formulated and implemented to achieve genuine, lasting benefits. This blog has outlined some of the ingredients of such a strategy.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/not-just-personal-data-stores-f2070eada6be">Not Just Personal Data Stores</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Instead of the heavy-handed mechanism for the encoding and canonicalization of attributes values that we’d imagined for Rich Schemas, they use RDF canonicalization and a hash function. Rather than expanding the credential definition, they discarded it, taking advantage of some properties of BBS+ keys which allow for deterministic expansion.</p></blockquote> <a href="https://trbouma.medium.com/verifiable-credentials-mapping-to-a-generic-policy-terminology-bce84a039bb">Verifiable Credentials: Mapping to a Generic Policy Terminology</a> <blockquote><p>Why is this useful? When writing policy, you need a succinct model which is clear enough for subsequent interpretation. To do this, you need conceptual buckets to drop things into.

<p>Cover photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@artnok?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Nicolas Picard</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/web?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p><p>This week we got word that a <a href="https://uspto.report/patent/grant/10951697">patent</a> we submitted to the USPTO was approved. That means that Holochain’s special DHT design — rrDHT — is <a href="https://holo.host/holochain-patent/">covered under intellectual property laws</a>.</p><p>To be honest, when I heard we were filing for a patent, I was surprised and not entirely comfortable with the idea. So let’s get my (and probably your) ethical concerns out of the way first.</p> Why did we file for a software patent? <p>The most pressing reason is troll protection. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_troll">Patent trolls</a> are organisations that sit on large collections of patents simply so they can collect licensing fees from people who actually build things — and sue the ones who don’t buy a license. This is an unfortunate reality that we must face — because we plan to build a revenue-generating business on Holochain tech, we may become an attractive target for trolls. This patent helps protect us — and every business that builds on Holochain.</p><p>It also helps make the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/cryptographic-autonomy-license/blob/master/README.md">Cryptographic Autonomy License</a> more enforceable. I don’t pretend to understand the legal artistry that went into all this, but I gather that it gives extra legal teeth to anyone attempting to use the CAL to defend end-users’ data sovereignty and access to the Holochain codebase.</p> But isn’t Holochain open source? Isn’t this kinda… closed? <p>The patent isn’t an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patentleft">open patent</a> right now; we still want to figure out appropriate licensing schemes that make sure that it gets used in ways that <a href="https://medium.com/holochain/understanding-the-cryptographic-autonomy-license-172ac920966d">align with our values</a>. But any application developer who has a license to Holochain (which is anyone) gets to enjoy the use of that patent in their software. And it’s being transferred from Holo (the company) to the Holochain foundation this month.</p><p>I’ve got more thoughts about patents, ethics, and living in the current world while trying to create a new world. But I’ll save them for the end of this article. And you can read more about the ‘why’ and the ‘how’, including how to use the patent in your own non-Holochain-based software, in <a href="https://holo.host/holochain-patent/">Holo’s press release</a>.</p><p>Now, on to the ‘what’!</p> rrDHT, a relaxed, agent-centric distributed hash table  Background: what is a DHT? <p>The patent language starts out with some legalese, then breaks into some pretty accessible language before returning to legalese. At the beginning, we learn that...</p><blockquote>While it is possible to design computing systems that don't use state, many problems — particularly those that are designed to reflect human interactions and the physical world — are easier to model when the computing system has state.</blockquote><p>In computing terms, ‘state’ means ‘remembering things’. It’s what turns computers from simple machines to magical ‘do-everything’ machines.</p><p>Consider a weaving loom. It takes in thread and produces cloth. Pretty cool, but pretty simple.</p><p>Now let’s add ‘state’, or ‘memory of where I’ve been and where I’m going’ to the loom. Now it can know that it’s done twelve lines of blue and needs to change to yellow, but only once it gets a third of the way through the thirteenth line. Suddenly, it can create something really special.</p><p>So far, so simple. We know that computers remember stuff. But it gets complicated when you involve more than one computer, because who’s in charge of remembering the state?</p><p>Even though we operate in a networked era, most online tools you use operate in a centralised way — client/server — where a central authority takes care of remembering everything.</p><p>That’s nice and easy, and it works great — until the database shuts down, the company gets bought out or goes out of business, or the system gets co-opted by someone with evil plans.</p><p>This prompts us to set out to find a better way of holding shared memory — one that isn’t vulnerable to disruptions or bad actors. If you got rid of the central database and distributed the data to all the participants, it would certainly help. But now you’ve got a new problem: without any authority to talk to, how do you find the data you’re looking for?</p><p>The distributed hash table (DHT) was created to help solve this problem. A hash table is just a simple index of keys (things you know) that point to values (things you want). It’s a bit like a dictionary: when you want to know the definition of the word <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/floccinaucinihilipilification">‘floccinaucinihilipilification’</a>, you take its name (the key) and search through the book until you find it. On the same line you’ll see the definition (the value associated with the key).</p><p>A distributed hash table just spreads responsibility for the keys and values across a lot of machines — each one stores just a portion of them. This means that, if one machine disappears, only a little bit of data is lost.</p><p>Of course, now if you want to retrieve a piece of data, you have to figure out who’s got it. You don’t want a central index (remember, that’s risky), so instead you need a way of figuring it out on your own. Here’s how it works.</p><p>We’ve already seen that every piece of data in a hash table has a key. In a distributed hash table, every machine has a key too.</p><p>In order to find the machine that has the data you want, you compare the data’s key against the keys of all the machines you know about, using a “nearness” algorithm, and then ask the closest match for the data at that key. If they don’t have it, it’s likely that they know another nearby machine that does.</p><p>Storing data works the same way: you calculate the key for the data you want to store, compare it against the machine keys, and ask the computers whose addresses are nearest the key of the data to store it for you.</p><p>Different DHTs use different ways of calculating nearness, and might implement different ways of recovering from failures such as a machine going offline.</p> How rrDHT makes things fast and robust <p>rrDHT starts out with a pretty simple nearness algorithm — keys are just 32-bit numbers, and the machine whose number is closest to the data’s number is the best match. This makes lookups very fast to calculate.</p><p>We also want to make a Holochain app’s DHT as resilient as possible. Machines come and go, especially when they’re just users’ laptops and phones, and that means that your ‘best match’ for a data key might disappear for weeks at a time. So we want the participants in a DHT to collaborate to make sure each piece of data is stored by more than one responsible party.</p><p>So each peer — which in Holochain is both an end-user and a storage machine — has a range of the key space that it considers its ‘neighbourhood’. (You can think of the keys as addresses.)</p><p>From your place in the DHT, your neighbourhood stretches out to your left and right. Here, you know everybody by name and have a good idea what’s happening in their lives. You take responsibility for storing a copy of all data whose keys fall within it, to the best of your ability. You also know the transport addresses of all peers whose keys fall within it. (A transport address is the address in the underlying networking layer — an IP address, for example. It lets you do the actual communication.) You gossip over the fence regularly, sharing data with each other. If you go offline, your neighbours have your back, because their neighbourhoods overlap with yours and they can ‘heal’ the gap you left behind.</p><p>The size of your neighbourhood depends on your capacity and the resilience of your neighbourhood. If you find your device storage is filling up too quickly, rrDHT might choose to shrink your neighbourhood and drop responsibility for some data. And if you notice the coverage just outside your neighbourhood seems a bit weak, rrDHT might enlarge your neighbourhood and help improve resilience there.</p><p>Outside of this neighbourhood, you might have a couple connections with reliable peers spread across other regions of the DHT. (The patent suggests between five and ten.)</p> Neighbourhood lookups in action <p>Here’s how data storage and retrieval works in rrDHT. Instead of using numbers, I’ll make things easier and use the letters of the alphabet.</p><p>Maria and her friends are members of a dictionary DHT that stores words and their definitions. In the picture below, you can see the DHT from her perspective, with her neighbourhood spreading out from her place in the DHT:</p><p>Maria wants to know the meaning of the word ‘nanotechnology’. She calculates its address, which is N. That’s inside her neighbourhood, so she probably already has it in her own storage slice. But if she doesn’t yet, she asks Paulina, whose neighbourhood also covers that address. Paulina returns the definition to her.</p><p>Now she wants to store a definition for the word ‘galangal’. She calculates its address, G. If her neighbourhood were just a bit larger, she’d take responsibility for storing a copy herself and gossiping it to her neighbours. She sees that Henry, however, is really close to it. She sends it to him and, because his neighbourhood covers G, he stores it.</p><p>Finally, she wants to know the meaning of ‘caterwaul’. Its address, C, is also outside of her neighbourhood, and she doesn’t know anybody in her neighbourhood who’s close to it. The closest peer she knows about is Aoki. Aoki will have a better view of that part of the DHT than she does, so she asks him for the data. His neighbourhood doesn’t stretch far enough, though, so he doesn’t have it. But within his neighbourhood is Carol, whose neighbourhood does cover it. He sends Carol’s transport address to Maria, who asks Carol for the data.</p><p>We expect that, with most application DHTs, it’ll only take a few hops to get the data you’re looking for. Even in the worst-case scenario of a DHT with full saturation of the address space (roughly four billion peers who each have a tiny neighbourhood of two addresses in either direction), it’ll only take 22 hops.</p><p>(Note: there’s a second, broader neighbourhood that I didn’t mention. Maria doesn’t store data whose addresses fall in this neighbourhood, but she does keep tabs on who lives there. This helps improve resilience and lookup times.)</p> Why did we build something from scratch? <p>There are a lot of good DHT designs out there, and the nice thing about them is that they already have implementations we could’ve used. In fact, the first iteration of Holochain used <a href="https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht">IPFS’ implementation of the Kademlia DHT</a>. And it worked okay for finding data — it was fast and well-supported — but the challenge is that we want Holochain to have self-healing storage where data gets moved to peers with nearby addresses. And it wass very hard to describe that kind of neighbourhoods with Kademlia's nearness algorithm. And Holohchain wasn’t just using neighbourhoods for data storage and retrieval – it was using them for security too.</p><p>To understand that, we need to back up a bit and look at another problem that pops up when you take the authority out of the middle.</p><p>As I mentioned before, if an application wants to work right, it needs an assurance that it’s got a predictable view of the stored data, or state. If you expect X to equal 3 but it actually equals 7, your application might start throwing errors. But when nobody’s in charge of keeping that state consistent, the individual copies can get out of sync and make a mess of things. So you need to figure out who gets to modify that shared memory, and when. That is, how do you prevent two people from modifying the same thing at the same time on their separate machines? (Remember, there’s no central authority anymore — and there’s a new group of bad guys who would love to get involved too.) This problem was identified back in 1983 as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault">Byzantine Generals’ Problem</a>.</p><p>A common strategy is to select a ‘leader’ — the entity who’s allowed to make writes — and make sure that nobody else can write to the data.</p><p>Bitcoin, while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)">not</a> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)#Byzantine_Paxos">first</a> to tackle this problem, is certainly a pioneer when it comes to a strategy for leader selection among an unknown number of untrustworthy members. It simplifies the problem by recording everyone’s data writes in a single journal, of which everyone has a copy. Then a lottery is held every 10 minutes to select the next leader. This lottery helps keep everyone honest. But by design it’s expensive to play, in real time and money. This means that those with more money tend to dominate the game. That doesn’t feel very peer-to-peer anymore.</p><p>This is necessary because of Bitcoin’s design choice — that single, shared ledger is pretty attractive to bad actors, so it needs to be well protected. But we don’t think a shared ledger is actually necessary for ensuring data integrity.</p><p>Holochain makes things even simpler by saying, “why don’t we just put everyone in charge of their own write journal?” That’s where a peer-to-peer application runs anyway — on the devices of its users. This solves the leader selection problem; everyone is their own leader!</p><p>That’s fine when you’re just writing data for yourself. But when you start interacting with others, and everyone's in charge of their own data, how do you police bad data? Particularly problematic is the ability to manipulate your own history; you could do all sorts of fun stuff with that. Make negative balances disappear, change your mind about the politician you just voted for, modify things you said in the past without any accountability trail, etc.</p><p>Holochain’s answer is to make everyone accountable to everyone else. And here’s where that neighbourhood model comes in: when a neighbourhood is called on to store a piece of someone else’s public data, they first validate it according to Holochain’s #1 rule (you can’t manipulate your journal) and an application’s particular rules. If they find any suspicious activity, they sound the alarm. This alarm acts like an antibody — it spreads through the network of peers, triggering an immune response in each of them until everyone recognises the bad actor and has taken steps to protect themselves. (This usually looks like putting the bad actor in a block list.)</p><p>The address of each piece of data you produce is based on a cryptographic hash. That makes it effectively random, which means you don’t get to choose which neighbourhoods witness and validate your data. This prevents you from colluding with your evil friends and hiding your crime. You can try, but the person you’re trying to deceive has their own view of the DHT. They’re going to talk to the peers they trust. And when they find out nobody’s seen the data you said you published, your fraud is exposed.</p><p>Not only that, but you cryptographically sign every piece of data you produce. This means that your identity is all over the evidence.</p><p>This randomised peer witnessing, validation, and policing is what distinguishes Holochain’s rrDHT from other DHTs — it’s built for data integrity from the ground up. And that’s what makes Holochain able to perform at the speed of DHTs while offering the safety of blockchain.</p> Op-ed: bridging the old and the new <p>As I mentioned before, I’ve had a bit of a personal struggle accepting the idea of a patent on Holochain technology. I’m a bit of a starry-eyed idealist — I love free software (free-as-in-speech, although free-as-in-beer is also nice), and I love openness and sharing. Software patents feel like they’re part of the old world of enclosure, extraction, and competition.</p><p>But in the past few years of working with Holochain and Holo, I’ve come to appreciate the value of building bridges between the current world and the next. But when I reflect on it, I think that’s what we’ve been trying to do all along — working within the structures of the current world in order to birth the new. It’s unsexy, tedious, and sometimes dirty, but maybe it’s where we need to start.</p><p>There are a few reasons for this. First, if we don’t understand the rules of the game we’re stuck in, we won’t survive long enough to see the new game to maturity (this is why the troll protection). And reality is hard, messy, and inconsistent — we’re all at various stages of growth, various levels of ability to participate in new games according to our means. The current system isn’t going to just roll over and give us free room and board while we build tools for open collaboration and economics.</p><p>We also need to find ways to start unlocking and using the massive power and wealth that the current system is currently holding. We can see them as an asset, rather than a hurdle, and start ‘composting’ them into regenerative systems.</p><p>In the case of the CAL, that means we’re using the weapons of today (intellectual property law) to protect this little embryo of an idea we love so dearly. Besides being a standard open-source license, it imposes an extra restriction on those who create software with Holochain: they’re not allowed to hold your data hostage. It doesn’t mean you get to choose how it’s used (that’s an application-level concern), but it does mean you’ll never be barred from accessing it.</p><p>That feels powerful to me. It goes beyond the scope of open-source licenses to ensure freedom beyond just being able to audit and modify code. We’re embedding an ethical stance about data sovereignty into Holochain’s terms-of-use. This puts the CAL into the (sometimes <a href="https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/ethical-source-hippocratic-license">controversial</a>) territory of ‘<a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/definition/">Ethical Source</a>’. Personally, I’m okay with that. We’ve always been explicit about our intention to support the commons, and sometimes that means asking people to consent to <a href="https://osf.io/hnerp/?view_only=44b5c10772d5470892b701dfe4b2c833">restrictions</a> if they want to play this new game with us. After all, as Dr Elinor Ostrom famously demonstrated, <a href="http://www.onthecommons.org/magazine/elinor-ostroms-8-principles-managing-commmons">that's what makes the commons work</a>.</p>

 Oraichain, an AI-powered oracle and ecosystem for blockchains, will publish and monetize data generated from their services on Ocean&nbsp;Market. <p>Ocean Protocol is proud to announce a partnership with <a href="https://orai.io/">Oraichain</a> to integrate products, services, and AI data to expand their AI-powered ecosystem offerings.</p><p>Following the launch of <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-v3-is-now-live-b47c0e73f52a">Ocean v3 and Ocean Market</a> in October 2020, this new partnership connects key pillars of the Oraichain and Ocean ecosystems:</p>  Ocean will support Oraichain by providing Compute-to-Data technology to Oraichain’s AI Request Hub and AI Marketplace.  Ocean will enable its ecosystem partners to leverage Oraichain’s Request Hub to request data, compute services, AI oracles, and other AI services provided by Oraichain.  Oraichain will publish and monetize data from Oraichain’s AI services such as AI APIs and AI-generated data via the <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean&nbsp;Market</a>.  Oraichain and Ocean will explore further integrations of future products and services within their ecosystems.  <p>Here’s what Bruce Pon, Ocean Protocol founder, said about the partnership:</p><blockquote>Ocean Protocol’s engagement with Oraichain promises to be a dynamic addition to our data and AI ecosystems. The presence of Oraichain data on Ocean Market diversifies our offerings while Oraichain can benefit from leveraging our Compute-to-Data feature in their Request Hub. We’re excited to further explore the potential synergies.</blockquote><p>Commenting on the partnership, Dr. Chung Dao, Oraichain CEO,&nbsp;said:</p><blockquote>I am confident in the strong impact that the partnership between Oraichain and Ocean Protocol will have in terms of innovation in the AI and Blockchain space. Artificial Intelligence is the core of both companies, and the combined efforts, synergies, and future integration will create plenty of new opportunities.</blockquote><p>Oraichain is developing an AI Marketplace for AI services, featuring an AI Request Hub that will be the platform where companies (AI services &amp; data buyers) will be able to request customized AI solutions, and AI providers (AI services &amp; data sellers) will offer and monetize their solutions.</p><p>The collaboration will fast-track Oraichain’s AI Request Hub to be a solution-driven product providing direct access to Oraichain’s AI services, including AI Oracles — that contain AI APIs — and data for training and testing for those AI models. After the launch of <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/get-ready-for-smart-contracts-20-oraichain-launches-new-ai-powered-blockchain-network-2021-02-24">Oraichain Mainnet</a> (Oraichain’s blockchain network) in February, this new partnership will accelerate the rate of adoption of both organizations’ platforms.</p><p>The Request Hub is expected to launch in the second quarter of 2021 and will utilize Oraichain’s AI Data Hub and Ocean Protocol’s Compute-to-Data technology in order to attract customers and AI solution providers. Oraichain’s Request Hub will run several AI and Machine Learning competitions to call for an online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners, which is similar to Kaggle — a subsidiary of Google.

<p>This week, The Grocer’s conference on ‘How to build a sustainable brand’ brought together challenger brands, multinationals, NGOs and others to discuss the key issues in FMCG today. Read on for our roundup of the event’s key takeaways.</p>
 1. Brands must avoid ‘tunnel vision’ on sustainability issues 
<p>It’s vital that FMCG brands approach sustainability holistically and avoid championing certain environmental or social issues at the expense of others.</p>
<p>In a discussion on net zero targets, Dan Crossley of the Food Ethics Council reminded attendees that the current momentum around carbon mustn’t slow progress in other areas: “Brands must avoid having tunnel vision on climate alone and make sure that they are thinking about all those other environmental impacts: biodiversity loss, social impact, etc.”</p>
<p>Victoria Sjardin, VP of Marketing at Kraft Heinz, echoed this sentiment in a panel on sustainability communications. “It’s important to land simple messages with consumers but also to be responsible, and understand the framework of how we think about sustainability holistically.” She cautioned against making decisions to reduce impact in one area which might have detrimental effects in other areas, not least because “Gen Z has never been faster or more able to understand the full business intent.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s important to land simple messages with consumers but also to be responsible, and understand the framework of how we think about sustainability holistically.” – Victoria Sjardin, VP of Marketing at Kraft Heinz</p></blockquote>
 2. Customer-friendly frameworks will be key to driving behaviour change 
<p>“There are customers who would do something different if they knew what that was,” argued Susan Thomas, Senior Director of Sustainable Commercial Activities at Asda, in a panel exploring evolving shopper priorities.</p>
<p>Thomas highlighted the industry’s progress on communicating complex nutritional information to customers with <a href="https://www.food.gov.uk/safety-hygiene/check-the-label#:~:text=The%20traffic%20light%20labelling%20system,kilojoules%20in%20that%20particular%20product.">traffic light</a> health labelling. She believes the FMCG industry needs to deliver comparable education on sustainability issues: “From that data information understanding perspective, we’re a long way behind on the planet side of this conversation. Some products have put a carbon footprint on their packaging, but in isolation I don’t really know what to do with that number as a consumer. And of course, carbon footprint is not the only consideration – how are we going to collectively and consistently communicate these complex interlinked issues, so that customers can make important choices? I think that’s going to be a body of work for us as an industry for the next couple of years.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“Some products have put a carbon footprint on their packaging, but in isolation I don’t really know what to do with that number as a consumer.” – Susan Thomas, Senior Director of Sustainable Commercial Activities at Asda</p></blockquote>
 3. Don’t underestimate the proof required by regulators 
<p>Katie Vickery, Partner &amp; Head of the International Food Law Team at Osborne Clarke argued that proof was key to minimising risk for sustainability marketers, particularly in light of regulators’ increased focus on FMCG sustainability claims. She described how she’d seen a number of brands “put forward what would seem to be very credible substantiation [to the ASA], and actually that’s been knocked back.” Her advice for brands was not to underestimate the extent of substantiation required: “If you look at the trends that we’re seeing in terms of regulators, you get a sense of actually how far now marketing teams need to go when they’re coming up with their brand names or marketing slogans.”</p>
<p>But Vickery also offered marketers hope, in the shape of new guidance from the CMA, due to be published in summer 2021: “We’re going to get some really specific points around the different types of environmental claims that people can make.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Victoria Sjardin, VP of Marketing at Kraft Heinz, urged a holistic approach to sustainability</p>
 4. ‘No one can fix this alone’ 
<p>Cross-sector collaboration was a key theme throughout the day, and it prompted a fascinating debate on where responsibility lies for encouraging shoppers to make better purchase decisions. Rob Metcalfe, Richmond &amp; Towers, argued that retailers must take the lead: “The majority of brands don’t have sustainability as their raison d’etre. I don’t think brands can do it on their own.” Others stressed the need for a system-wide approach. ASDA’s Susan Thomas suggested that&nbsp; “a partnership between brands and retailers” was key to making sustainable shopping easier for customers. Jenny Costa, Rubies in the Rubble, agreed that brands have a big role to play, alongside retailers and government: “I would say that brands do have a really strong role to play in this. Purpose-driven brands can transform a category.”</p>
<p>In a keynote on net zero targets, Tesco CEO Ken Murphy also raised the importance of collaborating with suppliers, explaining that Tesco’s progress on carbon was only possible thanks to buy-in from its own-label suppliers: “By working to get our own house in order, we’ve learned lessons we can apply to the broader supply chain and we’re sharing our journey with suppliers. No one of us can fix this alone.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“Retailers want to list products that have a sustainable message and reflect their values well. It’s really exciting to see that change.” – Jenny Costa, Rubies in the Rubble</p></blockquote>
 5. Sooner or later, sustainable brands will reap the rewards 
<p>According to Jenny Costa, Rubies in the Rubble, both retailers and consumers have doubled down on sustainability issues in the last year: “Retailers want to list products that have a sustainable message and reflect their values well. It’s really exciting to see that change.” As for customers, she spoke of a huge rise in demand from zero waste stores, and explained that customer engagement in influencing business decisions is higher than it’s ever been.</p>
<p>But whilst investment in sustainability will pay off for brands, Ben Greensmith, Tony’s Chocolonely, suggested that this may still take time: “At the moment the companies that do good are at a commercial disadvantage, but I think in a few years time, those that don’t will be at a disadvantage.”</p>

  <p>A customer once asked me: “Hey – Can Okta integrate with Kong?” Spoiler alert: You totally can integrate Kong with Okta using its <a href="https://github.com/nokia/kong-oidc">OpenID Connect</a> plugin.</p>

<p>Still stuck wondering what an API gateway even is? Here’s a metaphor that works for me: You know that sci-fi movie trope in which you have a centralized hub that “jumps” you to other places in the galaxy? In that kind of system all the screening and security happens at the hub. It’s the same with Kong (and other API gateways).</p>

<p>In the case of the OIDC plugin, only Kong speaks directly to Okta using the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1">Authorization Code flow</a>. It then passes the contents of the <a href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeIDToken">ID Token</a> to an internal service using an HTTP header called <code>x-userinfo</code>. Your app just needs to know what to do with this HTTP header. It doesn’t have to do anything with OIDC itself.</p>

<p>This is easier to understand with some diagrams. Here’s what an architecture might look like without an API Gateway:</p>

<p></p>

<p>While you may have a load balancer sitting in front of everything acting as a “traffic cop”, each of your services has to know how to “speak” OIDC.</p>

<p>Here’s another diagram with an API Gateway in the mix:</p>

<p></p>

<p>In this case, only the Kong API gateway is interacting with Okta. Kong then passes the <code>x-userinfo</code> header along after the user authenticates. This enables your services to be a lot leaner – no OIDC stack needed.</p>

<p>I created a screencast based on <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-kong-origin-example">this working example</a>.</p>

 
  
 

<p>In this demo, I use <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> to create a container for Kong and another for a <a href="https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/">Spring Boot</a> app that understands the <code>x-userinfo</code> HTTP header.</p>

<p>The slides used in the screencast <a href="https://github.com/dogeared/centralize-auth-with-kong-and-okta">can be found on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>James Little presented on <a href="https://stork-search.net/">Stork Search</a>. He created it to solve the problem of locally owned, fast, relevant search for mostly static sites.</p><blockquote>Stork is two things. First, it's an indexer: it indexes your loosely-structured content and creates a file that you can upload to your web server. Second, it's a Javascript + WebAssembly frontend for that index file: Stork will hook into an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> on your web page, download the index you've specified, and display the best search results immediately to your user, as they type. The precomputed index and WebAssembly frontend module make the entire Stork engine very good, and very fast.</blockquote><p>It was really inspiring to hear James' story, starting with solving problems for his college newspaper website.</p><p>WebAssembly, ubiquitous CDN-like functionality for static sites, and that full-text search isn't black magic were the three things that happened roughly at the same time. Can a search index be treated like an image (which we know how to cache and deliver quickly), and use WebAssembly to make the experience very fast?</p><p>The answer of course is yes, with Stork!</p>"I can generate a search index out of band, then load it onto a webpage like an image, then use WebAssembly to run the search"<p>And, how the approach to images on the web can be applied to large search indexes:</p><p>Watch the video below for the full presentation.</p> Video <p><a href="https://files.jameslittle.me/talks/stork-slides.pdf">Download a PDF of the slides</a> or <a href="https://jameslittle.me/talks/stork/">visit James' talk page »</a></p><blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/jameslittle230?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@jameslittle230</a> considers Stork super early still.

   The traditional paradigm of investing in protection of known threats alone has been declining over recent years, as attackers become more adaptable and capable. Combine this with increased threats and attacker ingenuity it is small wonder that a CISO’s role has become more complex. This leads to the inevitability of a security incident where the complex environments and inventive attacks collide.

Combine this with increased threats and attacker ingenuity it is small wonder that a CISO’s role has become more complex. This leads to the inevitability of a security incident where the complex environments and inventive attacks collide. <br></p>
<p>This presentation looks at three fundamentals:&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Why traditional protective approaches are no longer effective enough.</p>
 
 
<p>How complexity has made the CISO’s ability to respond more difficult.</p>
 
 
<p>The importance of automation in the response process to address this paradigm shift CISOs now face</p>

<p>It’s no secret we need a better web. The original vision of an open and decentralized network that’s universally accessible continues to be a north star for those working to design the future of digital infrastructure for everyday people. Despite the progress that has been made in democratising access to massive amounts of information, the dire state of cybersecurity and privacy on the internet today present significant barriers to access for too many of our most vulnerable populations. We started MATTR because we believe that standards, transparency, and openness are not only better for users; they make for stronger systems and more resilient networks. We recognize that a decentralized web of digital trust, based on transparency, consent, and verifiable data, can help us address critical challenges on a global scale. It represents a significant opportunity to give people real agency and control over their digital&nbsp;lives.</p> Our story <p>At its inception, we chose “MATTR” as a moniker because we strongly believed that the movement towards more decentralized systems will fundamentally change the nature of data and privacy on the internet. Matter, in its varying states, forms the building blocks of the universe, symbolically representing the capacity for change and transformation that allows us all to grow and adapt. In another sense, people matter, and the impact of decisions we make as builders of technology extend beyond ourselves. It’s a responsibility we take seriously, as Tim Berners Lee puts it, “to preserve new frontiers for the common good.” We proudly bear the name MATTR and the potential it represents as we’ve built out our little universe of products.</p><p>In September 2020, we <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/introducing-the-mattr-platform-91db4925c773">introduced</a> our decentralized identity platform. Our goal was to deliver standards-based digital trust to developers in a scalable manner. We designed our platform with a modular security architecture to enable our tools to work across many different contexts. By investing deeply in open standards and open source communities as well as developing insights through collaboration and research, we realized that developers want to use something that’s convenient without compromising on flexibility, choice, or security. That’s why we launched our platform with standards-based cryptography and configurable building blocks to suit a broad array of use cases and user experiences in a way that can evolve as technology matures.</p><p>At the same time, we’ve continued to work in open source and open standards communities with greater commitment than ever to make sure we’re helping to build a digital ecosystem that can support global scale. We launched <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/">MATTR Learn</a> and <a href="https://mattr.global/resources/">MATTR Resources</a> as hubs for those interested in these new technologies, developing educational content to explore concepts around decentralized identity, offering guided developer tutorials and videos, and providing documentation and API references. We also unveiled a <a href="https://mattr.global/">new website</a>, introduced a novel approach to <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/a-solution-for-privacy-preserving-verifiable-credentials-f1650aa16093">selective disclosure of verifiable credentials</a>, built and defined a <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/jwm-a-new-standard-for-secure-messaging-a21d3daa4403">new secure messaging standard</a>, developed a prototype for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXvWxFjHvdY">paper-based credentials</a> to cater for low-tech environments, and made a bridge to <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/introducing-oidc-credential-provider-7845391a9881">extend OpenID Connect with verifiable credentials</a>. We’ve consistently released tools and added features to make our products more secure, extensible, and easy to use. In parallel, we also <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/news/2020/10/09/news-release-dhs-st-svip-makes-new-phase-1-awards-five-blockchain-companies">joined the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s SVIP program</a> in October to help advance the goals of decentralized identity and demonstrate provable interoperability with other vendors in a transparent and globally-visible manner. Zooming out a bit, our journey at MATTR is part of a much larger picture of passionate people working in collaborative networks across the world to make this&nbsp;happen.</p> The bigger&nbsp;picture <p>It has been an incredible year for decentralized and self-sovereign identity as a whole. In light of the global-scale disruption of COVID-19, the demand for more secure digital systems became even more critical to our everyday lives. Start-ups, corporations, governments, and standards organizations alike have been heavily investing in building technology and infrastructure to support an increasingly digital world. We’re seeing this innovation happen across the globe, from the work being done by the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/svip">DHS Silicon Valley Innovation Program</a> to the <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a> and <a href="https://www.digital.govt.nz/news/development-of-digital-identity-trust-framework-confirmed/">New Zealand Digital Identity Trust Framework</a>. Many global leaders are stepping up to support and invest in more privacy-preserving digital security, and for good reason. Recent legislation like <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> and <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">CCPA</a> have made the role of big tech companies and user data rights increasingly important, providing a clear mandate for a wave of change that promises to strengthen the internet for the public good. This provides an incredible catalyst for all the work happening in areas such as cryptography, decentralized computing and digital governance. Just in the last year, we’ve seen the following advancements:</p>  <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/secure-data-storage.html">Secure Data Storage WG</a> created at <a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> to realize an interoperable technology for encrypted and confidential data&nbsp;storage  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> v1.0 specification reached “Candidate Recommendation” stage at the W3C, establishing stability in anticipation of standardization later this&nbsp;year  <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/">Sidetree protocol</a> v1.0 released at DIF, providing a layer-2 blockchain solution for scalable Decentralized Identifiers built on top of ledgers such as Bitcoin and&nbsp;Ethereum  <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging v2.0</a> specification launched at DIF, a new protocol for secure messaging based on Decentralized Identifiers and built on JOSE encryption standards  <a href="https://identity.foundation/did-siop/">Self-Issued OpenID</a> (SIOP) became an official working group item at the <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OpenID Foundation</a>, advancing the conversation around the role of identity providers on the&nbsp;web  Google’s <a href="https://github.com/WICG/WebID">WebID project</a> started developing features to allow the browser to mediate interactions between end-users and identity providers in a privacy-preserving way  <p>For more information on how all of these technologies are interconnected, read our latest paper, <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/the-state-of-identity-on-the-web-cffc392bc7ea">The State of Identity on the&nbsp;Web</a>.</p><p>In addition, as part of our involvement with the DHS SVIP program, in March of this year we participated in the DHS SVIP Interoperability Plugfest. This event saw 8 different companies, representing both human-centric identity credentials as well as asset-centric supply chain traceability credentials, come together to showcase standards-compliance and genuine cross-vendor and cross-platform interoperability via testing and live demonstrations. The full presentation, including demos and videos from the public showcase day, can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MeeP7vDXb9CpSBfjTybYbo8qJfrrbrXCSJa0DklNe2k/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p><p>These are just a handful of the significant accomplishments achieved over the last year. It’s been incredibly inspiring to see so many people working towards a common set of goals for the betterment of the web. As we’ve built our products and developed alongside the broader market, we’ve learned quite a bit about how to solve some of the core business and technical challenges associated with this new digital infrastructure. We’ve also gained a lot of insight from working directly with governments and companies across the globe to demonstrate interoperability and build bridges across different technology ecosystems.</p> Launching MATTR&nbsp;VII <p>We’ve been hard at work making our decentralized identity platform better than ever, and we’re proud to announce that as of today, we’re ready to support solutions that solve real-world problems for your users, in production — and it’s open to everybody.</p><p>That’s why we’re rebranding our platform to MATTR VII. Inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_matter">seven states of matter</a>, our platform gives builders and developers all the tools they need at their fingertips to create a whole new universe of decentralized products and applications. We provide all the raw technical building blocks to allow you to create exactly what you have in mind. MATTR VII is composable and configurable to fit your needs, whether you’re a well-established business with legacy systems or a start-up looking to build the next best thing in digital privacy. Best of all, MATTR VII is use-case-agnostic, meaning we’ve baked minimal dependencies into our products so you can use them the way that makes the most sense for&nbsp;you.</p><p>Starting today, we’re opening our platform for general availability. Specifically, that means if you’re ready to build a solution to solve a real-world problem for your users, we’re ready to support you. Simply <a href="https://mattr.global/contact/">contact us</a> to get the ball rolling and to have your production environment set up. Of course, if you’re not quite ready for that, you can still test drive the platform by signing up for a <a href="https://mattr.global/get-started/">free trial</a> of MATTR VII to get started right away. It’s an exciting time in the MATTR universe, and we’re just getting&nbsp;started.</p><p>We’re continuing to build-out features to operationalize and support production use cases. To this end, in the near future we will be enhancing the sign-up and onboarding experience as well as providing tools to monitor your usage of the platform.

   ION – We Have Liftoff! 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Four years ago, we started a journey to help develop and advance decentralized identity, an emerging form of identity technology that empowers individuals and creates new business capabilities. Our goal is to put individuals, organizations, and other entities at the center of the apps, services, and digital exchanges that increasingly play a pivotal role in our lives. Among all the technical development required to deliver decentralized identity, none is more important than <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DIDs are identifiers that can be used to secure access to resources, sign and verify credentials, and facilitate application data exchange. Unlike traditional usernames and email addresses, DIDs are owned and controlled by the entity itself (be it a person, device, or company), and exist independently of any external organization or trusted intermediary. Without DIDs, you can’t have a vibrant, interoperable decentralized identity and application ecosystem. Early on we recognized the existence of a secure, scalable DID implementation was a prerequisite for the kinds of applications and services we wanted to offer, so in 2019 <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-active-directory-identity/toward-scalable-decentralized-identifier-systems/ba-p/560168">we set out to build one</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are excited to share that v1 of <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/">ION</a> is complete and has been launched on Bitcoin mainnet. We have deployed an ION node to our production infrastructure and are working together with other companies and organizations to do so as well. ION does not rely on centralized entities, trusted validators, or special protocol tokens – ION answers to no one but you, the community. Because ION is an open, permissionless system, anyone can run an ION node, in fact the more nodes in operation, the stronger the network becomes. Development of ION, and the Sidetree standard ION is based on, takes place in the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF). Read on to learn how you can integrate ION, DIDs, and Verifiable Credentials in your applications and services.<br><br>Learn more about ION here: <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/">https://identity.foundation/ion/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Use ION DIDs 
<p>Creating an open, public, permissionless DID implementation that runs at massive scale, to the tune of thousands of operations per second, while maintaining decentralization and security was a long road – now it’s time to drive adoption. To help get DIDs into the hands of users and enable developers to easily integrate ION DIDs in wallets, decentralized apps, and credential-related services, we have contributed an open source library for generating DIDs and have opened up our ION node to provide a no-hassle option for anchoring ION DIDs:<br><br></p>
<p>Generate ION DIDs and keys – the high-level ION.js helper library is the easiest way to start generating ION DIDs as fast as possible: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion-tools#ionjs">github.com/decentralized-identity/ion-tools (ION.js library).</a><br><br></p>
<p>An example of generating an ION DID with the ION.js library:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the lower-level SDK –&nbsp;access a larger set of ION-related APIs that provide more granular functionality: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion-sdk">github.com/decentralized-identity/ion-sdk (TypeScript/Node)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anchor DIDs you generate – easily anchor your DIDs via our ION node, without having to interact with a cryptocurrency wallet or run an ION node locally: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion-tools">github.com/decentralized-identity/ion-tools</a><br><br></p>
<p>[ NOTE: ownership of your DIDs is based on keys you generate locally, and all ION operations are signed with those keys, so even if you use our node for anchoring DID operations (or any other node), you are always in sole control. ]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Run an ION node 
<p>Running an ION node provides the fastest lookup of ION DIDs, the highest level of security when interacting with ION DIDs, and ensures you can always resolve ION DIDs without depending on intermediaries. There are two options for running an ION node:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Run the Dockerized version of ION: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion/tree/master/docker">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion/tree/master/docker</a> (provides an option to connect to an existing Bitcoin node) 
 Install a node natively on your machine: <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/install-guide/">https://identity.foundation/ion/install-guide/</a> 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Lookup ION DIDs 
<p>You can resolve ION DIDs to view their keys and routing endpoints using the ION Explorer interface: <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/explorer/">https://identity.foundation/ion/explorer/</a>. This dashboard (which you’ll soon be able to run against your own local ION node) is being built-out with more views and tools as we speak, and will eventually contain interfaces to help operators monitor their local ION nodes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Leverage ION DIDs today 
<p>Here are a few ways you can use ION DIDs right now:<br><br></p>
 
 If you are a business or organization, sign up for the public preview of the Azure AD Verifiable Credential service: <a href="http://aka.ms/vcpreview">http://aka.ms/vcpreview</a> 
 Explore integrating OpenID Connect Self-Issued for DIDs to authenticate with sites, apps, and services that implement the draft specification: <a href="https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/src/master/openid-connect-self-issued-v2-1_0.md">https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/src/master/openid-connect-self-issued-v2-1_0.md</a> 
 Create a DID for yourself or your company and cryptographically link it to Web domains you control, using the DIF Well-Known DID Configuration specification: <a href="https://identity.foundation/.well-known/resources/did-configuration/">https://identity.foundation/.well-known/resources/did-configuration/</a>. 
 Use a DID to issue <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a>, which are digital proofs that can be used to represent just about any verifiable assertion or asset, such as diplomas, membership cards, event tickets, etc.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 ION’s core protocol has been standardized 
<p>Along with ION reaching v1, so too has the protocol at its core: <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/">Sidetree</a>. Sidetree is a specification developed alongside many others at the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF) that enables scalable DID networks (i.e. <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/">ION</a>, <a href="https://www.transmute.industries/element/">Element</a>, <a href="https://trustbloc.github.io/did-method-orb/">Orb</a>) to be built atop any decentralized event record system (e.g. blockchains). We would like to thank the following collaborators who have worked on specs, contributed code, or provided feedback during this process:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.transmute.industries/">Transmute</a> (<a href="https://www.transmute.industries/element/">Element</a>)

 <a href="https://www.spruceid.com/">Spruce</a> 
 <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This work would not have been possible without the contributions of folks like Orie Steele of Transmute and Troy Ronda of SecureKey, who played key roles in shaping the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/sidetree">Sidetree specification</a>, our colleagues in Microsoft Research, as well as Dietrich Ayala and the Protocol Labs team, who helped integrate <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a> as the P2P file replication protocol used in ION.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open source development and codification of standards is essential to the creation of a vibrant decentralized identity ecosystem. If you are a developer or organization interested in contributing to the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/sidetree">Sidetree specification</a>, <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion">ION’s open source code</a>, or any other work underway in this area, we encourage you to join the <a href="https://identity.foundation">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF) and its <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/sidetree.html">Sidetree Development &amp; Operating Group</a>. This group is the primary place where contributors meet to discuss various technical and operational aspects of ION and the general Sidetree protocol.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Beyond v1 
<p>With ION v1 out the door, we will be turning our attention toward optimizing the ION node implementation and adding other important features, such as:<br><br></p>
 
 Deliver a light node configuration, making node operation easier for low-resource devices. 
 Add tooling and support for Ed25519 and BLS12-381 keys 
 Enable optimistic operation ingestion for transactions still in the mempool (reduces time to resolution) 
 Codify an initial set of DID type tags (used in tagging DIDs as IoT devices, software packages, etc.) 
 Enable querying of ION’s decentralized DID directory based on DID type – for example: once organizations and businesses establish DIDs, you will be able to fetch all DIDs typed as&nbsp;<a href="https://schema.org/Organization">Organization</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://schema.org/LocalBusiness">LocalBusiness</a>, etc., to build a decentralized directory. You will also be able find all DIDs of types like&nbsp;<a href="https://schema.org/SoftwareSourceCode">SoftwareSourceCode</a>, to create decentralized code package and app registries. (NPM? How about DPM) 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While launching v1 of ION is a significant milestone, we’re still in the early phases of this journey. We have a lot left to do before we can fully realize a better, more trustworthy, more decentralized Web that empowers every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.</p>

<p>A conversation with KILT Protocol’s Founder and CEO Ingo&nbsp;Rübe</p><p>KILT is a blockchain protocol for issuing self-sovereign, anonymous, verifiable credentials and decentralised identifiers.</p><p>But what exactly does that mean? Who better to ask than the creator of KILT himself! Ingo Rübe breaks it down for us in his own&nbsp;words.</p><p>Let’s start with the things that are most associated with KILT. What are decentralised identifiers and credentials?</p><p>Ingo: KILT Protocol is a system for maintaining identities. And here comes the first interesting part: an identity is something different from an identifier.</p><p>If we have an identifier it’s just a name or a number — it doesn’t say anything about an identity. So for example, my name is Ingo. If my identifier is Ingo, that doesn’t say that I’m from Berlin, it doesn’t say that I am working on the KILT Protocol, whether I have a driving licence or not; it doesn’t say anything about me. It doesn’t really contain any information, it’s just an identifier.</p><p>And if there is only one Ingo here and you direct a question to Ingo, I know it’s me you’re talking to. But if there are two Ingos in the room we never know, so it would be good to have those identifiers a little bit&nbsp;unique.</p><p>This is the first part: Identity starts with an identifier, which is what all the other things are linked to. And many of these things in our world are linked to the identifier with credentials. So think of real life; I have a passport from Europe and it basically says “Ingo”. And it also has a picture of me, and other things, but it can be directly linked to me because I am Ingo and the word Ingo is there on the passport. But the passport gives more information about me because, for example, it says I’m European. And this passport is what we call a credential.</p><p>So identity is built by adding more and more credentials to an identifier.</p><p>If you want to build a digital identity you need both an identifier — for people or things — and then you need different types of credentials which are linked to the identifier. Then step by step you produce a digital identity.</p><p>If you want to register with a social media platform, for example, you choose a username and password. And they check to make sure that the username isn’t already taken and that your password has enough numbers or letters or whatever, and if everything is okay this is now your username and your password and you’ve got an identifier.</p><p>And then you go on the platform and you like certain things and maybe write a comment or two. And depending on the platform, you can add photos, or university status, and a passport or whatever, and the identity is growing. And you can link other things to it. These are your credentials. This is your behaviour, and this aggregates there — with the platform, not with&nbsp;you.</p><p>But this can also be done for machines. The identifier of the device could be a very long number for example. This device can be identified by this number because this number is unique to it. And then, step by step you add more and more credentials to it, like an IOT device that is compatible with a certain standard, for example. Then the device gets an identity. And if the identifier is registered on the blockchain it becomes decentralised, because the blockchain doesn’t store information in any one location; it’s spread across a network of computers.</p><p>What are verifiable credentials and why is it important that they are verifiable?</p><p>Ingo: There are several parts to&nbsp;this.</p><p>First, credentials are built on trust. Trust is not generated by the blockchain, trust is something that happens in the real world — that’s how our society has been working for thousands of&nbsp;years.</p><p>KILT takes the old process of top-down trust in the real world and puts it into the digital&nbsp;world.</p><p>Anyone can build a credential. You could make your own. You could print your name on a piece of paper and stick your photo on it and write on it that you can drive, but people might not believe it just because you say it and made your own credential!</p><p>It would be better to use one that is already there, that is already trusted, like a driving licence from the government department that deals with them. That would probably have your photo, your name, it would include a vehicle class. You can go to most places in the world and they will look at it and look at your photo and say, ok, I trust it. It looks like a driving licence and he looks like the person in the&nbsp;photo.</p><p>But digitally, when you give your credentials to someone there’s no photo. I can wave a physical credential at you; a digital one I can’t — it’s just&nbsp;numbers.</p><p>So now we need a trusted entity to confirm that those numbers really mean what they say they mean. In KILT we call this the attester. We’ll go into more details on how the attester works another time, and how we know we can trust them, but basically, they confirm, or attest, that the information is true. They do this by digitally signing the digital credential and then sending it to the claimer. They also create a hash of the credential — a number representing the information — and store it on the blockchain. It’s not personal data or the document itself, it’s just a&nbsp;hash.</p><p>The important fact is: the credential is issued by the trusted entity to the user. And the user owns the credential. They can decide when to show it, to whom and for what purpose. The trusted entity is not involved anymore. So, if I receive your credential because you want to hire a car from me, you show me your digital driving licence. I check with the blockchain to see if this hash which comes out of your credential is actually present on the blockchain. If it’s present on the blockchain, it’s fine. You can hire the car and drive away. The driving license department will never find out about you hiring a&nbsp;car.</p><p>That’s why we call it a verifiable credential; it’s a credential that can be verified. Simple!</p><p>But what happens if you drive crazily and the driving department says “Give the licence back, we don’t want you to drive again for the next ten years”? In the real world they would ask you to send your licence back and you don’t have it any more. But in the digital world it’s just numbers. Even if you send it to them and say “Hey, here’s my licence back” you still have a digital copy. So there needs to be a way that the attester can check that everything is still okay and, if it’s not, be able to revoke the credential.</p><p>So that’s why digital credentials need to be revocable?</p><p>Ingo: Exactly! And that’s what we use the blockchain for. The KILT blockchain makes credentials revocable; so if the attester wants to revoke your digital licence they can just put another hash of the credential representing your driving licence on the blockchain to show that it has been&nbsp;revoked.</p><p>Then if you go to hire the car and present your credential, your digital licence, it looks OK at first. But when I check the hash I can see, yes, there was a credential once but this one was revoked. So I don’t let you hire the&nbsp;car.</p><p>And that’s why it’s so important to have an entity that stores the VALIDITY of a credential. But that’s the kind of thing you don’t want a big corporation to have. They might think “Hey, we could just revoke everyone’s credentials until they pay us a lot of money” or whatever. It could be the most dangerous company in the world. This is why the validity of credentials does not belong in the hands of a company. It has to be on neutral ground, revocable for attesters but immutable to anyone else. And that’s the reason we use a permissionless blockchain to record&nbsp;it.</p><p>Interesting! Back to the description of KILT we started with, what do you mean by “self-sovereign”?</p><p>Ingo: Self-sovereign means something very useful. It means that you hold your credentials. In the real world you hold your credentials in your wallet, or in your home. So you have sovereignty over them, basically. But in the digital world you don’t. In our example of signing up to a social media platform with a username and password, you don’t have your credentials — the platform&nbsp;does.</p><p>But with KILT you own your digital credentials. You keep them in your wallet and if someone asks for your credential — your driving licence or whatever — you can send it to them. And this also affects anonymity because when you have sovereignty over your credentials then you can choose what you show to people and how much of it you want to reveal. And a blockchain-based system allows you to do&nbsp;that.</p><p>So the data is anonymous?</p><p>Ingo: what we do is give you control over your data. We don’t store it on the blockchain, it’s stored in your wallet. Only the hash that shows that the credential is valid — or not — is on the blockchain.</p><p>But anonymity is more than that; it’s something that has to be provided in different ways. So, going back to the driving licence example. If you want to go into a bar you might have to prove that you are over 18. In the real world you can choose any of the credentials you have in your wallet to prove that — your driving licence, or identity card, your student card, whatever. And you can show this to the person on the door. They just need to see your picture and your date of birth to prove that you are over 18, but they don’t need to know your name, or anything else about you — you can choose to put your finger over it and you will still be let in. This is what we call selective disclosure and this is also a part of anonymity.</p><p>That sounds like a great development in digital identity! One last question for you today. What exactly is blockchain?</p><p>Ingo: In simple terms, blockchain is a digital, decentralised database, or record of transactions. So when you think about blockchains you have to start with databases basically, and these are something that are even older than credentials.</p><p>Databases are around 4,000 years old. They started with our ancient ancestors — they put symbols into clay and started to record things like how much tax someone owed, and that sort of thing. And this was the first central database. You had this piece of clay with all this information on it and this piece of clay told the truth, in a way. And if you wanted to know how much tax you owed, you could look at this piece of clay. This principle of a central database is the fundament of basically almost everything we have. Our governments wouldn’t work without that, society wouldn’t work without that, banking wouldn’t work without that; this is really a huge success in history, these databases.</p><p>But they have some disadvantages. The first is that if you drop the piece of clay on the floor, then it breaks and it’s gone. Well, modern databases aren’t made out of clay, but they are still very easy to break. You could make a copy, but then there can be errors in copying it. You could have two different types of information and not really know which is the real one. The second thing which is terrible about those databases is that they are controlled by a single person normally, and that single person can be bribed. So they can be connected with corruption. So you have a lot of disadvantages.</p><p>But you have also advantages, because you have a central piece of information, very easy to handle, very easy to administer, the governance of it is totally easy — the king, or civil servant or whoever says you write this down and only you write this down on this piece of clay and everybody can read it and we’re good to go, right? As long as the person isn’t corrupt and doesn’t die. So that’s basically how central databases work.</p><p>And modern central databases are extremely fast, extremely cheap, extremely easy to administer and this is why they are somewhat successful. But like the ancient ones, they have these two little problems — they are very easy to break and very easy to&nbsp;corrupt.</p><p>If you want to build a system to get away from that, a nice and easy solution is blockchain, because this is a system where you don’t have only one copy of the thing. You say basically everyone can be a bookkeeper and everybody has the same book. If something is added to the book then everybody has to add it, which is extremely hard to administer, extremely slow and extremely expensive. But it is completely safe; if one of the books falls down or one of the machines explodes, because you have 999 copies of it, it’s not a problem. And if one or two of the bookkeepers goes corrupt, it’s also not a problem because you have 998 others who are not corrupt. And with every new entry they have to agree that the book they all have is the same version of the book again. And this is the basic idea of blockchain.</p><p>So what can you do with something like that? You use this if you don’t want to trust a single entity or person, because with a database you always have to trust the person running it. I can read it but I have to trust what they actually wrote into it is true. And there might even be an intermediary, and I have to trust what they wrote in there&nbsp;too.</p><p>If you want to get rid of the intermediary you can use the blockchain and have the actual truth in the system, which is defined by a democratic majority of the bookkeepers and mathematical algorithms. And if you say everyone can actually become part of the system and be a bookkeeper as well, then you have the wisdom of the crowd and can say it’s probably actually the mathematical truth. So we change from trust in a person or entity to the mathematical truth. And most people believe the mathematical truth.</p><p>And if there are thousands of computers that have agreed on something like the balance of my account, then I can believe it much easier than believing a single person or institution. Because they might have made a mistake, or been corrupted.</p><p>This is what you use the blockchain for. It doesn’t work for everything — in the past people tried to build many crazy things with it, like closed logistics chains, and that doesn’t make sense. If you only have three partners interacting and they run a blockchain together they actually have to trust each other because they’re running the system together and it’s not open — it would be much easier and cheaper for them to run a database and all have a key to the database. Blockchain only makes sense if you need to work together without constantly making use of a trusted entity. The blockchain replaces the trust in an entity with the mathematical truth.</p><p>There are so many uses for blockchain; I think it’s going to change the internet completely over the next ten&nbsp;years.</p><p>Thanks for the insights&nbsp;Ingo!</p><p>Discover more about KILT Protocol on our <a href="https://www.kilt.io/">website</a> or follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/Kiltprotocol">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/KILTProtocolChat">Telegram</a>.</p>

   New Report: IAM for the Hybrid Enterprise 

<p>Today we published a new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-reports/forrester-study-hybrid-cloud-iam">study</a>* conducted by Forrester Consulting on behalf of ForgeRock and our friends at Google Cloud on the state of identity and access management (IAM) in the cloud. It’s a terrific read, and I encourage you to check it out.</p>

<p>We introduce an emerging concept called “Hybrid IAM,” which we think is the next phase of digital identity. Simply put, Hybrid IAM enables enterprises to run, unify, and secure all digital identities with a single platform in a hybrid IT environment. We recognize that, while many customers prefer cloud-only approaches if feasible, the reality is a comprehensive strategy involves IAM across <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">cloud</a>, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/deployments/multi-cloud-devops">on-premises</a>, and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/deployments/hybrid-iam">hybrid IT</a> environments. This is a big opportunity for organizations to tackle, and as the only IAM platform on the market that can do this, ForgeRock is very well positioned to help.</p>

 
 


 IAM for the Hybrid Enterprise 

<p>The focus of the study is a global survey of more than 300 IT leaders who are involved in IAM decisions and hybrid cloud migration efforts. Here are the key findings:</p>

  More than 80% will have adopted or plan to adopt/expand their cloud-based IAM initiatives over the next two years 
	 Nearly 90% of respondents are held back from embracing IAM in the cloud because of technical challenges: their current solutions lack the required scale, stability, and capabilities 
	 More than 80% believe a hybrid IAM approach would provide great customer and employee experiences 
  The ForgeRock Difference 

<p>We believe helping organizations create secure and frictionless, intuitive digital experiences is the name of the game, and the market continues to move in this direction. Working with Google Cloud, we continue to see enterprises requiring a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/deployments/hybrid-iam">hybrid IAM approach</a> to realize success. Again, check out the study, and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/contact">let us know how we can help you</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>*<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-reports/forrester-study-hybrid-cloud-iam">Identity and Access Management (IAM) for the Hybrid Enterprise</a> is a commissioned research study conducted by Forrester Consulting on behalf of ForgeRock.</p>

 Safeguarding your Personal Identifiable Information in the Digital&nbsp;World <p>When you think of the word “credential”, what’s the first thing that comes to your&nbsp;mind?</p><p>Possibly a driver’s license, passport, Social Security Number, a university degree, or anything that identifies or belongs only to&nbsp;you.</p><p>Generally speaking, a credential is a piece of information that identifies a particular entity or verifies that a person has a specific attribute, qualification, or claim. For example, passports are proof of your identity while a university degree is a claim you&nbsp;possess.</p><p>In the physical world, someone can verify documents by examining them, but how do you do it in the digital&nbsp;world?</p><p>Well, that’s where verifiable credentials come&nbsp;in.</p> What are Verifiable Credentials? <p>At the most basic level, verifiable credentials, or VC in short, are tamper-proof credentials that can be verified cryptographically.</p><p>There are three essential components of verifiable credentials, and they&nbsp;are:</p>  It is machine verifiable  It is secure and tamper-proof  Has been issued by a competent authority.  <p>From an implementation standpoint, these VCs must adhere to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C’s Verifiable Credentials Data Model</a>. This is a set of specifications that allow credentials to be verified and shared on the&nbsp;web.</p><p>Moving on, let’s take a look at how VCs&nbsp;work.</p> A Basic Working&nbsp;Model <p>There are three entities in a verifiable credential ecosystem and they&nbsp;are:</p>  Issuer  Holder  Verifier  <p>The issuer is the entity that is issuing the credential, the holder is the entity about whom the credential is issued, and the verifier is an entity that verifies if the credential meets the established criteria of a&nbsp;VC.</p><p>Let’s talk a bit more about these entities.</p> Issuer <p>An issuer is an entity that is authorized to issue a credential. These issuers are typically government organizations, healthcare centers, banks and financial institutions, schools and universities, and possibly even organizations that provide proof of employment.</p><p>These entities use a combination of methods such as digital signatures and custom schemas to prove that they are competent to issue a credential.</p> Holder <p>A holder is someone who is the owner of the credential and has complete control over how it can be managed, with whom these credentials can be shared, or revoked. Holders are typically individuals or organizations.</p><p>Since the holder is the owner of the credential, the onus is on this entity to create a verifiable presentation, which is the compilation of data sent by one or more issuers in a machine-verifiable format that adheres to the existing standards.</p> Verifier <p>A verifier is an entity that verifies a credential and ensures that it comes from a competent issuer, is tamper-proof, and is still relevant (not expired or revoked). A verifier takes the verifiable presentation from the holder to determine its authenticity.</p> Example <p>Let’s look at an example to better understand these entities and their relationship.</p><p>Say, a healthcare center certifies that a particular individual has taken the COVID-19 vaccination and this information is verified by a machine for its authenticity.</p><p>Here, the issuer is the healthcare provider, the holder is the individual who has vaccinated, and a verifier is a machine that checks the verifiable presentation for its authenticity. Once verified, the holder is free to share it with anyone he/she&nbsp;wishes.</p> Workflow <p>Now that we know the role of the three entities, let’s briefly talk about the workflow.</p>The Trust&nbsp;Triangle<p>The issuer digitally signs a document and sends it to the holder. Next, the holder creates a verifiable presentation in a certain format that conforms to the W3C specifications and sends it to the verifier for verifications.</p><p>Finally, the verifier checks the presentation against the specifications to verify the three aspects — competent authority, validity, and tamper-proof characteristic of the credential. If all three conditions are met, the credentials are deemed verified, and the verifiable presentation is sent back to the&nbsp;holder.</p><p>In another possible workflow, the holder can initiate the proceedings. Let’s say, the holder is an individual who wants to travel, but the airline stipulates only individuals who are vaccinated against COVID-19. In this case, the holder requests information from the issuer and sends it to the verifier for verification. Once verified, the holder can send the credentials to the airline&nbsp;company.</p><p>Likewise, the verifier can also initiate a request to get some data from the holder, and in turn, the holder reaches out to the issuer to send&nbsp;it.</p><p>As you can see, trust is the central aspect of VCs, and handling this aspect well is key to the success of any VC-based&nbsp;system.</p><p>Another key aspect is that many entities work towards the common goal of using the existing data collectively. They use commonly-agreed tools and data standards to handle the data on hand, thereby laying the foundation for a common data registry.</p> Use Cases <p>Now that you have an idea of VCs, let’s take a look at some of the areas where they can be implemented.</p>  Visa validity of travelers  Healthcare certificates, especially COVID-19&nbsp;tests  Airline tickets  Secure transfer of government-issued documents like passports and driver’s&nbsp;licenses  Checking credit scores for loan applications  Credentials for opening a bank account or setting up&nbsp;payments  Sharing residency status for appropriate government schemes, and&nbsp;more  <p>This is nowhere an exhaustive list, rather it gives you an idea of what you can do with this young and exciting technology. If you can think of any area where you can implement these verifiable credentials, join <a href="https://affinidipocathon.devpost.com/">Affinidi PoCathon 2021</a> that offers exciting prizes for new ideas and implementations.</p><p>Also, watch this space for more articles related to the triangle of trust in VCs, W3C specifications, use of complex criteria for verifying the identity of the issuer, possible threats to watch out for, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Written by <a href="https://medium.com/u/47e407d1242a">Lavanya&nbsp;Rathnam</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/affinidi/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">What are Verifiable Credentials?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/affinidi">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

After the sale was completed, the project effectively has had two successful Pre-IEO rounds, with that, we look enthusiastically to the 3rd and final Pre-IEO round. It is quite evident that the <a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/metamui-pre-ieo-sale-introducing-reservation-feature-9c940fa79648">Reservation Feature</a> helped achieve this feat, which enabled interested members of the community to deposit BTC/USDT/ETH ahead of time, which guaranteed their participation in the metaMUI&nbsp;sale.</p><p>The complete sale of the second round of the Pre-IEO will further enable SWN Global to increase development efforts in building the World’s first finance-specific hybrid blockchain, based on self-sovereign identity.</p><p>We are currently in talks with several global crypto exchanges in listing our mainnet coins — metaMUI. In the nearest future, the metaMUI will be available on several exchanges for trade activities, with the most popular pairs. More updates will be coming soon on this, stay tuned to our various social media channels for more information.</p><p>Next Steps: We’ll be announcing the details of the final round of the Pre-IEO sale very soon.

<p></p><p>The Molecule Protocol demonstrates a powerful 2021 rendition of the utility and benefits offered in multi-signature technology in the cryptocurrency space. In multi-signature cryptocurrency wallets, the hashed signatures of multiple addresses are required to reach a majority vote in co-signing a transaction or ‘decision’. The Molecule Protocol innovates on that development through new levels of ‘value’ across these aforementioned signing parties, rather, instead via the form of multi-connected tokens. Built upon the infrastructure of 0x’s Bloom Platform, within the Molecule Protocol, different ‘molecules’ (Customized ERC-protocol tokens) facilitate digitized identity verification and capability on the blockchain. The Molecule Protocol is one of the more recent examples of the harnessed power of 0x’s Bloom Platform for progressive self-sovereign identity development.</p><p>Centralized exchanges are custodial and compliant, relying on KYC (Know Your Customer), AML, CFT, etc. while controlling customer funds and incurring high fees despite its multiple restrictions. Contrastingly, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are unrestricted, have no KUYC, AML, etc - you have full control of your funds, and there are significantly smaller fees. The cost of this decentralized nature has been the lack of knowing who you are exchanging with. While the anonymity and speed of certain DEXs are what make them so favorable, it is also unpredictable and difficult to gauge which users are valid and which are risky, creating insecurity and apprehension from global regulators to further evolve the sector. The result has been a rift between the legacy financial sector and the new age of financial technology. Molecule Protocol aims to solve this via a user-friendly infrastructure that handles the transfer of ERC20 and/or ERC721 tokens only if certain constraints are met for both the sender and recipient. In this way, the Molecule Protocol bridges the aforementioned gap between the two exchanges since it retains the autonomy and self-sovereignty that decentralized exchanges present, however adding constraints that centralized exchanges enlist as a means of security. The protocol is considered non-custodial yet compliant.</p><p>For those not familiar with chemistry or blockchain, the system is still user-friendly and little to no knowledge of chemistry or blockchain is required to use it, making it a perfect stepping stone for those who want to learn more about blockchain, crypto, and self-sovereign identity. Each token (ERC721 or ERC20) represents an ‘atom’. A combination of tokens, such as 2 ERC721 tokens and 1 ERC20 token (like a hydrogen atom: H2O), can authorize functions on an entity. Only if an entity contains a KYC token can the transfer be executed. The concept is reminiscent of chemical reactions since the reactants are individual entities until the ‘reaction’, or in this case, ‘authorization’, occurs. Other molecules and subsequent structures can be configured, however the smaller the protocol, the more it can fit into the Molecule format rendering it more useful compared to larger structures. Tokens can be transferred to a sender and recipient on a DEX or marketplace without any restrictions. Molecule protocol applies the same concept except with an infrangible validation process, &nbsp;creating the security of validity the current digital financial environment lacks.</p><p>Users must first create a Protis account that provides an Ethereum wallet address. Then the user must go through ID verification to obtain a KYC token. In the Molecule Protocol, KYC represents the ERC721 token. Without any way to prove to banks, and even landlords, that you are trustworthy, there’s many times retail users struggle to get an apartment lease, mortgage, tuition, or car loan, creating seemingly unfair exclusivity. To mend this exclusivity the Molecule Protocol utilizes BloomID as verification and Bloom’s credit score system to include those who may not have traditional data. If approved, the KYC 721 token is issued from ‘OnRamp’, Bloom’s smart contract ‘bridge’.</p><p>Bloom creates a digital identity called a BloomID for those who cannot acquire verification via traditional data. With their BloomID, they can securely apply for credit as soon as their identity is verified. There is no need for a SSN which is beneficial to those who may not have a credit history. Rather than submit a credit score, users upload a personal form of ID - which can be in the form of a license, email, phone number, utility bills, or any other financials available or that are considered unconventional. All this data is then used to assess the user’s ‘credit score’, as well as how trustworthy the user is in relation to risk. Both the sender and receiver are able to track the sender’s credit score, utilization, age of credit, or payment history. After deploying, exchanges/marketplaces can validate addresses using Molecule Protocol.</p><p>The process of using Molecule Protocol is simple enough so those without any technical blockchain knowledge can employ it. The first step is to define all ‘molecule’ structures, which Molecule Protocol provides a schema for. Once done, the molecule tokens are minted.</p><p>The security Bloom has created, despite not acquiring SSNs or tax records from their users, is revolutionary to the space, and to self-sovereign identity. Through Bloom, users receive digital identities, and through the Molecule Protocol as a whole, users, globally, receive sovereignty.</p>

<p>On March 24th, we hosted a community chat for TiddlyWiki on Fission. We've been working with Jeremy Ruston, TiddlyWiki creator, to integrate Fission's webnative accounts and file system. Jeremy gave an overview and demo of the work to date, and we talked about what's next.</p> Video &amp; Slides <p><a href="https://presentations.fission.app/2021-03-24-tiddlywiki-community-chat.pdf">Slides »</a></p> Why does Fission want to support TiddlyWiki? <p>We started by giving a brief overview of Fission, including getting into why Fission wants to support TiddlyWiki. Here are a few of the points we covered:</p><p>The TiddlyWiki community is filled with people who aren’t necessarily software developers, but program and customize all the time: Fission wants to make it easier for anyone to create, personalize, and customize apps. The TiddlyWiki community does this all the time, because of the built in nature of TiddlyWiki itself. That's the kind of energy we want to promote and support.</p><p>Showcase apps on Fission that encourage people to dig deeper, do their own integration: there is a wave of note taking apps, second brains, digital gardens, and more. If we can show more people that these features are possible today in open source apps, and that they can be synced and work everywhere on the web with Fission, this can encourage more people to check us out. And, along the way, see more usage of TiddlyWiki, too!</p><p>We've even heard a rumour that the founder of Roam Research originally prototyped Roam on TiddlyWiki!</p> TiddlyWiki on Fission <p>Jeremy went on to demo what he has built so far. The TiddlyWiki on Fission App is live today at <a href="https://tiddlywiki.fission.app">tiddlywiki.fission.app</a>.</p>Logged in view showing a demo account's private and public file system.<p>You'll need to click on the Authorise with Fission button, create a Fission account if you haven't already, and then you're ready to create a new TiddlyWiki. </p><p>You choose from any of the Editions that are available, give it a name, and it will launch in a new window. As you work on this TiddlyWiki</p><p>What is rather unique is that the TiddlyWiki itself is just a regular TiddlyWiki flat file. Through an iframe, it talks to the TiddlyWiki on Fission editing app, that saves any edits you make to your Webnative File System attached to your Fission account.</p><p>This also means that you can upload any existing TiddlyWiki file that you have, and enable web-based viewing and saving from any browser. The <a href="https://drive.fission.codes">Fission Drive app</a> lets you browse your file system and upload files.</p> Static Publishing <p>As seen in the screenshot above where you pick an Edition to launch, Jeremy has been working on a new web-based static publishing feature. This lets you publish static files directly from the web version of TiddlyWiki. Before, this required the NodeJS developer tools for TiddlyWiki.</p><p>For Fission accounts, this means being able to publish a flat file version of selected portions of your TiddlyWiki as regular static HTML. If you keep your source TiddlyWiki in the private part of your file system, you can then selectively make pieces of content public. </p> Editions <p>Editions are what different distributions of TiddlyWiki – with content, plugins, and other resources bundled in – are called.</p><p>We're going to ask the TiddlyWiki community if they want to include Editions in the base app, so that any user can then select to launch a new TiddlyWiki. This is designed to be non-developer friendly – just give us the URL of where your edition is available online, and we'll add it to the "bill of materials" in the TiddlyWiki on Fission app. </p><p>For example, we've got a <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/tiddlywiki-second-brain-roam-clones/1594/">list in the forum about the different "Roam Clones"</a> that have been built with TiddlyWiki.</p><p>We've also got a thread in the forum going about <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/building-a-tiddlywiki-edition/1727">what is needed to build an edition</a>, and we'll make a basic Fission edition to use as an example.</p> TiddlyWiki on Open Collective <p>We have created a <a href="https://opencollective.com/tiddlywiki-on-fission">collective on Open Collective for TiddlyWiki on Fission</a>. Open Collective is a platform for gathering financial support and transparent finances.</p><p>Our goal is to gather funds from backers who want to see this work be further developed. We'll look to work with the community to find projects and features to fund, and hire from within the community to get those things built.</p><p>Thank you very much to <a href="https://opencollective.com/walt-ludwick">Walt</a> &amp; <a href="https://opencollective.com/karlicoss">Karlicoss</a> for being our first two backers! </p> Spaceship Cat <p>This was also the first introduction of Spaceship Cat, joining Flag Cat.

<p>Short answer: It’s bad and getting worse.</p>



<p>Long answer:&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">Research</a>&nbsp;continues to confirm organizations are falling behind in efforts to protect the privacy of users’&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personally identifiable information</a>&nbsp;(PII) online. Data&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy&nbsp;</a>is an exploding issue because the amount of digital data users generate is increasing exponentially, organizations are moving more data and services to the cloud, and privacy regulations are still a way off being a comprehensive fix. At the same time, the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/11/3-serious-data-privacy-risks-from-covid-19/">COVID-19</a>&nbsp;pandemic is forcing more remote work, which exposes organizations to greater risks, and&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2019/09/the-top-consumer-security-concerns-this-year/">cyberattacks</a>&nbsp;are becoming more frequent and sophisticated. The&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-the-data-economy-and-why-should-we-care/">data economy</a>&nbsp;is flourishing, on and off the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/11/the-growing-risks-to-business-and-their-customers-from-the-dark-web/">dark web</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data privacy is a global issue.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3889055">Gartner</a>&nbsp;predicts the worldwide information security market will reach $170.4 billion in 2022 as companies globally respond to increasing threats. Some countries are more affected than others though, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/blogs/a-country-in-crisis-data-privacy/#:~:text=Data%20privacy%20in%20the%20US%20is%20a%20growing%20problem%20caused,increasing%20at%20an%20unprecedented%20rate.">United States</a>&nbsp;is among the worst hit. Internet-connected computers are attacked every&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/87787-hackers-attack-every-39-seconds">39 seconds</a>&nbsp;in the US and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rsa.com/content/dam/en/misc/rsa-data-privacy-and-security-survey-2019.pdf">45 per cent of Americans</a>&nbsp;have had their personal information compromised by a <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/11/what-is-a-data-breach/">data breach</a>&nbsp;in the last five years. In 2019, the US had the highest average cost per data breach in the world, at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/security/digital-assets/cost-data-breach-report/#/">$8.64 million</a>, and healthcare&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/11/what-is-a-data-breach/">data breaches</a>&nbsp;alone affected&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/09/the-privacy-risks-of-telehealth-and-what-you-can-do-to-protect-your-privacy/">40 million people</a>—a number that’s growing with the ongoing&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/11/businesses-face-rising-cybersecurity-risks-from-covid-19/">COVID-19 pandemic</a>. The US still does not have a national consumer privacy law, despite&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dwt.com/blogs/privacy--security-law-blog/2020/10/national-consumer-privacy-law-round-up#:~:text=The%20bill%20seeks%20to%20provide,and%20fair%20exercise%20of%20their">ongoing efforts</a>&nbsp;to enact one, particularly in light of trailblazing regulatory advances in&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/11/california-prop-24-puts-more-brakes-on-big-tech/">California</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The picture is similar in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dwt.com/blogs/privacy--security-law-blog/2020/10/national-consumer-privacy-law-round-up#:~:text=The%20bill%20seeks%20to%20provide,and%20fair%20exercise%20of%20their">United Kingdom</a>&nbsp;where the cost per data breach is slightly lower than the global average but&nbsp;<a>88 percent of companies</a>&nbsp;have been caught up in a breach, mostly&nbsp;<a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2117843/what-is-phishing-how-this-cyber-attack-works-and-how-to-prevent-it.html">phishing</a>&nbsp;attacks. High levels of data breach are also reported in nearby Germany (<a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3440069/uk-cybersecurity-statistics-you-need-to-know.html">92 percent</a>),&nbsp;France (<a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3440069/uk-cybersecurity-statistics-you-need-to-know.html">94 percent</a>), and Italy (<a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3440069/uk-cybersecurity-statistics-you-need-to-know.html">90 percent</a>). Small UK businesses suffer an attempted hacking attack every&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hiscoxgroup.com/news/press-releases/2018/18-10-18">19 seconds</a>, and nearly&nbsp;<a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3440069/uk-cybersecurity-statistics-you-need-to-know.html">40 percent</a> of UK companies reported a data breach in the 12 months to May 2020.</p>



<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3153707/top-cybersecurity-facts-figures-and-statistics.html">Australia</a>,&nbsp;seven in 10 respondents to the Australian Community Attitudes to Privacy Survey 2020&nbsp;by the Office of the Australian Information Commission (<a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/">OAIC</a>), nominated privacy as a major concern for them, while 87 per cent wanted more control and choice over the collection and use of their personal information. These consumer sentiments are reflected in those of users worldwide, which we recently reported&nbsp;were that:&nbsp;</p>



  High profile, significant, and regular&nbsp;<a href="https://www.purdueglobal.edu/blog/information-technology/worst-data-breaches-infographic/">data breaches</a>&nbsp;have spooked consumers.&nbsp;  Consumers generally get that they have to trade certain&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal information</a>&nbsp;for services, but are now warier of sharing their personal data.&nbsp;  Consumers want to control their own data and will act to do so if they can.  Levels of consumer trust for brands is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/risk/our-insights/the-consumer-data-opportunity-and-the-privacy-imperative">generally low</a>.&nbsp;  Consumers will&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/14/half-of-americans-have-decided-not-to-use-a-product-or-service-because-of-privacy-concerns/">abandon</a>&nbsp;brands or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/cybersecurity-series-2019-cps.pdf">delay&nbsp;purchases</a>&nbsp;where they perceive a risk to their personal data.  The regulatory screws are tightening to protect consumers.  



<p>Privacy laws are trying to stem the data privacy crisis and put the brakes on&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">surveillance capitalism</a>, but there’s still a way to go. California has the&nbsp;California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and its successor, the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/11/california-prop-24-puts-more-brakes-on-big-tech/">California Privacy Rights Act 2020</a>, which reins in the powers of Big Tech, preventing them from sharing consumers’ personal information and closing a loophole that meant companies could keep targeting ads with user data even when those users opted out.</p>



<p>Beyond the US, there is also solid progress being made in consumer privacy legislation, with the&nbsp;<a href="https://gdpr.eu/what-the-regulation-means-for-everyday-internet-user/">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a>&nbsp;and Brazil’s new&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/brazils-general-data-protection-law-english-translation/">General Data Protection Law</a>, for example. And we hope, in the coming decade, we will see a simplification of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.adlawaccess.com/2020/01/articles/the-u-s-approach-to-privacy-what-is-it-and-where-is-it-headed/">current patchwork</a>&nbsp;of privacy regulations in the US.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At Anonyome Labs, we believe privacy will be a&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/">defining issue of the coming decade</a>, starting with some hot topics&nbsp;in 2021, as we ramp up the fight against abuse and misuse of data globally. Watch this space.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building off of our recent <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-receives-soc-2-type-ii-certification-b2b6ea7a6d75">SOC 2 Type II certification announcement</a>, we’re thrilled to share that GlobaliD is now HIPAA compliant.</p><p>What’s HIPAA?</p><p>Here’s the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations/index.html">U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services</a>:</p><blockquote>The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) required the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop regulations protecting the privacy and security of certain health information.1 To fulfill this requirement, HHS published what are commonly known as the HIPAA <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/privacyrule/index.html">Privacy Rule</a> and the HIPAA <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/securityrule/index.html">Security&nbsp;Rule</a>.</blockquote><p>In short, HIPAA compliance is about keeping your healthcare data (Protected Health Information or PHI) private and secure. (You can learn more about the Privacy and Security Rules in the HHS links&nbsp;above.)</p><p>More than keeping that data safe, it’s also about safeguarding who has access to it — while preserving certain individual rights such as the ability to obtain records or request corrections. That’s the kind of stuff that GlobaliD is perfectly suited for. By design, only you get to decide who has access to your data, which you alone own and control at all&nbsp;times.</p><p>So all of this should be no surprise to our users or partners given GlobaliD’s ongoing commitment to privacy and security.</p><p>Achieving HIPAA compliance is also an important milestone for us because of the many compelling use cases for self-sovereign identity and verifiable credentials that involve your health — some of which we’ve been actively working on behind the scenes. (Stay&nbsp;tuned!)</p><p>The pandemic has been a boon for telehealth and Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center CEO Michael Fisher believes it could make up to as much as 30 percent of all hospital visits in the near future, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/making-a-daily-to-be-list-how-a-hospital-system-ceo-is-navigating-the-coronavirus-crisis?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslogin&amp;stream=top">according to a recent interview with McKinsey</a>. Their hospital system saw telehealth visits soar to 5,000 per week compared to 2,000 for all of&nbsp;2019.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/vaccine-passports-airline-industry-asks-u-s-to-develop-credentials-for-travelers-01615252128">airlines and other businesses are looking to the U.S.</a> and other governments to spearhead health credentials in an effort to transition society back to a semblance of normalcy.</p><p>That’s just the tip of the&nbsp;iceberg.</p><p>GlobaliD’s HIPAA compliance positions our platform as a portable solution for those needs — one that allows you, the individual, to maintain ownership and control of your sensitive healthcare data.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-is-hipaa-compliant-1e8cdf915ab6">GlobaliD is HIPAA compliant</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Dear Shyft Network Community, <p>In alignment with the @polkastarter team, we have come to the decision to postpone the IDO until Friday, March 26th, 2021 @ 3PM&nbsp;UTC.</p><p>Shyft Network is, to our knowledge, one of the largest smart contract infrastructures in the ecosystem, with use cases that require this infrastructure to perform critical operations directly after launch. The size and complexity of the network’s smart contracts makes deployment ordering critical; a core contract that is used to route KYC primitives across multiple networks was missing a feature that would allow for accelerated deployments over the next 3 months of the protocol deployment’s roadmap.</p><p>Given the simplicity of the upgrade required, and the importance of the component for all iterations being deployed following this initial contract release, moving to Friday was a simple decision that will allow for long term ease of future development and cross chain security.</p><p>We understand the frustration that postponing the IDO may cause, and are grateful to the community for their incredible support and enthusiasm.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>The Shyft Network&nbsp;Team</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/balaganski">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>Data friction is arguably the biggest obstacle for every organization on its journey to achieve optimal business productivity. Even if you have not heard the term before, you’ve definitely faced its consequences in one form or another (most probably, even in multiple different forms). You need your product’s sales data for EMEA, but it’s not a top priority for your IT team? Your marketing team would love to derive better insights from your customer data, but your ERP system is not supported by their fancy cloud service? Your developers must wait several days to get an approved, anonymized copy of production data for testing?</p>
<p>Or maybe your bosses are urging you to migrate to the cloud, but you are too scared of GDPR? Every time your business urgently needs access to some data, but technical debt, other technological limitations or just compliance challenges prevent it from happening as expected, you are facing data friction again.</p>
<p>Data friction is the total of all delays and complications in delivering business data to its consumers within an enterprise. In the age of Digital Transformation when, for many companies, data is their lifeblood, too much friction is not just a productivity killer but the difference between success and failure as a business. Unfortunately, security and compliance are also often considered major sources of data friction, and ones that are too easy to fix: just relax your security policies a bit. Until a major data breach happens, that is.</p>
<p>There are, of course, multiple approaches towards reducing data friction. <a href="https://dataops.io/">DataOps</a> is an entirely new methodology for aligning your people, business processes, and IT to enable rapid, automated management of data. There are also numerous tools and technologies designed specifically to address certain aspects of data friction. For example, data virtualization solutions replace traditional ETL processes with real-time automated access to remote data sources, creating a layer of abstraction above multiple data siloes and enabling transparent data transformations to conform to security and compliance requirements.</p>
<p>However, whenever you add another layer of abstraction to an IT architecture, especially if its only purpose is to address the shortcomings of existing components, you’re not actually solving the underlying problem – to the contrary, the overall complexity is increasing, and the possibility of friction (or failure) is only increasing. Even if each component is the “best of breed” solution for a specific need, the whole is never “greater than the sum of its parts” – you’re lucky if it’s still just good enough. This idea applies to just about every field in IT, but it is especially relevant for the database market where highly specialized products optimized for a specific subset of data are still the norm.</p>
<p>This specialization leads to increasing data fragmentation between siloes, teams, and units within an enterprise. Needless to say, applying business analytics to this data is a challenge – you either have to be content with limited capabilities built into, say, a time-series database or have additional tools and processes to copy the data into a separate location for using “proper” BI solutions, which introduces additional friction and lots of room for error. But does it really have to be this way?</p>
<p>Well, an obvious alternative approach would be to try to keep all your data in a single universal database that’s capable of combining the traditional relational model with modern alternatives like graph or document models. This way, you’ll only need to manage a single technology stack with a single set of access and security policies. That is exactly what Oracle is offering with its “converged database”, and if you opt for their autonomous database service, you don’t even need to worry about managing that stack.</p>
<p>However, just placing all data into a single silo would be rather counterproductive if the only thing you can do with it is to store it securely. And again, Oracle’s long-term strategy is to build a multitude of data processing and analytics capabilities directly into its database. We have already covered <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/ev80405/oracle-apex-secure-low-code-application-development-platform/">Oracle APEX</a> – a low-code application development platform that helps even business users with limited programming skills to create applications that can effortlessly grow up to be enterprise scale while keeping their data secured directly in the Oracle Database. But the company doesn’t stop there.</p>
<p>Last week, Oracle announced major new self-service capabilities in its Autonomous Data Warehouse, which bring the same level of data democratization to business analytics as well. Now business users can import their existing semi-structured data like Excel spreadsheets or XML and JSON files or bring in data from internal or external sources into a data warehouse themselves using a simple wizard-driven UI, without any knowledge about data structures or transformations or support from IT. The data is then immediately available for management and visualization using the APEX platform.</p>
<p>The product now offers rich analytics capabilities that also come with self-service tools for creating business models, data lineage and impact analysis, and automated insight discovery. Again, without any technical knowledge, a business user can quickly identify hidden patterns or anomalies in their data or connect their favorite analytics tool to dig deeper. On top of that, the Autonomous Data Warehouse now comes with built-in machine learning capabilities and includes AutoML – the technology that hides most of the complexity associated with ML from users, supporting them with automatic selection of algorithms and features.</p>
<p>Needless to say, all these capabilities do not require any additional data transformation or export to a different data store, avoiding IT-related time delays. Meanwhile, sensitive business data remains in a single location, secured against a broad range of external and internal threats and highly available. To me, this looks like a Zero Friction situation!</p>

It is predicated on open standards foundations that enable easy movement of data and&nbsp;vendors.</p> Interoperability with DHS SVIP Companies <p>Our team was proud to participate in the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/svip">US Department of Homeland Security Silicon Valley Innovation Program</a> Interoperability Plug-fest this month. DHS SVIP has been leading the charge on interoperability for years now, putting their funding and networks on the table to lead the&nbsp;charge.</p><p>This was Transmute’s second time participating as an awarded company of the SVIP program, and we were joined by 7 other companies from around the globe, addressing topics from supply chain traceability to digital assets for&nbsp;humans.</p><p>While each company is focused on slightly different industries — and therefore nuanced solutions for those customers — we are all committed (and contractually obligated by the US Government) to implement open standards infrastructure in a way that ensures verifiable information can be issued, consumed, and verified across systems using different technical “stacks”.</p><p>Technical foundations for interoperability include the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-imp-guide/">W3C Verifiable Credential Data Model</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/on-json-ld-and-the-semantics-of-identity-42d051d3ce14">JSON Linked Data</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-http-api">Verifiable Credentials HTTP API</a>, and the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/">Credential Handler API</a>.

Note that the use cases have been simplified to allow for ease of demonstration to diverse audiences.</p><p>Transmute and other companies also publicly shared the results of our interoperability testing — Transmute’s results are&nbsp;<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-http-api/test-suite/transmute/">here</a>.</p> Interoperability in steel supply&nbsp;chain <p>Transmute is working directly with US Customs and Border Protection to trace the origins of steel materials using verifiable credentials. This video shows an example of multiple steel supply chain actors exchanging verifiable trade information culminating in a seamless review process from&nbsp;CBP.</p> Interoperability across industries <p>We also worked with other cohort companies to demonstrate how important credentials like a vaccination certificate can be used to help supply chain professionals get back to work safely. This demo includes the use of selective disclosure technology as well as off-line verification of a paper credential.</p> Charting the&nbsp;Course <p>Interoperability across systems moves the internet towards a more open-network approach for trustworthy exchange of information. Choice is increasingly becoming the network feature that governments and enterprises will not do without. <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/the-business-case-for-interoperability-a1a2b884297d">It is pre-competitive table stakes for doing business.</a> The path is clear for those of us developing technology in this space: interoperate, or get out.

<p>This is the fourth in a series of blogs which provide edited extracts of key points made by Mydex CIC in its response to the UK Government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/uk-national-data-strategy-nds-consultation">consultation around a new National Data Strategy</a>.</p><p>This blog focuses on common misconceptions that need to be addressed if we are to progress. Previous blogs focused on <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/how-to-unleash-the-full-potential-of-data-3676db8d7c03">how to unleash the full potential of personal data</a>, on why <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/how-to-unleash-the-full-potential-of-data-3676db8d7c03">every citizen should be provided with their own personal data store</a>, and on <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/transforming-the-system-a-roadmap-for-practical-implementation-411e8821ed19">how to achieve these changes at&nbsp;scale</a>.</p><p>To catch up on progress on our Macmillan My Data Store Pilot <a href="https://medium.com/macmillan-my-data-store-pilot">click&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>It wasn’t so long ago that sober, intelligent, responsible adults believed the sun orbited the earth, that if you were ill the best cure was to have a leech suck your blood, and that it was the right thing to do to hunt and burn witches at the stake. They also gave patronage to alchemists and astrologists who claimed they could turn lead into gold and foretell futures. These conventional wisdoms were deeply and dangerously wrong, but the majority of the great and good went along with them without a second thought. If everybody believes it, it must be true.&nbsp;Right?</p><p>Something similar is happening with debates about personal data today. Mydex CIC’s submission on the UK Government’s proposed National Data Strategy highlighted three areas where this is the case: a naive belief in the magic cure-all powers of ‘Big Data’ and artificial intelligence; confusion about what citizens ‘controlling’ their data really means; and whether citizens are actually capable of doing so. This blog summarises what we said on these&nbsp;issues.</p> Beware AI&nbsp;hype <p>Many narratives about a national strategy for data follow a familiar refrain. Artificial intelligence can gain much better insights from data and make much better decisions than human beings can. The opportunities are endless. To enable the analytics that will drive these insights we need to gather together as much data as possible.</p><p>There is so much wrong with this trope that we will need to devote future blogs to it. But basically, it contains three core&nbsp;errors.</p>  Claims for what AI can actually do are being wildly inflated. AI is good at solving certain types of problems (which require lots of computation and where judgements based on context or values are not required). But most of the important problems our society faces do not fit this specification.  By the nature of the processes needed to deliver AI, policies designed to promote it automatically favour existing data monopolies, thereby exacerbating the extreme imbalances of power and reward that already&nbsp;exist.  AI operates by crunching huge amounts of data. But when it comes to actually applying any insights or decisions generated to specific individuals, we hit a transition point. At this point we are <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/completing-the-4th-industrial-revolution-426af23aa475">no longer dealing with ‘big’ statistical data or (misnamed) artificial ‘intelligence’, we are dealing with specific bits of data about specific people</a>: we are dealing with personal&nbsp;data.  <p>This last point needs some elaboration.</p><p>Economically speaking, by far the most important and valuable uses of personal data do not derive from ‘insights’ derived from ‘analytics’. Businesses like Google and Facebook may loom very large in peoples’ consciousness, but their business models are organised around advertising, which accounts for less than 2% of all economic activity.</p><p>The really big uses of personal data lie elsewhere: in public administration, health, financial services, education, transport, retailing and so on. The key point about uses of personal data in these arenas is that they are operational. Service providers use data to plan, organise and implement activities and to undertake associated administration. Such activities include ensuring they are dealing with the right people, making decisions relating to eligibility and access to services, configuring service provision to the needs and circumstances of particular individuals, planning and organising the delivery of such services, keeping associated records, undertaking billing, dealing with queries,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>A key characteristic of these activities is that completing each one successfully does not require the aggregation of large amounts of data. Instead, they each require the ability to access and use exactly the right data at the right&nbsp;time.</p><p>The infrastructure and capabilities that make the construction of such data-driven services is not the aggregation of the biggest possible databases but the availability of safe, efficient data logistics: the ability to get exactly the right data to and from the right people and places in the right formats at the right&nbsp;times.</p><p>Establishing such personal data logistics infrastructure has almost nothing to do with ‘big data’ or ‘artificial intelligence’ and is entirely overlooked by AI enthusiasts. Personal data stores provide this infrastructure — infrastructure that is really needed to turbocharge the accelerated improvement of the big part of the data picture, operational uses of personal data for the purposes of improved service provision.</p> Do individuals really want to control their&nbsp;data? <p>Most debate about the issue of citizen ‘control’ of their personal data is fundamentally confused. There are two very different types of ‘control’:</p>  Individuals trying to control data that is collected about them and used by organisations  Individuals trying to use their data to manage their lives better, which means they have to be able to exercise control over&nbsp;it  <p>Virtually all current debate about ‘control’ focuses on the first, narrow, meaning. Virtually all of <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/a-practical-vision-for-personal-data-empowerment-1d366ed792f">the value of exercising control</a> derives from the second meaning, which is nearly universally ignored. Personal data stores empower individuals with the second type of positive control: the ability to use their own data for their own purposes; to add value in their&nbsp;lives.</p><p>A second set of misplaced assumptions follows. When individuals seek to control data that organisations collect about them, the process is usually adversarial. The individual is trying to stop the organisation doing things with data that the individual doesn’t like. But when individuals seek to use their own data for their own purposes, on most occasions they positively want to share data with bona fide service providers because these service providers can help them add&nbsp;value.</p><p>If a National Data Strategy frames debate and policy making about citizens controlling their data in the first narrow, adversarial way it will never unleash the full potential of personal&nbsp;data.</p> Are individuals capable of controlling their&nbsp;data? <p>A related, common misconception is that individuals do not want to or are unable to exercise control over their data, because doing so is too difficult and&nbsp;complex.</p><p>The opposite is true. Processes currently used by organisations to collect and use data manufacture complexity, thereby imposing significant burdens on individuals.</p><p>Current burdens lie in four main&nbsp;areas:</p>  Individuals are required to fill in multiple forms when seeking to access and use services, often having to provide the same information many times over, on occasion even to the same organisation.  Individuals are required to prove claims that they make about themselves (e.g. about their age or address) often involving the physical presentation of physical documents  Overly complex and cumbersome consent processes, including privacy policies and terms and conditions that are evasively worded and difficult to read and understand. These are often deliberately made excessively complex by organisations seeking to induce individuals to consent to data sharing for reasons and purposes that go beyond accessing the data that’s needed to provide the service the individual is&nbsp;seeking.  The organisation-centric nature of today’s data ecosystem means that individuals have to manage each relationship with each organisation separately — so that the above burdens of information provision, proofs of claims and consent are multiplied many times over as individuals deal with multiple organisations. Most individuals have 100 or more such data relationships, so to effectively ‘control’ all their data, they need to undertake these processes 100 times over. The transaction costs are so high that hardly anyone&nbsp;bothers.  <p>Personal data stores greatly reduce and often eliminate these manufactured burdens. They do so&nbsp;by:</p>  Standardising data sharing agreements around ‘safe by default’: only sharing data necessary for the purposes of service provision.  Automating data sharing processes so that they work for and on behalf of individuals ‘while they sleep’. For a parallel, think of standard orders and direct debits which provide individuals with full and complete control over their money, but work in standardised, automated ways that mean the individual no longer has to think about their operation.  Creating single, centralised tools for the citizen for managing relationships with suppliers (equivalent to setting up, changing or ending direct debits). For example, consent management dashboards enable individuals to see and simply manage all their data sharing agreements with suppliers in one place (rather than having to log in to dozens of different separate accounts)   Summary <p>It is not possible to make good policy decisions about priorities for investments, grants, innovation and research projects or rules and regulations if the grounds for these decisions are faulty. Currently, effective policy making is hampered by widespread misunderstandings about where the biggest economic opportunities lie, the nature of issues such as control, and the role of citizens in the workings of the data economy. This is resulting in misallocation of available resources and overlooked opportunities. For a National Data Strategy to succeed, a fresh assessment of the assumptions that lie behind current debates about personal data is essential.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/misconceptions-that-kill-progress-in-personal-data-4736b1d883c6">Misconceptions that Kill Progress in Personal Data</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Shyft Network — Token Distribution and Economics <p>Barbados, March 24, 2021 — The Shyft Network core team is proud to announce the details of its SHFT token economics and distribution schedules within the Shyft Network protocol.</p><p>The Shyft Network is a blockchain-based solution for centralized and decentralized technologies, like decentralized finance (DeFi). It’s a technology layer that aggregates and embeds trust into data stored on private and public ecosystems, enabling an opt-in compliance layer across all&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Shyft Network was designed as an interoperable standard for use cases that require multiparty trust and validation. We took a fundamentally different approach to data and identity and thanks to its founders’ long history with Bitcoin, dating back to 2010. The vision of Shyft Network was one that had a long-term view on the future of where our ecosystem was headed and what would be needed to protect decentralization and privacy while enabling new markets and&nbsp;users.</p><p>The Shyft Network enables identity verification, validation, and the sending of credentials and other data across multiple different blockchains and networks. It is a solution and compliance primitive to the entire decentralized ecosystem, with a focus on solving some of the largest global challenges around regulations, compliance, data privacy, and trust and coordination.</p> Balance and Decentralization <p>When designing the token economics and distribution schedules, we were careful to structure the various buckets/outflows to maximize our impact and collaborative structures across the ecosystem.</p><p>When designing this system, we took to heart the lessons that our ecosystem painfully learned over the last decade; one key goal is to provide distribution and allocation across use cases and community infrastructure enabling perpetual support and longevity to all functions that make networks successful across phases of their development. Resilience, adaptability and decentralization are guiding values of our&nbsp;work.</p><p>This economic structure was built and refined over the last 4 years and included the guidance and direction of our closest partners and advisors, whose capabilities complement the Shyft Network Core’s team, helping us make headway into our product focuses like compliance and identity. We are confident that this strategy will get us to product &amp; community readiness, and puts the hard work into a system that allows the community to take over and continue to advance the ecosystem forward!</p><p>The Network distribution is largely programmatic through distribution contracts which are closely coupled with the inflation rate that is used to pay for federation network security, Byfrost Bridge node security, and Community DAO (Shyft Community Runtime Inflation). The distribution below spans over 10 years with distributions focused on ecosystem pillars and critical infrastructure to support long-term growth of network usage, and meet demand balances to ensure a verifiable and scalable liquidity base.</p> SHFT Overview <blockquote>Name: Shyft Network<br>Symbol: SHFT<br>Type: Native Layer 1, ERC-20 token compatible<br>Decimals: 18<br>Initial Circulating supply on launch: 3,800,000<br>Circulating supply 12 months after launch: 507,432,184<br>Circulating supply 7.5 years after launch: 1,910,000,000<br>Node Inflation rate: set at 6% of the initial universe, released on a per-block basis, perpetually</blockquote> The SHFT&nbsp;Token <p>SHFT fuels the Shyft Network; think of it as gas that powers the engine. SHFT is a means of payment, a mechanism for bonding value, and an instrument for governance value capture. SHFT, depending on the use case, can be utilized in a multitude of ways which includes a payment and authorization system for long-term validation.</p><p>SHFT is a layer 1 currency for identity and data transmission, as well as a governance mechanism for coordination across ecosystems that enables entity-to-entity governance, compliant asset creation, and a system for compliant Defi and other applications. Enabling a new side of the existing ecosystem could greatly expand the size of market participants and increase the size of asset participation across all decentralized projects, protocols, and marketplaces.</p><p>The Shyft token, when used across use cases created on Shyft Network, enables assets and metadata to be added into this compliant layer-2 smart contract system, acting as a wrapper for these asset types and a directory for all Dapps that support the ecosystem. The SHFT token on other chains acts as a layer two gas and currency to pay for the compatibility, composability, and routing channel architecture that is required to create, utilize, and transit compliant (rule based) assets across all 3rd party applications (ie. Dexs, lending pools, etc.). Shyft Network’s native token becomes useful as a bridged currency in liquidity pools through multiple infrastructure and cross-chain Defi deployments. You can read more on the SHFT token&nbsp;<a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/the-shft-token-15743ba0e2d8">here</a>.</p> Token Distribution <p>The SHFT tokens are distributed into a number of tranches, designated for specific activities to benefit the network. These values and distributions are built into the core distribution contracts for automated deployment. You can view this as a form of pre-defined inflation across the network, spanning beyond 10&nbsp;years.</p> Economic Metagame — 20% <p>As users participate in the Wrap Rewards context, there will be a deflationary reduction in the total universe corresponding to the proportion of total assets (E.g. USDT erc20 token) within the Wrap Rewards contract. 20% of the total initial universe is available to be burned over the first 2 years (if lower, will move to further&nbsp;years).</p> Ecosystem Development — 23.81% <p>Less than 30% of the Ecosystem Development allocation will be unlocked at launch, and additional tokens will only be released outside of the intended schedule by Shyft Network in the event of major partnerships that require usage and bonding of tokens (such as enterprise partnerships, VASP partnerships, government partnerships, etc.). Sub-allocations within the Ecosystem Development include:</p>  Next-Gen DEFI (Project Adaptability) — 6.06%<br>To allow for the Shyft Network project to encompass and adapt to updates in the ecosystem as a whole, an allocation has been provided to allow for the engineering/production of services and utilities for this purpose, beginning on month 39 in daily distributions over a 12-month&nbsp;period.  Synthetic Asset Wrap Reward (Ecosystem) — 4.65%<br>Gives individuals a reward for holding other erc20-based assets on Ethereum within the Shyft Network smart contracts (e.g. Shyft-wrapped USDT), distributed in equal instalments over 10 years. Incentivizes participation in the total Shyft Network smart-contract stack e.g. allows for easy use of Trust Channels when regulations require/incentivize participation.  VASP Ecosystem Initializer — 0.03%<br>For the purposes of establishing our VASP/travel rule-related products that interact/support the Shyft Network compliance-related software stack, a small allocation has been provided on months 2–4 to incentivize the business-related relationships that will bootstrap this&nbsp;process.  Shyft Treasury — 2.76%<br>The Shyft Network will maintain a treasury composed of unallocated SHFT assets from advisors, partnerships, purchasers, et al. A portion of these assets may be distributed by way of decentralized consensus through community DAO-structures.<br>Our intention is to maintain these assets in the treasury until they can be allocated for their proper purposes, based on multi-year deployment schedules.   Public Distribution — 0.91% <p>For the whitelisted <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/shyft-network-ido-on-polkastarter-3dc553741e31">distribution through the Polkastarter platform</a>.</p> Advisors — 5.68% <p>Our global network of advisors has been invaluable to the development of the Shyft Network ecosystem. Advisor tokens will be delivered for one month, beginning on month 13, and then following a 6-month pause, resuming distributions on month 20 in daily distributions over a 17-month&nbsp;period.</p> Ongoing Technical Partnerships — 5.47% <p>Shyft Network partners are core to the technical development of the infrastructure, and many have been working with the Shyft Network core team for the past 2 years. Partnership tokens will be delivered for one month, beginning on month 6, and then following a 6-month pause, resuming distributions on month 13 over a 23-month&nbsp;period.</p> Purchasers — 22.26% <p>Shyft Network’s purchases from network participants, industry leaders, and other users. The principal distribution will begin in month 12 over a 16-month period, with partial amounts starting in month 6 as described below.</p><p>Starting in month 6, purchasers may have a mandatory bonding requirement to initiate Shyft Network’s interoperability bridge layer. Bridge rewards may be provided from month 6 to the end of month 11, depending on technical milestones achieved.</p> Strategic Partnerships — 4.01% <p>This allocation includes recent participants, with a focus on expanding Shyft Network’s use cases relating to compliance &amp; identity in the blockchain ecosystem. These partnerships comprise core development teams and entities who have and continue to build critical infrastructure to support native and cross-ecosystem infrastructure. Tokens will be released in daily distributions starting in month 4, over a 14-month&nbsp;period.</p> Core Team — 17.86% <p>The core Shyft Network team has demonstrated their commitment to the project by working relentlessly over the past almost 4 years. Team tokens will be delivered beginning on month 24 in daily distributions over a 12-month&nbsp;period.</p>Total Circulating Supply Over Time (Stacked) — 30&nbsp;months Inflation &amp; Runtime: Federated nodes, Runtime Inflation DAO’s &amp;&nbsp;Byfrost  Shyft Runtime Inflation DAO’s — 2%: Perpetual Community Funding and Ongoing Ecosystem Wide Resource Maintenance <p>Runtime Inflation was designed to address the issues of ecosystem resources that have been prevalent across the digital currency ecosystem. Methods of being able to consistently incentivize the community’s work, research, overall productivity and advancement have been hindered by the lack of structural design at the protocol level to account for these critical components of ecosystem growth and development.</p><p>Shyft Runtime was designed to allow for node block production inflation to be redistributed back to the developers, builders and users that openly contribute and progress the Shyft Network&nbsp;forward.</p><p>This 2% perpetual inflation rate is automatically directed to the Runtime Inflation DAO’s that will categorically allow the community and users to determine the most important initiatives to provide resources towards.</p><p>A separate article will be released that goes in-depth into Shyft Runtime Inflation and we call on the community to help as this exciting new model is deployed shortly after the protocol’s release.</p> Strong Federation — 2%: Inflation per block is generated to pay for the cost of security; all network transactions fees are eliminated through&nbsp;EIP1559 <p>Federation: The Shyft Network Layer 1 operates as a strong federation whose job is to act as proof of authority consensus network. This group of up to 21 participants is geographically distributed and all act as core parties who have aligned incentives to ensure the network is maintained and chainstate security is forward&nbsp;moving.</p><p>The network utilizes EIP1559 to eliminate fees that are transacted across the federation, creating a deflationary component of the network unless the network faces high usage and full blocks. As use cases utilize the network for its core purposes, fees are eliminated from the network reducing network fees over&nbsp;time.</p> Byfrost — 2%: Inflation routed to openly pay for the cost of public bridge nodes for asset-weighted Proof of&nbsp;Stake <p>Byfrost, which will be deployed halfway through the year, will be a weighted staking bridged infrastructure. The role of Byfrost is to secure asset transmission and data availability across blockchains. Byfrost is critical to allowing all of the Shyft Network smart contracts to communicate user identity data, compliant assets, and trust anchor coordination regardless of the layer 1 network they are operating on. Byfrost enables data availability to allow VASPs and use cases to be fully interoperable and connects the compliance and data layer to build an aggregate trust layer for public protocols and private&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Byfrost bridging infrastructure has 2% of the inflation perpetually being directed to pay for the proof of stake security provided by any users across the ecosystem. Nodes will be open and accessible by anyone across different networks who interact with Shyft Network on its native layer 1, or other bridged layer-1’s.</p> In conclusion <p>We are very excited to enter the next phase of our project, as we continue to see our communities growing and supporting the mission that guides us. We’ve stayed true to our path and our core values: decentralization, community-focused, impactful technology that is aimed at improving the way crypto is&nbsp;adopted.</p><p>We will be releasing further details on the inflationary component of the strong federation, and how the inflation mechanics of the network support perpetual enablement of cross-chain security and community DAO’s.</p><p>These token economics are the result of the careful analysis done over the past three years and reflect the decentralization-led ethos of the Shyft Network, its community and strategic participants. Our network is designed to be resilient and structured over time in a manner that best meets the needs of all global participants.</p><p>We are excited to begin to Shyft the world together.</p><p>Shyft Network aggregates trust and contextualizes data to build an authentic reputation, identity, and creditability framework for individuals and enterprises.</p><blockquote>Join our <a href="https://www.shyft.network/signup?userType=network">Newsletter</a></blockquote><blockquote>Telegram (<a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">https://t.me/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Follow us on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/ShyftNetwork">https://github.com/ShyftNetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our website (<a href="https://www.shyft.network/">https://www.shyft.network</a>)</blockquote>

				  Indicio open sources a text messaging UI for digital wallets.  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Technology provider Indicio.tech, a public benefit corporation advancing decentralized identity software and solutions, today announced the public availability of the Indicio Wallet UI Design, a user interface for holding and presenting verifiable digital credentials. A <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/news/2020/11/02/news-release-finalists-announced-digital-wallets-prize-challenge">finalist </a>in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology ( S&amp;T) Trusted User Interface (UI) Digital Wallets Challenge, the UI digital wallet design is now available in the <a href="https://github.com/Indicio-tech/indicio-mobile-ux">Indicio public Github repository</a>.</p>
<p>To date, most wallets that handle Aries-based credentials have focused on having the user navigate lists of items and an array of popups and notifications. The Indicio UI design concept is rooted in the understanding that the exchange of verifiable credentials isn’t simply about moving data, it’s also about creating and maintaining relationships. As a consequence, Indicio’s design placed all of the interactions into a single, threaded record whereby each party can communicate in plain language.</p>
<p>“Our wallet design is 180 degrees from the list-based or card-based approach to presenting the user with information,” said Scott Harris, Vice President of Business Operations, Indicio. “Instead, we focus on the relationship between a user and issuers and verifiers and we designed the interactions to use an interface that people are familiar with: the text message. A natural and comfortable interface allows issuers and verifiers to clearly communicate requests, offers, clarifications, and policies. It allows users to query their contacts and receive either a personal reply, or a ‘smart reply’ from AI or chatbot systems.”</p>
<p>As Indicio is committed to open source as a proven way to deliver complex, sustainable innovation and adoption across industry sectors, anyone in the open source community beginning work on their own digital wallet can now make use of the Indicio UI design and its associated elements and assets.</p>
<p>“Decentralized identity can give people unprecedented control over their identities and data online,” said Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “But it will only happen if people feel in control of the technology. That’s where good design meets great engineering. Good design is not just about creating beautiful things, it’s about giving people control over their lives, keeping them safe, solving their problems, and helping them achieve their goals.”</p>
<p>Indicio.tech is committed to being a resource hub for decentralized identity, providing enterprise-grade open source tools to get our clients, and the community, building solutions today. Providing the companies and organizations from diverse industries around the world rely on the work of Indicio.tech for expertise in building and scaling their decentralized identity solutions.</p>

 The GiD Report#152 — How economists corrupted the&nbsp;internet <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-151-understanding-globalids-vision-soc-2-type-ii-certification-62ebc3d93b36">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  How economists corrupted the&nbsp;internet  GK on the Justice Department investigation of&nbsp;Visa  Glenn Greenwald on Big&nbsp;Tech  What the future of NFTs is really about:&nbsp;music  Tweetstorm of the week — Clubhouse edition  Stuff happens   1. Matt Stoller: How economists corrupted the&nbsp;internet <p>Stoller’s latest blog post is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/16/google-files-ftc-antitrust-investigation-475573">based on this Politico piece</a> that uncovers 312 pages of FTC&nbsp;memos:</p><blockquote>Few moments in the power struggle between Washington and Silicon Valley have inspired more anger and bafflement than one in January 2013, when antitrust regulators appointed by former President Barack Obama declined to sue&nbsp;Google.</blockquote><blockquote>The decision still rankles the company’s rivals, who have watched the search giant continue to amass power over smartphones, data-hoovering devices and wide swaths of the internet, unimpeded by laws meant to deter monopolies. It has fueled some lawmakers’ calls to overhaul the Federal Trade Commission, the agency that spent 19 months investigating Google’s efforts to overpower the competition — and critics say,&nbsp;blinked.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>Nearly a decade ago, the documents show, the FTC’s investigators uncovered evidence of how far Google was willing to go to ensure the primacy of the search engine that is the key to its fortunes, including tactics that European regulators and the U.S. Justice Department would later label antitrust violations. But the FTC’s economists successfully argued against suing the company, and the agency’s staff experts made a series of predictions that would fail to match where the online world was&nbsp;headed:</blockquote><p>Now, <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/how-biden-can-clean-up-obamas-big">here’s&nbsp;Matt</a>:</p><blockquote>The FTC’s lawyers made two observations about Google. First, Google intentionally harmed and killed vertical search rivals by putting its own product first, which is known as ‘self-preferencing.’ “Google,” said the complaint, “routinely, and prominently, displays its own vertical properties, while simultaneously demoting properties that are identical to its own, but for the fact that the latter are competing vertical websites.” Google also would scape from its rivals and present their user-generated content as its own. Second, Google used exclusivity agreements and its own market power to deprive its rivals of user traffic, advertising revenue, data, and advertisers.</blockquote><blockquote>In doing so, Google drained the vitality out of the web, so much so that venture capitalists began using the term ‘kill zone’ to describe the un-investable spaces adjacent to&nbsp;Google.</blockquote><p>So why didn’t they take action? Reason&nbsp;1:</p>President Obama with Mark Zuckerberg and Eric Schmidt, Photo: Obama White&nbsp;House<blockquote>There were three main reasons for the reluctance to bring a case. The first is simple: corruption. Google was extremely close with the Obama administration, with its lobbyists averaging a meeting a week at the White House. Today, four out of the five FTC Commissioners who voted on the case, as well as staffers involved like Howard Shelanski, receives money directly or indirectly from one of the five big tech giants. (The only former FTC Commissioner who voted on the case and does not receive big tech money is deceased.)</blockquote><blockquote>Even more tellingly, the resolution of the case happened a little over a month after the reelection of President Obama, a campaign in which then-Google CEO Eric Schmidt was on election night, as The Wall Street Journal reported, “personally overseeing a voter-turnout software system for Mr. Obama.” Today this sounds bad, but at the time, the attitude in the White House was that Google, Facebook, and Amazon were making the world a better place. Republicans loved them because the GOP loves business, and Democrats loved them because they were culturally progressive and good for consumers. (For example, in 2013, well-known Democratic pundit Matt Yglesias wrote about Amazon, “Amazon, as far as I can tell, is a charitable organization being run by elements of the investment community for the benefit of consumers.”)</blockquote><p>That second paragraph is almost weird to read now. It’s crazy the aboutface the public has taken on Big&nbsp;Tech.</p><p>Reason 2:</p><blockquote>The second main reason was ideological. Even the FTC lawyers were under the spell of the ‘consumer welfare’ standard, and felt that Google had the right to monopolize as long as consumers weren’t harmed. The reason, for instance, that the lawyers didn’t want to bring a charge for Google’s self-preferencing to kill vertical search engines wasn’t that they didn’t know the goal. They realized it was a scheme to monopolize. But they felt that Google had presented enough evidence showing that consumers might like it if Google’s search engine prioritized Google’s own properties. This ideology made the lawyers meeker, though they still wanted to bring&nbsp;suit.</blockquote><p>This goes along with the first reason — the way we think about monopolies and Big Tech and the parameters by how we might assess those situations has radically shifted in the last couple years (further cemented by the appointments of Lina Khan and Tim Wu as part of the Biden administration).</p><p>Reason 3:</p><blockquote>The third and most significant reason is that the commission’s antitrust economists made a very strong, and entirely wrong, argument against the case, which in retrospect rested on a set of laughably inaccurate predictions. While the FTC lawyers at the Bureau of Competition wanted to bring some charges, the economists at the Bureau of Economics said there was no case. They believed the online ad and search markets were competitive, consumers were benefitting, and there was little evidence of misbehavior.</blockquote><p>So where are we&nbsp;today?</p><blockquote>Mostly I’m pretty happy with my predictions, in which I said Biden would spend a lot of money and be more populist than Obama. But Biden has out-performed my expectations. He hired antitrust expert Tim Wu for the White House, and is reportedly appointing antitrust expert Lina Khan to the FTC. And Biden himself when he was in the Senate had little patience for economists. Meanwhile, Republicans, who were just as in thrall to Google, have changed as well. Trump brought a Google antitrust suit, the conversation on Capitol Hill has undergone a stark change on the right, and the awesome Texas case against Google is heavy on evidence of monopoly power and very light on theoretical economics.</blockquote><blockquote>So both parties have broken from the antitrust status quo. That said, the question now is whether political leaders writ large can ditch their affection for economists. These debates are more than theoretical. When someone uses Google to find help for their addiction, that person is not accessing a search engine, but a manipulation machine designed to serve the interests of whoever pays Google the most. It didn’t have to be this way. And if we downgrade economics, it doesn’t have to be this way&nbsp;anymore.</blockquote><p>In a very different place, apparently.</p><p>And it’s not just Google. It’s Facebook. It’s Apple. It’s Amazon. These companies have spent years consolidating their market power and they’ve all leveraged their position for their own gains — at the expense of their competitors and at the expense of end&nbsp;users.</p><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/99a3f7c1-54d9-47fe-9bcb-fd72fcd94076">Apple warns Chinese apps not to dodge its new privacy&nbsp;rules</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-singapores-sea-used-facebook-to-become-an-e-commerce-giant">How Singapore’s Sea Used Facebook to Become an E-Commerce Giant</a>   2. But hey, at least we’ve woken up. Better late than&nbsp;never. <p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-investigating-visa-over-debit-card-practices-11616164525?mod=e2tw">The WSJ on the Justice Department’s investigation of&nbsp;Visa</a>:</p><blockquote>The Justice Department is investigating whether Visa Inc. is engaging in anticompetitive practices in the debit-card market, a probe that casts a cloud over a core part of its business.</blockquote><blockquote>The department’s antitrust division has been gathering information and asking whether Visa, the largest U.S. card network, has limited merchants’ ability to route debit-card transactions over card networks that are often less expensive, according to people familiar with the&nbsp;matter.</blockquote><blockquote>Many of the department’s questions have focused on online debit-card transactions, but investigators have asked about in-store issues as well, the people&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>The probe highlights the important role of the so-called network fees that are invisible to consumers, lucrative for card companies, but a weight on merchants, who often pass on the fees in the form of higher prices to customers.</blockquote><p>And <a href="https://twitter.com/gregkidd/status/1373038167092264960">here’s Greg&nbsp;Kidd</a>:</p><blockquote>No surprise here — Visa costs for running debit cards kept going down but prices kept going up. Hmmm. Glad the policymakers are finally waking&nbsp;up.</blockquote> 3. Glenn Greenwald’s opening statement on Big&nbsp;Tech: <blockquote>Over the last several years, my journalistic interest in and concern about the dangers of Silicon Valley’s monopoly power has greatly intensified — particularly as wielded by Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple. The dangers posed by their growing power manifest in multiple ways. But I am principally alarmed by the repressive effect on free discourse, a free press, and a free internet, all culminating in increasingly intrusive effects on the flow of information and ideas and an increasingly intolerable strain on a healthy democracy.</blockquote><p><a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU05/20210312/111315/HHRG-117-JU05-Wstate-GreenwaldG-20210312.pdf">Check out the entire statement here.</a></p> 4. What the future of NFTs is really about:&nbsp;music <p><a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-capital-187d649e-11c3-4584-85b4-495befd03358.html">Here’s Felix&nbsp;Salmon</a>:</p><blockquote>How it works: The overwhelming majority of music revenues now come from streaming, with less than 6% coming from digital downloads, per the RIAA. Artists and genres appealing to a younger audience see almost no downloads at&nbsp;all.</blockquote>  Fandom, however, remains, and there is almost no limit to how much fans are willing to pay to express their allegiance to their favorite artists — especially if that allegiance has potential speculative value.  <blockquote>The state of play: Currently, artists release their singles and albums digitally in unlimited editions, normally at a price of 99 cents per song or $10 per&nbsp;album.</blockquote>  If those downloads were replaced with limited editions of say 10,000 NFTs per single, the price could be orders of magnitude higher — and could attract buyers who currently have no interest in downloads.  The NFTs would become collectible objects, with a resale value that might even go up over&nbsp;time.  <p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/opensea-raise-andreessen-horowitz">NFT Marketplace OpenSea Raises $23M, Led by Andreessen Horowitz — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/wisekey-price-rally-nft">This (Small-ish) Swiss Cybersecurity Stock Jumped 80% After NFT-Related Press Release — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tony-hawk-nft-540-ollie">Tony Hawk Skates His Last Ollie 540, Puts the NFT of It Up for Auction — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/jack-dorsey-first-tweet-sells">Jack Dorsey’s First Tweet Sells for $2.9M — CoinDesk</a>   5.

<p>This is the actual letter to keep VCs that contacted me so far up to&nbsp;date.</p><p>Dear [%investor_name%]!</p><p>I’m thinking how to make venture capital aligned with the web3 style organization. I came up with a <a href="https://www.notion.so/Machine-DAO-your-advice-needed-5a63f9dbb4594b7fbc76ed5a8827f585">draft</a> and for further thinking/building I need to verify with you a couple of assumptions.</p> TL;DR <p>If you agree/disagree with the assumptions in bold chose an action item in the&nbsp;end.</p> Assumption: The way a project is made matters a lot in&nbsp;web3  Assumption: Intrinsically motivated team is better than highly payed&nbsp;stars <p>There is a choice: go fast from day one with money and strong devs VS go slower and build motivated AND strong team along the way. I believe the second option is better. Though certainly harder, in the long run it would be&nbsp;faster.</p><p>Or is there an even better&nbsp;way?</p><p>The plan is to start paying devs with tokens (1 token = $1). Mint them on the go. No real value until launch. After launch convert them into ownership. Hope to catch intrinsically motivated people this&nbsp;way.</p> Assumption: Multiple investors is a&nbsp;must <p>I think having investors in a decentralized project is good. Business professionals with large participation will help to make better decisions. But we need a number of them. Not just in rounds, but simultaneously.</p><p>Is it okay to have multiple investors from the&nbsp;start?</p><p>That would mean splitting the investment. You probably have a minimum threshold sum. Would it be a&nbsp;problem?</p> Assumption: Investor is a part of the community <p>Open discussion with investors brings a lot of value. It shows how the project is made, adds trust. Even the fact of having an investor in the community adds a lot of value. <a href="https://discord.gg/VQwHVqEDWk">Join Upala’s&nbsp;discord</a>!</p><p>Can I tell your name to other possible investors?</p> Action items <p>Join <a href="https://medium.com/six-degrees-of-separation/your-help-needed-db9464bc3030">Upala’s first community call</a> this Wednesday (March 24) 05:00 PM&nbsp;CET.</p><p>Check out <a href="https://www.notion.so/Machine-DAO-your-advice-needed-5a63f9dbb4594b7fbc76ed5a8827f585">Macine DAO draft</a> — an organizational structure for Upala and its evolution</p><p>Join <a href="https://discord.gg/VQwHVqEDWk">patrons channel in Upala’s&nbsp;discord</a></p><p>Answer the questions in the text (in&nbsp;italic)</p><p>If you think that I’m can do something better/faster/stronger or my assumptions are wrong please let me&nbsp;know.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/six-degrees-of-separation/an-open-letter-to-investors-a59c3813fc4b">An open letter to investors</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/six-degrees-of-separation">Upala Digital Identity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Overview <p>Do you know about “short&nbsp;clips”?</p><p>Short clips are short videos that improve the overall quality of video content, by inserting short scenes. Short clips are used in various videos such as YouTube, advertisements, and news. Content businesses like YouTube, where over 500 hours of videos are uploaded each minute, use a variety of diverse short&nbsp;clips.</p><p>Below is a 30 seconds campaign video that was produced using the short clips we provided. Could you figure out how many short clips were used in this&nbsp;video?</p><blockquote><a href="https://youtu.be/kdnKoMOPmQY">How many short clips are&nbsp;there?</a></blockquote><p>Video content editors acquire short clips from taking videos by themselves or purchasing from other sources. They spend a lot of time struggling to resolve copyright issues when purchasing from various sources. Videos posted on YouTube are frequently taken down for copyright infringements and/or violations. For YouTube, it is difficult to detect copyright infringements in the vast content&nbsp;library.</p><p>CRISPY WHALES has created Banana Clips, to address these&nbsp;issues.</p><p>Banana Clips is an online marketplace where video content creators can sell or purchase short clips using web and mobile applications. Anyone with a smartphone can easily upload videos and anyone can easily search and purchase them via the&nbsp;web.</p> Features <p>Banana Clips provides 3-big features:</p>  Uploading and searching short&nbsp;clips,  Preserving copyrights of short clips and protecting contracts between buyers and&nbsp;seller  Tokenizing short clips and&nbsp;rights.  <p>Banana Clip users can easily upload their own videos and receive rewards through sales. Searchable metadata and simple recognizable keywords are extracted from the uploaded short clips via our AI system. In addition, emotional keywords like ‘warm’, ‘afraid’, ‘sad’, etc. are extracted through our patented AI algorithm which provides a search function that allows downloaders to easily search for the right short clips without professional knowledge.</p><p>The uploaded short clips are analyzed by our AI system, and then unique steganography is implanted in each short clip through our copyright management system to be used for identifying and verifying later. The watermarked short clips are stored and protected over the AERGO platform. We believe that the fast transaction speed and the strong security of AERGO is the best solution to provide the appropriate environment to protect and verify the copyright of short clips. Additionally, the short clips are used in a variety of ways when purchased and 3rd party protection lends credibility. Banana Clips provides a contract management system using fingerprint technology on the AERGO platform and protects rights for buyers and&nbsp;sellers.</p><p>Uploaders can sell their ownership of short clips at any time in the form of a non-fungible token (NFT) with their unique value in Banana Clips. However, a contract to purchase rights of usage for a short clip would be a common case in our service. The unique value of it is determined by the value derived from the short clip and the contract. In order to enable trading, we are proposing to develop a new token protocol; a re-fungible token (RFT) which is a separate token value from non-fungible token&nbsp;(NFT).</p><p>Video content production and/or editing professionals using Banana Clips can purchase short clips and may use them free from copyright infringement through professional and advanced search methods. The unique token for each short clip issued can be traded to other users, so the sustainable value will further boost the market. In addition, NFTs or RFTs issued in this process will be valued and traded in the market, providing transparent compensation to uploaders.</p> Goal <p>CRISPY WHALES aims to provide a transparent marketplace through Banana Clip to ensure various short clips are securely provided and that each user can be fairly compensated. Furthermore, our company’s goal is to create a transparent and ethical culture by establishing a video copyright verification system that can be shared worldwide.</p><p>Within Banana Clips, content creator’s efforts will be paid at a fair price, the diverse values of the world will be brought together, and users will have a great collaborative experience.</p><p>CRISPY WHALES will work with AERGO to provide tools that will make it easy for content creators to exchange their creativity and have their work protected. We will collaborate together to create a world where the creator’s contents are respected.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-community-to-vote-on-awarding-second-incubation-investment-to-crispy-whales-be08520c8ea4">AERGO community to vote on awarding second incubation investment to CRISPY WHALES</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>2020 saw a gigantic shift of work occurring outside of traditional corporate offices. The trend toward a mobile, distributed workforce had been underway for some time, but the global pandemic kicked it into overdrive, with work from home transforming from a fringe benefit to a critical component in keeping businesses running successfully.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>But for wholesale remote work to be viable, it needs to be secure and convenient. And when enterprises no longer can rely primarily on their network security infrastructure as their main defense against outside attacks, what does the new security ecosystem look like?<br> &nbsp;</p>

Meeco has been enabling organisations and people to collect, protect and exchange personal data since the <a href="https://www.meeco.me/manifesto">Meeco manifesto </a>came to life in 2012. Since then, Meeco has been steadily growing in size and recognition.




 




2020 was an interesting year! Despite worldwide shutdowns and uncertainty, Meeco doubled in size in the last year, adding to our development team in Melbourne. Meeco also secured new partnerships in Europe along with the <a href="https://blog.meeco.me/fintech-australia-announces-meeco-as-a-finnies-2020-finalist/">Finnie 2020 award</a> in “Excellence in Industry Collaborations &amp; Partnerships” to prove it.




 




Now as we enter 2021, we’re keeping the momentum and thrilled to announce the expansion of our UX, Design and Testing team in Adelaide, Australia.




 




The new meeps will significantly bolster Meeco’s design chops, bringing more <a href="https://womeninidentity.org/">diversity</a> to the team and addressing the need for more women working on digital identity and personal data solutions. This new team is  Meeco’s Design/Digital hub, cementing Meeco’s commitment to delivering beautiful design and digital work made in-house.




 




The first task of the Meeco Design Team will be breathing some new life into its website and digital communication. The new meeps are excited to bring in their understanding of data collection, user interactions and how they can bring them together to create thoughtful design solutions. They add to Meeco’s belief that an holistic approach to designing processes is key to delivering unique and powerful memories for people.




 Our new office 





 




The team has taken residence in <a href="https://www.stoneandchalk.com.au/">Stone&amp;Chalk </a>Adelaide, keeping up with the tradition in Melbourne and Sydney. Stone&amp;Chalk  is located on Adelaide’s remarkable <a href="https://lotfourteen.com.au/">Lot Fourteen</a>.




 





<blockquote>With a $150 million investment from the Federal Government, the Adelaide City Deal builds on Adelaide’s global reputation in innovation, culture and the arts.<p></p>lotfourteen.com.au</blockquote>

  The French web was paralyzed after the fire that took place in a datacenter of OVH. For Cozy Cloud, despite 43 lost servers, no impact on the user side. We reveal why.

 <p>More than 3.6 million web servers representing 464,000 domain names went offline in a few minutes following the fire that broke out on Wednesday night, March 10, at our hosting company <a href="https://us.ovhcloud.com/">OVH</a>, including French government sites. Be assured: your Cozy domains were not affected by the fire and no data was lost.<br>
Our infrastructure withstood the fire despite the very rapid loss of 43 of our servers and in keeping with our strategy of transparency, we decided to detail you the impact of this incident on our business and how we were able to cope with it.</p>
 The French web paralyzed 
<p>The websites and services of more than 12,000 French companies that had chosen to have their data hosted by OVH were taken offline following the disaster.<br>
This is notably the case for :</p>
 
 the digital workspace (ENT) of the Île-de-France region 
 the Centre Pompidou 
 the data.gouv.fr website 
 the Simplified Procedures website 
 the CityScoot application 
 Coinhouse, a specialist in cryptocurrency transactions. 
 
<p>And the list of "burnt" machines is still long.</p>
<p>©SDIS 67</p>
 Why did your Cozy not be impacted by this fireplace? 
<p>At <a href="https://cozy.io/en/">Cozy Cloud</a>, our business is the protection of your data. Your data is hosted in geographically separated datacenters - Gravelines, Roubaix and Strasbourg, managed by OVH which guarantees for example that a "catastrophe" on one site will not affect the data hosted on the other sites. Each of your data is replicated 3 times in redundant systems, spread over several sites. Our infrastructures are also sized so that the loss of servers does not disturb the service.</p>
<p>Following this exceptional accident, 43 servers were destroyed out of a total of more than 200 and despite this, there was no noticeable impact on the service provided to our users, nor was any data lost.</p>
<p>©SDIS 67</p>
 What was our action plan? 
<p>First of all, nothing! The configuration and automation in place responded perfectly and isolated the affected components to maintain data and service despite everything.<br>
Then, as soon as we became aware of the fire shortly after midnight, our team established the following action plan:</p>
 
 Identify losses and prioritize actions to replace machines 
 Immediately order replacement machines from other OVH datacenters to restore redundancy and our scalability and performance capabilities 
 
 
 Re-installation of machines with priority given to restoring the redundancies most affected by the accident. Our configuration automation allowed us to perform these re-installations in only a few minutes per machine and thus minimize the time when our redundancy was reduced 
 
 
 4. Real-time communication to our various partners of the impact on their production and specific action plans 
 
<p>All of these actions performed by our team took place in less than 36 hours of intervention after the disaster was announced.</p>
 What is the total impact to you, the Cozy users? 
<p>This incident has not impacted the availability of your Cozy and its data. However, action is required on the part of Cozy Banks users to <a href="https://support.cozy.io/article/509-ma-banque-affiche-identifiantserrones-que-dois-je-faire">resume synchronization of their new bank data</a>.</p>
 "Keep calm: your data is safe" 
<p>Making data backups is essential today but it also requires technical skills. Our mission is to do it for you in order to facilitate your already complex digital life.</p>
<p>Testimony of an user who chose to save his data in a Cozy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had my laptop broken into and stolen. But thanks to Cozy, I didn't lose any data, and I have access to everything from my phone! I was able to print invoices partly recovered by the connectors, and other documents, from my Cozy on my phone. Anyway, I just wanted to tell you that I am very happy to be part of your users!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Congratulations to all our users who have already chosen Cozy!</p>
 Support OVH 
<p>Faced with the challenges of digital sovereignty, and in order to keep our promise, we have always chosen to work with French and more European partners.<br>
The reason is simple: by interacting with them on a daily basis, we have control over our infrastructure and therefore your data. This makes it easier to act quickly and effectively in these extreme cases.<br>
We therefore reaffirm our confidence in OVH and give them all our support to overcome this ordeal.</p>
 Thanks to our team 
<p>We would like to thank all of the system administrators who have been able to work with us, since the beginning of the Cozy adventure, to set up an architecture that is sufficiently robust, redundant and resilient. It is because of their work that this incident has not impacted your data or access to your Cozy today.</p>

<p>The Fission team has had the pleasure of getting to know medical doctor and developer Abraham Samma. Abraham is based in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, where he practices medicine and develops software. His latest project is called Oneplaybook, and is built on TiddlyWiki.</p><p>We talked with Abraham about his work, digital note taking apps, TiddlyWiki, Oneplaybook and his thoughts about the future of all things privacy and security.</p> Q. When did you first Discover TiddlyWiki? <p></p><p>A. I discovered TiddlyWiki around 2016. I was looking around the web at the time for inspiration for my next web side project. I wanted to try to create a knowledge management system because, as a doctor and philomath, my primary concern was building and maintaining an organized personal knowledge base for the many things I learned over the years. However, I didn’t want to simply use someone else’s app. <br></p> Q. What is TiddyWiki in your own words? <p></p><p>A. Describing TiddlyWiki has become something of a mental exercise when introducing it to people outside of the TiddlyWiki community. It’s pretty hard because it is more than just another wiki application. For beginners, the succinct description of a “non-linear notetaking app” is usually sufficient to get them interested enough to have a look and try it out for themselves. The idea of creating free flowing linked thoughts is appealing because in many ways, that is how our minds usually work. We tend to meander in our thoughts, and at our own pace. It’s refreshing for many of us who can’t bear to fill diaries on a regular basis!</p><p>However, the moment beginners start to use TiddlyWiki and experience the many incredible features it has to offer like transclusion, metaprogramming and the ability to reproduce its own source code (making it a quine) and allowing it to save itself as a self-contained, decentralized single HTML file, they usually almost always experience a profound “aha” moment. All of these features aren’t really captured by the non-linear notebook description well enough. So I’d prefer calling it ‘a metaprogramable environment for your thoughts and knowledge’. Another apt high-level description I like to use is ‘like Excel, but in notebook form.’</p> Q. What do you use TiddlyWiki for personally? <p></p><p>A. I try to organize my life with TiddlyWiki as much as possible. I use it for brainstorming, creating shopping lists, noting down ideas, even saving web articles for offline saving that are too important to me to be put into another web article saving tool.</p><p>In some cases, I use TiddlyWiki’s built-in building blocks to create my own solutions. Other times I use a solution crafted by other TiddlyWiki users. I do all this not only for my own utility, but also to explore new ideas for plugins to fill in certain need gaps that may exist in TiddlyWiki.</p><p>I’m heavily invested in my notebook. So much so that it has become a living portrait of my life. I am sure advertisements networks would kill to have this kind of rich information about a single person. But they never will, and that’s the beauty of it! It’s all yours and no one else’s. Oh, it even has a built-in tool to encrypt your notes so there’s that!</p> Q. What have you built with TiddlyWiki? <p></p><p>A. I’ve built a number of plugins, including a Lean canvas manager that I’d like to revamp in the near future. I also created Maarfapad dot com which is a free community cloud service for hosting personal wikis. Now I am busy with the upcoming <a href="https://oneplaybook.app/">OnePlaybook</a> dot app service which will give users the ability to create and use wikis inside their preferred cloud service, like Google Drive or Dropbox. You could also deploy it onto a private server and use it completely offline.</p>From Oneplaybook.app<p>It’s been a work in progress since sometime last year. I came up with the basic concept in February and I’ve been refining the idea with a colleague of mine who is a software engineer.</p><p>We are testing it and seeing we can address some pain points for our future users. We’re staying customer focused on our side of things because we really want this thing to succeed. The pandemic is showing us different pain points that can be met with our product and with TiddlyWiki. For instance, Oneplaybook allows teams working remotely to work together asynchronously or in real time in a free and secure workspace.</p><p>People need to be empowered with their own agency and sovereignty again with these tools</p> Q. What are your favorite TiddlyWiki plugins? <p></p><p>A. Let me break it down into a list:</p>  For UI, I love the work that JD mobile is doing. I use his Whitespaces plugin that configures TiddlyWiki into a mobile friendly experience among other things.  Mohammed’s Kookma Todo list plugin is a very compact micro-app todo list maker for your wiki. Highly recommended  Noteself is an awesome edition of TiddlyWiki that creates a self-hosted wikis with your data being stored inside your browser. You can also sync it to a CouchDB server that you own  Projectify is a beautiful edition of TiddlyWiki reimagined as a project management tool with direct inspiration taken from basecamp by its author. Very nice that one.  Krystal plugin turns your wiki into Andy Matuschak’s notebook. If you don’t understand, Google this guy’s notes. It’s mind-blowing and he’s awesome!  <p>There are many more than I could go on about, but these are my absolute favorites. There is also a plugin that turns TiddlyWiki into a Roam Research lookalike called Stroll. This is a testament to the inventiveness of open source communities like ours. You never know what you might find tomorrow.</p> Q. What’s one thing that you wish TiddlyWiki did? <p></p><p>A. In terms of features, there’s not much it can’t do that’s essential. You can always create a plugin or macro to satisfy your needs. And more will come along, especially as the core developers work to make API easier to understand and work with in upcoming versions. More integrations with other external services for things like sharing and publishing would also be nice. But what I would like is more traction. And that’s somewhat more difficult to attain.</p><p>Although TiddlyWiki is already very popular as an open source software, with more than 5k stars on Github, it is still relatively unknown to many it’s meant to help. Its main ‘competitor’ in this space is Roam Research which tends to steal the show among academics, which is ok--we all have different tastes, but I feel people are missing out a lot. Particularly in terms of robustness; TiddlyWiki works fine no matter the browser you use or the state of your internet connection. You can’t say the same about most proprietary software-as-a-service apps.</p><p>And when it comes to knowledge management, you want that kind of robustness and versatility. TiddlyWiki is so much older than other similar apps today (more than seven years old now) and it has stayed very stable throughout that time. Backwards compatibility is keystone in the community. A TiddlyWIki from 2014 will work just as well and will be mostly compatible with a version from 2021. That kind of robustness is gold in an age of planned obsolescence and ‘move fast, break things’.</p> Q. What excites you about Fission and TiddlyWiki teaming up? <p></p><p>A. Whenever there is a new service integration for TiddlyWiki, there’s more to look forward to in terms of possibilities and opportunities. Hooking up TiddlyWiki to Fission allows for all kinds of interesting things IMO, such as web publishing, site creation, SaaS creation (difficult if you don’t employ a MERN or LAMP stack), things that might require domain experts or teams might now be possible for ordinary people from other fields of expertise to do.</p><p>The web should be open for creators from all walks of life, not just IT ninjas. I see this partnership as a step towards enabling that vision even more. We can imagine people learning only basic web skills creating B2B web services built with TiddlyWiki and hosted on decentralized infrastructure and improving their livelihood. It may feel like a stretch, but we must remember that all of the web today was once seen as a stretch too. It’s up to all of us to make it more mundane!</p> Q. What interests you about the future of web technology? <p></p><p>A. I’m really interested in decentralized web technologies--these are really good things and we need them more than ever. Last year we as a nation actually experienced for the first time some form of censorship during our elections. It was really unnerving for a lot of us. We couldn’t access Twitter...and evidence emerged online that Twitter was being locked on every level imaginable. They were blocking it wherever they could find it.</p><p>In fact, VPN became a meme of sorts because Tanzania was introduced to such a thing after this incident. It was really disorienting for people to need to think about this sort of thing. Some people even thought VPN was a magical potion to drink in order to access the internet.</p><p>The situation got me thinking about how vulnerable we are. Something needs to change on a fundamental level. We need to think about how we create stuff on the web and how we can be better protected.</p><p>This is a wakeup call of all of us over here. But, at least there is encouraging progress being made toward creating a lot of decentralized protocols. I hear that Mozilla and maybe Brave have taken up some of these protocols. So who knows? The future is bright. It’s encouraging.</p> <p>We here at Fission agree with Abraham--the future definitely looks bright! Especially with brilliant minds like Abraham's </p><p>If you’d like to be notified when Oneplaybook is ready, sign up for the waiting list at <a href="http://oneplaybook.app">oneplaybook.app</a>. You can find Abraham on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/ABSamma">@ABSamma</a>.</p>

					 Meetup with Indicio to explore decentralized identity 
				 
				
			 
				
				
			   
				
				
				
				
					 
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  As a public benefit corporation, Indicio is committed to advancing decentralized identity as a technology that will benefit everyone. To help people understand how this technology works, we are hosting Meetups once per month on a Wednesday, except holidays.  
			   
				
				
				 <p>We started in December last year, and this Wednesday the 24th will be our fourth get-together. I would like to briefly share with you some of the highlights from our past events. </p>
<p>Our first Meetup on December 23, 2020 saw Sam Curren (@TelegramSam) present an overview of decentralized identity, Lynn Bendixsen talk about the Hyperledger Indy Network community, and Daniel Bluhm (@dbluhm_) give an overview of Hyperledger Aries.</p>
<p>Our second Meetup in January, 2021 discussed our newly <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/indicio-tech-advances-decentralized-identity-with-release-of-critical-open-source-technology/">open-sourced mediator agent</a>, which makes it possible to communicate verifiable credentials to mobile devices via open source standards. Indicio’s Sam Curren (senior architect) &amp; Daniel Bluhm (software engineer) dived into the details. The recording (highly recommended!) is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXsELfUYrGM&amp;t=2s">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our February saw Mike Vesey, President of <a href="https://idramp.com/">IdRamp</a>, demonstrate how users of <a href="https://qiqochat.com/">QiqoChat</a> can take full control over their digital identity with a self-sovereign privacy-focused solution protected by state-of-the-art cryptographic blockchain security. Vesey showed just how easy it was to integrate verifiable credentials &nbsp;with various communication tools. You can watch the demonstration <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94Wd9S66Is4">here</a>.</p>
<p>This Wednesday, the innovative app developers at <a href="http://global.id">GlobaliD </a>&nbsp;Alexis Falquier and Dev Bharel will show a brief video demonstration of their interoperable wallet connecting with, receiving a credential from, and verifying the credential with an agent on Trinsic’s studio. Sign up <a href="https://www.meetup.com/indicio-identity-community/events/276745615/">here</a>! </p>

					  Gleich sechs Business Angels beteiligen sich mit einer Pre-Seed-Finanzierung in sechsstelliger Höhe an der comuny GmbH aus Weinheim. Bereits im Dezember konnte der Pitch des Startups beim Online-Matching der Business Angels FrankfurtRheinMain (BA FRM) überzeugen. Neben Mitgliedern aus dem Frankfurter Investorennetzwerk wurde ein weiterer Business Angel aus dem Kölner Raum gewonnen. <p>Benutzername plus Passwort? Nicht mehr sicher genug. Unternehmen unterziehen ihre Kunden immer stärkeren Sicherheitsüberprüfungen, wenn sich diese an digitalen Services anmelden. Doch die Organisation sicherheitsrelevanter Nutzerdaten und Passwörter ist für Unternehmen anspruchsvoll, technisch aufwändig und teuer. Zudem unkomfortabel für den Kunden: Trotz Kundenkonto braucht er oft zusätzlich eine App oder zeitraubende Hilfsmittel wie Smartcards.</p><p>Dabei liegt die Lösung auf der Hand: Zum einen setzen sich mobile Endgeräte aktuell immer klarer als favorisierter Zugriffspunkt vieler Nutzer durch. Zum anderen benutzen Prüfverfahren Gerätefunktionen wie Kamera, Fingerprint, TAN-Apps oder schicken Codes via SMS. Wer dieses Nebeneinander verzahnt, generiert entscheidende Vorteile.</p><p>Hier unterstützt comuny über eine schlanke B2B-Komponente und etabliert sich als Spezialist für die einfache und sichere Realisierung von Registrierungs- und Login-Prozessen für Apps über mobile Endgeräte.</p><p>So können Unternehmen erstmals persönliche Daten des Kunden für verschiedene ihrer IT-Systeme effizienter, nämlich unter Einbeziehung des Mobilgeräts organisieren. Denn einmal verifizierte Daten des Kunden können auf dem Gerät verwahrt und anschließend für sicheren Zugriff bei Anmeldung sogar auf neue Dienste weiterverwendet werden.</p><p>Steffen Seifarth, einer der Investoren von comuny, erfahrener Business Angel und bekannt für kritisch-konstruktive Prüfung von Teams und Geschäftsmodellen bekräftigt: „Uns hat von Anfang an der konsequente WIN-WIN-WIN Gedanke von comuny imponiert, bei dem Nutzer, Unternehmen sowie die eingebundenen Dienstleister von einer sicheren, schlanken und gleichzeitig hochflexiblen Datennutzung profitieren.“</p><p>Und Nikolaus D. Bayer, preisgekrönter Business Angel des Jahres 2020 formuliert für alle Investoren von comuny: „Wir freuen uns darauf, das Team von comuny in den kommenden Wachstumsphasen zu begleiten und bei der Applizierung der Technologie auf weitere Branchen und Use-Cases zu unterstützen.“</p><p><a href="https://www.comuny.de/presse/">Vollständige Pressemitteilung vom 22.03.21 lesen</a></p><p>#startups #businessangelfrankfurt #verifizierung #authentifizierung #operator #trinity</p>

There are many reasons; from parts of the regulation that focused or constrained its use into the public sphere only, to the lack of total coverage across all of the EU. Likely the key missing piece was that the cultural climate was not yet ripe and the state of digital identity was really not ready. Too many technical problems were yet to be solved.

<p>(originally sent on Sep 30. <a href="http://eepurl.com/coMMKT">Subscribe to our newsletter now</a>)</p><p>Hi Everyone,</p><p>I have a couple of follow-ups to Bitmark’s recent milestones mentioned in past newsletters.<br> <br> Last week, our team received the Cohack award for Autonomy, our public health app. Taiwan president 蔡英文 Tsai Ing-wen presented CEO Sean with the award, which upon seeing up-close photos of, I’m quite envious. <br> <br> See Sean at&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1307962865777651714">:15 from this tweet</a> from the President.<br> <br> We also officially announced our collaboration with UC Berkeley and its school of public health via this <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/uc-berkeley-and-bitmark-launch-autonomy-app-as-part-of-the-schools-covid-19-safe-campus-initiative-301134438.html">press release</a>. We’re excited to transition Autonomy to the entire city of Berkeley on September 30th. It’s completely free and users control the full rights to their data.<br> <br> If you know anyone in the San Francisco Bay Area, please have them try it out here: <a href="https://autonomy-pwa.bitmark.com/">https://autonomy-pwa.bitmark.com</a>. We’ve had some encouraging talks with other public health departments around the United States, and I hope we can be of&nbsp;help.</p><p><a href="https://autonomy-pwa.bitmark.com">Try Autonomy&nbsp;Now</a></p><p>I only have one link to share this month, so I’ll get to that first before going deeper into my current frame of mind. There is an irony that in many places, such as New York City, a tenant cannot install cameras (ex. doorbell cameras) to preserve everyone else’s privacy. Yet…landlords can.</p><p>There are few laws and regulations governing the collection and use of data in the context of Landlord Tech. Because it is generally sold to landlords and property managers, not tenants, Landlord Tech is often installed without notifying or discussing potential harms with tenants and community members. These harms include the possibility that sensitive and personal data can be handed over to the police, ICE, or other law enforcement and government agencies. Landlord Tech can also be used to automate evictions, racial profiling, and tenant harassment. In addition, Landlord Tech is used to abet real estate speculation and gentrification, making buildings more desirable to whiter and wealthier tenants, while feeding real estate and tech companies with property — be that data or real estate. Landlord Tech tracking platforms have increasingly been marketed to landlords as solutions to Covid-19, leading to new forms of residential surveillance.<br> <br> <a href="https://antievictionmappingproject.github.io/landlordtech/">https://antievictionmappingproject.github.io/landlordtech/</a></p><p>This got me thinking about the theme of today’s newsletter, how do we trust in the current age? A big part of why we built Autonomy during COVID-19 was that we heard how communities needed a way to trust, yet verify what they were being told. In an age of mass distributed disinformation, extreme politicking, and cancel culture, it’s hard to figure out if anything is real.<br> <br> For Bitmark, we like to believe that we can be a great partner because we are trustworthy, but how does one prove that? You really can’t. From the company’s inception, we needed to be able to create a digital rights standard. We felt we had to be effectively neutral without any ability to hold market power over stakeholders. Thus, we implemented blockchain in our infrastructure and open-source to let others verify what we were doing and be able to improve our work if we ever slacked behind. Using a decentralized platform ensured it would be extremely difficult for us to abuse our power (it would have been nice if we could say that about the Facebooks and Apples of the world right now).<br> <br> That said, you’d have to be pretty hardcore to go validate these things yourself. Unless there’s a lot of money in it or value in seeing Bitmark fail, not many people will be incentivized to investigate what Bitmark is doing.<br> <br> Perhaps the best we can do is signal our integrity and build relationships with you. When you have a chance to choose Bitmark to help you control the rights to a digital resource, we hope you feel comfortable doing so. One attempt is through this newsletter. Another is our new initiative to share Sean’s past reflections to our investors, which you can find here: <a href="https://medium.com/clean-titles/tagged/ceo-observation">https://medium.com/clean-titles/tagged/ceo-observation</a><br> <br> Sean writes these notes as part of his quarterly update to our investors. They’re often a bit raw, but they’re always an honest reflection of how he sees Bitmark’s role in the world at that time. Of course, if we go back, we might cringe at how naive we were, but that’s just part of the learning process.<br> <br> Moving forward, we’re going to share these with you, unedited, one quarter behind — you’ll see Q2’s notes in Q3. I’ve never seen another company do this, and I’m always fascinated by Sean’s viewpoint. I hope you can gain something from them too.<br> <br> I appreciate your continued support. If you enjoy this newsletter or our work, please help us by sharing it with a friend.

I love coding and I’m introvert. I though that it would be much simpler to explain in code, than in&nbsp;person.</p><p>Now I realized, that building everything by myself is certainly doable, BUT I need a long uninterrupted stretch of time for that. Which is impossible to get with all that presentations, documentation, talking, writing articles, and million of other things. Not to mention the necessity to make money for a living (I’m a human too, you know). I could shut it all down and go for a coding retreat for a couple of months, but there is a danger of falling into perfection death spiral for a project. Not an&nbsp;option.</p><p>Another important thing, is that by making all by myself I centralize it.

			  Xavi Aznal Prieto is Product Owner at Tokeny Solutions.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p></p>
<p>My name is Xavi Aznal Prieto. I was born and still live with my wife and kids in the Barcelona area (Spain). I have a degree in Telecommunications Engineering and a masters in Computer Vision. Since I was a child I have always had an interest in knowing ‘how machines work’. I had the opportunity to have my own computer since I was 10 years old (8 bits CPU and 128KB RAM at that time), so I would say I am a vocational engineer. During my professional career I have developed several tech related roles, from big companies to startups. I have coded a lot, defined tech strategy and managed projects and teams. In particular, I have been involved in startup projects during the past 12 years, an environment that I feel very stimulating as I like new challenges and not getting bored 🙂</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>I previously worked with our CCO Daniel Coheur in a startup project where I recruited and managed a tech development team in Barcelona. Tokeny had the idea of setting up a development team in Barcelona, so Daniel contacted me, we started discussing with Luc, our CEO, and I was quickly convinced by the potential of the business vision. I started with Tokeny by taking a Product Owner role and also with the goal of recruiting and managing Barcelona development office. Now we are seven people in Barcelona, and we will hopefully keep growing!</p>
 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>I feel very comfortable being part of Tokeny’s team. People are very skilled and communication is fairly fluid in all directions. Because of last year’s situation, we have become very familiar with a fully remote working environment and our adaption has been excellent, which speaks volumes about the quality of the team.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>I love to be outdoors and breathe some fresh air. I have been into endurance sports for many years, having finished some marathons, Ultra Trails and Iron Man triathlons. Now I do not train so hard but a good run across the countryside still charges my batteries.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>If all my beloved ones, wife and kids, stay healthy I have more than enough to be happy 🙂</p>
  
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>I would say that every person in the world could have their basic needs covered: food, roof and health access. A utopia? I would like to think it’s not.</p>

It features Bitmark CEO Sean and Girls in Tech’s Renee Yeh contrasting their experiences with technology, rights, and democracy in the east and the west. You can also find our audio podcast links in the video description of the link&nbsp;above.</p><p>I’ve asked some questions from our two hosts and producer Vivian&nbsp;Chen:</p><p>Who is this podcast for and what should they expect from&nbsp;it?</p><p>Vivian: This podcast is for those who care about rights and democracy and are wondering how we can improve&nbsp;it.</p><p>What’s been the most interesting learning you’ve had so&nbsp;far?</p><p>Sean: The most interesting learning I’ve had was with the National Taiwan Treasure project on the Hsiao A episode. It was surprising to me that it has had no impact on Taiwanese People. Finding out how this single bad decision has been affecting Taiwan as a country should have been a constitutional moment, but I was shocked that Taiwnese people didn’t care as much as I expected. In the United States in 2013, when Edward Snowden leaked highly classified information from the National Security Agency, U.S. citizens thought of him as a traitor. After thinking deeper into the incident, people realized that what the government was doing was actually anti-democracy. But it seemed that people don’t really know what or how to change anymore, since these problems are so deeply rooted in our culture and governance.</p><p>I think that podcasts are, for now, the most important media to share information and educate the public. They can be independent without censorship and time limitations. During each episode’s discussions, we get to go as deep as we want. It’s unlike the current media, which is under the attention economy — eager for fast and short content. I feel privileged to talk with Renee and share things we care about, and getting people to start thinking about them. It’s basically pirate&nbsp;radio!</p><p>Renee: I enjoy communication and public speaking, and I would say that audience response is what drives me to share more. Podcasting is very different. It is like sailing in the dark for me. Producing each episode is like piloting Endurance (sorry for being an Interstellar nerd) into the unknown, and testifying to the truth, the cosmic truth — “Love is the one thing we’re capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and&nbsp;space.”</p><p>In each episode, we project love. Love for the world, love for each other, love for a better future. We are not sure when or where such love will be perceived, but we keep projecting.</p><p>Vivian: At the beginning of this podcast program, I imagined that our show would be purely rational. Talking about technologies for good and how technology could be the engine of growth in modern crises, Covid-19 especially. After episodes of discussion, I realized our program can be more than that. We started to cover all different elements that form our society, problems that lead to crises and tools people use to get through the crises. I was amazed by the complexity of the world and hope to discover more in our future episodes.</p><p>With everything going on in the world, which crisis should we most have hope for and&nbsp;why?</p><p>Sean: Covid-19 of course! This crisis brings forward the importance of health, and it activates science. For example, traditionally, it would take around 10 years to fully develop a vaccine. But due to Covid-19, the U.S. government was encouraging the pharmaceutical industry to innovate by simplifying and amplifying the process of development, and the government is willing to take the risk of failing by covering the money lost in failure. This is what the government should do — protect people’s civil liberties, unlock innovation and make it safe to&nbsp;fail.</p><p>Renee: Democracy. I think democracy is a value but we humans have little knowledge about how to realize this value through political means. Democracy as a political system may be failing, or struggling — to put it in a more hopeful way — but it only suggests that human civilization needs optimization. I hope people will join me in defending mutual&nbsp;respect.</p><p>Is there a dream guest you’d like one&nbsp;day?</p><p>Sean: Edward Snowden — In a more radical sense — we should get to a place where we don’t need government. Tools should be engineered so that people have control of their rights and with more fairness and justice in society. Edward Snowden is best at articulating what’s wrong with democratic government.</p><p>Lex Fridman — I like his way of thinking. Not only in terms of AI and technology. I think he has some really deep thoughts on love, happiness and society. He is a rising star in the podcast world right&nbsp;now.</p><p>Renee: Joseph Gordon-Levitt! Duh, do you really need a reason to talk to&nbsp;him?</p><p>How can listeners help?</p><p>Vivian:</p>  Subscribe: Subscribe to Hope in Crisis! We are available everywhere.

<p>by Shannon Appelcline.</p><p>As the Bitmark blockchain becomes more popular for NFTs, health data, music royalties and other types of digital property, we are frequently asked about the energy impact of the Bitmark blockchain and of blockchains in&nbsp;general.</p> Energy &amp; The Blockchain <p>The energy usage of blockchains has been in the news a lot lately. What’s that&nbsp;about?</p><p>Q: Why do Blockchains Use&nbsp;Energy?</p><p>A: The most widely used methodology for securing blockchains is the “proof-of-work” algorithm, which is at the heart of Bitcoin, as well as the Bitmark blockchain.This means that you have to do work in the form of extensive cryptographic calculations order to add a block of transactions to the blockchain. Since each block requires time and computational power, the blockchain grows more and more secure the more blocks are piled on top of each other, because it becomes increasingly difficult to go back and redo all those calculations.</p><p>Computers running calculations draw&nbsp;power.</p><p>Q: How Much Power is&nbsp;Needed?</p><p>A: The power needed to secure a blockchain is related to the total computational power working on a blockchain. The more computers that are trying to create blocks for the blockchain, the more power that’s required. That means that a very popular blockchain like Bitcoin has high energy requirements, while one focused on a much smaller area of expertise, like Bitmark, has a smaller power requirement.</p><p>That means that the power requirement of a blockchain can be directly measured by its computational power. That measurement is usually recorded as a “hashrate”: the number of hashes that can be made in a second by computers working on the blockchain, where a hash is the main cryptographic function used to make blocks and thus secure the blockchain.</p> Energy &amp;&nbsp;Bitmark <p>Like many other blockchains, Bitmark uses a proof-of-work algorithm, which means that it uses energy to secure its blocks. How much and how does that compare to other energy&nbsp;uses?</p><p>Q: What is the Hashrate of the Bitmark&nbsp;Network?</p><p>A: The Bitmark Network runs at about <a href="https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/bitmark/hashrate-chart">160 TH/s</a> and remains rock solid at that level. That’s terahashes per Second, or trillion hashes per second. In other words: 160,000,000,000,000 hashes per&nbsp;second.</p><p>In comparison, the Bitcoin Network’s hash rate has been rapidly escalating since 2017 and is currently running a bit under <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-hashrate.html">160 EX/s</a>, which is 160 exahashes or quintillion hashes per second, which is to say: 160,000,000,000,000,000,000 hashes per&nbsp;second.</p><p>The hashrate of the Bitcoin Network is literally a million times that of the Bitmark&nbsp;network.</p><p>Q: How Much Energy Does That Mean Bitmark&nbsp;uses?</p><p>A: We can measure energy usage by looking at the power costs of the mining rigs that secure blocks on blockchains. A relatively modern rig, the <a href="https://shop.bitmain.com/promote/antminer_s17pro/specification">Antminer S17 Pro</a>, uses 39.5 joules per terahash, which is the same as&nbsp;.011 Wh, or&nbsp;.000011 KWh, for a trillion&nbsp;hashes.</p><p>If Bitmark were run entirely on Antminer S17 Pros, in year it would use&nbsp;.000011 KWh/TH * 160 terahashes per second * 60 seconds * 60 minutes * 24 hours * 365 days, which is 55,500 KwH or 55.5 MwH. That’s probably a lower boundary, as average energy usage is likely to be less efficient.</p><p>Q: How Does that Compare to&nbsp;Bitcoin?</p><p>In comparison, a variety of reports state Bitcoin energy usage currently runs 80 to 120 TwH, which is 80,000,000 MwH to 120,000,000 MwH.</p><p>That’s unsurprisingly the same one to a million comparison that we saw in hashrates between the networks: Bitmark’s energy usage is likely one one-millionth of Bitcoin’s.</p><p>Q: How Does that Compare to Centralized Financial Systems?</p><p>A: It’s very hard to compare a blockchain with centralized financial systems because the power costs of blockchains are quite transparent while those of centralized systems are full of hidden subsidies.</p><p>However, we can produce a quick thumbnail to reveal the scope of the cost of those centralized systems. Considering the financial sector as a whole, there are 9 million financial employees in the US, another 5 million or so in Europe, and even more in Asia, Australia, South America, and Africa, bringing the number to many tens of millions. They have a whole infrastructure of buildings, vehicles, computers, credit card machines, and stock markets underlying them. That energy cost is obviously astronomical.</p><p>Many of those employees work in skyscrapers, which allows for a more precise comparison: in New York City, a fairly average skyscraper <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90181905/a-block-by-block-look-at-the-energy-consumption-of-new-yorks-buildings">can use 40 MwH of energy a year</a>, which means that 1.5 skyscrapers would balance out Bitmark’s energy usage. However, the workers in the US centralized financial industry alone could fill 750 skyscrapers! That’s 500x more energy usage than Bitmark’s blockchain, just for the offices of those US&nbsp;workers.</p><p>So, even with all those hidden subsidies, it’s pretty easy to say that Bitmark at least uses a bare fraction of even the US financial market’s office&nbsp;energy.</p><p>For a more extensive look at the costs of the financial industry as a whole, please see our article, “Bitcoin: What are the Real&nbsp;Costs?”</p><p>Q: How Does that Compare to Other Property Blockchains?</p><p>A: Bitmark is specialized in digital property. We’ve worked to create <a href="https://medium.com/clean-titles/digital-property-rights-with-bitmark-nfts-evolving-the-artists-reserved-rights-transfer-and-sale-509ffd1f990a">the best combination of software technology with property law</a>. Fundamentally, there aren’t any other major blockchains with that focus. The closest is Ethereum, which has created some standards for tokens to support property. However, what they’ve created is ultimately an add-on to an existing system, so unsurprisingly their implementation is <a href="https://docs.bitmark.com/meta/bitmark-eth-comparison">less efficient</a>.</p> Energy &amp;&nbsp;Miners <p>It’s ultimately the miners who create (and secure) blocks that use the energy in a blockchain, thus examining them can tell us a bit more about energy&nbsp;costs.</p><p>Q: Where Are Miners&nbsp;Located?</p><p>A: Blockchain networks are decentralized, so they can be anywhere in the world. The University of Cambridge maintains <a href="https://cbeci.org/mining_map">a map</a> that suggests that the US, China, and Russia are the biggest homes of Bitcoin miners. (Other sources say that China may have more than 50% of&nbsp;mining.)</p><p>The more general answer is that miners tend to be located where energy is cheap, and that also tends to mean where energy is cheap because it isn’t being used. A lot of the Bitcoin mining in China thus uses hydroelectric power that was built up but was not used or is underutilized. In fact, Chinese cities have been <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/chinese-city-known-for-bitcoin-mining-seeks-blockchain-firms-to-burn-excess-hydropower">seeking Bitcoin miners</a> because they literally have billions of KwH of power going to&nbsp;waste.</p><p>More importantly, Bitcoin energy usage is very green. The best report on the topic puts <a href="https://coinshares.com/assets/resources/Research/bitcoin-mining-network-june-2019-fidelity-foreword.pdf">renewable energy usage at&nbsp;74.1%</a>.</p><p>Bitmark mining demographics are likely to closely follow Bitcoin demographics.</p><p>Q: How Distributed Are&nbsp;Miners?</p><p>A: Distribution is pretty much the heart of any blockchain.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/mining/pools/">number of mining pools</a> each mine between 10–20% of all blocks. There is certainly some centralization here, though a mining pool doesn’t require all the mining rigs to be in the same&nbsp;place.</p><p>For energy usage considerations, the most relevant fact here is this: miners distribute themselves to where the cheap energy is, and that often means clean energy and unused energy. Miners do not tend to cluster in locations with existing high energy costs, which would suggest high usage, because it’s just not economical to do&nbsp;so.</p><p>For a carefully footnoted look at the overall problems with the framing of blockchain energy arguments, especially in relationship to Bitcoin, see our article, “<a href="https://medium.com/p/ba830d6df104">Bitcoin: What are the Real&nbsp;Costs?</a>”</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/clean-titles/bitmark-blockchain-energy-usage-q-a-aeda13537228">Bitmark Blockchain: Energy Usage Q&amp;A</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/clean-titles">Bitmark’s Official Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The March 2021 edition of Fission's monthly Demo Day covered updates and demos from Fission, an overview of how we use IPFS, and demos from TiddlyWiki and IndyWiki.</p> How does Fission use IPFS? <p>We covered a brief intro to the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) as part of our demo day. We had a lot of interest in our recent <a href="https://blog.fission.codes/ipfs-local-offline-collaboration-sig/">presentation to the IPFS Local Offline Collab group</a>, and so decided to talk a bit more about how we use IPFS and why it's important to us.</p> User Domains and Public File Sharing Link Types <p>Every Fission user account has a custom domain at <code>USERNAME.fission.name</code>. For files that are stored in a user's public folder, they can access them using a consistent link using their own subdomain.</p><p>Brian from our team gave a demo and explanation of the different types of links that are available, as well as a small piece of example code showing how this works.</p><p>Visit the <a href="https://benevolent-senior-pink-yeti.fission.app/">benevolent-senior-pink-yeti </a>to get all the links to sample code and to experiment with the live demo yourself.</p> Linking Fission Accounts on Desktop <p>People can link accounts between browsers and devices today. Developers use the command line interface (CLI) use developer-only accounts that can't currently link to the web. Our CTO Brooklyn gave a preview of how CLI linking will work.</p><p>When this is released, it also opens the door for desktop-based file syncing and many other features, so we're excited to have this close to release.</p> Community Demos <p>Below is the full video for March 2021 Demo Day. Unfortunately, because we had an accident with recording, we managed to not capture a big chunk of the middle of the demos. In particular, Jeremy's TiddlyWiki static file publishing demo!</p><p>Join us this week, <a href="https://lu.ma/5j50g810">Wednesday, March 24th, for a TiddlyWiki Community Chat</a>, where we'll showcase current features and progress of <a href="https://tiddlywiki.fission.app">TiddlyWiki on Fission</a>.</p><p>Gyuri, who can follow online as <a href="https://twitter.com/Trailmarks">@TrailMarks on Twitter</a>, gave us a brief demo and overview of <a href="https://indywiki.fission.app/">IndyWiki</a>.</p><p>The full slide deck is <a href="https://presentations.fission.app/demodays/2021-03-18-fission-demoday.pdf">available here as a PDF »</a></p><p>Thanks to everyone for coming, including brief reports from Neil and Jim on what they're working on at the moment!</p> <p>We do weekly tech talks most Thursdays, as well as our monthly Demo Days. <a href="https://lu.ma/fission">Sign up to get invited to future events »</a></p>

 Transcription: 
<p>Mathieu Glaude: Okay. We are live. Thank you, Adrian, for doing this with me today.</p>
<p>Adrian Doerk: Hello, Mathieu – it’s a pleasure!</p>
 INTRO 
<p>Mathieu Glaude: Adrian – would you mind just giving a brief introduction and speak about how you got into self-sovereign identity?</p>
<p>Adrian Doerk: Yeah, sure. I’m Adrian. I’m 27, and I’m originally from Germany.</p>
<p>I have a technical background and a business degree, but I first heard about self-sovereign identity as an intern at HTC Exodus in Taiwan, where I did my internship. While I was there, I met Phil Chen, who told me about the emerging concepts of self-sovereign identity and surveillance capitalism.</p>
<p>I was fascinated by both topics, and then, roughly two years ago, I specialized more deeply on the subject of self-sovereign identity. Since then, quite a lot has happened. I converted my YouTube channel (my personal educational platform) from a rather crypto-wallet-focused track to focusing solely on the topic of self-sovereign identity. That’s how the <a href="https://twitter.com/SSI_Ambassador">SSI Ambassador channel</a> was born, more or less. Now, I’m also doing public relations and taking the lead on communication topics at <a href="https://idunion.org/">ID union</a>. I’m also involved in marketing and sales at Lissi.</p>
<p>Mathieu Glaude: Awesome. The topic of surveillance capitalism is one reason why many of the folks in our communities got into decentralized technologies, whether it’s crypto-wallets or even simply decentralized identity. When you first got into the SSI space, did you spend time on specific projects before getting into Lissi and ID union? I believe you also spent some time at Sovrin. Is that true?</p>
<p>Adrian Doerk: Yeah, that’s correct. Back then, it was probably the easiest way to get your hands dirty on the topic. I joined the ‘Business of SSI’ working group at Sovrin, and I was fascinated with all the different developments going on. I very much felt included by the Sovrin community. It was a fantastic starting point to get familiar with all the topics and to take a role contributing to some papers and other activities.</p>
<p>Mathieu Glaude: While you were doing that, were you part of the Main Incubator at that time? Does that cross a similar timeline?</p>
<p>Adrian Doerk: No. Back then, the Main Incubator was already researching the topic, but they were not necessarily speaking publicly about it. That was when I was still working in Taiwan, so I didn’t actually know that the Main Incubator team was engaged in their research at that time.</p>
<p>Mathieu Glaude: Got it. When you got into the Main Incubator, was it more from a blockchain or crypto standpoint?</p>
<p>Adrian Doerk: They approached me directly on the topic of SSI. I’d like to say a couple of words about the Main Incubator here. Essentially, the Main Incubator GmbH is the Research and Development unit of Commerzbank. We are a 100% subsidiary. We do venture capital for small companies in the finance sector that could be integrated into Commerzbank. We also do prototyping, which encompasses the work at Lissi and the whole topic of decentralized identity. There are community activities, such as our “Quantum Circle” or “Between the Towers.” We look into a lot of different topics. The whole issue of digital identity was one topic that was explored roughly three to four years ago. The ongoing developments were introduced and reviewed at the blockchain summit at Deutsche Bahn, which is the largest German railway company.</p>
<p>Obviously, I was super interested and immediately booked my ticket to go to Frankfurt and listen. Then, I wrote an article about Lissi without being a part of the team because I was just interested in the topic as part of the work I did as SSI Ambassador. The conversation continued, and at one point, we decided it would make sense to collaborate and push the topic forward together.</p>
 LISSI 
<p>Mathieu Glaude: That’s great. For folks that aren’t familiar with Lissi, <a href="https://lissi.id/">Lissi</a> is an output of the Main Incubator. Do you mind just explaining a little more about what Lissi is?</p>
<p>Adrian Doerk: At Main Incubator, we took a more in-depth look into how to jumpstart the whole topic of self-sovereign identity. We decided to take a look first at what frameworks exist. Hyperledger Indy and Hyperledger Aries, which we currently build on, is just one example out of many. Back then, there were several other different frameworks out there, such as <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/">Ethereum</a> or <a href="https://erc725alliance.org/">ERC 725</a>, which nobody is talking about at the moment. They had done the research and a deep dive on that. Then they reached out to collaborate with players who had selected the same technological frameworks. Since we have the same research approach and the same topic we need experience in, why not collaborate?</p>
<p>On the subject of digital identity, it makes sense to step out of your own silo and actually approach other players. There were some big-name players who were active in the field at that time, such as the Federal Printing Office of Germany (the Bundesdruckerei) and Bosch, and esatus AG, and other players. That’s how the first research initiative was jumpstarted. We were looking for a name, and we chose the acronym “Let’s Initiate Self-Sovereign Identity” — in short, LISSI. So that’s how Lissi was born.</p>
<p>In a stroke of luck, the innovation competition of the German government came up at the same time. The competition is called “Showcase Programme for Secure Digital Identities” or “Schaufenster Sichere Digitale Identitäten” in German. Basically, the government said, “Hey, we have a problem.” Or rather, we need <a href="https://northernblock.io/">a solution for digital identities</a>, which works with international standards, is interoperable, and which will enable people to control their own identity without being exposed to all the surveillance going on.</p>
<p>We applied to the competition with our concepts, and we said, “Lissi is more a software project, where we actually developed software together. We need an ecosystem that Lissi can live within.” And this ecosystem enables Lissi to then build on it. The ecosystem we applied to was IDunion.</p>
<p>We were part of the first phase of the innovation competition. Now, we’ve applied for a second phase, and we hope that everything goes smoothly so that we can begin in three weeks, which is April 2021. With the second phase, we would be able to start for free with a full year of funding, with 30 players from the public and private sector in IDunion.</p>
<p>So things have moved pretty fast and gotten pretty big. We’re really looking forward to that. It’s amazing what’s going on right now.</p>
 INTERNATIONALIZATION CHALLENGES 
<p>Mathieu Glaude: Yeah. I had Andre from esatus AG on the podcast a couple of episodes ago. Honestly, from my perspective here in Canada looking at what’s happening within the German ecosystem overall, it’s incredible to see the traction coming from both the private sector and the public sector in Germany. In particular, I’m looking at the investment that is going into strong digital identities and decentralized identities.</p>
<p>I’ll get back to IDunion in a minute, but I wanted to touch on one of the things you hadn’t mentioned within Lissi. One of the objectives of Lissi is all-around usability, right? When we talk about the internationalization of <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-digital-wallet/">SSI digital wallets</a>, I’d like to hear from someone who has spent more time thinking about the challenge of internationalization. It’s one thing to simply label your wallet and the buttons in the wallet and different static content in the wallet, all in a specific language. Lissi supports 12 languages, which is incredible. But, how do you look at internationalization beyond just flipping content?</p>
<p>It seems that content is one issue. But, when you actually get down into exchanging credentials in the different protocols, you need to deal with credential schemas, attributes, and much more. What are your thoughts on drilling internationalization all the way down to these levels?</p>
<p>Adrian Doerk: Okay. First, I want to give more context around the products we have or the solutions we offer at Lissi. We have one product, the Lissi wallet for end-consumers, which they can use on their smartphone as an app to store digital credentials and to interact with third parties. The other software we offer is for big institutions, so it’s an on-premise solution. It can be hosted in their own environment in order to establish connections, send credentials, or ask for them. Concerning the internationalization of all the products, it’s obviously not easy when talking about digital identity because it highly depends on the context at hand. As an example, we are familiar with green buttons on a touch-screen. Green is associated with something that works or that is supposed to “go.” On the other hand, red signals danger or “stop.” However, that’s all solely from a western perspective, which can be completely different for other cultures. This is just one out of many examples.</p>
<p>Colour is one example, and this continues with the use of gender in text, left-to-right or right-to-left writing direction. We face other issues around the information density of languages, the use of tenses, and so on. By translating our wallet into 12 different languages, we’ve already faced a number of these challenges.</p>
<p>We’re presently engaged in discussion with the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>, or DIF. Periodically, we have a product manager call, which I’m one of two to co-organize. In the calls, we discuss all these different challenges that we face as product managers. Specifically, we talk about how do we design the user experience? How can we make sure that the information lives within the credential so that the attributes are fully understandable in other contexts and other languages, as well?</p>
<p>For another example, I could get a good grade at university, marked as a “One,” which is the best grade in Germany. But then, maybe we go to a whole different country, with a different grading system. Nobody there actually knows what “One” means. In other regions, maybe letters are used instead. We know that this is information that needs to be transmittable, and the semantics need to be understandable from one context to another. We see that there are many challenges with that, but I think they are solvable challenges, now that we have the foundation to build on, and we’re able to go deeper into details.</p>
<p>Mathieu Glaude: Got it. A lot of the contextualization you’re talking about has to do with UX flows, in general, to be supported not only by different languages but also by different cultures.</p>
<p>Here in Canada, we have two national languages: English and French, and we see some similar challenges. However, when we take a step back to a broader view, beyond talking about specific cultures, I do understand that in terms of contextualization, there’s a lot more that goes into it. At the Decentralized Identity Foundation, you’re focused on UX flows.</p>
<p>Do you give similar considerations to other issues, such as creating backup mechanisms or similar requirements? Would you mind talking a little more about the work that’s going on there?</p>
<p>Adrian Doerk: It’s funny that you mentioned the backup mechanism because that’s exactly what we’re talking about right now. We have a call every second Wednesday, and we recently discussed all the different backup mechanisms. For example, the classic approach with mnemonic seeds. That is, we use 12 words, which you write down — that’s probably the method that most people familiar with if you have been in blockchain and cryptocurrencies. That option can obviously be used for SSI as well. However, we all know that this isn’t the most user-friendly approach, and there are significant drawbacks to that solution. So, we have to think about other ways; for example, social key recovery, or device-based recovery. All of these other mechanisms have certain advantages but also certain drawbacks.</p>
<p>Let’s take a deeper look into what the drawbacks are: How can we integrate them? What are the best solutions for companies or end consumers? Even then, for the end consumer, what is the best solution for my grandmother or my mother, who might not be too comfortable around digital devices?</p>
<p>We have to find solutions that work for everyone. They have to work well in a range of situations. The highly decentralized ‘maximalism’ crowd wants to store all their data on their devices with everything under their control, but the solutions have to be easy to use. There might even be a third party who is acting as a guardian in order to restore all the information. I think that in the end, we won’t have one single solution or backup solution. We have to make sure that we have different solutions available for different target audiences. We must consider the needs of any given group and then find a suitable solution for it.</p>
<p>Mathieu Glaude: Yeah. A lot of the problems apply directly to crypto as well, right? When you have that self-sovereignty, whether it’s over your identity data, your digital credentials, your digital native assets, or over different crypto assets, you have all the power in the world. It all comes down to effectively managing your keys.</p>
<p>There are a lot of similarities between the two worlds there, for sure. Jumping back now, we talked about Lissi and some of these announcements that LISSI is helping contribute to. That is, we spoke about terms of contextualization and internationalization, backups and mechanisms, and other topics regarding the Decentralized Identity Foundation.</p>
<p>Am I correct to say that Lissi is more of an international play, whereas IDunion is more specific to the German market, or potentially the EU?</p>
<p>Adrian Doerk: Yes. With Lissi, we want to make sure that this is a product that institutions from all around the world can use.</p>
<p>So, Lissi has a quite international focus. With respect to IDunion, we’re very German-driven for now and have German funding. We have a clear European focus, so we see that there needs to be a European solution. I’m not saying that IDunion will be the solution. It is only one way of doing things. We’ll see how things develop with the European blockchain service infrastructure, and other European SSI initiatives from other member States.</p>
<p>However, the final solution we go to, we say, “Okay, in the end, it’s all about governance.” Who controls it? Who can say how? What are the rules? And so on… There shouldn’t be a single entity that dictates the rules. We need to find a form of governance that can be influenced by all of the stakeholders involved – a very democratic approach.</p>
<p>So, we formed a European co-operative. That’s what we were planning when we founded that legal entity as the governance body to control the network. In that way, we can represent the interests of the sum of all members.</p>
<p>We took a long time to get deep into the nitty-gritty details of all the different aspects, which you need to consider when signing a governance framework. We spoke with lawyers and all the various stakeholders involved to make sure that we have a solid framework.</p>
<p>We’re at the stage of finalizing the legal documents. We’re looking forward to making the information and activity accessible to a broader audience. Then, we can found the European co-operative to ensure that we have a network that can run in a productive state.</p>
<p>Mathieu Glaude: Got it. In my opinion, we’re seeing a trend where different public identity utilities are popping up throughout the world, and they’re taking more consideration about localization, and better alignment to different data privacy laws. In the discussions before starting IDunion, were those things considered? Europe’s data privacy laws are world-leading and innovative. With the <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> (General Data Protection Regulation) in place, are these major considerations for public identity utilities (or just blockchain projects in general) in Germany?</p>
 IMPACT OF PRIVACY REGULATION 
<p>Adrian Doerk: I would say that there are two regulations in particular, which are very important. One, which you already mentioned, is the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, and the other one is the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/trust-services-and-eid">eIDAs</a>, or the electronic Identification and Authorization trust services regulation. Both regulations are really having a big impact, not only on the European Union but also on a broader regulatory landscape in an international context.</p>
<p>Obviously, it’s very important to make sure that whatever you’re building is fully compliant with the regulations at hand. This was a big part of the decision to have a European governance infrastructure. Another reason we decided to go for a European co-operative is that we wanted to have a level playing field for all different companies or public stakeholders in the European Union. We want them to be comfortable that this is not a German foundation that is really close to German law, which might create an entry barrier for them to participate. That’s the primary reason why we went for this quite specialized European co-operative.</p>
<p>I believe there are 35 which exist, so this is not something common. It’s something that is relatively new and hasn’t been explored or leveraged yet.</p>
<p>Mathieu Glaude: You wrote about that in a document that you contributed to the Trust over IP’s utility foundry working groups. There’s more information in there if folks are interested in learning about that. I know you’re active on social media about this topic as well.</p>
<p>Let’s switch gears. You did an interview with Tim Bouma last year. Tim is a thought leader, not only in the Canadian market (he’s part of the Canadian federal government) but internationally as well. There was a research question that you asked him concerning the growth factors of SSI solutions in Europe. The way Tim explained that was quite similar to the way that we’ve approached decentralized technology, crypto and blockchain. In general, end-users don’t really understand the plumbing. They probably shouldn’t fully understand it either. The growth is going to come from the plumbing; it’s going to come from the standards; it’s going to come from technology. It’s not stuff that the users need to be aware of. So, you have a Twitter account as <a href="https://twitter.com/SSI_Ambassador">SSI Ambassador</a> and a presence online where you’re strongly pushing education for the <a href="https://northernblock.io/removing-roadblocks-to-ssi-adoption/">adoption of self-sovereign identity</a>.</p>
<p>What made you get into doing this type of promotion through SSI Ambassador, and what topics are you preaching that are gaining a lot of traction?</p>
 SSI AMBASSADOR &amp; COMMUNITY SUPPORT 
<p>Adrian Doerk: That was a lot of different questions. Maybe I’ll begin with the SSI Ambassador.</p>
<p>I’m actually not too sure what the future plan is, in general. For now, the activity I’m doing is mainly providing content on Twitter, which is primarily educational. I can point to or share from people who wrote or have an opinion about SSI. I’ll quote them and say, “Hey, that’s what he or she is saying.” I want to give everybody a voice within their community without trying to be biased, which can be relatively tricky. I’m trying to make sure that you have one point of contact that you can follow and get different (and maybe critical) perspectives on SSI. So, you don’t have to follow two or three or 400 different people to get a sneak peek and insight into what’s going on. There’s no business model behind it; it’s a private endeavour for me.</p>
<p>I also write articles. I try to summarize different information about what’s going on in the community. I’ll quote people and point to resources and sources that are available. That was part of that interview with Tim Bouma because they developed the <a href="https://northernblock.io/digital-identity-in-canada/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a>.</p>
<p>It’s pretty impressive! They took it quite far in terms of how to approach the subject from a technology-agnostic perspective. I think we can all learn a lot from the Canadian approach. In the end, we have so many different aspects we need to consider that it’s really difficult to follow everything that’s going on. I hope I can make it a little bit easier for people to find relevant resources.</p>
<p>Mathieu Glaude: I would say that you definitely do. You make it very easy. For someone who’s just getting into the space, it’s a little tough at times; there’s so much stuff going on. Even for those of us who are in this space, seeing all the different initiatives, and working groups, and standards, and all the different things that are being worked on. It’s crazy; there’s so much stuff that is happening. There’s so much action, there’s so much momentum, but just keeping up with the activity is a challenge on its own. For someone just getting into this space or getting into the crypto space, you realize: “Oh, what have I gotten into here?”</p>
<p>How would you, for example, explain decentralized identifiers to a beginner without going into too much detail about any technology or standards?</p>
<p>Adrian Doerk: Basically, an identifier is something that connects you to a specific system. My classic identifier is a telephone number, or an email address, or anything that might be unique and associated with you as a person. For many systems, this identifier is given to you or at least managed by a central authority, as is the case for emails or telephone numbers.</p>
<p>The idea for a decentralized identifier is that you can create your own identifier, give it to somebody and say, “Hey, if you want to talk to me, just use this identifier, and you’re sure that you will end up in my wallet. And then we can talk.</p>
<p>Mathieu Glaude: Right. The other part is that once we have that secure, private, direct two-way connection between two entities, we can now exchange verifiable information. That’s where the verifiable credential conversation comes in.</p>
<p>Adrian Doerk: Yes. Once you’ve established an encrypted, private peer-to-peer connection through the decentralized identifier, you can use this communication channel to exchange all sorts of information. It doesn’t need to be a verified source of information like a verified credential but can also be self-attested. It can also be a check or PDF document. The possibilities are quite endless.</p>
<p>Mathieu Glaude: For sure. One of the reasons that led me personally into the self-sovereign identity space is the need to have verifiable data while maintaining the privacy-by-design and consent-driven interactions. We need to have this verifiable data in a decentralized manner that supports the centralized system. So, if I’m building a decentralized supply chain system, for example, I need to meet certain compliance requirements. I need to meet certain access and rule provisioning requirements if I’m going to onboard someone to this ecosystem solution for the supply chain.</p>
<p>It’s one thing to say, “Yeah, this is a very interesting model. Through this type of solution, we could create tons of transparency and traceability in a certain supply chain, that ultimately will benefit the end-user in many different ways.” But, to actually make that work, potentially in the world of government, you need to adhere to certain rules and regulations.</p>
<p>That’s what I got quite excited about: “Hey, look at this model with <a href="https://northernblock.io/verifiable-credentials-for-fintech/">decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials</a>.” Now, all of a sudden, this looks very complementary to these decentralized systems, whether it’s the supply chain or whether it’s crypto, whether it’s a decentralized browser like Brave.</p>
<p>You have been on both sides of the fence. Do you see that marriage between both being quite exciting?</p>
 DECENTRALIZED IDENTITY AND CRYPTO 
<p>Adrian Doerk: I think it’s really the connection between both, as you said. On one side, you have the whole decentralization crowd with <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/">Bitcoin</a> maximalists and so on. On the other, higher, side you have the institutions, which are quite conservative; they don’t want to actually commit to things they aren’t sure about. They’re rather risk-averse, and to bring them together is the challenge we have here. We have some very strong base layers: the infrastructure, the standardization formats for our credentials, and the IDs, but also protocols with Bitcoin, for example. We can bring the players together to say, “Okay, this is common infrastructure, which we have standardized at an international level, and now we can use it to do whatever we need.”</p>
<p>Looking at use cases, we have almost no limit in terms of what we can do with it. Whether it’s a natural person, a legal entity, or an IOT (<a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/internet-of-things-what-is-explained-iot">Internet Of Things</a>) device — you can use it for all of that. In the end, it comes down to getting the rubber on the road and merely starting with it.</p>
<p>Right now, it’s the time to explore and make different pilots possible, reflecting the interests of all the different public and private stakeholders. It’s amazing to see that they are willing to commit resources, not only financially but also to re-contribute to the open-source repository, for example.</p>
<p>We see that they clearly have the need and the vision to make it possible to have decentralized identities and the variables to enable their use for different use cases.</p>
<p>Mathieu Glaude: I love that. As you said, on the one side, you have the maximalists. I laughed at one of your tweets recently where you said people were basically tweeting about the price of (I quote) “insert any cryptocurrency here.”</p>
<p>It doesn’t provide any value. There are these people on one side that are just maximalist, maximalist, maximalist, or just people trying to pump and not really adding value. But on the other side, there’s valid interest in crypto. There’s real interest in government-issued currencies. There’s real interest in NFTs (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/non-fungible-tokens-nft-5115211">Non-Fungible Tokens</a>) that we see now, where there’s a lot of pumping happening there too. I really like how you look at it, where you have the common infrastructure that’s able to bring both sides together.</p>
<p>If all these projects happening are successful, if they’re NFTs or whatever we’re talking about, do you think these will gain adoption at the same time as SSI is gaining adoption? It seems as though there’s an opportunity for them to fuel each other.</p>
<p>Adrian Doerk: Yeah, I would say so as well. They’re complementary, but it strongly depends on what you want to use them for. For example, if you want to use NFT to really solve digital identity, then let’s be honest. It’s not going to happen because NFTs are not built for privacy from the design aspects.</p>
<p>We saw that with a lot of people who put their Ethereum name system tag up on Twitter, for example. Anyone can see what they’re doing, what transactions they’re making, what NFTs they bought, and so on. That’s not a desirable call, right?</p>
<p>That’s not something we want. People tend to start using it, and then, in the end, they say, “Oh, damn it. Now everybody in the world can see what transactions I make, when I bought a certain object and so on.” That’s obviously not something we want, so it depends on what you’re going to use it for.</p>
<p>There is a niche or a demand for certain use cases when the time comes to jump to NFTs, or other cryptocurrency applications which combine with digital identity. But, it’s difficult to say now where that use case will be, because I’m not so deep into the whole NFT topic as I used to be.</p>
<p>I have some crypto Pokémons; I forget the name of which ones. I experimented with that a couple of years ago. But, I haven’t been able to deep dive on the topic recently due to all the different activities going on.</p>
<p>Mathieu Glaude: I’m with you on that, too. I was deep in the crypto world a few years ago and still have excellent visibility. But then the whole yield-farming stuff was happening last year, and now just the craziness that’s taking place around NFTs. You understand what’s going on, but it’s just pure craziness. That’s the type of thing that happens with these subjects. Every year, there seems to be a new hyped-up thing within the whole crypto world.</p>
<p>Adrian Doerk: One more statement about these kinds of crypto projects: I see some projects working to solve this kind of digital identity issue, and they use a token. Having a token is not the problem. Rather, having a token which you can invest and speculate on and which is connected to your identity, that’s a problem. We don’t want to have an ecosystem where people have a financial incentive to comment below. They may have a stake of some kind, a portfolio investment, or they’re short-selling the token.</p>
<p>When it comes to digital identity, I personally try hard to avoid any project which has a speculative token.</p>
<p>Mathieu Glaude: If you think about Ethereum, there are a lot of different digital identity projects happening around Ethereum. Uport is one of the ones you mentioned earlier. There are many different ERC standards (Ethereum Request for Comments), such as the 725 one that’s used for digital identity smart contracts.</p>
<p>Do you look at that the same way? If you use something like Ethereum as a public utility for your identity, does that mean there’s speculation happening on Ethereum?</p>
<p>Adrian Doerk: That’s something different again because Ethereum is obviously not built to solve digital identity. It’s so much more, and digital identity is just a small part of it.</p>
<p>We see the Ceramic network, and they’re trying to solve the whole topic of digital identity, but I think it’s more about the issue of reputation instead of digital identity. There’s always this line that you need to draw. When do you say if a particular project does something positive or negative, because you’ve invested in it? At a certain point, it’s really difficult to draw that line. I’m not quite sure where to draw the line with Ethereum.</p>
<p>I’ve recently seen that with other digital identity projects using a token. I don’t think that makes any sense because you can have a situation where bots are simply spamming comments on Twitter, using the hashtag of the token. That doesn’t get us anywhere; it makes things worse.</p>
<p>Mathieu Glaude: I think a lot of the time, people come from the wrong side of things. They’re coming from the solution standpoint rather than from the problem side. It drives an approach to say, “Hey, we have the solution to everything. It’s decentralization, and let’s try to fit in everything to that model.” That’s a common problem we see over and over again.</p>
<p>But you touched upon reputation there. I’m curious to know – what are your thoughts on reputation for identity overall?</p>
 REPUTATION 
<p>Adrian Doerk: Trust is something that you build over time. Essentially, that’s the same thing as reputation. Ultimately, you have a new partner that you want to do business with, and you want to know, can I trust this person? The question is does this person or business have a reputation that gives me a reason to trust them, and actually engage in business activity.</p>
<p>You can build this reputation over time, through records. Ethereum might be a good solution for that. For example, if I can prove it through three years of constant updates to a contract with me as a business. It’s also possible that we could do audits, as well.</p>
<p>We can say that all these separate points accumulate to build my reputation on the system. And then you can use this reputation to engage in other conversations. It would be very valuable to have something like that. I think we still need to talk about that more as an SSI topic because we don’t talk about that so much at this time.</p>
<p>We talk about verified credentials, and active disclosure and so on. Reputation is a track record that you can show, which then might be embedded in all your credentials. In my opinion, this is an area that needs to be explored as a community.</p>
<p>Mathieu Glaude: Potentially, it doesn’t necessarily need to be all decentralized solutions either, right? We have the core of owning and managing your own data and all that. If it’s consented to, and you’re following the right principles, you could potentially use a centralized reputational system; if it gives you the benefits that you want, and you have transparency into what’s happening.</p>
<p>Adrian Doerk: Yes, it will be naive to think that we’ll have a full <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-enterprise-cloud/">decentralized ecosystem</a> in the end. It will be a combination of centralized components and decentralized components and obviously something in between — a hybrid.</p>
<p>We need to make both worlds able to co-exist simultaneously and to build bridges that connect them. Then, as an individual, as a company, or as a public stakeholder, you can choose to use whatever solution suits your needs best.</p>
<p>Mathieu Glaude: Exactly. For the institutions, you’re talking about creating a bridge, or SSI infrastructure could build a bridge between the institution’s needs and their ability to partake in this new digital or decentralized centralized economy at times. There needs to be a proper way to mix both together. For example, for a financial institution to do business, they’re regulated in a way that constrains them to do things in certain ways. Data needs to be stored in specific ways. They need to do certain types of reporting and have access to certain types of things. So, it’s silly to think everything could be dis-intermediated and decentralized, if there are valid other solutions that emerge. The way the world works today is that we have nation-states that are governing the states. We’re simply going to have to find a way to fit it into that environment.</p>
<p>Adrian Doerk: Yes. This co-existence is super important, and also we need to integrate all the different protocols that are still existing, such as Open ID Connect, for example. Obviously, these are the bridges that we need to build in order to connect to the existing world.</p>
<p>Mathieu Glaude: I was curious about another tweet you had made, and I’d like to pick your brain on it. To quote you, you said, “It’s just a matter of time until the decentralized identity technology will be abused by an authoritarian dictatorship. However, this won’t happen with self-sovereign identity because it’s a philosophy and not a technology.”</p>
<p>Would you mind expanding on that tweet?</p>
<p>Adrian Doerk: Yeah, that’s maybe a controversial statement. But, essentially, when we take a look into the technology, it’s just a tool. You can use it however you want. If there exists a government, a party, or a stakeholder, who may not have the best interests for the people around you, then the technology can be abused</p>
<p>We see that with a lot of surveillance going on. Why not use decentralized technology, and tweak it a little bit in your favour? For example, if people cannot choose their own decentralized identifier, but instead, you simply provide them with one, then it’s possible to control many aspects within the system. If it’s implemented in that way, then you can actually assert control instead of providing control.</p>
<p>This is true for all technologies, right? It’s not a unique issue for the stuff we’re building. The same is certainly true for artificial intelligence, quantum computing, or whatever other hyped-up technology you have right now. However, in my opinion, that won’t happen to self-sovereign identity because it’s a way of thinking. It’s not a way of implementing technology; instead, it’s a way of asking the right questions in terms of “how can we protect the individual?” How can we ensure we have trusted relationships between two parties so that as a society, we can work together and have interactions and relationships that are meaningful, without total surveillance and controlling of every aspect of a citizen’s life?</p>
<p>Mathieu Glaude: Yeah, I’m aligned to that. With the right foundational standards and norms and principles, then you’re able to build properly. By using a mindset where no matter what standards, norms, principles, and so forth that you had established, there won’t be an opportunity to bypass those, and you’re really building everything around that concept.</p>
<p>To close up here, Adrian: the last question or topic I wanted to ask you is: what excites you most at the moment? There are tons of activities happening; you’re involved in all sorts of different forums and with various projects. There are tons of use cases coming up that are being built around verified or verifiable people, and around verifiable organizations. There’s the whole IOT space, which is something different. What excites you the most right now about what’s happening in the space?</p>
<p>Adrian Doerk: As you said, there’s so much going on, and I could talk for three hours about all of the amazing projects which are happening right now.</p>
<p>For me, it’s quite a personal perspective, obviously, and I really enjoy seeing the public and private stakeholders come together and collaborate. You can see it here in Germany, with IDunion, and also with a lot of other projects. Not only in Europe, but also worldwide; all the different stakeholders are coming together, and that’s something that’s really good to see, because then we have ready solutions which can be put into production. Then, we’ll have use cases and so on.</p>
<p>Something else that I’m keen to see is that we have the first SSI digital wallets with more than 100,000 users. I think that will be a really big use case coming up, maybe as early as this year. So we have this significant need for a solution that everyone agrees will be the best solution for how to approach the problem. At that point, we’ll see a huge inflow of people who actually use the products and components in a real-life scenario. I think that we’ll see that leap this year.</p>
<p>Mathieu Glaude: Yeah, I think so too. It’s definitely coming, and there’s so much momentum going in that direction. So I’ll end it on that, Adrian.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for doing this with me today. Much appreciated. I really enjoyed the conversation.</p>
<p>Adrian Doerk: Yeah, it was very nice, Mathieu. Thank you for the invite.</p>

 KILT Protocol in the Real World — Machine&nbsp;Identity <p>KILT is a blockchain protocol for issuing decentralised identifiers and verifiable credentials. KILT brings the old process of trust in real-world credentials (passport, driving licence, certificates, etc.) to the digital world, representing your identity while keeping your data private and in your possession.</p><p>But KILT Protocol is not just for people. It can be used for machines, services and anything that identities can be built on,&nbsp;too.</p> Machine Identity <p>Identity is multifaceted, made up of a unique combination of characteristics, attributes and properties that distinguish a person or object from&nbsp;others.</p><p>At KILT we break identity down into two key components:</p>  A decentralised identifier (DID), which uniquely identifies an entity or device,&nbsp;and  Verifiable, revocable credentials that are confirmed by trusted parties (“attesters”).  <p>In machine identity, these credentials would be the static and dynamic properties of the device, such as certificates, rights, roles or capabilities.</p><p>In order to add credentials to its identifier (DID), the device could create a claim that it wants to have confirmed by an attester. The attester would check that the attributes are correct and if they are, would send a credential back to the device, which would store it under its control. Additionally, the attester anchors the validity of the credential by creating a hash out of the credential that represents the credential on the blockchain.</p><p>If the attributes change or become invalid, the attester could invalidate the credential on the blockchain. When the device presents a credential to a third party (verifier), the third party could check if the entity presenting the credential actually owns it, and could verify the validity of the credential on the blockchain.</p><p>Using the KILT Protocol, only a hash that represents the credential and its validity is ever recorded on the blockchain, not the full certificate itself. Thus, a minimum of data is stored to maximise privacy, anonymity and security. The attested certificate itself remains the property of the device and can only be read with the permission of the device&nbsp;owner.</p> Energy Efficiency <p>How could that be used in the real world? A current example is our collaboration with <a href="https://www.dena.de/en/home/">dena</a>, Germany’s federal energy&nbsp;agency.</p><p>In a move towards greater energy efficiency, dena initiated a project to create the Blockchain Machine Identity Ledger (BMIL), a decentralised digital registry to enable the integration of energy generating and energy consuming devices as active market participants.</p><p>To achieve this, assets such as energy meters, heat pumps, solar power systems, etc. could register their identity on the BMIL. As outlined above, this means that the device could generate an identifier in the form of a DID, with attributes assigned to this identifier as verifiable credentials whose validity is anchored on the BMIL as long as they meet the standards built into the system. More credentials could be added as needed, creating a digital identity.</p><p>These digital identities would allow data to be exchanged between the market participants and systems while meeting the required regulatory standards.The process contributes to the creation of the digital ledger as a dynamic registry of devices to be registered and have their data verified in a decentralised way. The owner of the unique identifier of each device could choose how much information is released by it, maintaining privacy and control over the&nbsp;data.</p><p>This pilot project provides the basis for building services and market-oriented applications, complementing the use of smart meters. The BMIL thus aims to coordinate and connect the rapidly increasing interfaces within the German energy system. In addition to being secure, reliable and traceable, the cost of sharing data could be kept&nbsp;low.</p> Cooperation <p>The dena project is being delivered by an alliance of 21 partners, made up of scientists, established players in the digital and energy sectors, and innovative blockchain startups like BOTLabs, the inventor of&nbsp;KILT.</p><p>KILT is participating as part of a consortium led by <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/2019/06/19/energy-web-foundation-launches-worlds-first-public-open-source-enterprise-grade-blockchain-tailored-to-the-energy-sector/">Energy Web Foundation</a>, a global non-profit organisation who use open-source technology to initiate a low carbon system that enables any energy asset owned by any customer to participate in any energy market. The Energy Web blockchain was launched in&nbsp;2019.</p><p>Other members of the consortium include <a href="https://www.riddleandcode.com/">Riddle &amp; Code</a>, <a href="https://www.50hertz.com/">50 Hertz</a>, and <a href="https://www.parity.io/">Parity Technologies</a>, the company behind the development of Substrate — the blockchain technology that KILT is built on — and Polkadot, a ground-breaking “blockchain of blockchains”.</p> Web 3.0 with&nbsp;KILT <p>This is just one example of the many ways KILT Protocol could be used to create digital identifiers and revocable, verifiable credentials while protecting the self sovereignty and anonymity of the data owner. We look forward to seeing how entrepreneurial developers use our universal protocol as blockchain technology moves into the next generation of the internet, Web 3.0, evolving beyond the hype to real-world uses.</p><p>We are proud to be part of the cutting edge of that revolution. In 2018 we were early adopters of Substrate, the modular system powered by Parity Technologies that makes it easy to build a customized blockchain using pre-built components. Substrate also allows seamless integration with Polkadot — an ecosystem of blockchains that overcomes the previous problems of security, scalability, and interoperability that have hampered blockchain adoption so far. Founded by Ethereum co-founder and former CTO Gavin Wood, Polkadot is paving the way for a new era of innovation.</p><p>In January 2021 KILT became one of the first projects in the world to join Rococo, the parachain testnet for the Polkadot ecosystem. When parachains have been fully tested and stabilised on Rococo and subsequently on Kusama, Polkadot’s canary network, we aim to participate in the first Kusama parachain auctions. We then intend to start our mainnet on Kusama shortly after securing a parachain slot to make our services available as soon as possible.</p><p>See our <a href="https://kilt-protocol.medium.com/kilts-path-to-parachains-ad3be644db8a">Path to Parachains article</a> for more details and <a href="https://www.kilt.io/learn/newsletter/">sign up for our newsletter</a> to stay up-to-date with developments as they&nbsp;occur.</p>

 5 Beauty ingredients you thought were&nbsp;clean <p>Clean Beauty is an up and coming industry with the potential to effect real, positive change. Unfortunately, many products branded as “clean beauty” contain hidden ingredients that negatively impact our health and the environment.</p><p>Here are five beauty care ingredients that you might not know are harmful to people and the&nbsp;planet.</p>  Exfoliating microbeads — many face washes and exfoliating body washes contain a plastic substance called polyethylene or microbeads. Microbeads are touted as good for your skin because they exfoliate to remove dead skin cells. Unlike natural exfoliants like salt that biodegrade, plastic microbeads cause <a href="https://cvskinlabs.com/7-cosmetic-ingredients-that-are-bad-for-the-environment/">real harm to the planet</a>. Although the beads are tiny, one container of facial cleanser can contain up to 350,000 beads! These beads accumulate in rivers, lakes, and oceans, causing plastic pollution.  <a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/six-skincare-ingredients-which-are-harming-the-environment">Triclosan</a> is “an antibacterial agent sometimes found in toothpaste, shampoo, soap, face wash, and hand sanitizer.” Not only does it have harmful effects on algae and aquatic bacteria, but it may also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6126357/">negatively impact human&nbsp;health</a>.  Synthetic fragrances can be found in almost every beauty product from shampoo to bronzer and they may contain any combination of bad ingredients. <a href="https://coconutsandkettlebells.com/10-harmful-ingredients-makeup-skincare-products/">The problem</a> with fragrance in beauty and skin care products is that manufacturers aren’t required to say exactly what is in it. They can simply say “parfum” or “fragrance,” which could contain carcinogens, allergens, endocrine disruptors, or irritants.  Oxybenzone and octinoxate are ingredients commonly found in sunscreen and are known to have <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/news/sunscreen-corals.html">harmful effects</a> on coral reefs and marine life. In January of this year, <a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=dc777751-66bf-4b68-abe4-3176bb93a589">Hawaii officially banned</a> the sale of over the counter sunscreens containing these ingredients, in an effort to preserve marine environments.  Last, but not least are Siloxanes, which are <a href="https://www.byrdie.com/toxic-beauty-ingredients-4782646">compounds found in many cosmetic and skincare products</a>. Not only have they been found to cause harm to the environment through bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms, but they have also been linked with <a href="https://davidsuzuki.org/queen-of-green/dirty-dozen-siloxanes/">endocrine disruption and fertility issues</a> in humans, making them a serious health&nbsp;concern.  <p>It is disappointing to learn how few regulations there are governing the beauty industry and manufacturers claiming to be “clean beauty” brands can get away with putting harmful ingredients in their products. <a href="https://www.greenamerica.org/green-living/ugly-side-cosmetics">According to the Environmental Working Group</a> “89 percent of 10,500 ingredients used in personal care products have not been evaluated for safety by the CIR, the FDA, nor any other publicly accountable institution.”</p><p>Thankfully, some companies are taking a stand to ensure that everything in their products are good for human health and the planet. Brands like <a href="https://www.drbronner.com/media-center/press-release/genuine-eco-friendly-brand-squeaky-clean-reputation/">Dr. Bronners </a>and <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2017/01/why-drunk-elephant-is-the-best-natural-skincare-line.html">Drunk Elephant </a>are paving the way in real clean beauty, ensuring that their products are free of any dangerous ingredients.</p><p>But how can serious clean beauty brands show customers that they are the real deal? Peer Ledger’s <a href="https://peerledger.com">MIMOSI Connect</a> empowers companies to uphold their social values and share proof of their responsible practices. We help companies prove not only what’s in the product, but where these ingredients came from. That’s not just good business, it’s good people and the&nbsp;planet.</p> References   Rebecca (April 18, 2016), 7 Cosmetic Ingredients that are Bad for the Environment, CV Skin Labs.

<p>When Kristy Kim moved to the U.S. with her family from South Korea, she worked hard to achieve the American Dream. But when she graduated from a top university and landed a high-paying job in investment banking, she realized her years of scrimping and saving didn’t pay off in one crucial way – she had no credit file, so she wasn’t eligible for a car loan. She had to pay cash.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now Kim has launched <a href="https://www.tomocredit.com/">TomoCredit Inc.</a>, a startup that uses with <a href="http://www.finicity.com/">Finicity’s</a> open banking platform to determine which applicants are qualified for credit, and how much credit to offer them. Traditionally, lenders use a credit score, but many people, including immigrants to the U.S. and young people, have not built up a credit history. TomoCredit’s research indicates that legacy lending policies keep 40 million people from accessing credit and the ability to build wealth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using consumer-permissioned real-time data from than 10,000 financial institutions, Finicity can help TomoCredit get a clearer picture of an applicant’s financial health, <a href="http://www.finicity.com/lend">improving risk assessment and credit decisioning</a>. Once approved, applicants receive a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210318005204/en/The-TomoCredit-Mastercard%C2%AE-Gives-Consumers-Access-to-Credit-Through-High-Limit-Offering-With-No-Fees-and-0-APR">TomoCredit Mastercard credit card</a> with no fees and 0% APR.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Enabling people to access and control their data, while ensuring best practices to protect both that data and the consumer, will continue to drive tremendous innovation that increases financial literacy, inclusion and health,” Finicity CEO Steve Smith says.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/kuppinger">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>This week, <a href="https://investors.sailpoint.com/news/2021/03-12-2021-140027735" title="SailPoint announced">SailPoint announced</a> their intent to acquire <a href="https://www.erpmaestro.com/" title="ERP Maestro">ERP Maestro</a>, a SaaS-based solution for monitoring SoD controls and manage access controls in business applications such as SAP. This announcement fits well into the SailPoint strategy of expanding their core offerings IdentityIQ and IdentityNow with additional SaaS services, such as AI-based identity analytics and, now, capabilities for in-depth management and control of access in business applications.</p>
 Acquisition will help SailPoint in further expanding their offerings for business applications 
<p>This acquisition also fits well into the SailPoint focus on managing users and their access across the entire lifecycle, and for all types of services. While SailPoint has been strong in managing SAP users and roles before, and also comes with considerable capabilities in SoD management, this acquisition will help them in further expanding their offerings for business applications.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the acquisition, once executed and once the two product sets are integrated, will give organizations an interesting option for a one-stop-shop for a solution that covers IGA (Identity Governance &amp; Administration, i.e., User Lifecycle Management, Identity Provisioning, and Access Governance) and delivers in depth SoD control and access control capabilities for environments containing business applications of various vendors.</p>
<p>While ERP Maestro’s biggest strength is in managing SAP environments, they also support some other business applications. SailPoint also provides support for a wide range of business applications.</p>
 Combining in-depth capabilities for ERP and core business applications serves current trends 
<p>With the business application landscape undergoing change, with SaaS offerings already playing a strong role in certain areas, and with a trend towards multi-vendor approaches for providing business applications, the combination of in-depth capabilities for ERP and other core business applications, and the breadth of supported systems SailPoint can offer, serves these trends well.</p>
<p>As for every acquisition, there is a need for unifying roadmaps and integrating the offerings, on which SailPoint must deliver. However, due to the specific strengths and focus of the existing solutions of both SailPoint and ERP Maestro, we see significant advantages in this strategy, and limited risk for existing customers of the companies.</p>
 CIOs should revisit their strategies around siloes of business applications 
<p>We recommend CIOs to revisit their strategies regarding access control, SoD control, and GRC for their business applications as well as their IT organizations, to reflect the move away from siloed solutions towards a more open ecosystem of business applications by various vendors, frequently deployed as SaaS.</p>

<p>The UEFA European Football Championship or the Euros is one of the most anticipated soccer competitions in Europe. The global sports betting volume is expected to increase massively – so providers have to ask themselves if they are ready to handle the player spike?</p>
<p>The global COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the growth of the online gambling sector drastically. With fans watching from home, many are looking to engage through sports betting. Operators around the world are reporting record-high player numbers. We at IDnow noticed a surge in player onboarding since the start of the pandemic in March 2020 with impressive peaks during Super Bowl (+ 175%) and big football matches like Bayern Munich v Borussia Dortmund (+ 340%) – and we are expecting an even higher demand during the Euros.</p>
<p>Operators need to get ready to handle the spike in demand and keep their players happy. We prepared a convenient Infographic to give you an overview of what’s on the horizon:</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/tolbert">John Tolbert</a></p><p>Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platforms are attracting a lot of attention from many organizations, from enterprises to government agencies and even those on the upper end of Small-to-Mid-Sized Businesses (SMBs). The reason for this is clear: the cybersecurity landscape continues to evolve and get more complex in order to combat the corresponding rise in frequency and complexity of attacks.</p>
<p>SOAR platforms can be the capstone application for Security Operations Centers (SOCs). Most organizations have a plethora of security tools already, such as Endpoint Protection/Detection &amp; Response (EPDR), Next Gen Firewalls (NGFWs), Network Detection &amp; Response (NDR), Secure Web Gateways (SWGs), Email Gateways, Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems, and so forth. SOC analysts have to interact with each of these systems in the course of daily management, investigations, and incident response. SOARs are designed to centralize many of the SOC analyst common and repetitive tasks, thereby decreasing the chance of errors and promoting efficiency.</p>
 From SIEM to SOAR 
<p>Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM) tools have been on the scene for more than 15 years. SIEMs are the central repositories that hold security log data from all the upstream security tools. SIEMs can catch the data but have historically had difficulties with enterprise-wide orchestration and generating false positives. SOAR solutions have filled some of the functional gaps, adding orchestration, automation of enrichment and investigations, and providing the capability of simplifying incident responses.</p>
<p>Many SOAR products originated from specialized startups addressing the gaps in SIEM tools. Some SIEM solutions have upgraded and added SOAR type functions to their platforms; other SIEM and security stack vendors have acquired SOAR specialist companies to augment their offerings in that way. In some cases, Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) management platforms have grown toward full SOAR capabilities. CTI management is a core feature of most SOAR tools, so this market development makes sense.</p>
 Orchestration and Automation 
<p>With a myriad of deployed security products in most SOCs, the lack of orchestration makes analysts’ work more arduous and time-consuming. Consider the following scenario. An analyst is alerted by EPDR via SOAR that registry entries have been added to a user’s workstation. These registry entries don’t match the baseline for deployed software within the organization; however, malware was not immediately detected. SOAR queries CTI and finds that these registry entries match newly discovered Indicators of Compromise (IoCs). SOAR can then automate a full scan on the affected machine and execute an enterprise-wide search for the same IoCs on all nodes.</p>
 Playbooks 
<p>Playbooks are the constructs that allow for default and customizable orchestration, automation, and response tasks. In the example above, the SOAR platform can profile the registry changes and query CTI sources to find out if others have encountered this type of event. SOAR can add the relevant CTI to the ticket for the analyst as it is opened and updated. Follow-up tasks such as the scans and multi-machine searches can be scripted in. Most SOAR solutions ship with dozens to hundreds of playbooks that address many of the common tasks that SOC analysts have to perform. Most SOAR playbooks are quite customizable, allowing customers to decide what level of automation they want to implement. Many organizations that use SOAR choose to automate preliminary investigation tasks and package response actions such that complex tasks can be reduced to a single analyst action. Another pertinent example would be allowing an analyst to remotely terminate network sessions to suspicious IP addresses while initiating scans and collecting file-level forensic evidence.</p>
 Integrations 
<p>Since SOAR must interact with various security data sources and downstream tools, integrations are the key. Integrations are typically packaged connectors that utilize APIs to pull information from and remotely command downstream security tools such as EPDR, NDR, NGFWs, etc. SOAR capabilities are constrained by the actions exposed by integrated tool APIs. When selecting a SOAR for your SOC, it is imperative to choose the vendor that has integrations for the tools you already have.</p>
 SOCs, SOC-as-a-Service, and MSSPs 
<p>Large organizations with mature security architectures and SOCs already in place can achieve a reasonably short time-to-value with SOAR implementations. Organizations that have SOCs but want to utilize outside help for SOAR functions, or those that want additional expertise may opt to use SOAR services delivered by Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs). Companies that do not have SOCs can still benefit from SOAR features if they engage SOC-as-a-Service solution providers. Many SOCaaS providers utilize SOAR products from the major vendors as a way to reduce the Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR) for security incidents for their customers. &nbsp;</p>

<p>	Many global small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have limited access to financing which creates an uneven playing field for those who cannot acquire traditional data. Those outside the US struggle to finance their endeavors due to lack of a credit score, SMEs are cornered into financing through alternative options with high-interest rates. On the flip side, these alternatives will struggle to effectively validate sellers and transactions, inevitably increasing the risk for all parties. These international buyers and sellers are who TrafiGuard lends its services. Built on 0x’s Bloom platform, TrafiGuard uses a form of self-sovereign identity to deliver its mission statement as the “[Global] Trade Finance Solution for Micro Small and SMEs”.</p><p>	The “solution” allows the buyer to deposit funds into the TrafiGuard smart contracts, which are locked in the <a href="http://compound.finance/">Compound</a> protocol via USDC to collect interest and provide collateral allowing the seller to take out a loan in its local currency. The process is as follows: First both the buyer and seller must connect with the TrafiGuard Smart Contract. Then the buyer is required to submit proof of their digital identity via encryption on Bloom. In order to secure the loan, however, the seller must prove they are valid and trustworthy through steps that will then be stored as proof in the blockchain. The first involves the seller submitting their Bloom decentralized ID and ‘credit score’.</p><p>	TrafiGuard bridges the gap between global SME financing and global, verified players by removing documents that are often barriers in determining how trustworthy the user is in relation to risk via Bloom. Users are able to track their Bloom-unique credit score, utilization, age of credit, payment history, and inquiries, similarly to how credit karma is structured except with inclusivity. This opportunity allows international SMEs to become stronger candidates for financing regardless of their country’s differing credit systems. This is also beneficial for buyers or lenders since they are able to access risk efficiently and with more accuracy through Bloom’s Truth Platform.</p><p>	Bloom’s Truth Platform is composed of Validator, SourceSpring, and SafeSwap, to attain cryptographically secure alternative solution to KYC/AML compliance for the digital age.</p><p>	The seller must provide approved income, tax returns, and any additional financials to the connected data providers. The third and fourth steps regard the actual shipment of goods, in which case the seller must provide a Bill of Lading verification and a voyage complete event for settlement. All proofs will be supplied via Chainlink oracles to the smart contract. Here, multiple protocols are executed to enact the process. The first being Bloom’s share kit and smart contract bridge, (Currently under development through the name ‘OnRamp’) handles validation and trustworthiness; Chainlink external adapters that supply proofs to the smart contract, compound CTokenhandler &amp; Comptroller, and USDC stable coin for money flows and lending. Sample transactions and references are documented on their GitHub page for those who are not well versed in blockchain.</p><p>	Once all these steps are completed, a risk score is calculated and depending on the score, the seller can take out a loan. The buyer deposits an amount of currency in USDC into the compound protocol. There it is locked, leaving it to accrue interest and be used as collateral for security purposes. The seller has the ability to take out a loan between 10% to 50% of the deposited collateral. Once the goods arrive at their destination, the deposited amount from the buyer will be cleared with the loan and sent to the seller, with the financial also taking a share.</p><p>	TrafiGuard’s system is redefining trade finance, especially for those who trade and finance on an international level. Bigger companies that were held back before are able to finance their businesses, leaving small and medium enterprises struggling to obtain a loan or paying high-interest fees. With multiple varied credit scoring systems, it becomes complicated to gauge how secure or risky a seller is and if the seller is truly who they say they are, resulting in SMEs being underfinanced with limited alternatives and buyers who are constantly taking uncalculated risks. TrafiGuard’s system, while it does require a certain degree of knowledge pertaining to blockchain and program development, is much more accessible and stricter with validation, resulting in buyers who feel more at ease with financing sellers, which in turn creates a flowing market.</p>

<p>When Elon Musk simply tweeted ‘Use Signal’, he put a megaphone to the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">global data privacy conversation</a>.</p>



<p>Musk’s tweet was in response to widespread outrage that the Facebook-owned instant messaging app WhatsApp was demanding its 2 billion-plus users consent to sharing their personal information, including their phone number, with Facebook and its subsidiaries or have their accounts deleted. WhatsApp set an initial deadline for user consent of February 8, 2021 but later pushed it to May 15 following widespread backlash.</p>



<p>Since Facebook is in the business&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">data surveillance</a>&nbsp;it shouldn’t have been a huge surprise when its instant messaging app wanted to change its user terms and privacy policy so it could share user data with its parent company for targeted ad and product experience purposes. In fact, WhatsApp has been sharing user data with Facebook since 2016 and hasn’t stopped, effectively breaking the 2014 promise that both companies made on Facebook’s acquisition of WhatsApp that the two services would remain separate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why this latest news of WhatsApp sharing data with Facebook has shocked and riled so many then is that, for some, it was the first time they’d realized it was even happening (despite it going on for four years). Further, many users and some media interpreted the changes to mean that WhatsApp and Facebook would now be able to access the&nbsp;content, including text and photos, of users’ private messages, and spotted that the original opt-out statement giving them the choice to not have their data shared was now missing from the revised privacy policy. Many users rightly or wrongly saw this latest move as yet another Facebook data sweep and a further hit to their increasingly vulnerable privacy. Fair enough. But the story is even bigger than that.</p>



<p>When WhatsApp announced its controversial privacy policy change in early January,&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">consumer tension</a>&nbsp;was already at boiling point over&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/fight-the-fatigue-data-privacy-really-does-matter/">data privacy</a>&nbsp;and Big Tech’s&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">increasing surveillance and use</a>&nbsp;of customer information.&nbsp;So when Elon Musk ‘suggested’ people use private messaging app Signal, its popularity skyrocketed, gaining around&nbsp;7.5 million downloads in just four days. Similar app Telegram also experienced a massive boost in downloads because of the Musk tweet, and most privacy-focused apps, including&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>, benefitted too.</p>



<p>Musk flagged Signal to his 42 million followers because it’s a recognized private messaging app, powered by the open source Signal Protocol, whose sole feature is end-to-end encryption of user content. Privacy and encryption are quickly becoming hot property indeed.</p>



<p>This is obviously a big and important story for data privacy. That millions of consumers are so tired and weary of trading their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal information</a>&nbsp;for access to services and would jump ship to a more privacy-focused alternative within hours of Elon Musk suggesting such, speaks volumes about where the world is at in the consumer data conversation. But this is also a big and important story for&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/mysudo-private-secure/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;and here’s why:</p>



 MySudo has more privacy features than Signal, Telegram or any other privacy app on the market today.&nbsp;<br> 



<p>Signal and Telegram are&nbsp;private instant messaging apps. MySudo is a&nbsp;complete privacy toolkit.&nbsp;Just as it was before the latest data sharing uproar, MySudo is an excellent alternative for not only in-app messaging but also all out of network comms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>MySudo uniquely offers private and secure voice and video calls, SMS, email, browsing and payments&nbsp;all in one app, and doesn’t require any of your personal information, like your phone number or email address, on sign up. So, even if you abandon WhatsApp to use Signal or Telegram for private instant messaging, if you’re serious about your right to data protection and privacy you will need even more privacy features than those apps can give you.&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/mysudo-private-secure/">MySudo delivers those features</a>.</p>



 How does MySudo work?<br> 



<p>MySudo is based on the concept of a&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo</a>, a secure alternative profile or digital identity.&nbsp;You assign your Sudo its own identity data, like a real email, phone number, payment card (and more), and use that data online instead of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">your own</a>&nbsp;personal and private information. In this way, the Sudo identity shields your personal identity, and protects you from the type of data grabs we’re seeing from Facebook and Google (plus&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/11/what-is-a-data-breach/">data breaches</a>, fraud and various other forms of data abuse).</p>



<p>Since you can create up to&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2021/01/5-ways-to-make-best-use-of-your-9-sudo-profiles/">nine different Sudo profiles</a>&nbsp;in the app, it’s possible to use a different Sudo for everything you do online across all your activities (searching, shopping, selling, socializing, etc.).&nbsp;This categorization and separation of your private data across various Sudos is called&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalizing-your-private-data-is-simple-with-mysudo/">compartmentalization</a>, the most powerful data privacy strategy there is.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you download MySudo you get:</p>



  Market-leading privacy and security foundation: MySudo is built on Anonyome Labs’&nbsp;market-leading cybersecurity and privacy infrastructure. It powers outstanding UX and unprecedented data privacy and security, and features: encryption, authentication, key management, secure communication channels, and decentralized trust. For example, all data stored on our cloud is encrypted. Only you hold the unique encryption key. And all Sudo-to-Sudo messaging, calling, video, and email is end-to-end encrypted.  No personal information necessary: We don’t ask for your email address or phone number to register for MySudo or other personal information (except for virtual cards when we must do a one-time verification,&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/04/we-need-to-verify-your-identity-for-mysudo-virtual-cards-heres-why/">by law</a>&nbsp;like other financial products). And&nbsp;you can always access MySudo from your mobile app without a login or password.&nbsp;  End-to-end encrypted voice and video calls with other Sudo users:&nbsp;Every Sudo comes with one working&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/the-6-big-benefits-of-using-the-phone-numbers-in-mysudo/">phone number</a>&nbsp;(and up to nine or more, depending on your&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/mysudo-plans/">plan</a>&nbsp;and needs). The phone number allows inbound and outbound calls, voicemail, and has a contacts database. You can call anyone from your Sudo number, even if they don’t have a Sudo. But if they do have a Sudo, you get end-to-end encrypted video chat with those users.&nbsp;&nbsp;  End-to-end encrypted messaging with other Sudo users: You can send standard SMS messages to any phone using MySudo, whether they have a Sudo or not. But if you’re messaging with other Sudo users, you enjoy enhanced messaging with complete end-to-end encryption, plus group messaging, set and send expiring messages, edit and delete message capabilities, and more.&nbsp;  Secure email: MySudo gives you up to nine&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-5-big-benefits-of-using-the-private-email-in-mysudo/">email addresses</a>&nbsp;and all emails you send to other MySudo users are completely end-to-end encrypted.  Ad and tracker free private browsing:&nbsp;Each Sudo has a separate&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2019/07/what-are-the-benefits-of-using-the-mysudo-private-browser/">private browser</a>, which means you can keep your browsing history, bookmarks and tabs separated by Sudo (which might be particularly useful if you’re searching from your&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalizing-your-private-data-is-simple-with-mysudo/">medical Sudo</a>, for instance). You can open links in emails and text messages on the private browser and, because it’s totally ad and tracker free, you neatly sidestep the spam.  Private and secure online payments: MySudo&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/04/mysudo-virtual-cards-are-here-making-the-safest-way-to-live-online-now-even-safer/">virtual cards</a>&nbsp;are designed to powerfully protect online purchases and payments. You can have an active virtual card for every Sudo you create, and they offer a long&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/the-7-big-benefits-of-using-virtual-cards-in-mysudo/">list of benefits</a>, the biggest of which are that&nbsp;merchants and your bank can’t track your spending habits&nbsp;and&nbsp;you keep your money safer.&nbsp;  In-built decentralized identity technologies and standards: Last but nowhere near least, the Sudo concept is on a critical path to making&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/decentralized-identity-key-concepts-explained/">decentralized identity</a>&nbsp;usable for&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/how-sudos-are-making-decentralized-identity-usable-for-most-people/">most people</a>. Sudos incorporate emerging decentralized identity technologies and standards. Sudos digital identities will become the innovative alternative to traditional identifiers such as email address, password, and phone number for authentication. Sudos are being engineered to be fully interoperable with decentralized identity technologies as they are introduced. MySudo is incorporating decentralized identifiers, peer-to-peer communications, and payments—with more to come.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>You can see how MySudo gives you much more privacy than Signal or Telegram. We’re not saying to abandon those services but rather to use MySudo as a companion product.&nbsp;For example, Signal requires your personal phone number to register. You could use a MySudo&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/the-6-big-benefits-of-using-the-phone-numbers-in-mysudo/">phone number</a>&nbsp;to sign up for Signal and then get all the extra privacy features of MySudo.</p>



 A few final thoughts on Facebook and WhatsApp&nbsp;<br> 



<p>WhatsApp has clarified that its privacy policy change includes “new options people will have to message a business on WhatsApp and provides further transparency about how we collect and use data”. It says the changes&nbsp;won’t affect the end-to-end encryption on users’ messages and the content they send and receive—the two providers won’t be able to see user communications. That’s fine, but there’s still a mountain of user information and metadata that WhatsApp can collect and share. For instance, while WhatsApp can’t share the content of messages, it can tell Facebook who you’re messaging, when and from where.&nbsp;It can also share&nbsp;account information including your personal phone number, information about for how long and how often you use WhatsApp, your device identifiers, IP address, transaction and payment data, and much more. Read this detailed breakdown of everything in a user’s WhatsApp data report from the&nbsp;<a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/whatsapp-privacy-policy-user-data-report-how-to-download-what-does-it-contain-faq-7151248/">Indian Express</a>.</p>



<p>As Johns Hopkins University cryptographer Matthew Green is widely&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/whatsapp-facebook-data-share-notification/">quoted</a>&nbsp;as saying: “WhatsApp is great for protecting the privacy of your message content. But it feels like the privacy of everything else you do is&nbsp;up for&nbsp;grabs.”</p>

<p>Payroll data is a tremendous resource upon which fintechs and financial services providers can build better experiences for consumers and, at the same time, enable consumers to benefit more from their financial data.<br>
<br>
But enabling access to payroll data isn’t as easy as flipping a switch. And we can’t build better experiences without a simple and trusted process for consumers. This is where open banking comes in. Open banking platforms can unlock payroll data, but such data access has to be done the right way with a consumer-centric model that ensures successful connections and collection of data.</p>
 How to Leverage Payroll Data the Right Way 
<p>Payroll data is a beneficial resource, but how it’s accessed is central to enhancing the customer experience and ensuring successful data collection. Let’s look at this in greater detail.&nbsp;</p>
 API Connections Vs Credentialed Access 
<p>In some cases, data providers look to access payroll data by using a consumer’s credentials. Unfortunately, this model is overly cumbersome for the consumer. Unlike digital banking, where consumers know the data source and have login credentials, consumers are largely unaware of their payroll provider, and in many cases haven’t even set up an account to access a payroll portal. Plus, many employers use a firewall-protected HR portal to enable employees to view paystubs and other income information, which means the employee never directly interacts with the payroll provider. That firewall also protects the payroll data from external access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These credentialed-access hurdles make it painful for employees to permission data access and significantly depress successful connections to payroll data. With a low hit rate, financial services innovators or others looking to leverage such data are left with an awkward, sub-par user experience at best and no data at worst.</p>
<p>The best way to leverage payroll data is to provide technology that enables the consumer to easily access their data, and protects them while they do so. This is achieved through direct API connections to payroll providers that eliminate the need for employees to have or know their credentials. It even eliminates the need to know who their employer is using as a payroll provider.</p>
<p>By connecting directly via an API, an open banking platform provider partners with payroll organizations that are equally committed to providing consumers with access to their financial data. The open banking platform can then connect the employee with their payroll provider for them, enabling the employee to more readily benefit from their payroll data and, should they choose, permission access of that data to a fintech or financial service provider.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finicity is already leveraging direct API connections to payroll providers and is quickly expanding those tested and proven connections to reach more employers and benefit more employees. We already provide direct connectivity that covers tens of millions of employees in the U.S. Finicity has a history of building partnerships with leading data sources, such as our <a href="https://www.finicity.com/finicity-lend-to-accelerate-next-gen-credit-decisioning-experience/">&nbsp;direct API connection with the largest payroll provider</a>.</p>
<p>In the case of payroll data, direct API connections have created the best experiences and led to the best outcomes for both our partners and for consumers. This remains consistent with our market push on direct API connections to a broad range of financial institutions.</p>
 Consumer-Centric Means Consumer Protection: Operating as a CRA 
<p>It’s not enough to promise consumer-centric processes or protection in word only. After all, leveraging payroll data the right way also comes down to how the open banking platform handles the data and how they involve the consumer in that process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the primary uses of payroll data is in lending. Our <a href="https://www.finicity.com/lend/">Finicity Lend solution set,</a> for example, currently leverages payroll data to enhance income and employment verifications necessary for credit decisioning. In this use case, consumers can gain additional protection and strengthen engagement through the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). These protections hold the data provider accountable for data accuracy and ensure the consumer has a mechanism to dispute the data in case of issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While other data providers claim FCRA compliance, at Finicity we’re not just talk. <a href="https://www.finicity.com/data-aggregators-cra-fcra/">Finicity operates as a Consumer Reporting Agency</a> (CRA), which means we are legally required to adhere to FCRA requirements. When data providers are delivering income, asset, and/or employment data for the purpose of credit decisioning, operating as a CRA is not only the best way to provide the data, it’s the right way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But data access that truly empowers the consumer and keeps data secure doesn’t stop there. We also keep the consumer at the center of all our data-access experiences with <a href="https://www.finicity.com/the-finicity-perspective-whitepaper/">our CATTS data principles</a>: Control, Access, Transparency, Traceability, and Security. These principles inform our policies, our products, and ultimately our entire approach to empowering the consumer with their financial data.</p>
<p>It all comes back to trust. Consumer-centric principles, reinforced both in word and in deed, establish trust between data access providers and consumers, as well as with financial institutions, payroll providers, and other financial services providers.</p>
 How Can Open Banking Platforms Use Payroll Data? 
<p>Payroll data enables financial service innovators to leverage consumer data to improve decisioning and enhance lending processes, as well as create new financial services experiences.</p>
<p>While financial service providers have traditionally relied on ‘physical’ documents, such as bank statements, tax documents, paystubs, and more to verify information about consumers, digital payroll data via open banking provides quick access to all insights necessary to create next-gen financial experiences.</p>
<p>Finicity payroll partnerships provide access that enable or enhance various use cases, such as:<br>
</p>
 
 Mortgage lending 
 Auto lending 
 Personal lending 
 Tenant screening 
 Background checks 
 Government verification 
 Personal financial management<br>
 
 
<p>And where Finicity has been leading the market, the market is following. Along with an increasing number of financial institutions and other financial service providers, more payroll providers are recognizing that consumers can benefit from the data they hold. As a result, these providers are adopting API connections to open banking platforms that expand the use of financial data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Employees aren’t the only ones who benefit from consumer-permissioned data. Payroll providers ensure greater security when specific data is only shared with third parties for the use case, rather than released on a large, broad scale. They retain greater control in their role as data stewards.</p>
<p>Payroll data goes even further in delivering a more complete view of a consumer’s financial story when it’s paired with other open banking capabilities, such as validating information with bank transactions and, in appropriate cases, with digitized paystubs—another area where Finicity has led the market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consumers own their payroll data, and they should be able to benefit from it. But to ensure the best experience for the consumer and the financial services innovators looking to use such data, enabling access to that data must be done right. <a href="https://www.finicity.com/fintech-demo/">See in action</a> how Finicity is leveraging partnerships with payroll providers and financial institutions to provide technology that empowers consumers to benefit from their financial data and improve their lives.</p>

A PDF of the full interview is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Blockchain-Brad_Transcript.pdf">here</a>.</p> 1. TESTNET TO PARACHAIN <p>Ingo [00:54:38] Well, right now we are in testnet mode. We want to go live as soon as possible. So actually from the tech side, including everything that we are claiming and what not, on the verifiable credential and DID side, we are ready to go. The testnet is out there for a year now and has been tested by lots of people. And we have got a lot of feedback and we improved a lot of things that we didn’t see in the beginning. And so I think from that side, we are ready to&nbsp;go.</p><p>The only thing that is currently missing is the parachain. We’re waiting for that. But that’s going to come out — maybe not in the next weeks, but in the next few months, definitely. So we will have that and we will take part in the first parachain auctions and hopefully get one of them. And then we are basically… the next thing coming up is the go-live of the network. So we are ready to go. Just some external dependencies which we have to clear up and then we’re good to&nbsp;go.</p><p>Brad [00:55:42] You absolutely must be excited because it’s been years in the making. Now one of the things I wanted to ask you, and I hope you don’t mind if I do, is the backers. Now often when we’ve seen in the last few years, there’s been a lot of money raised in all kinds of ways. Some are controversial, some are not. But ultimately, it’s the backers in the long term that I care about, and I hope others do, in the space. Because that’s how they support you long term. One of the worries I have is that some of them don’t and they’re just out for the capital and they dump the value of your whole economy, your whole&nbsp;system.</p><p>But from what I’m understanding about you is that you’ve also built so much in that paramount to everything, even the fear of that, is the utility itself of the system. So what are your thoughts on this? When it comes to backers, when it comes to the long term position for your economy, for the quality of the technology, for the team and for really pushing this whole thing forward. So that people can start to use this more and more around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Ingo [00:56:42] Yeah, so, for backers, I think the fact that we are in this ecosystem from day one on basically, gives us a lot of connections to really nice people who back us. And they all come from the development circles. And I think it’s even more important to have those people behind you than to have a huge financial backer behind you. It’s always nice to have money in the bank. I think we do have some money in the bank which will actually give us the possibility to…</p><p>Brad [00:57:20]&nbsp;…have more runway as well. But the great thing is that you have the devs. You have real people building this, as&nbsp;backers.</p><p>Ingo [00:57:27] Yeah, especially in blockchain, things take longer than we thought. We have seen that with multiple things. Just look at Ethereum, how long we are waiting for Ethereum&nbsp;2.0.</p><p>Brad [00:57:40] Yeah, and respectfully so I mention that. Because we do see a lot of promises come out. But I mean, they were first mover in terms of smart contracts, as you’d appreciate. But again, that’s why you’re&nbsp;moving.</p> 2. LOOKING TO THE&nbsp;FUTURE <p>Ingo [00:57:51] Also see that that’s things like when we do the social KYC and those KYC things, those will first emerge inside the blockchain world, right? And the blockchain world is relatively small. And then we have those projects, which we call the lighthouse projects, together with European governments; and stuff like that. But those projects, they also take a very long&nbsp;time.</p><p>So we are in front of a runway. We have to recognise that. It’s not like “Hey, we go live next Tuesday, then we have two hundred million users” — this is not going to happen. It’s going to be gradual, a ramp-up period. And we know that we need the funds to survive that. And we’re pretty OK with the funds that we have. So we are looking to a positive&nbsp;future.</p><p>Brad [00:58:41] And that’s the great thing. That’s the great thing, because that’s what is beautiful about the crypto community, is that they do come together from top to bottom, from high net worth to the average person who wants to contribute. And that is where the movement is also potentially revolutionary because there are so many people that want to support endeavours like yours, quite sincerely.</p><p>So there’s a lot of excitement for KILT out there, especially with the support and the brand and the integrity of the top tier Polkadot teams. That’s the truth. And you’re up there. We can see that code. We can see the collaborations that are emerging, the integrations. So there’s a really good positioning that you are in right now for 2021. I’m really excited to see what’s coming very soon. You mentioned the switch to live state from the testnet. That’s also ahead on the road map. So that’s all a big deal for everything from speculation hype all the way across to the imperative of having more credentials built in and more tinkering on the blockchain.</p><p>But what about things like market economies? We talked about trust built in, rather. So those trust market economies, they’re really important to everything that makes sense when you build this out and when it unfolds. So that it all is seamless and, I guess, it’s being self regulated and automating because the protocol’s done. Are you excited about the potential of this once everything goes live,&nbsp;Ingo?</p> 3. ENTREPRENEURIAL DEVELOPERS <p>Ingo [01:00:04] Yeah, definitely. I know this from my past. That was not only an industry, I was a board member of the Drupal Association. Drupal is one of the biggest open source projects out there in the world for a couple of years. And it’s really interesting how open source actually works. Because, well, it doesn’t go just by enthusiasm. It always needs&nbsp;money.</p><p>And the thing is, a project can only be successful if it is possible for others to earn money with the project. Of course, you can join and then hope that this coin gets rockets, but there must be a little more to that, actually. So with Drupal, what we learned is that we have to maintain just the core of Drupal. But then if somebody wants to build a website, they probably don’t turn to us. They turn to the Drupal shop on the next corner. And the Drupal shop on the next corner then makes a profit with that website and then draws out a little bit, but then also contributes back to the original software.</p><p>And this is how the whole thing grows. In Drupal we had more than 70,000 developers working for Drupal and we didn’t pay any of them, but they all got money. Because they all had jobs because it was possible to build business on top of Drupal. That’s the important thing.</p><p>And this is why we focus very much in KILT on the fact that it is possible to earn money with KILT. So if you are a trusted entity or building trust and want to build a trusted entity on top of KILT — like, half a year after we go live there will be another stage for that, so that you can build virtual organisations on top of KILT which accumulate trust — so if you are in a business like that or if you want to go into a business like that, then you can build that on top of KILT. But you can also be an integrator and just build software on top of KILT and start earning money with&nbsp;that.</p><p>I think building this economy is absolutely crucial for a lively ecosystem and this is why we have a strong focus on that. That every role, no matter if you are a validator, if you are a nominator, if you are a builder, if you are an entrepreneurial developer, if you are an attester, if you are an integrator, that all of those guys, according to their abilities, have the chance to grow on this. And there must be the possibility to live off it, right? You cannot trade on something you can’t live off in the long run. Sometimes you have to eat, right! And then you need some money to buy your&nbsp;food.</p> 4. BERLIN AS BLOCKCHAIN HUB <p>Brad [01:02:48] It’s amazing. And this is a decentralised global economy built in and embedded into this protocol. And that’s where the game-changer is. Not only is it the benefit of the block chain for the transparency and for the provability, but really it’s also a major game-changer because there’s something real built in that’s a unique technological addition to the layer one and layer zero tech&nbsp;stacks.</p><p>But you’re literally providing something that is an incentive by design to take on board and use and and reap the benefits of. I mean, that reward system that is being built in is really second to none. And it’s really what is, I guess, catching attention all the way to Wall Street, because it is a different classification. And this is what I did want to talk to you&nbsp;about.</p><p>Berlin and Germany are world leaders when it comes to being progressive in the blockchain. We know all the way to dena, we know to the government papers I’ve read. It is quite remarkable. And they definitely are supportive of this kind of innovation to really bolster, much like you see hubs of the world for tech. Berlin is no different, I guess, to Silicon Valley, some places in Hong Kong or in China, Shanghai, India. So you must be excited that you are in one of the world’s leading hubs to build out and play around with something that by design can really change the game when it’s married with something useful like these credentials that you are building into the layer&nbsp;ones.</p><p>Ingo [01:04:22] Berlin is fantastic. I can say that, I’m a born Berliner. Yes. It is, it’s fantastic. But it’s also really nice — when we saw the blockchain scene emerging here from 2015, 2016, 2017 on, where the Ethereum builders were here, where also other new companies like Ocean came up here. And it was very, very intelligent people and a very international crowd. It was really, really nice. We had blockchain meetups every night. You could get your pizza and beer there and listen to really highly intelligent people.</p><p>We’ve got the whole Parity team — or, not the whole Parity team, but most of the Parity team — sitting in Berlin. Which was very helpful for us, of course, because we could not only video conference with them, but also meet them in person. That’s just two kilometres away. That’s also nice because it builds personal relationships, and even in computer science, personal relationships are really important.</p><p>Brad [01:05:32] I want to ask you also, I follow a lot of the things that Gavin’s involved with, and he is obviously a staunch advocate for the tech first. You don’t see him in a lot of interviews, but you just know this guy is all about the integrity of the technology first and foremost. I would imagine the relationship you’d have with people like Gav would be pretty important because he sees the value of what you’re doing. You’re in Berlin. He’s been building Parity from the outset. So, do you liaise, do you engage, do you connect with who is essentially the co-founder of Ethereum and the builder of Polkadot?</p><p>Ingo [01:06:07] Well, basically, we know each other, but it’s not necessarily that we engage every day and make plans together. I think it’s far more important, actually, that the devs of the teams work together. That’s bigger because this is where the news comes from. Right? And when Parity changes something in Substrate or so, it’s so important for us to get very early information on that, to have somebody to talk to and say, “whoops, now my code is broken at this point. Did you change anything?”</p><p>Those things, I think, are much more important than the strategic alignment because the strategy of Polkadot is one thing. And it’s good that we know what’s happening there. But we don’t have to align all the time. The whole thing was built as an ecosystem. So we are basically doing what we think is important and what is right. And we do our stuff and we are just linking up to their system and utilising what they have built. So it’s not necessary that Gavin and I make strategic decisions.</p><p>Brad [01:07:11] Right, and that’s the way it should be. I have noticed that Gavin does support you with his own tweets of you. Obviously, you know, the fact that you’re on that testnet indicates a lot with regard to that mutual support indirectly.</p> 5. DEMO CLIENT AND KILT&nbsp;FAUCET <p>Brad [01:07:25] So it’s great to know and again, I agree with you, I think the tech needs to speak. It’s not about the fomo and the hype of certain personalities in the space leading things, and that’s certainly not Gavin’s agenda. It’s more about letting the tech talk and you utilising it how you see fit. And that’s definitely what you’ve noticed from the technology, from what you’ve been saying and what you’re doing now, which is essentially building upon what is already available. And then letting others use you for their own purposes.</p><p>So with regard to things like the full SDK. I want to understand, is it all ready now for access? Can anyone go and use that in this testnet phase? And also, any other things that you’ve built in beyond the SDK? How much is actually ready and being used&nbsp;now?</p><p>Ingo [01:08:11] Yeah, so the SDK is, I would say 100% ready. There’s going to be a new release, but this is minor changes in…next week I think. That should be the final release for the SDK actually before going live. So everything’s there, everything’s open source. Go to dev.kilt.io and find the Github pages there. Find the 101s and how to install it, how to use it. And if you get stuck, just jump on our Riot channels and get the devs directly and ask them why you’re not going&nbsp;forward.</p><p>Brad [01:08:45] So the devs are relatively accessible for other devs if they need to&nbsp;connect.</p><p>Ingo [01:08:52] I think this is happening all around the ecosystem. So basically there are lots of Riot channels from all the projects. We never had any problem getting in touch with anyone. And we try to live up to the same standards, also be as accessible as possible. When five hundred projects ask at the same time, then it is a sign for us that we obviously need better documentation. Right now they still can&nbsp;develop.</p><p>Brad [01:09:25] Absolutely, and that’s great to know because having that access to you is going to mean so much as people are trying to just grapple with the gravity of what they’re embarking on; if they’re new, perhaps, to blockchain or new to some of the technology that you’re building out. And certainly the SDK is a great tool for them to engage. With regard to things like client demos as well. That’s available, as I understand. So how is that working in the context of the SDK? Are there other things and demos that you provide for parties as they are starting to really want to utilise the protocol&nbsp;itself?</p><p>Ingo [01:10:02] Yes, what we have is a demo client that everyone can access at demo.kilt.io. We have a faucet where you get some Mashnet coins, which is our testnet coin, and then you can play around with that and that’s basically built for if you have a great business case in&nbsp;mind.</p><p>And this involves credentials and well, maybe something like delegated trust. And so as one entity delegates trust to another entity and this entity then issues a credential and somebody then looks at it, and whatever. So with the demo client, you can basically build those scenarios very easily on the live testnet. It’s not a fake. So when you start it’s connecting directly to the blockchain and you can start building your business cases on&nbsp;that.</p><p>And then if you see that the business basically works with that technology, if you want to build your application, then, as the demo client is, of course, open source as well, you can just take this piece of software and hack it into pieces and reuse pieces of that to more easily build your application, because it’s a nice piece of software. So that as a developer, you can understand what’s happening there and you can just use the pieces and build up your system easier with that right on top of the&nbsp;SDK.</p> 6. PROOF OF&nbsp;STAKE <p>Brad [01:11:26] And it’s good that you have all of this ready now. I mean, you really are coming out of the blocks, literally, so to speak, with so much ready for 2021. And we like to see that when it comes to those who are exploring these new technologies, coupled with economies. And in that sense, I wanted to also ask you about your comment more generally about&nbsp;staking.</p><p>Because that seems to be a really innovative way to add democracy, to add support for legitimacy in what you’re building, but also just sheer value in enabling an economy. So do you think that staking more generally is something that is not only innovative but necessary to build out the initial support and attention and interest in something like&nbsp;KILT?</p><p>Ingo [01:12:15] I think staking is really, really important because we decided a couple of years ago to move away from proof of work. First, proof of work is not really sustainable.</p><p>Brad [01:12:26] A bit too much&nbsp;work!</p><p>Ingo [01:12:29] Yeah, that’s a catastrophe for the environment. And if we have better technologies at hand, like proof of stake, then we have to use that. We cannot go back and say “proof of work is also nice. Please have big KILT coins farms out there.” You don’t want that. I think that’s the first notion that we need to do. And then there’s a necessity inside any permissionless blockchain system that is decentralised to be de-incentivised to do wrong things. And this is what you do normally with the proof of stake system. And this is why you need&nbsp;staking.</p><p>And then after that was found out five years ago, then people started thinking about, hey, actually there are interesting economic models behind that, which can also not only de-incentivise people, but which can also incentivise people to do things, right? And there are different ways you can go there, like nominated proof of stake and stuff like&nbsp;that.</p><p>And I think the direction in which the Polkadot and Substrate things moved is actually extremely well thought out. Because it has a lot of democratic ideas behind that, which are extremely cool. And it’s not perfect. Nothing is perfect. And that is not a true democracy, of course, again. But it is far closer to a democracy than maybe all the other things we see out there. So we are absolutely happy to adopt these technologies and those mechanisms also for our&nbsp;system.</p><p>Because they are economically very sane, I would say, and they are producing the current maximum of democracy within the network, which is not the optimum probably that we will ever see — so there will be new developments after that — but I think it is the best we have right now. So, yeah, that’s it. And it’s there. So it’s there to use and be built. And this is another thing, right? Like other people are using KILT because they don’t want to implement this boring credential stuff; we can use Parity Substrate, Polkadot, Kusama mechanisms to actually not reinvent the wheel on this nominated proof of stake thing. So we’re basically tweaking it. But we are 98%, I would say, using the mechanism that Polkadot and Kusama already proved work, obviously.</p><p>Brad [01:15:17] Yes. And I think people underestimate Kusama thinking it’s just simply a testnet. And we know it’s so much more than that for specific use cases. For certain parties who want to have, perhaps, a less expensive — in terms of cost and tinkering — system as opposed to that really gold star or gold standard parachain with the Polkadot network itself. Making sure that differentiating use cases for both is important, not just simply saying that one is the step to the other. It’s just not the case. You would know that, because you certainly are involved in both of those core technologies.</p><p>Now, the roadmap, I wanted to ask you again, it’s not definitive, but I have read a bit into some of the interconnections, and I thought you could clarify or confirm. It does seem to me that certain entities in Berlin, beyond even the blockchain space, are paying attention to you and can see the benefits of this. And I mentioned this in the context of some of those local government bodies. I listened to some of those — the ones that aren’t just in German — I listened to some of the presentations that happened there. And it’s really interesting because there’s so much interest from the top down coming from Berlin and coming from Germany. Do you foresee in the near future, more of these kinds of announcements that come out that showcase that KILT is going to be embedded in the real world so that the average person can read in the paper that this company has partnered here and is doing&nbsp;this.</p> 7. KILT IN THE REAL&nbsp;WORLD <p>Brad [01:16:46] Will we see more exposure of KILT in the real world? So people understand it’s not just a blockchain game for crypto-savvy people.</p><p>Ingo [01:16:54] Yeah, we’re pretty sure that this is going to happen because we’re being involved. We tried to pay attention to our surroundings in the beginning. And one of the surroundings, obviously, is the crypto scene, which is important for us because we’re part of that. But there’s other worlds out there. And there are some people in the crypto scene who say we don’t have to recognise them because we are happy in our&nbsp;bubble.</p><p>But we said from the beginning, actually, we have to recognise the outside world and the outside world consists of people, industry and government. And we tried to make connections there as soon as possible. And the merits of that is probably that now governments are sometimes very much interested in building projects, not only in Germany, by the way. Right now, we are talking with a South American..</p><p>Brad [01:17:45] You can’t tell me too much, can&nbsp;you?</p><p>Ingo [01:17:46]&nbsp;…about a climate thing. That would be extremely exciting to also have a footprint there. And if you talk to those people, if you respect them — OK, you’re from government, you might have a little bit different views on things — but we are not being bad. We’re trying to build a supportive technology, which might be interesting for you as well. And if you consider thinking about using such a technology, maybe it’s also beneficial for you. And then people start thinking about&nbsp;that.</p><p>And this is why a project like the German Energy Association is doing a project with us. This is why we are part of the Gaia X project, which I’m extremely proud of, which is the European cloud infrastructure. We are one of the first members there as a company. And the other companies in there are basically like the German Telecom with two hundred thousand employees or something. And then it’s us. And it’s good to be&nbsp;there.</p><p>It’s beneficial for them because in this case, we definitely bring very, very new ideas. And it’s beneficial for us because if a thing like a European cloud infrastructure should ever be really, really successful, it’s already got KILT baked in then, that would be cool. So, yes, I think we will see a lot more of those things because we didn’t do any big marketing things around what we&nbsp;do.</p><p>Brad [01:19:16] Yeah, I don’t think you needed to. And you also are backed by some of the most reputable in this space when it comes to start-ups, when it comes to people. Or even if you are working relatively independently in that context, you are still using the underlying core technology. And we saw the likes of Energy Web, for example, and you mentioned some names that they’re also aligned with. And that’s because you see such immense support from that mainstream arena of business enterprise.</p><p>And what was great about the parties that you’re involved with is, you’re not discounting the value of enterprise either. It’s not just simply the narrative of DeFi, a.k.a. cypherpunk or right at the end of one continuum. You actually appreciate the whole broad spectrum from one to the other and everything in between. So with the roadmap, because it’s been a long interview and I do apologise for the length, there’s so much I want to get out of it. What excites you most coming up? Because you are the CEO, you certainly are privy to stuff you’re not telling us today and respectfully so. But what are some of the things that you’re excited that you can tell us about the KILT roadmap that’s coming, that you feel very confident is going to unfold in the way intended because you’re on time so&nbsp;far?</p> 8. A ROCKET WITH TRAINING&nbsp;WHEELS <p>Ingo [01:20:25] Yes. The most important thing for anyone who builds a blockchain is basically a token generation event. And then the phase after that until we set the thing to complete decentralisation. So this is going to be an extremely exciting time for us. We don’t have an exact timeline because we still don’t know when we get the parachain, because we don’t know when the parachain auctions&nbsp;are.</p><p>Brad [01:20:48] But not months&nbsp;away.</p><p>Ingo [01:20:52] We expect this for the very, very near future. And this is the most important time for us because the blockchains are a little bit like a rocket, right? You fire them off once and then they lift for themselves. And if you did something wrong, then it’s a really big mistake. Or you have this, like Polkadot did, this transitioning phase from after the token generation event to the decentralisation, where we have maybe six weeks to a month where we have the Sudo key and can still fiddle around with the&nbsp;system.</p><p>So we have a rocket with training wheels, which is good. And this period of having a rocket with training wheels is probably one of the most exciting periods of my&nbsp;life.</p><p>Brad [01:21:42] Absolutely. And, you know, what Ingo, I have to say, perfect timing. And this was fortuitous by circumstance, because now we see the market in the way it is. We see the conditions are ripe. We also see most importantly, that there is so much support in the crypto community for Polkadot and for multichains and for integration, for collaboration, for Ethereum, for DeFi, for Web 3. Now you’re coming out with the reputation of all of that, plus the credibility of all the time you spent building this. And we can see it. It’s transparent through the code and you have the use&nbsp;case.</p><p>So there’s so much going on. I’m very excited for you, for this new event that’s about to unfold. But beyond that — you’re going to be subjected to a lot of hype — is what excites you post that, when you really start to see, as a lead developer, as a lead, a sort of initiator in this movement, beyond the live moment, what’s something that is going to really showcase your value to those who want to start to tinker more? Is there anything at all that you know about that you can tell us post a major event coming&nbsp;up.</p><p>Ingo [01:22:48] We could talk about this project or that project,&nbsp;but…</p><p>Brad [01:22:51]&nbsp;…you’d have nothing to talk about&nbsp;later.</p><p>Ingo [01:22:55]&nbsp;..but they would be really, really disappointed because they didn’t get mentioned. But I think that everything that’s growing adoption, and maybe growing adoption in the big wave, is going to be very exciting for us. After that it’s basically growing adoption. That’s what we are going to do in the next two to three years after that, grow adoption for the whole&nbsp;thing.</p> 9. KILT COMPETITION <p>Brad [01:23:22] So just a couple more things I want to ask you. One was the competition question. Now we’ve seen the likes of Litentry emerge. Litentry is something that arguably has its own unique value proposition. It also has come forth prior to you. I wanted to ask you some specifics about that with regard to the claims potentially of all the differentiations of both in the context of identity. Because one, on the one hand, there’s arguments for KILT, there have been suggestions of off-chain authorisation to issue credentials as opposed to potentially on-chain. Another argument is put forth for Litentry. So I wanted to ask you, can you clarify exactly if there is even competition or are they different? And are there any others aside from Litentry that you have your eye&nbsp;on?</p><p>Ingo [01:24:08] Well, it’s always complicated to talk about other projects because I don’t know exactly what they’re doing today. So that can also change. What I have in my mind is that Litentry is more about producing reputation on-chain and utilising other chains for producing this reputation. So you have a reputation on this network, have a reputation on this network, and they are aggregating the reputation.</p><p>So this is actually an interesting use case that could be used also with KILT, because when you talk about reputation, you normally don’t talk about your reputation. Normally when you are in the credential space, you’re talking about the reputation of the attester. So when you show me your university degree, it’s not about your reputation. It’s about the reputation of the university. Because I look at the credential and say, oh the university is great, so this guy must be great. So it’s about this reputation.</p><p>Ingo [01:25:19] And I think that an area of cooperation could actually be that we could use the Litentry system to build the reputation of attesters in there. And then those attesters issue the normal credentials to the people. But this is something…we are talking for a couple of months with Litentry.</p><p>Brad [01:25:42] This is super interesting because you have all attestation information in your white paper. It goes into detail about that aspect as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Ingo [01:25:49] Exactly. And then they are concentrating on something else. They’re concentrating on the reputation part. We are not really concentrating right now on the reputation part. So if they do a good thing there and if they actually manage to utilise the Polkadot ecosystem for receiving some kind of reputation from other chains, that could be valuable to aggregate with them and then use this power of reputation for building attesters. So actually, for me, it’s not a case of competition. For me, it’s a case of potential cooperation.</p><p>Brad [01:26:29] Exactly. And that’s what I was hoping because when I was researching. I couldn’t really see how the idea of competition come up. It was just someone brought me the question actually, in the community and I wanted to clarify that with you. So it’s exciting to hear that they have a unique value proposition.</p> 10. BUILDING&nbsp;ADOPTION <p>Brad [01:26:45] Yours sounds like it’s very vast, though, in the sense that once again, you are specifically about that verifiable credential embedded in all potential startups and all potential uses of the technology right across the board. So it’s going to be interesting to see how this unfolds. And again, I wouldn’t be surprised if there is a partnership that does emerge that’s meaningful between the two of&nbsp;you.</p><p>One last thing I want to ask you. I think I can already guess the answer, but are you going to engage in marketing or what’s the strategy here? Because I will say this. You don’t come across like someone who is playing games with a lot of the, sort of, more questionable things we say with influencers in some respects from certain sort of lower-tiered start-ups where they almost rely on immediate hype. Sounds like you’re going to approach this very differently.</p><p>Ingo [01:27:34] Well, yeah, so what will we do with marketing? So we will have to do more marketing based on the technology, because when the technology is out there and it has the first use cases, then I think it’s really, really interesting to have those lighthouse projects out there and then also talk more. So this is computer science and computer scientists don’t talk. So this is why we were a little bit silent maybe in the last three&nbsp;years.</p><p>We have to change that a bit and talk more about the technology. I don’t think It’s the right way to do this.:.well, I’m always happy when one influencer says KILT, because that feels to me like we are recognised, so that’s really cool for us, but this is probably not how we will actually get the word out to industries and governments and bodies like that. So I think, influencers are important and it’s good that they like us and I hope they like&nbsp;us.</p><p>But it’s also important that we are a part of, for example, the International Blockchain Association, that we are part of the Blockchain For Europe initiative and things like that. I think there’s a lot going on on the interface between the blockchain world and the old world, right? And so we engage a lot in those things as&nbsp;well.</p><p>So that’s really important because what our goal is actually, as I said, for the next three years, we have to build adoption. This is where everything comes together. It’s nice to have good technology out there, but if nobody knows about the technology, it’s useless, right? Now if you can build for three years the best possible&nbsp;rocket…</p><p>Brad [01:29:41] Exactly. And what a time to come out. Now you’ll ready to go, you’re ready to fire the engines and showcase that you are able to achieve adoption because you spent the years. And it is time for you to come out of the blocks as well and go with your team. And I had a look at them. If anyone wants to know more about the team, there is so much information. There are so many credentials, again, no pun intended, but there are a lot in the team itself of KILT Protocol.</p><p>Now. As I said before, there’s a lot that’s going to unfold here. It’s very clear you’re in a position that’s primed for the attention of all the crypto space right now. They’re hungry for more in this market. And they’re certainly looking for the best reputation, the best credentials, the best technology that can really prove itself as you move forward and you’re primed to go. So with that in mind, thank you so much for your time. For those who survived this very long interview, it’s been an honour speaking with the founder and CEO of KILT Protocol.</p><p>Again, if you’d like to know more, I put links in the social media. I’ll make sure that there are links for those who are devs who want to learn more and can interact with devs based on the feedback from Ingo after the interview. And also, just don’t forget, credentials is the word, but it’s all about embedding into the technology. It’s about making sure that it is provided for a very specific trust aspect of the trustless world that we are currently all trying to support for the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Ingo, is there anything you’d like to say as one final comment to the people on behalf of KILT Protocol?</p><p>Ingo [01:31:14] I don’t have anything else. I’d like to thank you for the excellent questions. That was really, really good and a very nice interview. Thank you very much for all the questions and for digging so deep into what we do, which would obviously enable you to ask those very specific questions. Very cool. Thank&nbsp;you.</p><p>Brad [01:31:34] You’re super welcome. And if it’s okay with you I’d love to catch up with you again, especially after these events are about to unfold, because it is always about that continued support, free, transparent. Everything you represent is the same for me. I definitely want to see you grow in the future to really transform legacy models that need to change. And you are definitely part of that conversation. So keep going Ingo, keep leading this team out and don’t stop, mate. It’s only going to get more exciting, as we see the blockchain show what it can&nbsp;do.</p><p>Ingo [01:32:04] Thank&nbsp;you.</p><p>Read to <a href="https://kilt-protocol.medium.com/blockchain-brad-interviews-ingo-rübe-essential-credentials-for-web-3-0-7ed856151aec">Part 1</a> of “Essential Credentials for Web 3.0” interview.</p>

And today I’m honoured to speak with the founder and CEO of KILT Protocol. His name is Ingo and he’s here to explain everything that we possibly don’t know yet about KILT and what they’re actually building and have been building for some time. So Ingo, thank you very much for being here as the lead of this very challenging endeavour.</p><p>Ingo [00:00:27] Hello. Thanks for having&nbsp;me.</p><p>Brad [00:00:28] You’re very welcome. Now, in transparency, it’s important that all of you know this is entirely free. And obviously I know KILT. This is about making sure that there really is key information from the source. And that’s from Ingo himself. No better than the CEO and founder of any team anywhere in the world right now in blockchain.</p><p>So let’s talk about something that isn’t really talked about a lot Ingo, and that is credentials. Honestly, it’s a very complicated topic. A lot of people really haven’t dug deep, I don’t think, yet into KILT, and they don’t tend to do that until they start to see financial reasons to do so. So let’s start early. Let’s explore for the right reasons. That’s the tech ones. Why do we need to explore credentials in the context of Web 3 and blockchain Ingo?</p> 1. CREDENTIALS <p>Ingo [00:01:09] So the credential is something you all know. You have a lot of those. Normally they come on paper or on plastic. So for example, your identity card is one, your driver’s licence is one. And also if you have a university degree, you’ve got a piece of paper from the university. This is a credential. Also, your key which opens your door or your car, this is also a credential. So credentials are all around us basically, but normally they are not digital. Normally they are somehow physical. And we were exploring this thing from the side of the digital identity.</p> 2. IDENTITY <p>Ingo [00:01:43] So I think everybody agrees that digital identity is needed in digital systems. So we need to know who to talk with. We need to know if a service is actually the service it pretends to be and stuff like that. So there’s a huge need in identity. And when you look a little bit into identity, you can actually see that identity consists of two things. The first thing that you need is an identifier. So in this call, Ingo would be a nice identifier for me because I’m the only Ingo here and if Brad says “Hi Ingo”, I know that it’s going to me. But this is just an identifier and it doesn’t say anything about me. So this is not identity. This is just an identifier. It’s just like you put a QR code on an egg or you put a number on some packages or whatever. It is, it doesn’t say anything, it’s just a&nbsp;number.</p><p>And to have this become identity, actually, you need to put something more to it. So how does my identity grow? It grows with credentials, actually. So, I’m European, for example, I have a European passport, so that makes me European. And this passport mentions my identifier again. It says Ingo. So I can show it — this is Ingo, this is Ingo — this is part of the identity. Also, I can drive a car. This is why I have a credential for driving cars. I also have a company here which I can prove by having somebody look into the commercial register of the city I live in. And I also have a university degree and if I go to look for a new job, I might want to show this because then the guy trusts me, obviously, that I can do something, especially in computer science, and this is how my identity actually&nbsp;grows.</p><p>And if we want to have digital identity, it’s not enough to just have the identifiers and give everyone a name because then you don’t know anything about those things, it’s just names. You have to put credentials to it and you have to have the credential in a digital representation. And this is why we need those verifiable credentials — that’s the name for that — in a digital representation so that we can link them up to identifiers. And identifiers plus the credentials together form an identity. And this can be an identity of a person. It can also be an identity of a machine. It can also be an identity of an IOT device. It can also be the identity of a service which is just running in software. Right? So to build digital identity, we need those credentials because otherwise it’s just pure identifiers. And that’s boring and doesn’t help&nbsp;anyone.</p> 3. USE CASES FOR VERIFIABLE CREDENTIALS <p>Brad [00:04:31] Well, let’s explore this also in the context, because the reality is that you want to have key use cases. You’ve been building this for some years and we’ve already seen in the blockchain arena DIDs, or those decentralised digital identification markers, nice experimentation on the blockchain emerge for real use cases. But one of the things that hasn’t come, perhaps so much, is the credential component that must happen. So in the context of, I guess, real world business and real world applications and more importantly, all the way to the very top of government, surely Ingo, this is really limitless in how this can be applied in this Web 3 arena. And obviously the blockchain is crucial to innovating, otherwise we’re just reinventing old&nbsp;wheels.</p><p>Ingo [00:05:16] Exactly, so it’s not… Actually what we do is protocol development. And if you do protocol development, it’s always very wise not to have a specific use case in&nbsp;mind.</p><p>Think of Tim Berners-Lee. He invented the http protocol. Nowadays you can sell your bicycle via http. This definitely was not Tim Berners-Lee’s goal, right? So if you do protocol development, you have to do something which is basically open for millions of use cases. Otherwise, it’s not going to be successful. So we were thinking in the beginning, shall we maybe go into some vertical? Should we concentrate on DeFi? Should we concentrate on government? Should we concentrate on whatever? And we said actually that would be the wrong way. Let’s be completely open.</p><p>And it now turns out that this was basically quite a good idea. Because now we have this base technology out there. We see use cases popping up left and right from us, which is really, really cute because we never thought of those things. So people come there and say, hey, can we do this for certificates for allergens inside food? And we never thought of that. And then people have come up and say, hey, we’re trying to make a genetics service which doesn’t store the genetic information about the people so it can’t be misused. Actually, you could do that with credentials can’t you? And then we say, yeah, actually, you can. That’s cool. And so, there are use cases all around us. And the cool thing is that we just concentrate on building the protocol and making it so flexible that everybody can possibly use it and then people around it build the use cases on&nbsp;it.</p><p>Brad [00:07:05] Yes. And that’s why I’m so excited about it, to be honest. I’ve been tweeting about this for a while and following you along because it really equates to, in many respects, the TCP/IP of credentials aligning with identity for really limitless use cases that aren’t specific to KILT Protocol itself. But in that context, I wanted to talk you through a few terms related to this universal potential of the protocol, such as self-sovereignty, the anonymity and the verifiability or the verification aspect. You mentioned that already, but they are key components to building this, I guess, universal protocol, because that’s really what it is from the&nbsp;outset.</p> 4. SOVEREIGNTY <p>Ingo [00:07:44] Yeah. So let’s dig into sovereignty first. So I think sovereignty is one of the most important things when you look at the internet as we see it today, and this is where the Web 2 and the Web 3 actually differentiate a lot. So when you look at digital identity in the Web 2, this identity is basically held with big companies. I don’t want to mention names, but they’re mostly in America. And so how does it work? So if you want to log into a huge social network, actually what you choose is a username and password, which is an identifier. Right? And then they look to see if the username is already taken, if the password is long enough and whatever. And if everything is fine, then they say, OK, this is now your username and password and you’ve got an identifier.</p><p>The first problem there is actually that they know your secret and you know your secret. Actually, you have a shared secret. From a security point of view that’s not so cool. What happens then, is that you start to behave on this social network and this aggregates data. And this aggregation of data is actually the credentials. This is your behaviour and this aggregates not with you, it aggregates there. Right? It aggregates on their database. And then it becomes really, really dangerous because it’s not only your data that’s aggregating, everybody’s data is aggregating there. So this is a huge honeypot for hackers. If you just hack in once and you’ve got all the information, pretty cool — for the hacker, not for the&nbsp;others.</p><p>The second thing is that this aggregates a lot of power with this social network because the social network then goes and says, hey, we got a messenger service as well. If you want to log into the messenger service, you can just use your identity or your identifer you have from your social network. That’s so convenient for you. But in the end, it’s all put together to one database and they have more information and they can start selling and misusing it. And there’s a huge, huge danger in&nbsp;that.</p><p>And the biggest danger is actually, if you have a better idea of how a messenger should work, how will you ever go to market? Because they can already say, hey, you have your log-in there already, it’s so convenient. And so they’re aggregating more and more users. And better technologies, brighter ideas will never come to market because no one is going to finance them because they don’t have the users. Right? And that’s a huge thing, which is which is hindering innovation. And so we have to somehow stop&nbsp;that.</p> 5. TRUST &amp;&nbsp;TRUTH <p>Brad [00:10:22] Can I just jump in there and ask you this in the context of trustlessness. We hear that a lot in DeFi. We hear that a lot in the broader blockchain speak. But you’re embedding a layer of trust within the framework so that all the engineering that is afforded by blockchain for trustlessness, so that any entity from top to bottom, grassroots or otherwise, governmental or enterprise, can actually start to engage. But with the security and provisions of trust built in for proper applications and use cases that we know can then be utilised in business, even.</p><p>Ingo [00:11:03] Yeah, that’s it. I think this is a complicated thing people have to get their head around. Because actually you’re completely right. What we’re doing in blockchain is we produce a trustless system. What does a trustless system mean? Trustless means basically, we exchange trust with the mathematical truth. So if I have a Bitcoin and I see a Bitcoin on my balance, this is mathematically calculated. I can be sure this is my Bitcoin. Right? So this is truth. When I have a dollar in the bank, I can see my balance there, but I have to trust the bank that their database is actually working well and that they give me the dollar back in cash or whatever. So this is&nbsp;trust.</p><p>So we have a truth system in the blockchain and we have a trust system outside the blockchain. So we can state that. But then also in our culture, we need some kind of trust. And this kind of trust is represented normally by entities. This basically starts in the beginning of your life. At first, you trust your parents. You can’t get away from&nbsp;that.</p><p>Maybe 12 years later, you start doubting this trust, but in the first 12 years and it’s just trusting that. And then we are educated to trust institutions. Some people trust judges. Some people trust governments. Normally you trust universities. And it’s not going to go out of our culture. So when I have an employee who wants to work here and he shows me a university degree, then I will actually look at it and say, OK, I’ve heard of this university. This is a good university. I trust this university or what they do. And of course, then I would like to have this employee here because he has this nice piece of paper. So this trust between me and the university is probably not going to go away just because we have a new technology here.</p><p>Brad [00:13:03] Right. And… sorry, go&nbsp;ahead.</p><p>Ingo [00:13:07] And if we want to implement something like credentials, we have to recognise that those structures are there. Right? So we have to give the university a chance. The trust relationship between me and the university is something that happens in the real world. So this is a trust relationship, this does not have anything to do basically with the blockchain. But you could actually also make your university diploma yourself and just show me a fake&nbsp;one.</p><p>And this is what we can actually prevent with the blockchain because we can — and this is what KILT is about — we can store a hash of this credential on the blockchain so that it is absolutely mathematically true and verifiable that the university actually issued this credential and issued it exactly to me. And this is what we can find out, where we can produce the truth&nbsp;upon.</p><p>Brad [00:14:04] This is so awesome. I want to jump in here because this does this at a level that really hasn’t been done before in terms of finite trust, provable by blockchain, provable by code. So rather than trusting people and systems that sometimes can be flawed, this can be a better way, arguably for the future of any system, whether that be open source design for the people with no enterprise, endeavour or otherwise.</p><p>The great thing you said there was that there is this true, valuable synergy between the blockchain’s trustless design that’s provable and verifiable through the chain itself and then coupled with credentials that we absolutely need in society. So that’s a really innovative thing. I think that has the potential that we really haven’t explored yet globally.</p> 6. ANONYMITY <p>Brad [00:14:50] So that verifiable aspect that’s nuanced by the blockchain. You’ve also referenced the importance of sovereignty as well, self-sovereignty. But what about anonymity? How does that fit into the context as well, especially when that’s had a bad rap Ingo, at the beginning of the blockchain movement, when the governments tend to be quite averse to anonymity sometimes.</p><p>Ingo [00:15:11] Yes, I think anonymity is something that comes in different flavours and that has to be provided in different ways. So, for example, take a real world example. So I want to get into a bar and I have to be eighteen for that. So I choose one of the credentials I have in my wallet, which is probably my driver’s licence. And then I show this to the bouncer. And the bouncer actually needs to see the picture so he can see that the credential matches the subject. And the bouncer also has to see my date of birth, obviously, so he can find out if I’m eighteen or not. And he definitely doesn’t need to know my name. Right? So what I can do is I can put my finger on the name and then he will still let me in. He will not know who I am, but he will see that I’m eighteen. This is what we call selective disclosure.</p><p>This is one part of anonymity we have to provide and this is also something that KILT can provide. So if you have a credential and this has four different things in it, you can choose which parts you show. So that’s one thing. The other thing that is important is that it must be possible for you to show up somewhere and prove something and then show up again and prove it again or prove something again without the verifiers, the bouncer in that case, knowing that it is you again. This is needed for many different DeFi applications and this is also something that we implemented. So I come to you and say, hey, I have a cat, I can prove I have a cat. And next I come back and say, Hey, I have a cat. You say, OK, he has a cat, but you don’t know that this was the same person. That is something that is also especially needed around blockchain projects.</p><p>So those things around anonymity have to be provided. And that’s necessary to get to the general acceptance of a system like that. Otherwise, it would be absolutely open to anyone to read that and that wouldn’t fit with data security. And sovereignty is also something that plays into anonymity, because when I have the sovereignty over my credentials, and this is what you have in a blockchain-based system and this is what you also have in the real world system, like with your real wallet, then I choose who I show which credential to and which part of the credential I&nbsp;show.</p><p>Brad [00:17:50] That’s a huge thing because many, many different parties want to be selective.</p><p>Ingo [00:17:55] Exactly. So this is why we need those features as well to be useful for a variety of use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>Brad [00:18:05] Yes, I mean, it’s immense what you’re talking about. I mean, it really is immense because, again, it’s that standardisation. For those who aren’t really understanding perhaps yet, that’s a keyword, wouldn’t you argue Ingo, is that you are a standard as a true protocol.</p><p>Brad [00:18:21] But I would also suggest that you’re going to be more than that, because whilst you are the protocol, you’re building in specific potential, specific, technology, specific, perhaps even products, who knows — you’re going to teach us this — that really build out more than a protocol, but a whole platform. Because there’s a lot going on for the standard protocol that can be applied to a vast amount of use cases. But I wonder, from you, are you thinking of specific ones that really capitalise on the potential of this protocol?</p> 7. SOCIAL&nbsp;KYC <p>Ingo [00:18:50] Yeah, I think there are things that we already see which are going to have a very big potential. So, I think we’re KYC-ing is one thing that really has to be rethought in the world. And everybody’s really unhappy with KYC. That has to do with every country having a different legislation around it. This has to do with basically every bank or whoever you deal with has a different view on what he should do and what he shouldn’t. It has to do with being really annoying for people when they are around in the DeFi space to KYC basically every day. So that doesn’t make a lot of sense right now. So something has to be done about that. And we see the first projects coming and popping up and we are part of those projects.</p><p>For example, together with the companies, Polkadex and Fractal, we just started a really, really nice thing where we provide the KYCs from a well-known KYC provider as verifiable credentials which are in the possession of the user. Not only the KYC. You do the KYC and then the data is owned by the bank or by the service you signed up to. This is basically stupid, actually. You should have that because then you can reuse it. Right? And you don’t need to make the KYCs&nbsp;again.</p><p>We are also working on a project called Social KYC, which I think is going to be really important. Because there’s not only the government KYC, it’s also possible to do social KYCs around there, which means that you actually prove that you have access to different accounts like a LinkedIn account, a Twitter account, a Riot account, a Github account and your email address. And if you prove that you have all those accesses and if you store them in a credential, you can actually send people out there in the internet something that is basically much more valuable than a KYC which is issued by a government’s thing. Right? Because..why do I want to know where you live? Actually that’s really not important to me. But if I know who you are on Twitter, who you are on LinkedIn, who you are on three or four social networks and know your email address and your phone number, then I actually know who I’m dealing with. And if you can prove to me that you control all these accounts, then I’m pretty sure I’m working with you, right? That’s much more valuable.</p><p>Brad [00:21:28] Exactly. And you’re opening this up so that someone like me or anyone really who wants to engage with the open source nature of the code — and that’s what I wanted to check with you — can start to tinker with this and start to almost personalise it or to make it their&nbsp;own.</p><p>And something quite unique because we haven’t seen that kind of access in the past before either, especially in the context of credentials and especially in the context of systems that are built. And often they’re for people but not available as readily, as easily. So in that, where’s the value for this Ingo, when it comes to open source tech as opposed to proprietary? Given that this is in the spirit of block chain, how much of the protocol itself, through the GitHub, through the access, through the nature of open source, is available for everyone to interact with? And can it be forked? Can it be appropriated?</p> 8. OPEN&nbsp;SOURCE <p>Ingo [00:22:20] So, what we do is 100% open source. So anything that we produce is always open source. So as soon as it’s released, it’s also open source. I think this is a necessary component in the blockchain world. If you build something on blockchain and then it’s not open source, then who will trust you actually, that you don’t put traps in that? So that’s a precondition. I don’t think there are many blockchain-related projects out there which have closed source components, and I wouldn’t trust them, actually.</p><p>Brad [00:22:54] Thank you for letting us know that. So where does the value sit in then for you? So we clarify this because you’ve been spending years with your team on this code. You’ve been building this out for a very specific value universally for, as you’ve mentioned, limitless potential. So how does KILT as a team capitalise on the protocol?</p><p>Ingo [00:23:15] So we capitalise like any serious blockchain project just by producing our own currency. That’s what we do. So we don’t take any fees for licences or data from people and sell it later. We’re not going to go into the service thing. Because I think that an open source project actually works best when there are integrators around that. We have seen that in the past. So successful open source projects actually concentrate on their open source product, which is in our case, KILT Protocol.</p><p>And then around that you have people with bright ideas who want to build great services on that and have their own business models. And you have to encourage those guys actually to build the software. And then they can earn money with it and there must be different, multiple business models possible on top of that. While we stay very small, stay in our corner and just build the KILT Protocol.</p><p>Brad [00:24:24] So you’re the lean protocol team. And you also alluded to that important economic aspect of this. I mean, that’s the true utility fuel. The reality is that token economy is really important to the dynamics of how this can play out to enable everyone to engage with this, but also be incentivised. This is something quite revolutionary, I would think, given that this is something that people can then take to build out their own credential needs. They can add them in and embed them into their own technology, their own tech stacks, their own business models, whatever the use case may&nbsp;be.</p> 9. A UNIVERSAL PROTOCOL <p>Brad [00:24:59] But going back to you, one thing I did want to ask you: often when I talk to CEOs and founders, they also have in the back of their mind, perhaps we could also tinker ourselves as a team, not just build the protocol, but we could perhaps build some products. Have you ever thought about that on top of the work you’re doing, which is vast? I mean, let’s be real. This is a universal protocol. But is it a possibility later on where you may privatise some aspects in-house, that can use the protocol like anyone else? That are high quality, that are high tech and are very usable for, say, for example, governments. For, say, for example, enterprises. So they don’t have to build these products or these useful&nbsp;tools.</p><p>Ingo [00:25:42] Yeah, right now we are not doing this because we have enough to do with the protocol, actually. But like many blockchain companies you see, we also have two parts. We have the Foundation and we have the commercial entity. And the Foundation will always care for the protocol. But then we also have the commercial part. And the commercial part is absolutely free to move into building a service later. But right now, no time for that! But hey, next year things can&nbsp;happen.</p><p>But actually we don’t have any…this company doesn’t have an unfair advantage. It has the same source code as everybody else. And if we say we are going to build Service X, which is the super duper premium wallet for KILT credentials, someone else might come around and build a better one because it’s just normal competition. We don’t have any advantages.We could do that, but we are not even sure that we will. If we do, it must be a really bright idea. And we must also see that no one else is doing something better than&nbsp;that.</p><p>Brad [00:26:55] And you know what’s so exciting is that the protocol itself is the ability, the basis, the foundation for all of the economy to emerge. That’s what I’m hearing from you, is that the token economic design of this is really just to build out the value of the protocol, allow that to be the true core system at play when you can start to build these important credentials the world&nbsp;over.</p><p>So you must be pretty proud of the fact that you’re potentially a world mover here. First mover, rather. Do you know of anyone else in the space, given that you’ve been doing this for a few years, that is doing something similar or doing something even remotely as complex as you in the world of verifiable credentials, in the world of Web 3, in the world of self sovereignty?</p> 10. DECENTRALIZED IDENTITY FOUNDATION <p>Ingo [00:27:42] So that’s a very good question, because we are part of the Decentralized Identity Foundation, which has, I think, more than a hundred, maybe two hundred companies in there. Small ones, blockchain ones like us, but also bigger ones like IBM and Microsoft. We are all organised there. Why did we do that? We saw that if it goes to digital identity, this is a biggie. Right? And we are not competing with our ideas of a decentralised identity with just another small company. We’re competing with the real big ones, the GAFA, right? And so if I come with my little 15-people team here and say now I’m going to compete against the GAFA, I will probably not be successful, especially not if the next project, just a couple of streets down the road, has the same idea and does it a little bit different.</p><p>And so what we need to do is we first have to agree on how we do it and then we have to do it the same way for the user. So the credentials and the DIDs have to look the same way. So already in 2017 we gathered all those companies together and said we have to agree on standards so that we are compatible with each other, even though we might be competitors.Where the DIDs actually emerge from, this is where the verifiable credentials standard emerged from. So there are many companies in this field and they all differentiate a little bit by doing something a little bit different than others. But the credential which you hold in your wallet will basically be compatible with any other.&nbsp;Right?</p><p>And this is absolutely important because otherwise we can’t win. We are all, even if we are Microsoft and IBM, we are too small to win. So we have to put our strengths together and all go to a little bit of a different use case maybe, or go into a different vertical or have some speciality around it. Like maybe we are a little bit better in providing anonymity and we might be a little bit more in the blockchain world, which other companies maybe are not. But in the end the credential is the credential.</p><p>Brad [00:30:14] This is fascinating because I’ve spoken to only one other company in this context before where we were talking about standardisations. And we were talking about global standardisations that were reaching across into the mainstream, into those major players in enterprise, as you mentioned, in Microsoft. So what does that mean for something like KILT? So I can really understand, and everyone listening, when you’re collaborating at that level. When you’re having that inter-discussion about the internet of credentials, essentially. Having that TCP/IP really, to use that analogy, for having that credentials layer. That’s a big deal for every aspect of literally every application, and every person in the world really can benefit from&nbsp;this.</p><p>I’m wondering, why would Microsoft pay attention to little KILT, little KILT Protocol? What’s in it for them? What’s the reciprocal and mutual benefit? Because clearly, no disrespect to you, they have the money, the power, the capital, the centralised systems. But what they don’t have is the years of experience that you’ve had and you’ve built. So are you ahead of the game and they are catching up and working with you for that reason or what’s going on here&nbsp;Ingo?</p><p>Ingo [00:31:23] I think in the beginning of this Decentralized Identity Foundation it was, just, let’s gather the people and start to work on standards. That was the idea. So it’s more like really doing something together and being bigger. And even Microsoft isn’t big enough. They need us. It’s not only us. They need the 200 companies in there as well. And pretty quickly, actually, we took it away from the company-to-company talk because that doesn’t really make sense, because then everybody has their own&nbsp;agenda.</p><p>What we did is we asked and we were successful in asking the World Wide Web Consortium, the W3C to handle the standardisation process for us. So everybody now comes to the table and has their ideas. And so Microsoft has the same say in this as we do. And we all go to the standardisation bodies, bring in our ideas and what comes out is the standardisation. And we say beforehand, no matter what comes out, we are going to agree on that. Right? That’s the stuff that we&nbsp;did.</p><p>Brad [00:32:31] So it’s almost like the UN, Ingo, for credential standardisation, for a revolutionary protocol that’s going to change the game. Once the world comes together on&nbsp;this.</p><p>Ingo [00:32:46] It’s not meeting every day like the UN, but it’s actually…(laughs).</p><p>Brad [00:32:50] It’s mind boggling because we talk about DeFi but we have to have those board members at the dev table. And you’re one of them. So how does it feel to be one in two hundred approximately who are contributing to what is potentially — without trying to understate this — a game-changer for the entire world? I mean, as revolutionary as the internet was, this could be also something of that magnitude. Would you&nbsp;agree?</p><p>Ingo [00:33:14] I wouldn’t say… I would say that what we do with credentials and digital identity is a base layer which is needed for the next generation of the internet, which we normally call the Web 3. Which also needs some more things. But one of them is identity. Definitely. So you have to be able to do digital identity in a way that is self-sovereign — that’s absolutely necessary. No way around&nbsp;that.</p><p>So we are important, but we are only a building block within something much bigger — that is the Web 3 — with things like infrastructure, things like being able to produce blockchains for dedicated use cases, like Polkadot does. Where we need decentralised storage like Filecoin and IPFS does. I think all those things basically have to come together to actually change the world of the internet and bring us into a new and a little bit better scenario with the&nbsp;Web.</p><p>Brad [00:34:23] Well said. And you know what’s great is that you’re embedded, as you articulated. You’re a feature embedded in that layer, that fundamental foundational layer that is going to potentially sweep the globe in that Web 3 scenario. So you’re not something built on top. You’re actually embedded and built in as a key component with the credential aspect and the verifiable credentials specifically.</p><p>So let’s keep going, because there is so much to unpack. And it’s really exciting to talk to you. Your background — I just want to touch on that briefly. So that people understand again, you didn’t just move from an everyday job to build this. You had a lot of experience behind you. So do you just want to give yourself a bit of a&nbsp;plug.</p> 11. INGO’S BACKGROUND <p>Ingo [00:35:06] Yeah, so, after studying I had my first startup in the 90s of the last century. That was something completely different. It was medical informatics. And then we sold this company in 2000, I think, and that was nice. But then I did the thing that the normal serial entrepreneur doesn’t do. I didn’t set up the next company. I went into industry. And I think that was a good learning experience for me, because when you are always an entrepreneur and you’re always the boss, then you actually don’t know, don’t learn how the structures work and how complicated and complex structures work.</p><p>So it was very, very healthy for me to go into big industry for 12 years or so. And I worked mostly with huge publishing companies and media companies and made my industrial career there. And then after that I decided, now I’ve actually seen both things. I’ve seen the small companies, I’ve seen the tech, but I’ve also seen how you actually build business and what the mindset of those people is and what they actually require and how you can talk to those guys. And that’s a knowledge that is really, really valuable.</p><p>And then I decided, when the blockchain thing was coming up, I decided, OK, this is actually the big chance in my life because I understand this technology. How cool. And I know how to build a business and I know the surroundings. I know the needs of the industry. And I can still speak to the blockchain scene people and be respected by them because I studied the right thing. So why not build something there? And then, yeah, I left my everyday job as a CTO and said, OK, now let’s give it a try and build something which is actually useful for the&nbsp;world.</p> 12. KILT USE&nbsp;CASES <p>Brad [00:37:13] Well, let’s start with that comment for the next point of discussion, that’s useful. That is such a rare proof in this space. As you know, with blockchain and crypto coming together to be known as the crypto space, utility and use case, real proveability when it comes to being applied and useful is a rarity and a gem, even today. So are you confident that you really do have something that isn’t just a narrative, isn’t just another scenario with the token economy, but actually something that is genuinely going to be applied and useful for the everyday user who more importantly, does not even need to know about the blockchain.</p><p>Ingo [00:37:51] Yeah, we did a lot of research on that because actually, the idea behind the whole thing of KILT is do something useful and not do something to get rich quick or something. So it’s really about use. And we thought a lot about that. And many of the decisions that we have made are actually driven by this “use”&nbsp;thing.</p><p>So we were seeing that digital identity is really, really interesting. And we were also seeing that everybody is talking about the digital passport and how useful that would be. Actually, it might be useful in some edge cases, but talking to politicians, actually, it’s not going to happen in the next ten years. Because the politicians or the governments, they have a monopoly on identity right now and they don’t want to give it up. And let’s be also fair, it’s working for most people. Those people where it doesn’t work — when you don’t have a passport, when you are a refugee — for those people, it doesn’t work in a nice&nbsp;way.</p><p>My passport works nice, actually. So I don’t need to replace the very, very simple plastic card with a piece of really complicated technology. That’s really hard to explain to someone living in Australia and Germany. And this is maybe going to come — but not today, not tomorrow.</p><p>But then we saw that there’s a huge need in industry actually to have verifiable credentials for services and for things inside the internet. Because the only digital identity mechanism that we have is the OAuth2, which is basically the thing that the GAFA use to centralise the data. And it seems to be quite OK — not understandable for me — but it seems to me seems to be quite OK for people to have their credentials stored with a big American company and not with themselves.</p><p>Brad [00:39:56] No allusion there. Wouldn’t be F and B together, would&nbsp;it?</p> 13. WHY POLKADOT? <p>Ingo [00:39:59] It would be nice if we change that, but obviously this is also not the biggest necessary use case. The biggest necessity use cases are actually for companies, because when I build a product and this product owns a credential, then the credential is part of the value of the product. Right? And then if this credential or the validity of this credential is not with me — it is with Facebook or whoever — this is not acceptable for me as a production company. They need that. So then they need this fully decentralised machine, actually, where there’s no trust needed, where there is truth in there. Right? And there, blockchain is needed, by the way. This is somewhere you can do something useful with blockchain.</p><p>And then you come to the next phase where you go to potential industry partners and say, hey, we’re building this thing and it’s a fully decentralised blockchain and it has the truth in it and it holds your credentials and you hold your credential but it holds the validity. And then they say, OK, nice thing. But unfortunately, your blockchain produces unpredictable production costs. Because sometimes the gas is five euros and sometimes the gas is fifteen euros and sometimes it’s twenty four. And actually we can’t produce things like that because we don’t know how expensive the product is going to be in production so what price point would we&nbsp;set?</p><p>And then you could say, OK, let’s do a permissioned blockchain like Hyperledger, or whatever, and go into that and then you have a predictable price. But unfortunately then you don’t have the truth in the system, right? So you have a dilemma&nbsp;there.</p><p>And this is basically why we moved to Polkadot in 2018 because Polkadot is solving this problem. I think it’s the only technology out there which we have which solves this problem. Because when I have this — it’s called a parachain lease — I actually can build a small blockchain and have predictable gas prices, so I can say making a credential in KILT will never cost more than €0.10 or something. And then they can build their production costs on&nbsp;that.</p><p>But I can also say I have the truth of a truly, fully permissionless blockchain in there because I can send my blocks to the Polkadot Relay Chain and have them verify it for me. And if they are good, then they have the truth in the system again. So I have the mathematical truth and I have the price stability which I need. And we are really trying to make things which are useful and we are reflecting with the people who will use them later. And when they say it doesn’t work this way, then we use the technology or choose the technology that can actually fulfil the requirements of the potential users.</p><p>Brad [00:42:57] And can I just jump in there? Because, I mean, there’s a lot said in there. So clearly, you’re the sort of person who’s paying attention to the optimal blockchain platform; the optimal blockchain, full stack of services and provisions, tools and all the way down to that fundamental code. Now, you talked about Polkadot. Again, everyone knows I’m a fan of that, but I am certainly agnostically positioned in all the space. So I’d imagine you would be too, whether it be Polkadot or whether it be something in the future. The absolute criterion for you is that this system, whichever it is, is the best in the world in what you need. And right now Polkadot clearly is that for&nbsp;you.</p><p>Ingo [00:43:37] Yeah, that’s true. We were brought there by this dilemma of price and truth, so they were solving the price/truth dilemma. So that was clearly where we wanted to be. So this is why we started developing the whole thing on Parity Substrate in October 2018. Parity Substrate was in the beginning at that time, so it improved a&nbsp;lot.</p><p>Brad [00:44:04] That’s why we had the canary&nbsp;network.</p><p>Ingo [00:44:08] And then it turned out that it’s also a nice community actually. And this is another reason to stay because the Polkadot community obviously attracts very, very bright minds. And that is also a thing where we feel very well. Yeah, we feel very well talking to and exchanging with people in a relatively small community when you compare it to Ethereum or so. And a relatively small community which has bright people in there who come up with new ideas, who also criticise you in a positive&nbsp;way.</p><p>Brad [00:44:45] Well, let’s talk about that then Ingo, because we had the co-founder of Ethereum move across and build Parity, Gavin Wood. Then he tinkered with the highest standards of tech to build out what has now become the Polkadot ecosystem. We see that Substrate now emerged. We see Kusama with the canary network, and we see again, from many other key parachain initiatives or potentials, we see also very complex and emerging tech moving out for specific purposes, specific use cases and even more that is just really on the edge of the future of decentralised technologies.</p><p>So this is a very big deal, knowing that we’re talking about interoperability here. Cross collaboration, the potentials of working and enhancing even the likes of Ethereum, for example, and many others to come. So would it be fair in saying that you’re also not only pro Polkadot, but you’re pro interchain. You’re pro bringing things together just like you are with the credentials built into this foundational layer of the&nbsp;future?</p><p>Brad [00:45:44] Surely, because when we listen to Gavin, he doesn’t talk solely about Polkadot, he talks about what’s coming and integrating so much more into a more seamless Web 3&nbsp;world.</p> 14. XCMP and POLKADOT RELAY&nbsp;CHAIN <p>Ingo [00:45:56] Yes, sure. So when you do base layer technology, interconnecting is crucial because people have to somehow use the KILT Protocol. And there are different ways to do that. So for industry players we provide a nice JavaScript SDK on top of that so that they can use their own resources, basically. Because normally big companies have some JavaScript developers. To build KILT applications on top of that, that’s the industry part. We have to cover&nbsp;that.</p><p>We are very happy about XCMP now coming up, the cross-chain messaging protocol, so that we are able to natively speak through the Relay Chain in a very secured way to other projects which are also in the Polkadot ecosystem. And I’m very excited about what’s going to come up there. This technology is brand new, right. So there’s no one really out there already using it. It’s just there. We now know how it works and we start talking with the first projects and say OK, and could we send messages here and there, and start collaborating on this level as well? So this is too new to talk about, basically, but this is very, very exciting for us. And I think it’s a great chance to be an early part of this ecosystem, because in the beginning, it’s going to be relatively small. Right? This is going to grow.&nbsp;Yes.</p><p>And it’s good to be there in the beginning already and have some use cases also inside the ecosystem where we can show that communication through the Relay Chain is very valuable for projects to be part of this ecosystem. This will draw more people inside the ecosystem, which is good for us, because then we have more partners to talk to. And it’s also good for them because if they wait a little longer, they will already find a functioning infrastructure for a lot of problems that they will&nbsp;see.</p><p>Brad [00:47:52] Yes,&nbsp;exactly.</p><p>Ingo [00:47:54] And so it’s good for us to be in early and it’s good for the others that we are in early because we can solve some of their problems. They don’t have to wrap their heads around&nbsp;them.</p><p>Brad [00:48:04] Yes. Well, I want to dig a bit more because everything you’re saying suggests meaningful partnerships, which was on my agenda later in the conversation. But let’s do it now. So earlier in the conversation, you mentioned that blockchain itself is something you are knowledgeable about, or you had some understanding of. That makes you rare. Firstly, when you couple that with all the expertise you had technologically and even in your role as leading out some very important, I guess, engineering roles, important leadership roles, all the things you’ve done in the&nbsp;past.</p><p>Now, when it comes to crypto, we see a lot of partnerships that aren’t meaningful, that are just hype-driven and fomo-driven and drivel-driven. But then we see the ones that aren’t. You know the difference pretty quickly when you start researching why these partnerships happened.</p><p>What’s interesting about you is that you could potentially partner with literally every high quality initiative that is useful in and of itself and in inter-blockchain, inter-multchain scenarios with other core layer one solutions or layer one foundational technologies. And then even outside of the scope of all of those in the mainstream, too, with the compatibility you mentioned, with the alliances you’re forging. So let’s start with the smaller ones. With the Polkadot arena, with the Polkadot potential. Can you tell us a bit more about the meaningfulness or the importance of these relationships you are forging and partnerships. For them, what’s the mutual benefit and why are they saying, yes, partner with us? Because it is happening. It’s unfolding now.</p> 15. ECOSYSTEM COLLABORATION <p>Ingo [00:49:34] Yeah, that’s actually pretty simple. This credential thing and identity thing, I would call it, this is a lot of work. And it’s really not nice if you have a project which needs to identify a person, say you’re building up an exchange, or whatever. If you have a DeFi system where you need some kind of credibility for people in there to calculate their credit score or whatever. You are very often confronted with the problem that you have to identify a person. And then you could go and implement this yourself because there’s a standard or they’ll just use the standard implemented.</p><p>Then you will notice, OK, the standard is maybe not enough. We need some things on top of the standard, like delegated trust and stuff like that, which you come to when you think about it and which are not described in the standard but are implemented already. Then you have two choices. Either you delay your project by one and a half years and start implementing the stuff, or you just use the stuff that is already&nbsp;there.</p><p>Brad [00:50:46] Or you call KILT. That’s what you&nbsp;do.</p><p>Ingo [00:50:50] That’s it, we save the people one and a half years of development work.</p><p>Brad [00:50:56] So let’s be real, I mean, we’ve seen the value of some of these real and meaningful partnerships. Chainlink has led the way with the Oracle endeavour, and I’m sure you’ve seen that because they are essentially an agnostic technology that’s important for the whole space. And they’re working across a multitude of different layer ones. And even layer zeros, as we know Polkadot&nbsp;is.</p><p>So without, again, trying to add any kind of hype, it’s really impossible not to when we know that this is a technology that doesn’t really exist outside of the scope of you in the Polkadot context, I would imagine. Or if it does, there’s few of them. And that means that there’s a very high chance that there’s going to be a vast amount of partnerships because they would all want to add this credential layer&nbsp;in.</p><p>Ingo [00:51:39] Exactly. I think there are two types of partnerships. There is the type of partnership where people just use our system. You don’t have to ask us for that. It’s open source. So that’s the easiest partnership, when we’ve just noticed “Whoops, they are using KILT. That’s cool.” That’s cool for us. But then there are also dedicated partnerships. And we use those partnerships for building things together.</p><p>So this happens, for example, as I said in the beginning with the Polkadex example, that we set something up together because nobody has done that before and we decided that we have to do that together. Right? Or with Moonbeam, we also have a partnership. We’re building something. And this thing only works when we bring the devs together, actually. If we can’t do it alone, they can’t do it alone, let’s let’s work together. This is a partnership which really makes sense because it makes the thing&nbsp;bigger.</p><p>And then we do partnerships and actually also bring development resources to the table. In the normal case, say, the 95% case, it’s just a project which is building something and says, OK, if we use KILT, then we’re faster on the market and it also fits into the ecosystem. And let’s just use those guys. Maybe they call us and say hey, we use you. And of course, they&nbsp;can.</p><p>Brad [00:52:57] This is so fantastic. It’s fantastic to know this is already happening now. You haven’t even launched and really explored publicly what’s unfolding with your whole economy.But to hear that utility is built in now, this is a big deal. Because sometimes we see white papers at launch with other projects, as you would appreciate, or not. So we like to see years of tech built in, years of the team building. And you’ve been doing all of&nbsp;that.</p><p>But on top of that, now you’re starting to be able to be useful, prelaunch, with something that’s going to fuel a broader, more experimental economy on top. So this is a big thing, especially knowing that this is related to something that’s underpinning so much more above, like we see with layers twos and all the applications that can come forth on these new and emerging blockchains.</p><p>Brad [00:53:43] So one of the things you said is “simple”. And often the case is with a great CEO, they won’t explain that simple means very technical. But it does. You know, for you to get to something where it’s seamless and easy and simple for me, it means that it’s years in the making for you. And some of those key things that have come up are things like creating, issuing, verifying, presenting and also claiming when it comes to the digital credentials.</p><p>So do you feel like where you are in your roadmap now, that you can actually achieve those things in reality? When you see these partnerships, when you see these other businesses and entities and protocols start to want and need you as they emerge for the future, are you applied now? Are you usable? Are you ready to go? And is this moving forward something that’s only going to grow and prove itself with real functionality and real application?</p><p>Continue to <a href="https://kilt-protocol.medium.com/blockchain-brad-interviews-ingo-rübe-essential-credentials-for-web-3-0-73fdb4ab4427">Part 2</a> of “Essential Credentials for Web 3.0” interview.</p>

<blockquote><p></p><p>“Markets don’t wait for engineering timelines.”</p>–Vinny Lingham</blockquote>



<p>That’s Vinny Lingham describing why <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/civic-announces-integration-with-solana-blockchain/">Civic is integrating with the Solana blockchain</a> in a special AMA last week, featuring a fireside chat with Anatoly Yakovenko, CEO and Co-Founder of <a href="https://solana.com/">Solana</a>.</p>



<p>As background, Ethereum transaction fees have soared since last summer, blocking the mainstream adoption of DeFi and squeezing companies that depend on a functional blockchain ecosystem. With a second layer solution requiring months of development, chain-agnostic Civic <a href="https://www.identity.com/embedding-identity-into-the-blockchain-with-solana/">and its non-profit partner</a>, Identity.com, are paving a better path by leveraging Solana’s blazing speed and low fees that scale as the ecosystem grows.</p>



<p>Vinny’s point was that companies experiencing the stranglehold of high ETH fees don’t have time to simply wait months for a software fix that may work. There are many available alternatives, including solutions like Solana that are better-positioned for the future.</p>



<p>For its part, Civic believes that with identity as a cornerstone of blockchain infrastructure, a safer, more sustainable financial ecosystem may develop. And, with its unique expertise in identity-based key management and recovery, Civic will help make financial tools more accessible to mainstream consumers.</p>



<p>The journey to working with Solana began several years ago, when Vinny was first introduced to Anatoly in the most unusual way. As Anatoly recounts to Vinny during the virtual event, they met through a mutual friend that plays underwater hockey, back when Solana was looking for its seed round of funding. Anatoly said it really was that weird sport with a small community that led to the check that got the company its start.</p>



<p>Key Takeaways</p>



  <a href="https://youtu.be/tf4NbhxhfkU?t=195">03:15</a>: Civic is integrating with the Solana blockchain to leverage blazing speed and scalable fees.  <a href="https://youtu.be/tf4NbhxhfkU?t=1398">23:18</a>: Solana CEO Anatoly Yakovenko joined Civic CEO Vinny Lingham for a fireside chat. Spoiler: they met through a mutual friend who played underwater hockey.  <a href="https://youtu.be/tf4NbhxhfkU?t=1815">30:15</a>: Why is Solana the right platform for DeFi?  <a href="https://youtu.be/tf4NbhxhfkU?t=2715">45:15</a>: The move away from ETH was prompted by high gas fees and a long timeline for Layer 2.  



<p>Other Highlights</p>



<p>During the event, Anatoly and Vinny cover a range of topics, including Solana’s vision for DeFi at inception (<a href="https://youtu.be/tf4NbhxhfkU?t=1815">30:15</a>), what it was like last summer when ETH gas prices spiked (<a href="https://youtu.be/tf4NbhxhfkU?t=1643">27:23</a>), and what the landscape will look like now that many corporations have invested in cryptocurrency (<a href="https://youtu.be/tf4NbhxhfkU?t=2444">40:44</a>). Importantly, they cover the near future of identity. Anatoly notes that the “Summer of DeFi” proved that small groups of 10,000 to 20,000 people can easily organize around the idea. By knowing that a fellow group member is a verified human, the community can very easily build decentralized trust, unleashing a brand new way to connect and take action around good ideas (<a href="https://youtu.be/tf4NbhxhfkU?t=2317">38:37</a>).</p>



<p>Check out the full AMA above and hear more about what it takes to move blockchains. With the integration well underway, Civic will have more announcements about <a href="https://civic.finance/">our consumer gateway</a> soon.</p>

				  Professionally-staffed MainNet supports mission-critical, enterprise-grade decentralized identity market solutions   
			   
				
				
				 <p>Technology provider Indicio.tech, a public benefit corporation advancing decentralized identity software and solutions, today announced the public availability of the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-mainnet/">Indicio MainNet</a>, a professionally-staffed decentralized identity network designed for global enterprises that need a reliable platform to develop and scale identity services and products. The development of the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a>-based network follows on the successful deployment of the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-testnet/">Indicio TestNet</a>, a market leader in decentralized identity networks.</p>
<p>The Indicio MainNet uses distributed ledger technology—multiple identical databases spread across different nodes—to enable the use of privacy-preserving verifiable digital credentials. This provides the foundation for flexible, portable, and permanent digital identities that are always under the control of the identity holder—the individual—and which provide an evolutionary leap forward in security.</p>
<p>“Our clients asked for a stable, fully-staffed network based on Hyperledger Indy— one that could provide the&nbsp; Service Level Agreements their customers need for mission-critical workloads,” said Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “Today, we are excited to announce that this MainNet is open for business.”</p>
<p>“This is the network we need to accelerate adoption of passwordless zero trust ecosystems for enterprise customers” said Mike Vesey, President of <a href="https://idramp.com">IdRamp</a>, a leader in decentralized identity and a Genesis Node Operator on the Network. “Our customers are developing service delivery ecosystems that require world class support, and leading edge features managed by a team with deep technical experience. The Indicio network provides exactly that.”</p>
<p>“The Indicio Network enables GlobaliD to deliver a digital identity platform that puts you in control of your identity and your data,” says Mitja Simcic, CTO of <a href="https://global.id">GlobaliD</a>, one of the first companies to use Indicio’s MainNet. “Most digital identity platforms take ownership and control of your digital identity and your data for their own purposes. For instance, social media companies make money from selling your data to unauthorized third parties. Indicio is creating an ecosystem for providers that are working to make this practice obsolete. This network is bringing real change to real people, all over the world.”</p>
<p>The Value of Decentralized Identity<br>Decentralized identity allows individuals to control their own data and solves the privacy and security issues that undermine current models for handling identity online. This privacy-preserving model for identity, where everyone controls their own information, makes it easy for companies and organizations to comply with data privacy laws, makes business partner integrations more secure, and does away with the need for third-parties to manage and hold personally identifiable information (PII).</p>
<p>It is important to note that as part of Indicio’s <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-network-governance/">governance</a>, no personal data, such as names, addresses, or birth dates, are written to any of the Indicio Network ledgers. Instead, machine-readable cryptographic information identifies the issuer of the credential and the details that demonstrate the credential is authentic. With just a few writes to the Indicio MainNet, millions of credentials can be issued, all pointing to the same few ledger writes making the system easily scalable.</p>
<p>How to use the Indicio MainNet<br>Anyone using technology to verify a verifiable credential that is presented to them may access the Indicio MainNet for free. Several wallets currently in production now point to the Indicio Network, enabling credentials to be issued on, and read from, the Indicio Network.</p>
<p>Global innovators interested in becoming part of the Indicio Network are welcome to become an Indicio Node Operator. This diverse, supportive, and collaborative network of dynamic companies, work together to support a copy of the ledger while helping to advance decentralized identity. <a href="https://indicio.tech/node-operator-program/">Learn more</a> about the other benefits of becoming a Node Operator.</p>
<p>Finally, those that want to use the publicly available ledger as a platform for an identity solution may write directly to the Indicio Network. <a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1xPes3CuyQqeGBbWU8FtrNQ4frvz">Go here</a> to learn more about how you can write to the Indicio Network today!</p>
<p>As part of our commitment to advancing decentralized identity, Indicio is committed to being a resource hub by providing enterprise-grade open source tools so that everyone can start building solutions today. In addition to the public MainNet, Indicio offers a TestNet, and builds <a href="https://indicio.tech/private-networks/">Private Networks</a>. Indicio’s customizable, instructor-led <a href="https://indicio.tech/training-packages/">training programs</a> are an excellent introduction to understanding how decentralized identity works, and scale to all levels of expertise.</p>
<p>A note on environmental impact<br>As a public benefit corporation, Indicio takes environmental impact seriously. The use of a distributed ledger in decentralized identity does not involve “proof of work” or mining, both of which entail substantial energy costs. Instead, with the optimal network size being 25 or fewer nodes, writing to the Indicio MainNet is energy comparable to logging into a website or sending a form. Much of the activity in a decentralized identity ecosystem takes place off ledger. This all makes decentralized identity a low-energy consumption practice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<p>ABOUT US<br>Indicio.tech provides technology development services for decentralized identity, and offers a complete software ecosystem for business, consumer, and mobile applications to issue, verify, and exchange verifiable digital credentials. Founded on the belief in privacy and security by design, Indicio supports the open source and interoperability goals of the decentralized identity community.</p>
<p>As a Public Benefit Corporation, Indicio is committed to advancing decentralized identity as a public good that enables people to control their identities online and share their data by consent. Identity and application teams rely on Indicio’s simplicity, extensibility, and expertise to make identity work for everyone.</p>

 Ocean Protocol smart contracts and Ocean Market are deployed on a low gas fees network with rapid community adoption <p>As part of <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceans-on-ethereum-mainnet-ba9be1aee0ce">Ocean’s multi-chain strategy</a>, we have partnered with <a href="https://polygon.technology/">Polygon</a> (formerly Matic) to bring Web3 Data Economy tools to their chain &amp; ecosystem. Polygon has seen widespread adoption with over 90 dApps, 7 Million transactions, and 200,000 unique users, enabling high-quality user experiences for top dApps like Polymarket, Aavegotchi, Decentral Games, and Neon District. Polygon also offers a strong alternative to the high gas fees on Ethereum, meeting a key goal for Q1 in our <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-product-update-2021-6875bc1f804f">2021&nbsp;roadmap</a>.</p><p>With Ocean deployed to Polygon, this&nbsp;means:</p>  People can use Ocean Market to publish, swap, stake, and consume data assets in Polygon. Transactions now cost mere cents with lower latency. Users simply point their wallet in Metamask to Polygon, and Ocean Market will show data assets registered in the Polygon&nbsp;network.  Data marketplace builders and other dapp developers can use Ocean libraries (ocean.js, ocean.py) and frontend components (react hooks, market) with&nbsp;Polygon.  Token holders can <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/polygon-bridge">move their OCEAN to Polygon as mOCEAN tokens</a> and&nbsp;back.  <p>Ocean components supported in Polygon include: Ocean smart contracts, Ocean Market, <a href="https://explorer-mainnet.maticvigil.com/address/0x282d8efCe846A88B159800bd4130ad77443Fa1A1/transactions">mOCEAN smart contract</a>, OCEAN-mOCEAN bridge, Provider (for data services), Aquarius (metadata cache), and Ocean Subgraph (The Graph queries). For more details, visit our <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/#polygon-mainnet">Supported Networks</a>&nbsp;page.</p><p>The Ocean Protocol deployment to Ethereum mainnet, and related services, including Ocean Market, will continue as&nbsp;before.</p> Cross-chain mental&nbsp;model <p>Prior to Polygon, Ocean Protocol was deployed on Ethereum Mainnet, Rinkeby, Ropsten, and Ganache. An Ocean Market user could change the network by pointing their wallet (e.g. Metamask) to a different network, and Ocean Market would show data assets that are on that network. Ocean.js and ocean.py drivers are similar; the dapp developer simply specifies the “network” URL.</p><p>It’s the same for&nbsp;Polygon.</p><p>Polygon is the first network beyond Ethereum Mainnet that isn’t a testnet, where tokens on the network have real value associated, so token bridges across networks have been&nbsp;built.</p>  OCEAN on Ethereum mainnet gets bridged across as mOCEAN on&nbsp;Polygon.  ETH for gas fees on Ethereum mainnet corresponds to MATIC for gas fees on&nbsp;Polygon.  ETH on Ethereum mainnet gets bridged across as mETH on Polygon, though you won’t need mETH for Ocean&nbsp;Market.   New Datasets and&nbsp;Services <p>People can choose to publish datasets and services in Ethereum or Polygon. With Ethereum, there are higher gas fees and confirmation latency, but in exchange, the UX and familiarity of users is high. For Polygon, the costs and latency are much lower, but users need to use the mOcean bridged&nbsp;tokens.</p> Prior-Published Datasets /&nbsp;Services <p>Let’s say a publisher has an existing dataset/service as an Ocean datatoken contract published on Ethereum, along with a pool of sizable liquidity. They shouldn’t just publish a new datatoken contract to Polygon for the same dataset /service. This would be highly unfair to their existing datatoken holders and stakers on Ethereum because value in the new token siphons value from the&nbsp;old.</p><p>Ideally, there would be bridges for datatokens, just like the bridge for OCEAN. This might seem like it would come out-of-the-box since datatokens follow the ERC20 standard, but alas, it doesn’t work because there are technical “gotchas” related to datatoken metadata and more. These issues are solvable and currently being worked on, but not in time for this first&nbsp;release.</p><p>In the meantime, we have a pragmatic workaround for publishers and stakers. We call it the Republish Rule.</p>  General principle: republishing datasets and services as a new datatoken into Polygon is not unfair if most liquidity has been removed from the datatoken’s pool in Ethereum (low vested interest in the datatoken).  Republish Rule: it’s ok for a publisher to republish a dataset/service as a new datatoken (and pool) in Polygon if there is less than 1000 OCEAN in the dataset/service pool in Ethereum mainnet. Conversely, if they publish while there’s still greater than 1000 OCEAN, this is not ok, and the publisher and the asset will get placed into <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/list-purgatory/blob/main/policies/README.md">Ocean Market Purgatory</a>.  <p>This needs no further software implementation, as it uses the Ocean Market’s existing flows for purgatory. The community can flag assets breaking the republish rule, just as the community has already done for IP violations, sensitive data violations, etc.</p><p>The rule provides a natural incentive for stakers to remove their stake from Ethereum mainnet pools, so publishers can republish in Polygon and for the stakers to follow suit with staking on the&nbsp;new.</p> Further Resources on Ocean *&nbsp;Polygon   Ocean-related tokens and services in Polygon: <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/#polygon-mainnet">https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/#polygon-mainnet</a>  Tutorial on bridging OCEAN in Ethereum mainnet, to mOCEAN in Polygon: <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/polygon-bridge">https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/polygon-bridge</a>  mOCEAN contract in Polygon blockchain explorer <a href="https://explorer-mainnet.maticvigil.com/address/0x282d8efCe846A88B159800bd4130ad77443Fa1A1">https://explorer-mainnet.maticvigil.com/address/0x282d8efCe84</a>   Announcement Statements <p>“Polygon has a long history of collaboration with the Ethereum ecosystem with an eye towards scaling and security. The Polygon team has developed a first-class platform for running EVM-based contracts and bridging across chains. It’s our pleasure to leverage Polygon so that our users benefit from far lower gas costs in Ocean Market and in other emerging dapps &amp; protocols that use Ocean,” said Ocean Founder Trent McConaghy.</p><p>Sandeep Nailwal, Co-Founder and COO of Polygon, said, “We’re thrilled to have Ocean Protocol and their revolutionary data marketplace on Polygon.

<p>(originally sent on Oct 28. <a href="http://eepurl.com/coMMKT">Subscribe to our newsletter now</a>)</p><p>Hi Everyone,</p><p>A major discussion we’ve been continuing internally is about how Bitmark can make the control of digital rights accessible (applicable) to everyone. As hard as we’ve worked in the areas of personal data, healthcare, music, and art, there remains a significant learning curve for most people to join in. Many of us in the United States are used to signing our rights away without really considering what we’re reading. That’s the way it&nbsp;is.</p><p>If you’re now told you should have better control over your rights and this [Bitmark] is a way to do so, it may not seem that obvious that you should care unless you already are someone who protects their rights at every opportunity — for example, maybe you refuse to use Facebook.</p><p>To be honest, most people are not in this bucket. While Bitmark believes in market solutions over well intended (but poorly executed) regulation, the market seemingly says rights are not important. Otherwise the US government wouldn’t be talking about Facebook in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/06/house-antitrust-committee-facebook-monopoly-buys-kills-competitors.html">monopolistic terms</a>.</p><p>Thus, I have a couple of asks of you this&nbsp;month:</p>  Where are you actively looking to have digital rights control? How could Bitmark&nbsp;help?  CEO Sean often tells me that Bitcoin is the first major success of giving users direct control over a digital asset where control (eg: transfer, subdivide) is based on cryptographic proof instead of trust. Along those lines, if you’re someone who’s passionate about BTC (the ethos behind it, not just a fan of making money from it), please reach out to me. I’d love to understand your relationship with BTC, your current frustrations.  <p>To respond, just reply to this&nbsp;email.</p><p>Continuing on with this question about accessibility, the Oct 19th iteration of the New York Times ON Tech Newsletter discussed what I feel is a way of taking away rights — simply don’t give people information on how to exercise them. I don’t mean the following situation was malicious in intent, but we know that people who need rights the most are the ones most unable to access them. In our first project in public health with UC Berkeley years ago, I remember learning that health research is made up primarily of middle aged white men because they have the resources to access health services, learn of opportunities, time to participate without affecting home life, and the least to lose in terms of potential privacy leaks. The people who could benefit the most from clinical trial research or better decision making from public health institutions were the very people being excluded!</p><p>So I present to you: A new<a href="https://nl.nytimes.com/f/a/9DDbf-9Xs2GjjHxABXMsTg~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRhcD2cP0TBaHR0cHM6Ly9jZW50cmVjb3VudHl2b3Rlcy5jb20vP2NhbXBhaWduX2lkPTE1OCZlbWM9ZWRpdF9vdF8yMDIwMTAxOSZpbnN0YW5jZV9pZD0yMzI3MyZubD1vbi10ZWNoLXdpdGgtc2hpcmEtb3ZpZGUmcmVnaV9pZD05MjQyNzgxNiZzZWdtZW50X2lkPTQxNTAzJnRlPTEmdXNlcl9pZD0xYzc4ZDI0OTU5NmI5YzBiNTFjYzcyOGJiMDI1MmE1YVcDbnl0QgoALJy4jV-hWhosUhNtaWNoYWVsQGJpdG1hcmsuY29tWAQAAAAA"> election information website for Centre County, Pa</a>., that’s as easy to use as your favorite shopping&nbsp;site.</p><p>That’s it.

He was quoted costs of up to $40,000, he said. The county paid nothing for the election services that U.S. Digital Response volunteers helped&nbsp;create.</p><p>Now, about 1,000 people a day visit Centre County’s election website, Pipe said. “It’s been about saving personnel time and a better customer service experience for our residents,” he&nbsp;said.</p><p>“You can’t do public policy if you can’t make the damn website work,” is how<a href="https://nl.nytimes.com/f/a/pZt4wiAVbJiQpFlwDInaSw~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRhcD2cP0TcaHR0cHM6Ly9iZWVja2NlbnRlci5nZW9yZ2V0b3duLmVkdS9wZXJzb24vcm9iaW4tY2FybmFoYW4vP2NhbXBhaWduX2lkPTE1OCZlbWM9ZWRpdF9vdF8yMDIwMTAxOSZpbnN0YW5jZV9pZD0yMzI3MyZubD1vbi10ZWNoLXdpdGgtc2hpcmEtb3ZpZGUmcmVnaV9pZD05MjQyNzgxNiZzZWdtZW50X2lkPTQxNTAzJnRlPTEmdXNlcl9pZD0xYzc4ZDI0OTU5NmI5YzBiNTFjYzcyOGJiMDI1MmE1YVcDbnl0QgoALJy4jV-hWhosUhNtaWNoYWVsQGJpdG1hcmsuY29tWAQAAAAA"> Robin Carnahan</a>, a former Missouri secretary of state who is helping lead U.S. Digital Response’s election projects, put it to&nbsp;me.</p><p>Pipe said this is his 18th election as a county commissioner, and it’s a doozy. He said the new website, with clear information and election returns, is also a way for officials to build faith among voters in a year with lots of misinformation and mistrust about the election&nbsp;process.</p><p>In the United States, it took over a hundred years before everyone had the same, equal right to vote. But that hasn’t stopped some from <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/24/861776313/federal-judge-rules-florida-law-restricting-voting-rights-for-felons-unconstitut">making it harder for some groups </a>to do so or basically <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/08/19/903886567/trump-while-attacking-mail-voting-casts-mail-ballot-again">restricting the access</a> to the right if not the right&nbsp;itself.</p><p>This has made me think, shouldn’t equal accessibility to a right be a right, not just the right itself? In the Bitmark sense, we can’t be satisfied with “build it and they will come”.

You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-150-say-goodbye-to-cookies-9a2de65c7ef5">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>First off, in case you missed it — <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-receives-soc-2-type-ii-certification-b2b6ea7a6d75">GlobaliD receives SOC 2 Type II certification</a></p><p>This week:</p>  Understanding the GiD&nbsp;vision  This week in monetization  This week in regulations  Stuff happens   1. Understanding GlobaliD’s vision <p>RealVision’s Santiago Velez <a href="https://www.realvision.com/shows/the-interview-crypto/videos/globalid-the-age-of-digital-identity?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=2021312_Crypto_MR_TW_W1_LINK">conducted a super interview with Greg Kidd</a> — and the end result is the best overview we have at the moment of GlobaliD’s vision.</p><p>Here’s an&nbsp;excerpt:</p><blockquote>Very frankly, we’re not excited about, maybe you like hitting ads, I hate that. We hate ads. We don’t believe the world should be built on advertising where the person is turned into the product. But we want people to make money. And so, our alternative vision, and we’re seeing it now with what we call monetization of content, or just NFTs, it’s non-fungible tokens.</blockquote><blockquote>People are willing to pay, they pay for subscriptions to things to get access to data, they pay per view, and they’ll just pay, and they might tip, they might pay for one time use, they might pay for ongoing use. But we see that the economic rights of content or the economic rights of things can be built into those things with lightweight smart contracts. I don’t need to go to Netflix to find out about some good movie on. Oprah will tell me about&nbsp;it.</blockquote><blockquote>I saw it on Oprah’s Instagram account, and I clicked on the link. And because I have an identity with a wallet attached to it, either custodial or noncustodial, and Oprah has a wallet and the creator has a wallet, that’s a flat world, and no ads. You could say that me listening to Oprah that Oprah is advertising but that’s not how I see it, I’m just listening to the people or listening to the causes I want. And if they mentioned some content that’s interesting to me, it’s a process of discovery, not advertising.</blockquote><blockquote>And that world can be very flat. It doesn’t mean we have to get rid of the intermediaries. If they really have such a great search engine, but I hate the concept that there’s all these silos and if I have to find the Beatles, I have to go here, because these guys locked it up, or I want to watch the Tour de France and I found out all the exclusive rights were sold to one entity. I’m like,&nbsp;why?</blockquote><blockquote>For all these things with great content, just let the creator create tickets or access and maybe it’s people in the movie that are advertising them. Anywhere you discover content, and you want to watch it, if there’s a model that lets that person who wants to pay for it, pay and reward the creator, and potentially the distributor, just embed those rights directly in the content. So, while we’re talking about GlobaliD for people and groups, things have identity too. Like a lot of diamonds, they last a lot longer than us people. We come and go, but that diamond ring is going to be one hand after another over generations.</blockquote><blockquote>So, put the economic rights into the things. But once again, from a regulation point of view, things ultimately are controlled by people or groups. There’s an ultimate beneficial owner. You could have title registries that don’t have owners in them but that’s silly, like, oh, here’s this great title registry of houses and cars. Well, who’s behind all those? Oh, we don’t know. But it’s really, really efficient, and&nbsp;slick.</blockquote><blockquote>And I’m like, okay, those guns and badges guys, they don’t like that stuff. Yes, technologically, that’s possible but we live still in a world of law and ethics. And so, these trustless systems that don’t have any identity but that are technologically efficient, it’s like that saying “ready, fire, aim”. Just because you can do it, it doesn’t mean you should do&nbsp;it.</blockquote><blockquote>And so, we really love all these new defi and registries and title this and non-fungible token that, monetization of content, but on behalf of who? And without identity, you’re back to like the Mad Max world. Why should I give you this? Well, my gun is bigger than yours, or I have bullets and you don’t. Well, okay, that’s a world we can live in. It’s fun to go to the movie theater and see Mad Max, but that’s not the world I want to live in at the end of the&nbsp;day.</blockquote><blockquote>And I want everybody, everybody to have a seat at that table. It doesn’t matter where you are on the economic spectrum, everybody has a right and a responsibility to an identity so they can transact in this world and be equally empowered. It doesn’t matter if you’re the richest or poorest person, like when you need that horse because you got to get out of town, you either have the authentication and the authority to do it, or you don’t and we want that to be a level playing for everyone.</blockquote><p>Check out the full interview:</p>  <a href="https://www.realvision.com/shows/the-interview-crypto/videos/globalid-the-age-of-digital-identity?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=2021312_Crypto_MR_TW_W1_LINK">Globalid: The Age of Digital Identity | Real&nbsp;Vision</a>  <p>Also relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCU32JjOj0A">Greg Kidd: Global Investment Trends for New&nbsp;Unicorns</a>   2.

This week in regulations: <p>We’ve talked quite a bit about Lina Khan. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/05/technology/tim-wu-white-house.html">Enter Tim&nbsp;Wu</a>:</p><blockquote>President Biden on Friday named Tim Wu, a Columbia University law professor, to the National Economic Council as a special assistant to the president for technology and competition policy, putting one of the most outspoken critics of Big Tech’s power into the administration.</blockquote><blockquote>The appointment of Mr. Wu, 48, who is widely supported by progressive Democrats and antimonopoly groups, suggests that the administration plans to take on the size and influence of companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, including working with Congress on legislation to strengthen antitrust laws. During his campaign, Mr. Biden said he would be open to breaking up tech companies.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>Mr. Wu has warned about the consequences of too much power in the hands of a few companies and said the nation’s economy resembled the Gilded Age of the late&nbsp;1800s.</blockquote><blockquote>“Extreme economic concentration yields gross inequality and material suffering, feeding the appetite for nationalistic and extremist leadership,” Mr. Wu wrote in his 2018 book, “The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded&nbsp;Age.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Most visible in our daily lives is the great power of the tech platforms, especially Google, Facebook and Amazon,” he&nbsp;added.</blockquote><blockquote>Mr. Wu was a contributing writer for The Times before dropping that position for his appointment to the White&nbsp;House.</blockquote><blockquote>His role, with a focus on competition policy, will be a new one in the National Economic Council. Mr. Wu will also focus on competition in labor policy, such as noncompete clauses enforced by companies, and concentration in power in agriculture and the drug industry. The job does not require Senate approval.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/biden-tech-critics-tim-wu-lina-khan-68af4526-8bd6-48f1-9fe9-f75da80f547b.html">Biden gives tech’s toughest critics seats at the policy&nbsp;table</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcMRr0frKj0">Sorry, Apple: Government Stepping&nbsp;Ina!</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/what-big-tech-antitrust-foe-lina-khan-could-do-at-the-ftc">What Big Tech Antitrust Foe Lina Khan Could Do at the&nbsp;FTC</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-tech-breakups-could-be-good-for-shareholders-the-informations-tech-briefing">Why Tech Breakups Could Be Good for Shareholders: The Information’s Tech&nbsp;Briefing</a>   4.

  Gimly is part of the European SSI infrastructure programme (eSSIF-Lab),

<p>Gimly is participating in the European SSI  infrastructure programme (eSSIf-lab), building a bridge for the implementation of NFC smartcards with secure elements as physical SSI identifiers. Our aim is to enable self-sovereign identity for both online and offline identification, authorization and access management, with a decreased dependency on the use of personal smartphones. Example use cases may include  private health records (including corona test and vaccination status), eID cards with eIDAS compliant signatures, or enterprise employee authorisations, access management and transactions. </p>
<p>The bridge will be blockchain and did-method agnostic to allow for easy integration of SSI smartcards in any SSI solution. The smartcards hold an NFC microchip with an EAL6+ grade secure element for authentication and signing with their embedded DID and can be used for sovereign storage and selective disclosure of verifiable credentials. While the first smartcards to be supported are <a href="https://www.gimly.io/tangem-by-gimly">Tangem made-for-blockchain NFC cards</a>, we welcome any producer of smartcards that meet the hardware, firmware, and security requirements for SSI functionality in our open-source project.</p>
<p>Open source, ecosystems, and collaboration are the drivers in SSI and in our NFC bridge. We are looking forward to collaborating with Sphereon, our partners in SSI, and with all participants in the eSSIf-lab programme or other partners in the SSI ecosystem to ensure compatibility of the NFC bridge with their SSI stack.  </p>

 Achieving Change At&nbsp;Scale <p>This is the third in a series of blogs providing edited extracts from Mydex CIC’s response to the UK Government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/uk-national-data-strategy-nds-consultation">consultation around a new National Data Strategy</a>.</p><p>The first focused on <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/how-to-unleash-the-full-potential-of-data-3676db8d7c03">how to unleash the full potential of personal data</a>, the second on why <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/how-to-unleash-the-full-potential-of-data-3676db8d7c03">every citizen should be provided with their own personal data store</a>, and c<a href="https://medium.com/mydex/misconceptions-that-kill-progress-in-personal-data-4736b1d883c6">ommon misconceptions that derail progress</a>.</p><p>This blog explains why this strategy can be quick and easy to implement.</p><p>To catch up on progress on our Macmillan My Data Store Pilot <a href="https://medium.com/macmillan-my-data-store-pilot">click&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>In some peoples’ minds, the idea that every citizen should be provided with their own personal data store generates visions of massively costly, risky and time-consuming IT projects that invariably overrun in terms of both time and money while failing to deliver their promises (the sad but common experience of many centralised Government IT projects).</p><p>Providing individuals with their own personal data store is not one of these projects. In fact, because it implements a completely different model, it avoids these problems.</p> How to make it&nbsp;happen <p>Providing every citizen with a personal data store does not require a massively high cost, high risk IT procurement process. To the contrary, the strategy can be pursued in a way that minimises costs, risk and disruptions, and builds momentum incrementally. For example, the strategy identified <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/2020/10/01/digital-identity-scotland-a-beta-industry-event/">by the Scottish Government</a>:</p>  Builds on what already exists. Organisations already hold huge amounts of data about citizens, including verified attributes. All they have to do is electronically share some of this data when requested. Providing individuals with personal data stores does not stop organisations from collecting and using data to provide valuable services. Rather, it builds on their expertise and infrastructure to add a new, additional layer of capabilities and infrastructure.  <p>Verified Attributes are already used widely and frequently in the provision of public services. Citizens are already required to present proofs about themselves using documents provided by other parties (e.g. passport, driving licence, bank statement, official letter etc). Providing individuals with a personal data store so that they can separately store and share Verified Attributes about themselves simply enables the same things to happen digitally, safely and securely in a more efficient manner.</p>  Minimises risk and disruption. Providing individuals with a personal data store does not require any significant changes to existing back office systems, or to organisations’ processes, culture, business models or operations. Personal data stores add a new connecting element that ‘joins the dots’ between previously separate data silos, where the personal data stores acts as a node for citizen-controlled information sharing. This does not require the dots themselves to change what they do or how they&nbsp;operate.  Builds momentum automatically and incrementally Roll-out can proceed incrementally, taking one particular service at a time, allowing for a test-and-learn approach that builds momentum and impact over time. This avoids big leaps into the unknown. Incremental adoption can be built-in to small, additional process changes. For example, by minting digital copies of birth certificates during the certificate creation process and placing them into the child’s attribute/personal data store, the Government could create a system that provides every individual with a personal data store from birth, and which builds momentum over&nbsp;time.  Generates compelling win-wins to gain active buy-in. Using Verified Attributes to improve the quality and cut the costs of public service provision generates powerful win-wins between service providers and citizens (who will find applying for and accessing these services much quicker and easier than before). As the richness of the data held in each individuals’ personal data store grows, incentives for other organisations to connect to the system also&nbsp;grow.  Sets the right course for the future, pump-priming further developments. Even as this approach enables improvement of prioritised services now, along the way, it also builds the infrastructure and capabilities to further improve these and other services as momentum&nbsp;builds.   Central Government’s role <p>In saying that every citizen should be provided with their own personal data store, we are not suggesting they should be provided directly by the Government via some new centralised, nationalised personal data store authority. Multiple different, competing providers can and should offer personal data store services, so long as they conform to an essential set of design principles (see&nbsp;below).</p><p>The particular role that only the Government can fulfil is to break a collective action logjam that currently blocks progress. This collective action problem is simple to state: while every service provider using data wants to be able to access more reliable data, more quickly and cheaply, none has any immediate incentive in making the data they hold available to others. Why should Organisation A invest time and effort helping Organisation B cut their costs and improve their outcomes?</p><p>But if all such organisations made key data points available via the citizen’s personal data store, all of them would benefit from the ability to access this data. Government can, and should, break this logjam by mandating public services to share Verified Attributes for free via personal data stores in public services. This approach can also solve some internal data logistics and distribution issues and reduce internal operating costs and help eradicate use of paper and contribute to net zero&nbsp;targets.</p> Design principles <p>For such a mass-scale personal data store infrastructure to work at scale however, it needs to operate by design principles that ensure its integrity. Learning from experience since our founding in 2007 we have identified what these key design principles are:</p>  Fiduciary duty Personal data stores should be required to work in the best interests of their clients — the citizens.  Neutral and enabling Personal data store infrastructure should not be designed or used so as to favour one party’s vested interests over another (e.g. one data controller or relying&nbsp;party).  Distributed, not centralised Each personal data store should be uniquely and separately encrypted and held by individuals for individuals. They should not result in the creation of a new centralised database holding all citizens’ data.  Zero-knowledge operations Personal data stores should not look into or seek to influence how individuals use their data. Their job is to promote and enable citizen agency, not to seek to control or influence citizens in any particular direction.  Aligned incentives Personal data stores’ business models should be structured so that they have no financial incentives to monetise, manipulate or seek control over individuals’ data or their uses of this data. They should earn their money from infrastructure provision and related services.  Separation of storage from use Personal data stores should focus on the provision of infrastructure enabling citizens to collect, store and share their data and should not seek to use this data to provide data-driven services (e.g. to provide financial advice, treat a medical condition, or assess an individual’s eligibility for a service). By enabling service providers to access individuals’ data (with permission) the role of the infrastructure is to enable more service providers to better access and use more, richer data in order to provide better, cheaper services.  Committed to interoperability Citizens should not be ‘locked in’ to any particular provider of personal data stores. It should be part of the duty and responsibility of personal data stores to enable interoperability to enable sharing of data between individuals and organisations and to enable individuals to move from one PDS provider to&nbsp;another.  Universality Every citizen should have access to their own personal data store (their own ‘running data’ as it were), just as every citizen should have access to ‘running water’ and ‘running electricity’.  Independence For privacy protection and independence reasons, personal data stores should not be owned or controlled by the state or under the control of existing service-providing data controllers.  Built to last Personal data store providers should have built-in safeguards against changes to role, functions and priorities — for instance, in the case of a change of leadership, stock market listing, merger, sale, acquisition or bankruptcy.  <p>The EU has already embraced many of these principles in its <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/vindicated-cb897fb4e94b">new Data Governance Act</a>. The UK should do the&nbsp;same.</p> Unleashing a positive feedback&nbsp;loop <p>Every now and again, as societies and economies evolve, a need arises for citizens to be equipped with new capabilities.</p><p>In the late nineteenth and early 20th centuries a need emerged for public sanitation to secure public health and for all children to learn how to read and write. Similar advances soon followed: universal access to running water, universal access to electricity, and universal access to basic health services.</p><p>Each of these advances improved personal wellbeing, making individuals’ lives easier and better. At the same time they also generated powerful positive social/economic externalities: a healthy, educated workforce is much more productive than an unhealthy, uneducated workforce.</p><p>Generating such positive feedback loops between personal wellbeing and social/economic efficiency and productivity is the hallmark of successful popular Government initiatives.</p><p>Government action was needed in these cases because only the Government was able to intervene at the level needed to break collective action logjams and to realise the positive externalities including the universality of provision upon which the positive externalities are based. The modern digital age has created the need for the Government to play a similar role again: to equip citizens with the data they need to manage their lives better and to undertake interactions and transactions with service providers.</p><p>A new positive feedback loop between citizen wellbeing and economic efficiency and productivity is now waiting to be unleashed.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/transforming-the-system-a-roadmap-for-practical-implementation-411e8821ed19">Transforming the system: a roadmap for practical implementation</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

			 The Knock-on Impact of NFT Tokens Going Mainstream 
<p>As we’ve seen with the recent activity amongst crypto tokens and now with NFTs, 2021 is shaping up to be the year blockchain-based tokens go mainstream.</p>
<p>The flavour of the month is Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). They have hit the headlines as major artists and celebrities around the world announced their plans to use tokens to represent their creations. People are willing to pay big bucks for these NFTs, with one collector even selling a digital artwork of Joe Biden and Donald Trump nude for $6.6 million! Popular musicians such as the Kings of Leon and Lindsay Lohan have also jumped on the bandwagon.</p>
 But, What Are NFTs? 
<p>NFTs are blockchain-based tokens with unique identification codes and metadata that distinguish them from each other. Unlike cryptocurrencies, they cannot be traded or exchanged at equivalency. In the world today, non-fungible items are typically items such as real assets, diamonds, collectable cards or even artwork. NFTs are digital representations of these items with code that verifies their authenticity. Just as diamonds may come with an accepted certificate of authenticity, NFTs digitally associate authenticity and rights to assets or items, such as digital art. In the same way jewellers accept certificates of authenticity for diamonds, consumers are beginning to accept NFTs as acceptable authentications of digital art.</p>
 NFTs vs Security Tokens 
<p>This notion of associating authenticity and/or rights to an item is also applied in the realm of security tokens. In the same way NFTs associate rights with digital certificates (tokens), security tokens associate rights on the asset, i.e. ensuring that only eligible investors can hold the specific token. Whilst NFTs and crypto-tokens are going mainstream as we speak, the security markets will naturally move more slowly due to the surrounding regulation. That being said, we can see an acceleration occurring with security tokens, encouraged by all the legislation passed recently.</p>

<p>Since the AERGO mainnet upgraded to 2.0 update in late 2019, we have been working hard to enhance both the usability and stability of the AERGO network to prepare for mainstream adoption.</p> Building the Foundation <p>In 2020, we saw the introduction of AERGO Enterprise 2.0 with enhanced performance and a more enterprise-friendly user experience, as well as AERGO Agora to better decentralize the network and empower the AERGO community. The introduction benefited both the individual AERGO community members expecting more usage and utility for the native tokens, and the prospective enterprise clients who desire a more stable, decentralized environment that can be used to process serious workloads.</p><p>Earlier this year, we launched the closed beta service for AERGO Hub, a utility computing center built around AERGO, meant to replace more traditional PaaS (Platform as a Service) implementations.</p><p>All those developments precipitated into building a solid foundation required for the serious enterprise adoption of blockchain technology and now we believe we are ready for rapid expansion.</p> Our Vision for&nbsp;2021 <p>With a fully functional mainnet and a rich set of utilities to ease the adoption process, we intend to push the mainnet utilization to its theoretical limit by bringing a plethora of applications and use cases into our ecosystem this&nbsp;year.</p><p>In order to achieve this, we are announcing collaborations with two additional second party partners into our network to accelerate both the business and the technical sides of the AERGO ecosystem.</p><p>“Devroos” is a new entity based in Korea, introduced by a former Blocko co-founder and CISO Hochul Seok (the lead architect behind the AERGO Agora effort.) Devroos means to function as a more specialized, business-development vehicle for the AERGO project with a heavy focus on public relations. Devroos will strive to discover strategic opportunities for AERGO and help us make key investments in order to boost our ecosystem.</p><p>“Onmydev” is a new tech team founded by Hunyoung Park, the current CTO of AERGO and the lead architect behind AERGO mainnet technology. Onmydev will supplement our core team by bringing DevOps and cloud technology specialists into our workforce.</p><p>The two entities will work in tandem with Blocko, which will continue to serve as our core technology and business development partner in the enterprise area.</p><p>With the Devroos and Onmydev team in our network, AERGO will be able to seek a much broader range of opportunities and a stronger focus on B2C and&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>“Blocko” continues to be one of our important technology partner that has incorporated AERGO into their core products, AERGO Enterprise, AERGO Enterprise Manager, and DTT TSA. Blocko will be the source for corporate deployments and real life applications of&nbsp;AERGO.</p> Accelerate <p>We plan to accelerate the adoption of AERGO and boost our mainnet utilization with the help of the Devroos&nbsp;team.</p>  App and Service Incubation  <p>Starting with our investment in CCCV (<a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-to-award-the-first-incubation-investment-to-cccv-63794ccfd96">https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-to-award-the-first-incubation-investment-to-cccv-63794ccfd96</a>), we are launching an all-year-long effort to introducing second-parties to build crucial apps and services for AERGO that are meant for general consumption.</p><p>Those apps and services will integrate tightly with AERGO mainnet and test the limits of our technology.</p>  Community Acceleration  <p>We will be hosting a number of events and opportunities for the general public to propose/build applications and help them with the resources and network required to be successful.</p><p>We are in communication with key/strategic partners to provide more opportunities for those applications, including a chance to be listed/integrated into a global wallet provider.</p>  Enterprise Integration  <p>We will be working with Blocko to bring enterprise applications and workloads onto AERGO&nbsp;mainnet.</p><p>AERGO will play a central role in DTT alliance (<a href="https://en.blocko.io/dtt/">https://en.blocko.io/dtt/</a>) by providing a high-performance, readily usable blockchain network that can be readily&nbsp;used.</p> Development <p>With the help from Onmydev team, we will be making key enhancements to better support apps and services built on AERGO technology, paving the way for the general adoption of our technology.</p>  App Portal  <p>Building on the concept introduced by AERGO Hub, we will be launching a dedicated starting page for AERGO users, which will serve as both a control panel and an app store to discover and access AERGO apps and services.</p><p>Our app and service incubation program, as well as the community acceleration initiative, will play a crucial role in seeding the App Portal with important apps.</p><p>The App portal will be a two way channel where both DApp developers and users can interact with each other. By introducing features such as DApp registration, categorisation, advertisement and wallet based authentication, the App Portal will allow users to search and find Dapps while Dapp developers can acquire users efficiently. In this way, we hope the app portal will maximise the utilisation of AERGO&nbsp;mainnet.</p>  Mobile Support  <p>AERGO wallet support will expand from the current desktop-based experience to accommodate mobiles apps — opening up the possibility of building mobile apps/websites making use of AERGO technology.</p><p>Our mobile wallet will be fully integrated with the App Portal to allow accessing vital functionalities including participating in governance and BP selection process.</p><p>Important features to be developed include; storage of native AERGO tokens, access to the AERGO Portal easily, easy swap service and integration with the App&nbsp;Portal</p>  Hardware Integration  <p>The hardware wallet support for our native tokens will be enhanced, allowing not only the users, but potential crypto exchanges to interface our mainnet tokens directly as&nbsp;well.</p><p>We see this development as a crucial step in allowing more liquidity into our native tokens, enabling a more diverse range of applications/services to be built on top of our mainnet technology.</p> The Roadmap for&nbsp;2021 <p>In order to realise our vision in 2021, we have outlined our roadmap for 2021 as&nbsp;follows.</p> Our Promises <p>We will work hard to bring “the year of AERGO mainnet adoption” to reality. This will be a joint effort not only between our first party and second party partners, but with the community as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Up to 10% of global GDP could be stored on blockchains by 2025, according to the World Economic Forum (<a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Building-Blockchains.pdf">http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Building-Blockchains.pdf</a>.) and I believe the only way for the decentralized future to come to reality is by helping enterprises adopt blockchain.</p><p>Join the journey and help us shape the future of enterprise blockchain.</p><p>AERGO Team</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-2021-vision-and-roadmap-2d4ab015a31d">AERGO 2021: Vision and Roadmap</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

However, 20 years of maturity are a lot for IT, also indicating that some concepts may benefit from modernization.</p>
<p>In his talk, Martin Kuppinger will look at four areas:</p>
 
 What is the right approach for future IGA deployment models? 
 What must change in role and entitlement management, to remain complaint but reduce complexity and workload? 
 How to reduce the workload in access reviews/recertification while getting better in compliance and concrete risk mitigation? 
 How to move to the next level in customization, orchestration, and integration, without staying in fear of the next major update?

<p>As consumers demand more responsible practices from companies, governments and global organizations are taking&nbsp;action.</p><p>Over the past few years, we have seen an increasing number of regulations come out related to responsible sourcing and supply chain management. These standards play an important part in the adoption of ethical practices and are essential to our sustainable future. In this article, we summarize the main regulations and standards shaping the metal and minerals industry.</p><p>The first, and most recent standard is the <a href="https://coppermark.org/multi-metal-coalition-publishes-joint-standard-to-respond-to-lme-responsible-sourcing-rules/">Joint Due Diligence Standard for Copper, Lead, Nickel and Zinc</a>. We wrote more about this in a recent <a href="https://peerledger.com/blog-posts/2021/3/3/new-joint-due-diligence-standard-for-copper-lead-nickel-and-zinc">blog post</a>, but in short the standard comes into play in 2023 and will impact producers, traders, and extractors of these metals by requiring them to adopt a responsible supply chain management system.</p><p>The <a href="https://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2017/march/tradoc_155423.pdf">EU Conflict Minerals Regulation</a> is another recent regulation that came into effect in January 2021. The standard affects anyone involved in the trade of tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold (the 3TGs), and is mostly focused on conflict affected and high-risk areas. The aim of the regulation is to ensure that the sales of metals and minerals are not supporting armed groups and human rights violations. It will require companies and individuals within certain requirements to carry out due diligence on their supply&nbsp;chain.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dodd-frank-financial-regulatory-reform-bill.asp">Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act</a> is a financial reform legislation in the US that was passed in 2010, and it includes requirements related to conflict minerals. <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2012/34-67716.pdf">Section 1502</a> of the Dodd-Frank Act requires companies to evaluate and disclose their use of conflict minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo, and neighbouring countries on an annual basis, with the goal of creating a responsible compliance and assurance framework.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/mne/OECD-Due-Diligence-Guidance-Minerals-Edition3.pdf">OECD Due Diligence Guidance</a> for responsible supply chains provides recommendations to help companies respect human rights, and targets companies sourcing metals and/or minerals from conflict-affected and high-risk areas. The five step framework is as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Establish strong company management systems  Identify and assess risk in the supply&nbsp;chain  Design and implement a strategy to respond to identify&nbsp;risks  Carry out independent third-party audit of supply chain due diligence at identified points in the supply&nbsp;chain  Report on supply chain due diligence  <p>The last standard we will look at is the <a href="https://www.gold.org/about-gold/gold-supply/responsible-gold/conflict-free-gold-standard">Conflict-Free Gold Standard</a> which was set by the World Gold Council. The standard gives gold producers an approach to assess and provide assurance that their gold is responsibly sourced and extracted, and does not contribute to armed conflict or human rights&nbsp;abuse.</p><p>Many of these regulations and standards require a technology solution to support their efforts. Our <a href="https://peerledger.com/supply-chain">MIMOSI Connect</a> supply chain traceability system gives companies a trusted, immutable record of transactions, documents and metrics across their entire supply chain, and enables them to easily comply with regulations related to responsible sourcing. There will always be new regulations coming into play and our flexible solution is a great tool to make sharing your ethical practices easy.</p> References   The Copper Mark (February 9, 2021), Multi-metal Coalition Publishes Joint Standard to Respond to LME Responsible Sourcing Rules.

<p>To: Bitmark Investors &amp; Advisors<br>From: Sean Moss-Pultz</p><p>Note: This article series is taken from Sean’s quarterly letters to Bitmark investors. We share them publicly one quarter after they are written to give everyone a deeper, transparent look at Bitmark’s perspective of the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Dear Investors &amp;&nbsp;Advisors</p><p>Bitcoin appears to be emerging from the trough of despair. The fundamentals are looking strong. Taproot, one of the most important improvements to the Core Protocol, was merged. That will enable more flexible (and private) smart contracts when activated. Or price, if that’s your signal, is again back to nosebleed levels. When Trump was elected in 2016, Bitcoin was $700. At the start of Q3 it was around $11,000. Now it’s over&nbsp;$26,000.</p><p>Behind this excitement is an institutional story for Bitcoin. Microstrategy Inc. (NASDAQ: MSTR) bought $425MM worth of Bitcoin in Q3. Their CEO says <a href="https://bitmark.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6ba47d35944fc04102b0e9ae6&amp;id=ff33eb5671&amp;e=b5e6fd72f3">Bitcoin will be their primary treasury reserve asset</a>. Square Inc. (NYSE: SQ) generated $1.63 billion in bitcoin revenue and $32 million in bitcoin gross profit during Q3 from their mobile payments Cash App. This is 11 times more in bitcoin revenue than Q2. In their earnings call, CEO Jack Dorsey said, “We believe [bitcoin] will be the native currency of the Internet, and help people thrive around the world and the economy.” Square also announced it has <a href="https://bitmark.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6ba47d35944fc04102b0e9ae6&amp;id=7b00ad18c8&amp;e=b5e6fd72f3">invested $50MM in Bitcoin</a>. Again, touting that Bitcoin is “an instrument of economic empowerment and provides a way for the world to participate in a global monetary system, which aligns with the company’s purpose.”</p><p>While Square’s $50MM bitcoin bet pales in comparison to MicroStrategy’s $425MM, it’s arguably more important as a forcing function for other financial institutions. JPMorgan said “other payment companies will also likely follow in Square’s footsteps or risk getting shut out of a growing segment.” which is exactly <a href="https://bitmark.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6ba47d35944fc04102b0e9ae6&amp;id=aaeac391d9&amp;e=b5e6fd72f3">what PayPal did</a>. Their entire network of more than 26 million merchants can now use&nbsp;Bitcoin.</p><p>Bitcoin is a demographic mega-trend led by younger age groups — 18% of Gen Z and millennials already own Bitcoin. To put the millennial proclivity in perspective: Only 37% of people under 35 are invested in the stock market. By the way, if you want to see a beautifully simple introduction to Bitcoin you should read “<a href="https://bitmark.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6ba47d35944fc04102b0e9ae6&amp;id=4c11efecb9&amp;e=b5e6fd72f3">My First Bitcoin</a>” from&nbsp;Square.</p><p>JPMorgan sees Bitcoin’s increasing use as an alternative to gold as being amplified by millennials. “Even a modest crowding out of gold as an alternative currency over the longer term would imply doubling or tripling of the bitcoin price from&nbsp;here.”</p><p>It’s worth noting that the biggest US bank’s CEO Jamie Dimon said, back in 2017, that bitcoin was a “fraud” and that, “If you’re stupid enough to buy it, you’ll pay the price for it one day.” As Bob Dylan would sing, “The Times They Are A Changing”.</p><p>Fidelity announced they are getting ready to launch a Bitcoin fund. They explain their perspective for holding this asset in their <a href="https://bitmark.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6ba47d35944fc04102b0e9ae6&amp;id=f3bfd48f3c&amp;e=b5e6fd72f3">Bitcoin Investment Thesis</a>. For a fund with $3.3T under management, this is a truly shocking position. If even 5% of their clients participate the overall impact would be staggering.</p><p>Closer to home, Grayscale, a wholly owned subsidiary of one of our investors DCG, said that they attracted $1B in new capital in Q3. That was 1.5x the capital it raised throughout 2019. What’s equally exciting is that 84% of inflows came from institutional investors.</p><p>By this point I hope you’re thinking, “What exactly is the institutional case for bitcoin?” Some people like to describe bitcoin as a hedge against central banking. Right now the US central bank is running an unprecedented experiment injecting trillions of fiat money into the global economic system. How you think that ends says a lot about how you look at longtail risk in an increasingly unpredictable environment.</p><p>Having a hedge against central banking makes sense. It’s like having home insurance. You pay a small price now so that if disaster does happen you’re prepared.</p><p>Yet, Personally, I think something deeper is going&nbsp;on.</p><p>Institutions can be understood as mechanisms which govern the behavior of a set of individuals within a given community. In computing, a communication protocol is a system of rules that allow two or more entities to transmit information. In the digital environment, protocols can create new institutions because they can redefine the rules, syntax, semantics of transactions between parties. I believe we are witnessing a fundamental change in how institutions will operate. I believe we will see new institutions emerge that can better address the needs of a global, digital&nbsp;economy.</p><p>If you asked me I would say the reason institutions see value in bitcoin is because enough people inside them understand bitcoin as a protocol — an integrated system of algorithmic rules that can structure social interactions. They see a chance to fix some really fundamental problems.</p><p>How does this play out? Like most technologically driven change, it will be very slow for some time and then wickedly fast. Institutions almost never want to be first. But it’s equally as true that they don’t want to be last. This snowball will get huge as more and more institutions embrace&nbsp;bitcoin.</p><p>Make no mistake, bitcoin is not (just) money. It’s an alternative financial system in disguise. Bitcoin will not replace banks anymore than the Internet replaced the phone or the cable companies. But it can radically change them for the better. The shift from trust to cryptographic proof will be profound.</p><p>Even with COVID-19 and the political divisions, I’m quite optimistic about the future. Financial institutions embracing Bitcoin means that there is a path to build a more transparent financial future. And if improvements can be made to financial institutions, then other institutions will swallow this pill, too. I would not be surprised if recording value without using a blockchain will be seen as luddite within a&nbsp;decade.</p><p>That’s the macro view. Let me share what this means to Bitmark. In Q3, we spotted a great opportunity for us to build a mobile app and personal data server that makes individual control of Bitcoin safe and easy. I will call this a “Crypto Wallet” from here onward. But please keep in mind that it’s actually a lot more than that. The personal server component, unique to our architecture, will play a critical role in realizing our mission of giving individuals control over all their&nbsp;data.</p><p>In case you don’t use Bitcoin, a “Wallet” is what we call the app that stores the information necessary to transact bitcoins. It’s quite the misnomer. Unlike a physical wallet that actually holds things, a Bitcoin wallet stores the digital credentials for you to access (and spend) and spend your bitcoins. The actual bitcoins are in the cloud — they are inseparable from the blockchain transaction ledger.</p><p>The Bitcoin network uses public-key cryptography for access control. Once you have a bitcoin that is issued (by the miners), all subsequent use is with bearer objects. Control of that bitcoin can be transferred or subdivided to others who can satisfy the requirements of the script (based on either public or private keys) associated with that bitcoin. At its most basic, a Bitcoin wallet is a collection of these&nbsp;keys.</p><p>Managing these keys continues to be one of the most difficult tasks in information security. We are nowhere near a user experience that can go mainstream. People, like me, that do it ourselves have become a bit more experienced and a lot more numb to the risks. When I talk to people that are new to bitcoin they are baffled and bewildered by all of&nbsp;this.</p><p>Most individuals when they understand the problem of key management simply give up and let central intermediaries like Coinbase do it for them. That weakens the security and privacy architecture in Bitcoin. Centralizing keys has led to incidents where exchanges have lost their customers’ assets and then “<a href="https://bitmark.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6ba47d35944fc04102b0e9ae6&amp;id=8f5b059941&amp;e=b5e6fd72f3">compensated</a>” them with an exchange token. (Aka “Shitcoin”.)</p><p>Crypto Wallets are necessary to secure all types of digital assets, not just money. OurBeat is actually a cryptographic wallet and server infrastructure for beats. In our work with Pfizer and UC Berkeley, it became clear that a cryptographic wallet is also critical for advancing the future of healthcare. Right now our data is trapped in institutional silos. If individuals could control their own data they could exchange it directly with institutions for better services. Right now when an institution wants access to your health data they need to contract with other institutions. Competing commercial interests oftentimes prohibits access. As we showed with Pfizer, going direct to the individual radically simplifies that flow. Giving individuals control over their digital assets also helps the bottom line: Compliance with regulations like HIPAA and GDPR are trivial; the transaction is “peer-to-peer”.</p><p>This is why Bitmark is building a mobile app and personal data server to make individual control of digital assets safe and easy. The initial architecture makes individual control over Bitcoin keys safe and easy. This might be surprising to many of you. A fair question to ask is, “Does the world need another bitcoin wallet?” Probably not. However, that misses the point, unless you understand our larger plan. The mission of Bitmark is to give individuals control over their own data. Bitcoin has the biggest user base that pays for control over their data (digital assets). There’s at least 60 million active Bitcoin wallets. These users suffer from complicated and unsafe key management. Bitmark can solve this problem and, in the process, drive down costs and optimize the technology to provide control over any type of data. We can then go down market from Bitcoin users and give individuals control over things they never dreamed possible.</p><p>So in short, the master plan&nbsp;is:</p>  Build a crypto wallet and personal server architecture that makes individual control of Bitcoin safe and&nbsp;easy.  Extend that architecture to provide control of Facebook data. Experiment with ways for individuals to monetize (opt-in).  Extend that architecture again to control more data (eg: health) and more ways to monetize.  <p>The vision is that, in the future, you will carry a crypto wallet that holds not just money and your ID, but also what you like, where you’ve been, your medical records, health data, exercise habits, and more. This wallet will have a multi-dimensional record of who you&nbsp;are.</p><p>We are building on <a href="https://bitmark.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6ba47d35944fc04102b0e9ae6&amp;id=084edb3983&amp;e=b5e6fd72f3">Gordian</a> from Blockchain Commons. Gordian is secure open infrastructure for mobile clients to access Bitcoin full-node services with exceptional security and privacy. After we make the basic Bitcoin features like multisig a joy to use, we will bring in Cryptographic Object Capabilities to the Bitcoin and Bitmark protocols and make more powerful authorizations possible. (That’s what I wrote about in our Q2&nbsp;update.)</p><p>The founder of Blockchain Commons is Christopher Allen. He’s the co-inventor of SSL/TLS — the cryptographic protocol that provides end-to-end security of data sent between applications over the Internet. When your web browser shows the green lock in the address bar you’re using his work. Without TLS, sensitive information such as logins, credit card details, and of course your personal information can be seen by eavesdroppers and hackers. In short, our goal is to bring to that level of safety and security to all types of digital assets, starting with&nbsp;Bitcoin.</p><p>History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes. In the early days of the Internet, we had a collection of protocols for file transfer, email, newsgroups, etc… but we lacked a central place that made the benefits of these protocols accessible to everyday people. That’s why, when the Netscape web browser came out, the Internet rocketed to the mainstream. It wasn’t that Netscape was a radically new piece of technology. Rather, it was a friendly user experience for existing communication protocols that were (previously) difficult to&nbsp;access.</p><p>This Crypto Wallet is a “browser-like” opportunity. Done right, it has the potential to revolutionize our economy and society at a scale that could make the Web seem&nbsp;small.</p><p>That’s all for now. Stay&nbsp;hopeful.</p><p>Best,<br>Sean</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/clean-titles/bitmark-ceo-observations-q3-2020-57b737141de">2020 Q3: Bitmark CEO’s Observations to our Investors</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/clean-titles">Bitmark’s Official Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Our latest feature, private delegation, allows credential issuers to delegate to other entities the ability to issue verifiable credentials.</p><p>We are excited to be making Dock’s credentials delegatable, as we expect this feature to serve many use cases across different industries. For example, a government may want to allow private test centers to manage issuance of certain licenses on its behalf. Or a professional organization may delegate the credentialing authority to online learning platforms, so that the members who complete courses on the platforms can receive verifiable credentials that are officially recognized by the organization.</p><p>This release leverages Dock’s <a href="https://blog.dock.io/dock-completes-claim-deduction-milestone/?utm_source=dock_blog&amp;utm_medium=organic_article&amp;utm_campaign=delegatable-credentials-now-available">claim deduction</a> feature from Q4 2020, which is showcased in our <a href="https://biometrics-demo.dock.io/?utm_source=dock_blog&amp;utm_medium=organic_article&amp;utm_campaign=delegatable-credentials-now-available">biometrics demo</a>.</p><p>How It Works</p><p>Let’s take the first example mentioned above, and imagine that a government would like to delegate to a private testing center, so that the latter can issue professional licenses to the individuals who qualify. In this case, using Dock’s latest feature, the government simply issues a verifiable credential to the testing center. The credential states that the testing center may issue credentials on the government’s behalf.</p><p>When the testing center issues licenses to the individuals who qualify, these verifiable credentials would now be bundled with the credential that the government has issued to the testing center earlier.</p><p>Now, let’s say that an individual has obtained a license from the testing center. When she needs to prove to others that she indeed holds this credential, she would need to present her license to a verifier. When she does this, the verifier is presented with the bundle containing both the verifiable credential and the testing center’s delegation credential. Then the verifier uses Dock’s claim deduction feature to analyze the proof, and determine that the testing center has been authorized to issue the credential on behalf of the government.</p><p>Further technical description of the private delegation feature can be found in our <a href="https://docknetwork.github.io/sdk/tutorials/concepts_private_delegation.html">concept document</a> and <a href="https://docknetwork.github.io/sdk/tutorials/tutorial_private_delegation.html">tutorial</a>. And our open-source code can, as always, be found on <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/">Dock’s GitHub</a>.</p><p>Limitations and Next Steps</p><p>The current release is only the first version of our delegatable credentials feature, and has some limitations: it supports full delegation of credential issuing and sub-delegating rights, without an option to granularly specify what kind of statements &nbsp;the delegatee is allowed to make within the credentials they issue (for example, allow the delegatee to issue only the credentials that certify one’s ability to work as a plumber). The current version also requires the credential holder to store and present the proof of delegation as part of their verifiable credential, without a way for the delegator to publish the delegation and allow it to be freely viewed by others.</p><p>In the upcoming months, we will release further features to support more nuanced delegation, as well as public attestation for delegations. We will continue to work diligently on delivering these updates, and keep the community posted as always. Stay tuned!</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/kuppinger">Martin Kuppinger</a></p> TPG Capital acquiring Thycotic in addition to Centrify, but leaving many questions unanswered 
<p>Mergers and acquisitions are not uncommon in the tech industry, specifically in software. Even in the specialized area of Privileged Access Management (PAM), currently a $1.4bn market according to the KuppingerCole market sizing data, there have been several acquisitions in recent years. Despite its relatively small size, competition within the PAM market is fierce and it attracts startups and investors who realize that PAM has performed a growth spurt in the last years.</p>
<p>This was due to both the ever-increasing cyber-attacks and the challenges imposed by new work and software delivery models, but also due to regulatory compliance and C-SCRM (Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management) challenges. It is a hot market, and predictions are that it will remain a growth market.</p>
 We should welcome investment, but... 
<p>Venture Capital and Private Equity are a valuable part of the tech sector. Without them, many innovative companies would not exist. However, on some occasions we must, as analysts, carefully analyze and, sometimes, criticize the rationale behind their investments.</p>
<p>Sometimes investments make perfect sense. Sometimes, however, they leave you scratching your head. The purchase of Thycotic by TPG Capital and its plan to merge the company into its existing property, Centrify, is one of investments that don’t immediately fit into the first category. And, for legal reasons until official approval of the deal, there won’t be many answers. The official line in the announcement is full of words like synergy, cloud-first, identity platform, best-in-class SaaS platform, etc., but lacks concrete facts.</p>
<p>It describes Thycotic as a “next-generation, cloud-first company with innovative identity security solutions” and Centrify as a “trusted PAM market leader”. The description of Centrify is true. They are one of the market leaders, and this statement also is backed up by its performance in KuppingerCole’s PAM-related <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lc80088/privileged-access-management" title="Leadership Compass reports">Leadership Compass reports</a>.</p>
 Thycotic and Centrify: Both amongst the PAM leaders 
<p>Thycotic is also a leader in PAM, and even outperforms Centrify in some of our report ratings, although the two are closer when measured for <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lc80355/privileged-access-management-for-devops/" title="DevOps capabilities">DevOps capabilities</a>. However, “next generation” and “cloud-first” are bold claims. Thycotic delivers many services to their customers as SaaS, but most are still based on their established Secret Server product. On the other hand, Thycotic has cloud-native offerings in the portfolio such as their Account Lifecycle Manager (ALM) and DevOps Secret vault. Overall, based on its activity in the last 12 months, Thycotic, despite these claims, seems the more innovative of the two. But “next generation”? Partially yes, without any doubt, but not (yet) in all areas.</p>
<p>Thycotic too, was on the acquisition trail in 2020 when it purchased CASB startup OnionID to add that functionality to its PAM suite, an excellent purchase and one easily integrated. It signed an OEM deal with IBM to provide a white-label version of its PAM platform – a deal that has benefited both parties. Its management and active road map seemed in a good place.</p>
 A merger of equals – not a takeover 
<p>As aforementioned, TPG Capital is acquiring Thycotic in addition to Centrify, with the intent of merging the two companies in what we would rate as a merger of equals. Centrify, while showing good progress and continuing to be amongst the PAM leaders, may not have shown the same levelheadedness as Thycotic. On the other hand, with the split of the IDaaS (Identity as a Service) business now being Idaptive, Centrify is fully focused on PAM for quite a while now. It has had three ownerships in three years. And three (or, more correctly, two) different CEOs. The latest, industry veteran Art Gilliland is set to take over the reins of the newly merged business. He is #3, but became CEO just at the day of the announcement of the Thycotic acquisition by TPG, now being in charge of leading the integration. This, amongst others, is a clear indicator for a merger of equals, not a take-over of one by the other.</p>
<p>The general question in every merger is whether synergies will be leveraged. Is the approach taken by TPG the right or wrong way around for merging companies? As usual, there is a danger that the innovations that Thycotic displayed will be lost in the familiar process of merging the two companies two sets of PAM technologies with considerable overlap (but also several uniquenesses), and all that entails. There also is a danger that some of the Centrify’s strength will suffer. But the setup chosen by TPG is focused on avoiding these scenarios, despite all the buzzwords used in the official announcement.</p>
 Cui bono? 
<p>At the end, the bottom line is whether it is good for the customer. The answer is unclear yet, until more concrete plans are announced (which, as mentioned ahead, has to wait until formal approval of the deal). It is arguably good for TPG Capital to effectively neutralize a rival, but it means less choice for the customer – especially at the enterprise level. There always remains a risk for the companies and products if the merger runs into difficulties.</p>
<p>On the other hand, TPG Capital has a reputation for longer-term strategic investments, thus this can turn into leveraging synergies, which we consider being a lot more likely. But we don’t know yet, and as of now, there (for the aforementioned reasons) has been no strategy and roadmap published. In other words: For now, we are in a phase of uncertainty, but with some positive hints when looking at the details, and behind the scenes.</p>
 Wait until the dust settles 
<p>Our advice for organizations currently in the process of making decisions in the PAM space is to wait until the dust has settled and both transition and integration roadmaps are published. Ask also the other vendors to explain their roadmap and longer-term strategy. While there is yet a lot of uncertainty regarding the future of the mutual products and the strategy, there appears being a plan behind the acquisition.</p>
<p>For existing customers, the same holds true. With two vendors with largely overlapping product portfolios merging, the risk of one of the products disappearing exists. But there are also opportunities, with two strong vendors joining forces. Thus, before making decisions in a hurry: Better wait a little, until Centrify and Thycotic tell us about their plans, and then decide based on that.</p>

  <p>NestJS is a node.js framework that boasts the ability to build efficient, reliable, and scalable applications.  A NestJS application can serve as the backend for your SPA.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you will use React, one of the most popular javascript front-end libraries available to build your SPA, and then use NestJS for your server.  To secure everything, you will level Okta’s simple and powerful single sign-on provider.</p>

<p>You will learn how to authenticate a user to React using Okta.  Okta will then issue a JWT to your SPA, which you can relay to the NestJS application.  NestJS is built with external libraries in mind, meaning it’s straightforward to use Okta’s JWT verifier to validate the JWT and ensure the user is authorized to access the resources on your server.</p>

<p></p>

 Create your Okta Application 

<p>To start, you will need a forever-free Okta developer’s account.  If you don’t have one, you can <a href="https://developer.okta.com/developer/signup/">sign up here</a>.  For this tutorial, you will be creating your application using Okta’s new CLI tool.  If you haven’t used it before, I highly encourage you to check out <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2020/12/10/introducing-okta-cli">this tutorial</a> or check out the <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">official documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Once you are logged into the CLI, run <code>okta apps create</code> and begin the setup.  Give your application a meaningful name; I called my <code>nest-js</code>.  Next select Single Page App.  Change your Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:3000/callback</code> and your Post Logout Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:3000/</code>. The CLI will return your Issuer and Client ID.  Make note of both of these as you will need them in your applications.</p>

 Create your React Application 

<p>Now that you have your application set up in Okta, you can create your React application.  For this, you can use the <code>create-react-app</code> task runner. Use <code>npx create-react-app nestjs-frontend</code> to begin your application set up.  For this project, I named my react app nestjs-frontend, but you can name yours whatever you like.</p>

<p>After the task runner has scaffolded React for you it’s time to install a few packages.  First, install <code>bootstrap</code> since it’s a nice, easy CSS library.</p>

   <code>npm i bootstrap@4.5.3
</code>   

<p>Okta provides a couple of useful libraries to help facilitate securing your application.  You will want to install these next.</p>

   <code>npm i @okta/okta-auth-js@4.7.2
npm i @okta/okta-react@4.1.0
</code>   

<p>You’ll also be using a library that allows you to use a local file to store properties that will be read as environment variables in React, called <code>dotenv</code>.</p>

   <code>npm i dotenv@8.2.0
</code>   

<p>The last step before coding your application is to set up your <code>.env</code> file.  Add a new file called <code>.env</code> to the root of your front-end application and add the following values to it.</p>

   <code>REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID={yourOktaClientId}
REACT_APP_OKTA_URL_BASE={yourOktaDomain}
REACT_APP_OKTA_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
REACT_APP_SERVER_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
PORT=3000
</code>   

<p>You will plug in the Okta CLI client ID you received earlier and your Okta organization URL (e.g. https://dev-123456.okta.com).</p>

<p>Next, add a file to your <code>src</code> folder called <code>AppWithRouterAccess.jsx</code>.  Add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import { Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Security, LoginCallback } from '@okta/okta-react';
import { OktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';

import Home from './Pages/Home'

const AppWithRouterAccess = () =&gt; {
  const issuer =  process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_URL_BASE + '/oauth2/default'
  const clientId = process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID;
  const redirect = process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_APP_BASE_URL + '/callback';

  const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
    issuer: issuer,
    clientId: clientId,
    redirectUri: redirect
  });

  return (
    &lt;Security oktaAuth={oktaAuth}&gt;
      &lt;Route path='/' exact={true} component={Home} /&gt;
      &lt;Route path='/callback' component={LoginCallback} /&gt;
    &lt;/Security&gt;
  );
};
export default AppWithRouterAccess;
</code>   

<p>This class provides the setup for your application’s authentication.  It wraps your application in a <code>Security</code> component that’s initialized with your Okta settings.  That way you will have access to the <code>oktaAuth</code> object on any of the paths defined within.</p>

<p>Next, open your <code>app.js</code> file and replace the code with the following.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';
import AppWithRouterAccess from './AppWithRouterAccess';
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';

const App = () =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;Router&gt;
      &lt;AppWithRouterAccess/&gt;
    &lt;/Router&gt;
  );
}

export default App;
</code>   

<p>Here you are using the <code>AppWithRouterAccess</code> you just created.  This is also the appropriate place to import <code>bootstrap</code> to use with your application.</p>

<p>Next, add a folder called <code>Components</code> and add a file called <code>Header.jsx</code>.  Add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>import React from "react";
import { useOktaAuth } from "@okta/okta-react";

const Header = () =&gt; {
  const { oktaAuth, authState } = useOktaAuth();

  if (authState.isPending) {
    return &lt;div&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;;
  }

  const button = authState.isAuthenticated ? (
    &lt;button
      className="btn btn-secondary"
      onClick={() =&gt; {
        oktaAuth.signOut("/");
      }}
      &gt;
      Logout
    &lt;/button&gt;
    ) : (
    &lt;button
      className="btn btn-secondary"
      onClick={() =&gt; {
        oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect();
      }}
    &gt;
      Login
    &lt;/button&gt;
  );

  return (
    &lt;div className="navbar" bg="light" expand="lg"&gt;
      &lt;div className="navbar" href="/"&gt;
        NestJS To Do List
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div className="navbar" aria-controls="basic-navbar-nav"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div className="navbar" id="basic-navbar-nav"&gt;
        &lt;div className="navbar mr-auto"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;form className="inline"&gt;{button}&lt;/form&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};
export default Header;
</code>   

<p>This header provides a title for the website and a button for logging in or out, depending on the value of <code>authState.isAuthenticated</code>.  The button then uses the <code>oktaAuth</code> object to call <code>signOut</code> or <code>signInWithRedirect</code>, depending on which is appropriate.  The <code>signInWithRedirect</code> function will redirect the user to the Okta-hosted login page and return the authentication information to the callback you defined in <code>AppWithRouterAccess</code> before.  Once the user signs in, you will have access to the requested authentication details.</p>

<p>In that same folder, add a file called <code>ToDoList.jsx</code> and add the following code.</p>

   <code>import React from "react";

const ToDoList = ({ authState, list, onCompleteItem }) =&gt; {
  if (!authState.isAuthenticated) {
    return (
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          Hey there, it looks like you aren't logged in yet. To log in, click here.
        &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    );
  } else if (!list) {
    return &lt;div className="container"&gt;Loading....&lt;/div&gt;;
  }

  return (
    &lt;div className="container"&gt;
      &lt;table className="table table-striped"&gt;
        &lt;thead&gt;
          &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;Task&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th width="15%"&gt;Complete&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/thead&gt;
        &lt;tbody&gt;
        {list.map((item, i) =&gt; {
          return (
            &lt;tr key={i}&gt;
              &lt;td&gt;{item.text}&lt;/td&gt;
              &lt;td&gt;
                &lt;button className="btn btn-primary" onClick={() =&gt; onCompleteItem(item)}&gt;
                  Complete
                &lt;/button&gt;
              &lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;
          );
        })}
      &lt;/tbody&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};
export default ToDoList;
</code>   

<p>This component does a couple of things.  First, it checks if the user is authenticated and, if not, directs them to log in.  In practice, the user should never see this because the <code>Home</code> page you will implement shortly will prevent this.  It also checks if <code>list</code> is populated.  If not, it displays a message that your application is loading.  Finally, if the list exists then, it shows it in a simple table.  The table has a column with a button for marking the items complete.  The logic for this will also be on your <code>Home</code> page.</p>

<p>You will want to implement that next.  Add a folder called <code>Pages</code> and add a file to that folder called <code>Home.jsx</code>.  This is a relatively simple application, and you will only have one page.  Add the following code to that file.</p>

   <code>import React, { Component } from "react";
import { withOktaAuth } from "@okta/okta-react";
import ToDoList from "../Components/ToDoList";
import Header from "../Components/Header";

export default withOktaAuth(class Home extends Component {
  constructor(props, context) {
    super(props, context);

    this.state = {
      list: undefined,
      loadingList: false,
    };

    this.markItemAsComplete = this.markItemAsComplete.bind();
  }

  componentDidMount = () =&gt; {
    this.getCurrentItems();
  };

  componentDidUpdate = (prevProps, prevState, snapshot) =&gt; {
    this.getCurrentItems();

  getCurrentItems() {
    if (
      this.props.authState.isAuthenticated &amp;&amp;
      !this.state.list &amp;&amp;
      !this.state.loadingList
    ) {
      this.setState({
        loadingList: true,
      });

      var itemsUrl = process.env.REACT_APP_SERVER_BASE_URL + "/todolist";

      fetch(itemsUrl, {
        method: "get",
        headers: new Headers({

          console.log(error);
          this.setState({ loadingList: false });

    }
  }

  markItemAsComplete = (item) =&gt; {
    var itemsUrl = process.env.REACT_APP_SERVER_BASE_URL + "/todolist";

    var data = {
      id: item.id
    };

    fetch(itemsUrl, {
      method: "post",
      headers: new Headers({
        Authorization: "bearer " + this.props.authState.accessToken.value,

    .then((result) =&gt; {

        var list = this.state.list.filter(function (i) {
          return i.id !== item.id;
        });

        this.setState({ list: list });
      }
    },
    (error) =&gt; {
      console.log(error);
    });

</code>   

<p>Here you have a <code>getCurrentItems()</code> function that gets called when the component is loaded.  This uses <code>fetch()</code> to contain the server you defined in your <code>.env</code> file.  That server isn’t operational yet, but that’s where your NestJS application will be.  Similarly, there is a function for <code>markItemAsComplete()</code>.  This function will also call your NestJS application and request the item selected to be marked as complete; then, it will remove the item from the table.  This is injected into the <code>ToDoList.jsx</code> component from before.  Finally, if your user isn’t authenticated, you will display a small welcome page for the user.</p>

<p>At this point, you can now run <code>npm run start</code> and let your application load.  Your lists won’t load, but you should be able to see the application.</p>

<p></p>

 Create your NestJS Application 

<p>Now it’s time to get the backend written for your application.  Navigate back to your root directory.  If you haven’t installed the NestJS CLI yet, then now is the time.  Run <code>npm i -g @nestjs/cli</code> and wait for that to complete.  Next, run <code>nest new nestjs-backend</code> to create a new nest project next to your frontend React app.  I named mine nestjs-backend, but you can call yours whatever is meaningful to you. You’ll be asked to choose which package manager you want to use. Choose <code>npm</code> to use all the commands that follow.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: You may get some <code>WARNING</code> messages when running the NestJS CLI or installing dependencies. This seems to be related to npm version 7+ and doesn’t seem to affect the application.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This process takes a moment, but you can begin to install your packages once it’s complete.</p>

<p>First, as usual, install <code>dotenv</code>.</p>

   <code>npm i dotenv@8.2.0
</code>   

<p>Next, you will need a few packages for authenticating your user and setting up the auth modules.  To do this, you will level <code>passport</code> and Okta’s jwt verifier.  You can install these now.</p>

   <code>npm i passport@0.4.1
npm i passport-http-bearer@1.0.1
npm i @nestjs/passport@7.1.5
npm i @okta/jwt-verifier@1.0.1
</code>   

<p>Next, add a file to the root of your backend directory called <code>.env</code> and add the following code.</p>

   <code>OKTA_CLIENTID={yourOktaClientId}
OKTA_ISSUER={yourOktaIssuer}
OKTA_AUDIENCE=api://default
APP_DOMAIN=http://localhost:3001
</code>   

<p>You will plug in your client ID and issuer you received from the Okta CLI earlier.</p>

<p>Now, open your <code>src</code> folder.  The rest of this tutorial will take place there.</p>

<p>In <code>src</code> you’ll see a file called <code>main.ts</code>.  Replace the code in there with the following.</p>

   <code>import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
  app.enableCors();
  await app.listen(3001);
}
bootstrap();
console.log('app started');
</code>   

<p>Most of this code is boilerplate from NestJS, although you are also enabling CORS so that your React application can make requests to this server.  To avoid conflicts, you changed the port this application is running on to <code>3001</code>.  This should match what your React application is expecting to call.</p>

<p>Next, open <code>app.service.ts</code> and replace the code with the following.</p>

   <code>import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class AppService {
  getToDoList(): any[] {
    return [
      {
        id: 1,
        text: 'Clean the dishes',
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        text: 'Cook Dinner',
      },
      {
        id: 3,
        text: 'Take out the trash',
      },
      {
        id: 4,
        text: 'Legdrop off the ropes',
      },
      {
        id: 5,
        text: 'Brush your teeth',
      },
    ];
  }

  markAsComplete(id: any): any {
    console.log(id);

    return {
      success: true,
      error: '',
    };
  }
}
</code>   

<p>The service component here defines the logic for the <code>markAsComplete()</code> and <code>getToDoList()</code> methods.  These are stubbed out, but you can connect them to a persistent storage if you want.</p>

<p>Next, replace the code in <code>app.module.ts</code> with the following.</p>

   <code>import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppController } from './app.controller';
import { AppService } from './app.service';
import { AuthModule } from './auth/auth.module';

@Module({
  imports: [AuthModule],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService],
})
export class AppModule {}
</code>   

<p>The change here from the stock code is that you are now listing <code>AuthModule</code> as an import.  This should throw an error at this point since you haven’t created the auth module yet.</p>

<p>Finally, edit your <code>app.controller.ts</code> to the code below.</p>

   <code>import { Controller, Get, Post, UseGuards, Body } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppService } from './app.service';
import { AuthGuard } from '@nestjs/passport';

@Controller()
export class AppController {
  constructor(private readonly appService: AppService) {}

  @Get('/todolist')
  @UseGuards(AuthGuard('bearer'))
  getToDoList(): any[] {
    return this.appService.getToDoList();
  }

  @Post('/todolist')
  @UseGuards(AuthGuard('bearer'))
  markAsComplete(@Body() id: any): any {
    return this.appService.markAsComplete(id);
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Here you are defining your routes and the logic within them.  The syntax here is pretty self-explanatory.  You can decorate methods with <code>@Get</code> or <code>@Post</code> (or, of course, any HTTP Method) and provide a route in the argument.  Next, you are using the <code>AuthGuard()</code> guard.  You have injected the <code>app.service.ts</code> class with the <code>app.module.ts</code> and, in the constructor of this controller, you’ve accepted that argument.  Now you can call the <code>getToDoList()</code> or <code>markAsComplete()</code> methods in the service.</p>

<p>Now, you will need to set up your auth module. First, you need to access the config variables found in <code>.env</code>.  NestJS prefers you inject the configuration rather than accessing with <code>process.env</code>, so start by creating a folder under <code>src</code> called <code>config</code>.</p>

<p>Add a file for <code>config.module.ts</code> and add the following code.</p>

   <code>import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';

import { ConfigService } from './config.service';

@Module({
  providers: [
    {
      provide: ConfigService,
      useValue: new ConfigService(`${process.env.NODE_ENV || ''}.env`),
    },
  ],
  exports: [ConfigService],
})
export class ConfigModule {}
</code>   

<p>This class allows you to inject the <code>ConfigService</code> into other classes that need access to it.  Create the <code>config.service.ts</code> file in the same directory and add the <code>ConfigService</code> code found below.</p>

   <code>import * as dotenv from 'dotenv';
import * as fs from 'fs';

export class ConfigService {
  private readonly envConfig: { [key: string]: string };

  constructor(filePath: string) {
    this.envConfig = dotenv.parse(fs.readFileSync(filePath));
  }

  get(key: string): string {
    return this.envConfig[key];
  }
}
</code>   

<p>This class provides the logic for getting the values from the <code>.env</code> file by parsing the file and returning the value based on the key.</p>

<p>You are all set up now to complete the authentication portion of your application.  Under your <code>src</code> folder, add a folder called <code>auth</code> and add a file for <code>auth.module.ts</code> with the following code.</p>

   <code>import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';

import { ConfigModule } from '../config/config.module';
import { AuthService } from './auth.service';
import { HttpStrategy } from './http.strategy';

@Module({
  imports: [ConfigModule],
  providers: [HttpStrategy, AuthService],
})
export class AuthModule {}
</code>   

<p>This should start becoming a pattern for you.  The module defines the imports and providers for the class.  Next, add the <code>auth.service.ts</code> file to the same folder and add the following code.</p>

   <code>import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import * as OktaJwtVerifier from '@okta/jwt-verifier';

import { ConfigService } from '../config/config.service';

@Injectable()
export class AuthService {
  private oktaVerifier: any;
  private audience: string;

  constructor(private readonly config: ConfigService) {
    this.oktaVerifier = new OktaJwtVerifier({
      issuer: config.get('OKTA_ISSUER'),
      clientId: config.get('OKTA_CLIENTID'),
    });

    this.audience = config.get('OKTA_AUDIENCE');
  }

  async validateToken(token: string): Promise&lt;any&gt; {
    const jwt = await this.oktaVerifier.verifyAccessToken(token, this.audience);
    return jwt;
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Once again, the service will contain the actual logic for your module.  Here you are using Okta’s JWT verifier to verify the token.  You don’t even need to parse any information from the token.  If the token is invalid, then <code>oktaVerifier</code> will throw an exception that you can catch later on.  This piece simply takes your issuer, clientId, audience and validates your token against it.</p>

<p>Finally, add <code>http.strategy.ts</code> to the same folder.  The code for this is below.</p>

   <code>import { HttpException, Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { PassportStrategy } from '@nestjs/passport';
import { Strategy } from 'passport-http-bearer';

import { AuthService } from './auth.service';

@Injectable()
export class HttpStrategy extends PassportStrategy(Strategy) {
  constructor(private readonly authService: AuthService) {
    super();
  }

  async validate(
    token: string,
    done: (error: HttpException, value: boolean | string) =&gt; any,
  ) {
    try {
      return await this.authService.validateToken(token);
    } catch (error) {
      done(error, 'The token is not valid');
    }
  }
}
</code>   

<p>This class ties everything together.  It is registered as a provider for the auth module, which is injected into the app controller, which uses the <code>AuthGuard</code> that looks for a passport strategy to tell it how to authenticate the user.  In this case, using your auth service class that knows how to use the Okta JWT Verifier.</p>

<p>Now you can run <code>nest start,</code> and this application should be ready to start.</p>

 Test and Run 

<p>You can now go back to your React application and login with your Okta account information.  Once you do that, you will be showing the to-do list with the items that you stubbed out in the app service class.</p>

<p>The evolution of identity on the web is happening at a rapid pace, with many different projects and efforts converging around similar ideas with their own interpretations and constraints. It can be difficult to parse through all of these developments while the dust hasn’t completely settled, but looking at these issues holistically, we can see a much bigger pattern emerging. In fact, many of the modern innovations related to identity on the web are actually quite connected and build upon each other in a myriad of complementary ways.</p><p>The rise of OpenID&nbsp;Connect</p><p>The core of modern identity is undoubtedly <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a> (OIDC), the de-facto standard for user authentication and identity protocol on the internet. It’s a protocol that enables developers building apps and services to verify the identity of their users and obtain basic profile information about them in order to create an authenticated user experience. Because OIDC is an identity layer built on top of the OAuth 2.0 framework, it can also be used as an authorization solution. Its development was significant for many reasons, in part because it came with the realization that identity on the web is fundamental to many different kinds of interactions, and these interactions need simple and powerful security features that are ubiquitous and accessible. Secure digital identity is a problem that doesn’t make sense to solve over and over again in different ways with each new application, but instead needs a standard and efficient mechanism that’s easy to use and works for the majority of&nbsp;people.</p><p>OpenID Connect introduced a convenient and accessible protocol for identity that required less setup and complexity for developers building different kinds of applications and programs. In many ways, protocols like OIDC and <a href="https://oauth.net/2/">OAuth 2.0</a> piggy-backed on the revolution that was underfoot in the mid 2000’s as developers fled en-mass from web based systems heavily reliant on technologies like XML (and consequently identity systems built upon these technologies like SAML), for simpler systems based on JSON. OpenID built on the success of OAuth and offered a solution that improved upon existing identity and web security technologies which were vulnerable to attacks like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping">screen scraping</a>. This shift towards a solution built upon modern web technologies with an emphasis on being easy-to-use created ripe conditions for adoption of these web standards.</p><p>OIDC’s success has categorically sped up both the web and native application development cycle when it comes to requiring the integration of identity, and as a result, users have now grown accustomed to having sign-in options aplenty with all their favorite products and services. It’s not intuitively clear to your average user why they need so many different logins and it’s up to the user to manage which identities they use with which services, but the system works and provides a relatively reliable way to integrate identity on the&nbsp;web.</p><p>Success and its unintended consequences</p><p>While OIDC succeeded in simplicity and adoption, what has emerged over time are a number of limitations and challenges that have come as a result of taking these systems to a global&nbsp;scale.</p><p>When it comes to the market for consumer identity, there are generally three main actors&nbsp;present:</p>  Identity Providers  Relying Parties  End-Users  <p>The forces in the market that cause their intersection to exist are complex, but can be loosely broken down into the interaction between each pair of&nbsp;actors.</p><p>In order for an End-User to be able to “login” to a website today, the “sweet spot” must exist where each of these sets of requirements are&nbsp;met.</p><p>The negotiation between these three parties usually plays out on the relying party’s login page. It’s this precious real-estate that drives these very distinct market&nbsp;forces.</p><p>Anti-competitive market&nbsp;forces</p><p>In typical deployments of OIDC, in order for a user to be able to “login” to a relying party or service they’re trying to access online, the relying party must be in direct contact with the Identity Provider (IdP). This is what’s come to be known as the <a href="https://github.com/WICG/WebID#the-idp-tracking-problem">IdP tracking problem</a>. It’s the IdP that’s responsible for performing end-user authentication and issuing end-user identities to relying parties, not the end-users themselves. Over time, these natural forces in OIDC have created an environment that tends to favour the emergence and continued growth of a small number of very large IdPs. These IdPs wield a great deal of power, as they have become a critical dependency and intermediary for many kinds of digital interactions that require identity.</p><p>This environment prevents competition and diversity amongst IdPs in exchange for a convenience-driven technology framework where user data is controlled and managed in a few central locations. The market conditions have made it incredibly difficult for new IdPs to break into the market. For example, when Apple unveiled their “Sign in with Apple” service, they used their position as a proprietary service provider to mandate their inclusion as a third party sign in option for any app or service that was supporting federated login on Apple devices. This effectively guaranteed adoption of their OpenID-based solution, allowing them to easily capture a portion of the precious real-estate that is the login screen of thousands of modern web apps today. This method of capturing the market is indicative of a larger challenge wherein the environment of OIDC has made it difficult for newer and smaller players in the IdP ecosystem to participate with existing vendors on an equal playing&nbsp;field.</p><p>Identity as a secondary concern has primary consequences</p><p>Another key issue in the current landscape is that for nearly all modern IdPs, being an identity provider is often a secondary function to their primary line of business. Though they have come to wear many different hats, many of the key IdPs’ primary business function is offering some service to end-users (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Google, etc.). Their role as IdPs is something that emerged over time, and with it has surfaced a whole new set of responsibilities whose impact we are only just beginning to grapple&nbsp;with.</p><p>Due to this unequal relationship, developers and businesses who want to integrate identity in their applications are forced to choose those IdPs which contain user data for their target demographics, instead of offering options for IdP selection based on real metrics around responsible and privacy-preserving identity practices for end-users.</p><p>This cycle perpetuates the dominance of a few major IdPs and likewise forces users to keep choosing from the same set of options or risk losing access to all of their online accounts. In addition, many of these IdPs have leveraged their role as central intermediaries to increase surveillance and user behavior tracking, not just across their proprietary services, but across a user’s entire web experience. The net result of this architecture on modern systems is that IdPs have become a locus for centralized data storage and processing.</p><p>The privacy implications associated with the reliance on a central intermediary who can delete, control, or expose user data at any time have proven to be no small matter. New regulations such as <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> and <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">CCPA</a> have brought user privacy to the forefront and have spurred lots of public discourse and pressure for companies to manage their data processing policies against more robust standards. The regulatory and business environment that is forming around GDPR and CCPA is pushing the market to consider better solutions that may involve decentralizing the mode of operation or separating the responsibilities of an&nbsp;IdP.</p><p>Identity Provider&nbsp;lock-in</p><p>Lastly, in today’s landscape there is an inseparable coupling between an End-User and the IdP they use. This effectively means that, in order to transfer from say “Sign In With Google” to “Sign In With Twitter,” a user often has to start over and build their identity from scratch. This is due to the fact that users are effectively borrowing or renting their identities from their IdPs, and hence have little to no control in exercising that identity how they see fit. This model creates a pattern that unnecessarily ties a user to the application and data ecosystem of their IdP and means they must keep an active account with the provider to keep using their identity. If a user can’t access to their account with an IdP, say by losing access to their Twitter profile, they can no longer login to any of the services where they’re using Twitter as their&nbsp;IdP.</p><p>One of the problems with the term Identity Provider itself is that it sets up the assumption that the end-user is being provided with an identity, rather than the identity being theirs or under their control. If end-users have no real choice in selecting their IdP, then they are ultimately subject to the whims of a few very large and powerful companies. This model is not only antithetical to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/06/technology/congress-big-tech-monopoly-power.html">anti-trust</a> policies and legislation, it also prevents data portability between platforms. It’s made it abundantly clear that the paradigm shift on end-user privacy practices needs to start by giving users a baseline level of choice when it comes to their identity.</p><p>A nod to an alternative model</p><p>Fundamentally, when it comes to identity on the web, users should have choice; choice about which services they employ to facilitate the usage of their digital identities along with being empowered to change these service providers if they so&nbsp;choose.</p><p>The irony of OpenID Connect is that the original authors did actually consider these problems, and evidence of this can be found in the original OIDC specification: in chapter 7, entitled “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SelfIssued">Self Issued OpenID Provider</a>” (SIOP).</p><p>Earning its name primarily from the powerful idea that users could somehow be their own identity provider, SIOP was an ambitious attempt at solving a number of different problems at once. It raises some major questions about the future of the protocol, but it stops short of offering an end-to-end solution to these complex problems.</p><p>As it stands in the core specification, the SIOP chapter of OIDC was really trying to solve 3 significant, but distinct problems, which&nbsp;are:</p>  Enabling portable/transferable identities between providers  Dealing with different deployment models for OpenID providers  Solving the <a href="https://indieweb.org/NASCAR_problem">Nascar&nbsp;Problem</a>  <p>SIOP has recently been of strong interest to those in the decentralized or self-sovereign identity community because it’s been identified as a <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/if-you-build-an-island-youll-need-a-boat-537f48525edc">potential pathway</a> to transitioning existing deployed digital infrastructure towards a more decentralized and user-centric model. As discussion is ongoing at the <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OpenID Foundation</a> to evolve and reboot the work around SIOP, there are a number of interesting questions raised by this chapter that are worth exploring to their full extent. For starters, SIOP questions some of the fundamental assumptions around the behaviour and deployment of an&nbsp;IdP.</p><p>OpenID and OAuth typically use a redirect mechanism to relay a request from a relying party to an IdP. OAuth supports redirecting back to a native app for the end-user, but it assumes that the provider itself always takes the form of an HTTP server, and furthermore it assumes the request is primarily handled server-side. SIOP challenged this assumption by questioning whether the identity provider has to be entirely server-side, or if the provider could instead take the form of a Single-Page Application (SPA), Progressive Web Application (PWA), or even a native application. In creating a precedent for improving upon the IdP model, SIOP was asking fundamental questions such as: who gets to pick the provider? What role does the end-user play in this selection process? Does the provider always need to be an authorization server or is there a more decentralized model available that is resilient from certain modes of compromise?</p><p>Although some of these questions remain unanswered or are early in development, the precedent set by SIOP has spurred a number of related developments in and around web identity. Work is ongoing at the OpenID Foundation to flesh out the implications of SIOP in the emerging landscape.</p><p>Tech giants capitalize on the conversation</p><p>Although OIDC is primarily a web-based identity protocol, it was purposefully designed to be independent of any particular browser feature or API. This separation of concerns has proved incredibly useful in enabling adoption of OIDC outside of web-only environments, but it has greatly limited the ability for browser vendors to facilitate and mediate web-based login events. A number of large technology and browser vendors have picked up on this discrepancy, and are starting to take ownership of the role they play in web-based user interactions.</p><p>Notably, a number of new initiatives have been introduced in the last few years to address this gap in user privacy on the web. An example of this can be found in the <a href="https://tag.w3.org/">W3C Technical Architecture Group</a> (TAG), a group tasked with documenting and building consensus around the architecture of the World Wide Web. Ahead of the 2019 <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/09/TPAC/">W3C TPAC</a> in Japan, Apple proposed an initiative called <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webappsec/2019Sep/0004.html">IsLoggedIn</a>, effectively a way for websites to tell the browser whether the user was logged in or not in a trustworthy way. What they realized is that the behavior of modern web architecture results in users being “logged in by default” to websites they visit, even if they only visit a website once. Essentially as soon as the browser loads a webpage, that page can store data about the user indefinitely on the device, with no clear mechanism for indicating when a user has logged out or wishes to stop sharing their data. They introduced an API that would allow browsers to set the status of user log-ins to limit long term storage of user data. It was a vision that required broad consensus among today’s major web browsers to be successful. Ultimately, the browsers have taken their own approach in trying to mitigate the&nbsp;issue.</p><p>In 2019, Google created their <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/building-a-more-private-web/">Privacy Sandbox</a> initiative to advance user privacy on the web using open and transparent standards. As one of the largest web browsers on the planet, Google Chrome seized the opportunity provided by an increased public focus on user privacy to work on limiting cross-site user tracking and pervasive incentives that encourage surveillance. Fuelled by the Privacy Sandbox initiative, they created a project called <a href="https://wicg.github.io/WebID/README.html">WebID</a> to explore how the browser can mediate between different parties in a digital identity transaction. WebID is an early attempt to get in the middle of the interaction that happens between a relying party and an IdP, allowing the browser to facilitate the transaction in a way that provides stronger privacy guarantees for the end-user.</p><p>As an overarching effort, it’s in many ways a response to the environment created by CCPA and GDPR where technology vendors like Google are attempting to enforce privacy expectations for end-users while surfing the web. Its goal is to keep protocols like OIDC largely intact while using the browser as a mediator to provide a stronger set of guarantees when it comes to user identities. This may ultimately give end-users more privacy on the web, but it doesn’t exactly solve the problem of users being locked into their IdPs. With the persistent problem of data portability and limited user choices, simply allowing the browser to mediate the interaction is an important piece of the puzzle but does not go far enough on its&nbsp;own.</p><p>Going beyond the current state of OpenID&nbsp;Connect</p><p>Though it is a critical component of modern web identity, OIDC is not by any means the only solution or protocol to attempt to solve these kinds of problems.</p><p>A set of emerging standards from the W3C Credentials Community Group aim to look at identity on the web in a very different way, and, in fact, are designed to consider use cases outside of just consumer identity. One such standard is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs) which defines a new type of identifier and accompanying data model featuring several novel properties not present in most mainstream identifier schemes in use today. Using DIDs in tandem with technologies like <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs) creates an infrastructure for a more distributed and decentralized layer for identity on the web, enabling a greater level of user control. VCs were created as the newest in a long line of cryptographically secured data representation formats. Their goal was to provide a standard that improves on its predecessors by accommodating formal data semantics through technologies like JSON-LD and addressing the role of data subjects in managing and controlling data about themselves.</p><p>These standards have emerged in large part to address the limitations of federated identity systems such as the one provided by OIDC. In the case of DIDs, the focus has been on creating a more resilient kind of user-controllable identifier. These kinds of identifiers don’t have to be borrowed or rented from an IdP as is the case today, but can instead be directly controlled by the entities they represent via cryptography in a consistent and standard way. When combining these two technologies, VCs and DIDs, we enable verifiable information that has a cryptographic binding to the end-user and can be transferred cross-context while retaining its security and semantics.</p><p>As is the case with many emerging technologies, in order to be successful in an existing and complicated market, these new standards should have a cohesive relationship to the present. To that end, there has been a significant push to bridge these emerging technologies with the existing world of OIDC in a way that doesn’t break existing implementations and encourages interoperability.</p><p>One prominent example of this is a new extension to OIDC known as <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">OpenID Connect Credential Provider</a>. Current OIDC flows result in the user receiving an identity token which is coupled to the IdP that created it, and can be used to prove the user’s identity within a specific domain. OIDC Credential Provider allows you to extend OIDC to allow IdPs to issue reusable VCs about the end-user instead of simple identity tokens with limited functionality. It allows end-users to request credentials from an OpenID Provider and manage their own credentials in a <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/concepts/digital-wallets">digital wallet</a> under their control. By allowing data authorities to be the provider of reusable digital credentials instead of simple identity assertions, this extension effectively turns traditional Identity Providers into Credential Providers.</p><p>The credentials provided under this system are cryptographically bound to a public key controlled by the end-user. In addition to public key binding, the credential can instead be bound to a DID, adding a layer of indirection between a user’s identity and the keys they use to control it. In binding to a DID, the subject of the credential is able to maintain ownership of the credential on a longer life cycle due to their ability to manage and rotate keys while maintaining a consistent identifier. This eases the burden on data authorities to re-issue credentials when the subject’s keys change and allows relying parties to verify that the credential is always being validated against the current public key of the end-user. The innovations upon OIDC mark a shift from a model where relying parties request claims from an IdP, to one where they can request claims from specific issuers or according to certain <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/concepts/trust-frameworks">trust frameworks</a> and evaluation metrics appropriate to their use case. This kind of policy-level data management creates a much more predictable and secure way for businesses and people to get the data they&nbsp;need.</p><p>OIDC Credential Provider, a new spec at the OpenID Foundation, is challenging the notion that the identity that a user receives has to be an identity entirely bound to its domain. It offers traditional IdPs a way to issue credentials that are portable and can cross domains because the identity/identifier is no longer coupled to the provider as is the case with an identity token. <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/introducing-oidc-credential-provider-7845391a9881">This work</a> serves to further bridge the gap between existing digital identity infrastructure and emerging technologies which are more decentralized and user-centric. It sets the foundation for a deeper shift in how data is managed online, whether it comes in the form of identity claims, authorizations, or other kinds of <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/concepts/verifiable-data">verifiable data</a>.</p><p>Broadening the landscape of digital&nbsp;identity</p><p>OIDC, which is primarily used for identity, is built upon OAuth 2.0, whose primary use is authorization and access. If OIDC is about who the End-User is, then OAuth 2.0 is about what you’re allowed to do on behalf of and at the consent of the End-User. OAuth 2.0 was built prior to OIDC, in many ways because authorization allowed people to accomplish quite a bit without the capabilities of a formalized and standardized identity protocol. Eventually, it became obvious that identity is an integral and relatively well-defined cornerstone of web access that needed a simple solution. OIDC emerged as it increasingly became a requirement to know who the end-user (or resource owner) is and for the client to be able to request access to basic claims about them. Together, OIDC and OAuth2.0 create a protocol that combines authentication and authorization. While this allows them to work natively with one another, it’s not always helpful from an infrastructure standpoint to collapse these different functions together.</p><p>Efforts like WebID are currently trending towards the reseparation of these concepts that have become married in the current world of OpenID, by developing browser APIs that are specifically geared towards identity. However, without a solution to authorization, it could be argued that many of the goals of the project will remain unsatisfied whenever the relying party requires both authentication and authorization in a given interaction.</p><p>As it turns out, these problems are all closely related to each other and require a broad and coordinated approach. As we step into an increasingly digital era where the expectation continues to evolve around what’s possible to do online, the role of identity becomes increasingly complex. Take, for example, sectors such as the financial industry dealing with increased requirements around electronic Know-Your-Customer (KYC) policies. In parallel with the innovation around web identity and the adoption of emerging technologies such as VCs, there has been a growing realization that the evolution of digital identity enables many opportunities that extend far beyond the domain of identity. This is where the power of verifiable data on the web really begins, and with it an expanded scope and structure for how to build digital infrastructure that can support a whole new class of applications.</p><p>A new proposed browser API called <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/">Credential Handler API</a> (CHAPI) offers a promising solution to browser-mediated interactions that complements the identity-centric technologies of OIDC and WebID. It currently takes the form of a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill">polyfill</a> to allow these capabilities to be used in the browser today. Similar to how SIOP proposes for the user to be able pick their provider for identity-related credentials, CHAPI allows you to pick your provider, but not just for identity — for any kind of credential. In that sense, OIDC and CHAPI are solving slightly different problems:</p>  OIDC is primarily about requesting authentication of an End-User and receiving some limited identity claims about them, and in certain circumstances also accessing protected resources on their&nbsp;behalf.  CHAPI is about requesting credentials that may describe the End-user or may not. Additionally, credentials might not even be related to their identity directly and instead used for other related functions like granting authorization, access,&nbsp;etc.  <p>While OIDC offers a simple protocol based upon URL redirects, CHAPI pushes for a world of deeper integration with the browser that affords several useability benefits. Unlike traditional implementations of OIDC, CHAPI does not start with the assumption that an identity is fixed to the provider. Instead, the end-user gets to register their preferred providers in the browser and then select from this list when an interaction with their provider is required. Since CHAPI allows for exchanging credentials that may or may not be related to the end-user, it allows for a much broader set of interactions than what’s provided by today’s identity protocols. In theory, these can work together rather than as alternative options. You could, for instance, treat CHAPI browser APIs as a client to contact the end-user’s OpenID Provider and then use CHAPI to exchange and present additional credentials that may be under the end-user’s control.</p><p>CHAPI is very oriented towards the “credential” abstraction, which is essentially a fixed set of claims protected in a cryptographic envelope and often intended to be long lived. A useful insight from the development of OIDC is that it may be helpful to separate, at least logically, the presentation of identity-related information from the presentation of other kinds of information. To extend this idea, authenticating or presenting a credential is different from authenticating that you’re the subject of a credential. You may choose to do these things in succession, but they are not inherently related.</p><p>The reason this is important has to do with privacy, data hygiene, and best security practices. In order to allow users to both exercise their identity on the web and manage all of their credentials in one place, we should be creating systems that default to requesting specific information about an end-user as needed, not necessarily requesting credentials when what’s needed is an authentic identity and vice&nbsp;versa.</p><p>Adopting this kind of policy would allow configurations where the identifier for the credential subject would not be assumed to be the identifier used to identify the subject with the relying party. Using this capability in combination with approaches to <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/concepts/selective-disclosure">selective disclosure</a> like <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/a-solution-for-privacy-preserving-verifiable-credentials-f1650aa16093">VCs with JSON-LD BBS+ signatures</a> will ensure not only a coherent system that can separate identity and access, but also one that respects user privacy and provides a bridge between existing identity management infrastructure and emerging technologies.</p><p>An emergent user experience</p><p>Using these technologies in tandem also helps to bridge the divide between native and web applications when it comes to managing identity across different modalities. Although the two often get conflated, a digital wallet for holding user credentials is not necessarily an application. It’s a service to help users manage their credentials, both identity-related and otherwise, and should be accessible wherever an end-user needs to access it. In truth, native apps and web apps are each good at different things and come with their own unique set of trade-offs and implementation challenges. Looking at this emerging paradigm where identity is managed in a coherent way across different types of digital infrastructure, “web wallets” and “native wallets” are not necessarily mutually exclusive — emerging technologies can leverage redirects to allow the use of&nbsp;both.</p><p>The revolution around digital identity offers a new paradigm that places users in a position of greater control around their digital interactions, giving them the tools to exercise agency over their identity and their data online. Modern legislation focused on privacy, portability, security and accessible user experience is also creating an impetus for the consolidation of legacy practices. The opportunity is to leverage this directional shift to create a network effect across the digital ecosystem, making it easier for relying parties to build secure web experiences and unlocking entirely new value opportunities for claims providers and data authorities.</p><p>Users shouldn’t have to manage the complexity left behind by today’s outdated identity systems, and they shouldn’t be collateral damage when it comes to designing convenient apps and services. Without careful coordination, much of the newer innovation could lead to even more fragmentation in the digital landscape. However, as we can see here, many of these technology efforts and standards are solving similar or complementary problems.</p><p>Ultimately, a successful reinvention of identity on the web should make privacy and security easy; easy for end-users to understand, easy for relying parties to support, and easy for providers to implement. That means building bridges across technologies to support not only today’s internet users, but enabling access to an entirely new set of stakeholders across the globe who will finally have a seat at the table, such as those without access to the internet or readily available web infrastructure. As these technologies develop, we should continue to push for consolidation and simplicity to strike the elusive balance between security and convenience across the ecosystem for everyday&nbsp;users.</p><p>Where to from&nbsp;here?</p><p>Solving the challenges necessary to realize the future state of identity on the web will take a collective effort of vendor collaboration, standards contributions, practical implementations and education. In order to create adoption of this technology at scale, we should consider the following as concrete next steps we can all take to bring this vision to&nbsp;life:</p><p>Continue to drive development of bridging technologies that integrate well with existing identity solutions and provide a path to decentralized and portable&nbsp;identity</p>  E.g. formalization of OIDC Credential Provider to extend existing&nbsp;IdPs  <p>Empower users to exercise autonomy and sovereignty in selecting their service provider, as well as the ability to change providers and manage services over&nbsp;time</p>  E.g. selection mechanisms introduced by SIOP and&nbsp;WebID  <p>Adopt a holistic approach to building solutions that recognizes the role of browser-mediated interactions in preserving user&nbsp;privacy</p>  E.g. newer browser developments such as CHAPI and&nbsp;WebID  <p>Build solutions that make as few assumptions as necessary in order to support different types of deployment environments that show up in real-world use&nbsp;cases</p>  E.g. evolution of SIOP as well as supporting web and native&nbsp;wallets  <p>Ensure that the development of decentralized digital identity supports the variety and diversity of data that may be managed by users in the future, whether that data be identity-related or otherwise</p><p>Taking these steps will help to ensure that the identity technologies we build to support the digital infrastructure of tomorrow will avoid perpetuating the inequalities and accessibility barriers we face today. By doing our part to collaborate and contribute to solutions that work for everybody, building bridges rather than building siloes, we can create a paradigm shift that has longevity and resilience far into the future. We hope you join&nbsp;us.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/the-state-of-identity-on-the-web-cffc392bc7ea">The State of Identity on the Web</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 A byline by Erick Pinos, Ontology’s America’s Ecosystem Lead <p>By Erick Pinos, Advisor at Wing, a credit-based cross-chain DeFi lending platform built on Ontology, and Ontology’s America’s Ecosystem Lead</p><p>The total value locked in DeFi projects is <a href="https://defipulse.com/">an estimated $38 billion</a>, while <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/defi/">CoinMarketCap estimates</a> that the total market capitalization of DeFi tokens is nearly $70 billion. For reference, $70 billion is nearly the same amount as the entire GDP of Luxembourg, and more than the respective GDPs of Bulgaria and Croatia, per <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?most_recent_value_desc=true">statistics from the World Bank</a>. In short: DeFi is massive, and expanding by the day. Its expansion over the last few years has seen the advent of new technologies and better ways of managing finances: new ways of financing projects, borrowing, lending, betting, investing; the possibilities are endless. The rapid growth of DeFi has, however, highlighted some innate problems in the industry, most notably when it comes to credit scoring. It was for this reason that we developed Ontology’s OScore protocol in 2020, a self-sovereign credit evaluation system based on user data stored on the Ontology blockchain.</p><p>For years now, lending and borrowing offers individuals a vast array of new opportunities in which credit scoring plays an integral role. This makes OScore a vital missing piece to the DeFi’s puzzle, because in order to offer these products, this vital data is required so that they can be assured the purchaser or borrower will be reliable and in a position to repay&nbsp;them.</p><p>In traditional finance, the cross section between off-chain and on-chain assets and actions is not adequately established to allow users to benefit from on-chain actions while keeping their personal data safe when it comes to credit scoring. Most platforms require access to the user’s off-chain information, while their on-chain data provides insight to the platform into the user’s credit history. This is what we are solving through&nbsp;OScore.</p><p>By using OScore, users can access DeFi products and services, projects, dApps and blockchain platforms, and also manage their on-chain credit data at their will. This allows users to utilise their credit history; if a user has a positive credit history, they can utilise this data to obtain access to more rewarding financial products without placing the safety and security of their data in jeopardy. Users can also amalgamate their on-chain and off-chain credit scores to formulate a more accurate depiction of their credit score with which they can achieve even greater access to high quality financial products. Banks can also have access to quality data that provides them with a full picture of who they are lending&nbsp;to.</p><p>Enter, Wing.</p><p>With nearly $158 million currently in <a href="https://wing.finance/">total value locked</a>, Wing is a force to be reckoned with. Based on the Ontology blockchain, Wing allows users to integrate their amalgamated on-chain and off-chain credit scores, or in this case, their OScore, into Wing’s credit evaluation module. Every product pool available on Wing can then allow users to verify their own credibility, while using OScore to increase the credibility of the individual Wing product&nbsp;pools.</p><p>Pertinently, by using OScore with a user’s credit rating, each user can avoid over-collateralization, especially when they are looking to borrow from a variety of different digital asset classes. The higher their OScore, the more benefits they can glean when borrowing, such as reduced rates and additional incentives. The better the user is at engaging with and participating in the project, the more incentives they receive. For example, if a user borrows and is now making monthly repayments on time, they may enjoy additional OScore points as a&nbsp;reward.</p><p>At Ontology, not only are we proud of our efforts regarding OScore and Wing, we believe decentralized credit scoring is a necessary next step in bringing decentralized finance into the mainstream. Data safety is of increasing importance to consumers; that is undeniable. To achieve mass adoption, we must as an industry first guarantee that. Secondly, if the industry wants to become on par or fully engage with traditional finance, we must adapt to give traditional financial institutions some of the assurances and ability to carry out due diligence, while giving consumers the peace of mind traditionally offered by large financial institutions, such as ease of access and credit&nbsp;scoring.</p><p>By utilising decentralized credit scoring that ensures the safety and security of user data, we are in the unique space of getting the best of both worlds. Thanks to Wing, it is now easier than ever before to see the full picture of an individual user’s financial history.</p><p>None of this comes at the expense of each individual’s right to privacy; only information that is absolutely necessary will ever be shared with a party that needs it. These assurances are crucial in winning over the trust of the general public, end users and traditional financial institutions. It will take an all-of-industry approach to achieve these goals, and we are proud to be paving the&nbsp;way.</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/decentralized-credit-rating-is-integral-to-defi-adoption-728cc2dfa8b0">Decentralized Credit Rating Is Integral To DeFi Adoption</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The following fictional passage, from a book being written in an Urbit Group called “the Aleph,” sketches out a dismal future for the human race. As an item of speculative fiction, the piece is not what one might call original. Anyone could have come up with these ideas. In fact, several already have. The Matrix is an obvious antecedent. Vonnegut isn’t far behind either. And the treacly humanism lodged beneath the bitter humor resembles nothing so much as the work of that beau monde satirist, George Saunders.</p>
<p>Really the only notable thing about it is that it was written on Urbit. And that, perhaps, has made all the difference.</p>
<p>It’s easy to be pessimistic about the future. Intellectuals, especially, are drawn to pessimism, because pessimism (falsely) implies a greater wealth of knowledge about the ways of the world. But one thing the pessimist never sees coming is a turn for the better. To wit, the future described in the below excerpt doesn’t have to take place. And Urbit is one piece of evidence for the claim that it will not.</p>
<p>The philosopher-cum-internet comedian Slavoj Zizek likes to point out that no one was really expecting the Soviet Union to collapse in 1989. In fact, the average Soviet dissident wasn’t even gunning for it. He was haggling over small reforms, pushing to get the less corrupt politicians to the top, just going about his day eating or opening a window or walking dully along. Then, kaboom. Collapse. No more USSR.</p>
<p>Then as now, the unexpected is more likely to occur than most would believe. One thing is not only possible, but an established fact: A brand new digital infrastructure is slowly, quietly being built. While U.S. political parties haggle over $1,400 disbursements for citizens, the rules of global finance are being re-written in code. While pundits debate the merits of Dr. Seuss’s lesser known titles, a global shift away from traditional publishing is gaining steam. And while users and social apps themselves pop up and down like whack-a-mole, folks are putting down roots with permanent peer-to-peer digital identities. If you’re anything like an optimist, you’ll probably want to get on Urbit ASAP and put down your own.</p>

<br>
<p>The date is January 1, 2050. The place, New York City. The vibe...subdued. Back in 2020, you made a note to yourself to take stock of the world around you here at the half-century mark. And now the time has come. What do you find? The air quality is a bit worse, the bad parts of town are a bit more dilapidated, the Knicks are still terrible—all in all, from the outside at least, not much has changed from 30 years ago. Today you wake up groggy on your self-adjusting Smart Bed (Smart Bed Never Sleeps), you make yourself a steaming pot of coffee (locally sourced, delivered within the half-hour by a drone, now that you’ve got Titicaca Prime), you shower and get ready for work.</p>
<p>But what was that dream you had last night? Only the faintest traces of it remain. A luminous rainbow, a mountain landscape, a sense of profound inner peace, mixed with euphoria, mixed with...an intense desire to go out and buy some Health Morsels cereal?</p>
<p>That’s odd. You’ve never even had Health Morsels. You open up your laptop, where you can view the activity of the iThink microchip that you got implanted in your cortex a few years ago. “Ads help Elysium provide you with free, quality sleep-monitoring. To disable ads, please upgrade to Elysium Premium.” That explains it. After all—and you pause for a moment over whether the forthcoming thought is yours or the iThink’s, before deciding that it’s much the same anyway—Health Morsels probably are delicious. And healthy, too.</p>
<p>As usual, they’re setting something on fire outside your home. Normally you’d scroll back through your Squawker feed to see what it was all about, but today you’re late for work, and anyway you’re in a pleasant haze after the Health Morsels dream—no point ruining it by poring over the latest Squawker pile-on. You glance at the awning. Ah, the bodega. Toilet paper and Juul Pods are cheaper in bulk from Titicaca anyway.</p>
<p>Another day at the office. You were never exactly passionate about content moderation, but hey, it keeps the lights on. (And since ConEd got absorbed by Titicaca, it’s been pretty important to have a Verified Income Stream.) It’s a normal day at work. Algorithms haven’t yet been able to filter out all Unverified Content—so it’s up to you the flag Unacceptable Violence, Disputed Claims, and Unfederated Currency transactions.</p>
<p>Except after your pleasant dream, it all suddenly seems so drab. You start to wonder whether there was an error last night—maybe they turned the dream levels up too high. Something from your night-time vision just won’t leave your mind, like a film strip looping over and over. It’s that river beside a sloping field, like you used to swim in when you were a kid. You can almost feel the icy cold against your skin, the sticks and mud against the soles of your feet, and then there’s the ripe, marshy scent of the riverbed. Uh oh. You realize you’re close to danger levels. This isn’t where your head’s supposed to be at. Frantically you scroll through content, seeking to moderate it. A user threatening violence against Titicaca. A stream that violates DMCA. A highly dubious Squawker claim, with no support from experts. Flagged. Flagged. Flagged.</p>
<p>Yet the river remains. You see it, you feel it, just as you feel the kiss of the sun on your shoulders, the breeze rustling through your damp hair.</p>
<p>Now you know what’s coming. You brace for it and wait. Three. Two. One. ZAP. Your iThink produces an electric shock: plenty painful but not permanently damaging—at least that’s what the Verified studies show. The river recedes from your mind. Following the shock, your iThink, as versatile a little machine as ever was invented, delivers a few milligrams of both amphetamine and oxycodone, bringing on a wonderful feeling of simultaneous alertness and relaxation. You look up at your monitor. Content moderation doesn’t seem so bad, with the stimulant and the barbiturate swirling paradoxically through your system. It’s true what they say in the ads: iThink doesn’t just make you think better, it makes you feel better. You dive back into your content moderation with renewed verve, even flagging a couple completely innocent posts just out of surplus exuberance. So what if you hardly get outside at all these days, so what if you’ll never swim in that stupid river. The fastest electronics, the Your Health and Wellbeing tracked and adjusted by an intelligence far greater than that which you could ever hope to possess, a gizmo that gives a whole new meaning to the term neural net.</p>
<p>2050 turned out to be a pretty good year after all.</p>

<p>To: Bitmark Investors &amp; Advisors<br>From: Sean Moss-Pultz</p><p>Note: This article series is taken from Sean’s quarterly letters to Bitmark investors. We share them publicly one quarter after they are written to give everyone a deeper, transparent look at Bitmark’s perspective of the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Dear Investors &amp;&nbsp;Advisors</p><p>Observations (from the&nbsp;future)</p><p>This is a letter from the future. It’s August of 2021 and even though we do have a vaccine, it’s not widespread. IP disputes between the US, Germany, and China (all contesting patents) are holding back deployment while the pandemic continues to punish society. But there is some silver lining. COVID-19 was the catalyst for a desperately needed transformation. Just about every sector of society moved online, acknowledged the defects of their institutions, and began to invest in better infrastructure.</p><p>2001: A Space Odyssey, the legendary Stanley Kubrick film, opens with the “Dawn of Man” sequence where apes surround an extraterrestrial Monolith:</p>2001: A Space Odyssey, the legendary Stanley Kubrick film, opens with the “Dawn of&nbsp;Man”.<p>Apes are going… ape shit, screaming and fighting and everything else you imagine apes would do. With a bone from a dead zebra, one ape beats another over the head. More jump in and beat that ape to death. Something feels desperately wrong. Everything is escalating. You realize you are witnessing evolution in real-time. Somehow the Monolith triggered a jump in evolution, starting with tool use and then quickly becoming weaponry.</p><p>A killer ape throws a bone into the air, and it turns into a spaceship orbiting Earth — human evolution summed up by the most audacious film cut in&nbsp;history.</p><p>More Monoliths appear. One is uncovered on the moon. Humans are dispatched to have a look firsthand. Upon arrival, that Monolith triggers a high-pitched alarm that accelerates another evolution — this time the machines become intelligent. (And not very&nbsp;nice.)</p><p>Perhaps we humans didn’t stay on the moon long enough to evolve. 2001 came and went and instead of HAL we got Facebook.</p><p>Or maybe SARS-CoV-2 was our Monolith, wreaking havoc on humans, forcing us to evolve through selective pressure. Everything accelerated. Anything that could move online did move online to survive. At the same time, we built artificial intelligence into everything around us. If this continues, our world will change more unrecognizably in the next decade of the 21st century than today’s world changed from what it was 20 centuries ago.</p><p>For the first time in human history, we are all connected with our machines and fellow humans into a massive hive intelligence. Opportunities to organize and govern in radically different ways are emerging everywhere. Finally, we have our chance to solve the big problems inherited from the&nbsp;past.</p><p>But make no mistake: humanity is at a dangerous tipping point. Yes, we have the potential to create a world of prosperity, beauty, and happiness for all. But it’s also quite probable we end up like 2001 with HAL murdering the&nbsp;humans.</p><p>To make sure we create an exponentially better world, we need to engineer better rights for humans. Yet, equally as important, we also need to make sure our AIs are engineered with a sense of rights and humanity at the deepest level possible. Doing this is Bitmark’s purpose. This is Bitmark’s ambition.</p><p>Earlier this year we released the second generation of the Bitmark Protocol, renamed as Bitmark Rights System. Even though “system” is overused, the easiest way to understand gen 2 Bitmark is as a system with the following components:</p>  Rights Capabilities: programmable rights to digital resources  Enclaves: storage and computation for&nbsp;data  Charters: standards for grouping and using&nbsp;enclaves  <p>Gen 2 Bitmark was developed with Blockchain Commons. If you remember from my Q4, 2019 update, I said that Christopher Allen thought Digital Property Rights could be embedded directly into digital assets using cryptographic “Object Capabilities”. We could turn property rights in a new form of a digital bearer asset — that blew my&nbsp;mind!</p><p>That’s what we did in Bitmark gen 2. It was so important to get to a point where rights could be maintained autonomously, without the need for a centralized server. Gen 1 Bitmark, to be clear, could define rights. But we had very limited ability to constrain and enforce usage. And what we did have was centralized. Let me explain why this improvement matters.</p><p>When a system such as an OS or website is presented with a request for a resource (e.g., data, device driver, service), it needs to decide if it should actually do what is being asked. The method it uses to decide is called “access control.”</p><p>All modern computers use an access control system that separates the “things” we are talking about (designation) from what we are allowed to do (authority). Since the early 1970s, information security people have known that this approach is fatally flawed. It leads to <a href="https://bitmark.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6ba47d35944fc04102b0e9ae6&amp;id=9730186e60&amp;e=b5e6fd72f3">ambient authority</a> issues. Yet amazingly, it never got fixed. Before we introduced Rights Capabilities, it didn’t matter if we’re talking about Windows, macOS, Linux, FreeBSD, iOS, Android, or whatever — they all separated designation from authority.</p><p>Object Capabilities was an alternative security model proposed in the late 70s for access control. Designed to address ambient authority problems, they work by coupling designation and authority. This allows access control to be regulated by possession of the resource alone, similar to how financial resources can be accessed simply via possession of a bearer instrument.</p><p>Rights Capabilities are cryptographic Object Capabilities. They are standardized for recording, transfering, using, and programming rights to digital resources (e.g., data, files, services). Cryptography tightly couples the description of what rights are given to which entities for which things. If you haven’t been granted a Rights Capability to do something for a specific resource, you are cryptographically barred from doing&nbsp;it!</p><p>The blockchain makes Rights Capabilities autonomously transferable and auditable, without the need for a trusted third party. Rights Capabilities are also programmable. They can be monitored and modified directly in code, creating a dynamic rights ecosystem totally unlike anything in the physical&nbsp;world.</p><p>You still might be thinking these are obscure technical problems. They are not. Never forget: “the cloud” is just your stuff on other people’s computers. When you put your data on another computer, totally out of your control, you want to make sure your rights are clearly defined and cryptographically enforced!</p><p>A whole range of security problems plaguing us today could be addressed using this new approach. This includes many kinds of injection attacks, cross-site request forgery, cross site scripting attacks, click-jacking, and most of the threats in the <a href="https://bitmark.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6ba47d35944fc04102b0e9ae6&amp;id=9234d6cd49&amp;e=b5e6fd72f3">top 10 security risks list</a>. These are all arguably manifestations of this one conceptual flaw first noticed in the&nbsp;1970s!</p><p>Development of the Bitmark Rights System was largely funded by the Taiwan Health Pilot. Finding alternative ways to fund infrastructure was a strategy I picked up from reading early quarterly reports of Tesla. Much to my surprise, I learned Tesla increased cash flows by selling electric drivetrains to Mercedes and Toyota. And even though the long-term goal is to occupy Mars, SpaceX transports cargo to and from the International Space Station to develop their infrastructure&nbsp;. Understanding how Elon Musk thinks about this gave me courage to reduce resources on our consumer apps and push as hard as possible to develop our core infrastructure.</p><p>Personal data control and processing in a Rights Capabilities paradigm looks nothing like the traditional paradigm. Let me use our Taiwan Health Pilot to illustrate some important differences.</p><p>Right now, in August of 2021, about two million people in Taiwan (roughly 10% of the population) are sharing their health data across studies in an open data network. In these studies, scientists and researchers like Dr. Ho, are using this data to make discoveries that are rapidly improving the lives of all participants.</p><p>Technically speaking, individual citizens hold their data in personal health enclaves, PHEs. Hospitals and clinics, as part of the pilot, were given Rights Capabilities to automatically push patient data into PHEs. The Health Pilot mobile app uses Rights Capabilities to pull data from personal devices, such as wearable devices or consumer health monitors. This builds up a full, longitudinal data profile. When individuals opt in to participate in studies within the open data network, their Health Pilot apps show what’s available based on their profiles.</p><p>Let’s say a match is found for a study on children with prediabetes markers. When the parent (guardian of the child) joins, they would get private, precision health recommendations. At the same time, their data safely helps advance preventative health for everyone.</p><p>Behind the scenes, Rights Capabilities to the individual’s PHE are delegated to a matching algorithm (an AI) that finds studies across the network that could help the individual or their family. When a match is found, the consent to proceed is secured, and the individual is added to the study’s Charter. Built into the Rights Capabilities are the methods for data transfers or queries that can be performed. All the regulation (think HIPAA, GDPR, etc.) is handled automatically and recorded for future&nbsp;audits.</p><p>This model of massive-scale, low-cost studies and trials was science fiction for decades. In Taiwan, thanks to the Bitmark Rights System and the support of a <a href="https://bitmark.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6ba47d35944fc04102b0e9ae6&amp;id=0e69850123&amp;e=b5e6fd72f3">courageous Digital Minister</a>, it’s&nbsp;real.</p><p>Bitmark’s business model is to license and support Rights Capabilities for enterprises, primarily in the medical/healthcare sector. But we also have a number of crypto companies as customers. We help them handle assets like Bitcoin or ETH. When access control goes wrong with crypto assets, there is usually no recourse!</p><p>By the way, Bitmark developed several apps based on Rights Capabilities:</p>  OurBeat. A community and rights platform for music beat makers. It stores beats in enclaves and records specific rights for them, allowing others within the community to freely reuse beats and for people outside the community to license them. This was built with&nbsp;KKBOX.  A2P. A community and rights platform for visual artists. It allows them to sell collectible digital prints, record rights, and retain their provenance using the blockchain. This was built with Casey&nbsp;Reas.  Autonomy. A community and rights platform for public health. It allows community members to store health information in personal and community enclaves while ensuring that they retain authority over that&nbsp;data.  <p>I’m not sure it’s possible to overstate the significance of building a better system for&nbsp;rights.</p><p>Rights shouldn’t be an afterthought or a necessary byproduct. Rights are the pillars of our society. They’re fundamental to civilization. They determine what we can do in society, what we can use, what powers we have, and what protections we enjoy. From free speech to property ownership, from privacy to freedom of movement, from the privilege to vote to the expectation that we won’t be discriminated against — rights embody the best parts of our humanity!</p><p>Unfortunately, rights are being eroded as we transform from a physical society to a digital society. Again, Facebook is the worst actor in this space. Hardly a month goes by without some privacy violation. Of course it’s not just Facebook, all the major social and professional networks hide from people the logic (algorithms) they use to make recommendations and guide our behaviours. You share information about yourself, but you have no control over the corporations that are reselling your information to advertising networks and other data collectors. At their core, these networks are predicated on people falling prey to addictive behaviors. They are massive AIs relentlessly solving corporate profit maximization rather than general human benefit maximizations. All costs are externalized to&nbsp;society.</p><p>But it’s not just the networks where we lose our rights. Music, books, and movies are being released online, but there’s never a secondary market: once a creator removes something from sale, it’s gone forever. One you buy something, it becomes dead&nbsp;capital.</p><p>Worse, we’re not even thinking about how we could be using the advantages of the digital world to expand on traditional rights. We could be engineering new rights that radically unlock the potential of the digital world. These new rights could be autonomously controlled by the people to whom they have been granted. As nearly all parts of our economy move online, there are enormous possibilities to create a new era of programmable rights.</p><p>Artificial intelligence is no longer science fiction. AIs are everywhere. It’s time for us to get serious about what kinds of AIs we want to foster and what kinds of values we want them to have. We cannot assume that the freedoms we want AIs to to respect and enforce will automatically emerge. “<a href="https://bitmark.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6ba47d35944fc04102b0e9ae6&amp;id=9353b7ffba&amp;e=b5e6fd72f3">I’m sorry, Dave. I’m afraid I can’t do that.</a>” should never be an acceptable response from a&nbsp;machine.</p><p>That’s the mission of Bitmark: engineering rights for a better humanity. The goal of our core product, the Bitmark Rights System, is to give you a full array of rights: protecting your privileges, and using the power of the digital world to take us all to the next&nbsp;level.</p><p>That’s all for now. Stay&nbsp;strong.</p><p>Best,<br>Sean</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/clean-titles/bitmark-ceo-observations-q2-2020-77bf617d4818">2020 Q2: Bitmark CEO’s Observations to our Investors</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/clean-titles">Bitmark’s Official Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Summary <p>Mostly we’re working on performance, bugfixes, and features (proxy server, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/659">storage code</a>, sharding, and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/684">validation receipts</a>), but we’re also working on a few developer tools: the <code>hc</code> command (yes, it’s coming back), a mock HDK, and a nearly finalised hApp bundle spec.</p> Highlights   The <code>hc</code> developer command returns!  Mock HDK: Test your DNA without firing up Holochain  hApp bundle spec ready for basic use   The <code>hc</code> developer command returns! <p>Veteran Holochain developers will remember the <code>hc</code> command, a sort of Swiss army knife tool that let you scaffold, compile, test, and run your hApps. It’s here again and (almost) ready for you to start using in your daily development.</p><p>Subcommands already implemented:</p>  <code>hc dna</code> replaces the existing <code>dna-util</code> command.  <code>hc dna init</code> creates an empty directory and manifest file for a DNA.  <code>hc dna pack</code> packs a collection of compiled WASM zomes and a DNA manifest file into a DNA file. It replaces <code>dna-util -c</code>.  <code>hc dna unpack</code> unpacks a DNA file into its component manifest and compiled WASM zomes. It replaces <code>dna-util -e</code>.  <code>hc app</code> has the same subcommands as <code>hc dna</code>, but works at the level of a hApp bundle — that is, a collection of DNAs. (See below for more info on bundles.)  <code>hc sandbox</code> is still a work-in-progress, but will let you generate and run conductor ‘sandboxes’ — temporary conductor configurations (including multiple instances on multiple conductors) that let you test-run your application.  <p>This tool isn’t available in mainline Holonix quite just yet, but you can try it out with this command:</p> <code>nix-shell https://github.com/holochain/holonix/archive/pr/bump-holo-nixpkgs-add-hc.tar.gz
</code> 
<p>Once it’s finished its work and you find yourself in the development shell, you should have the <code>hc</code> tool available:</p> <code>hc --version
holochain_cli 0.1.0
</code> 
<p>We’re still working out what scaffolding should look like beyond the simple <code>hc dna init</code> and <code>hc app init</code> commands. If you have an idea of what you need from a scaffolding tool, please <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues">create a GitHub feature request</a> and tag it with ‘enhancement’.</p><p>What about scaffolding and testing? Testing is already well-covered by the tools native to each language:</p>  You can use <code>npm test</code> to run scenario/end-to-end tests written with <a href="https://github.com/tryorama">Tryorama</a>  You can use <code>cargo test</code> to run unit tests with the new mock HDK (see below)   Mock HDK: Test your DNA without firing up Holochain <p>Unit testing — tests for the smallest executable pieces of your code — should be the foundation of your testing plan. Up until now, though, we haven’t had any great tools for unit testing a DNA.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama">Tryorama</a>, our scenario testing framework, has been great for doing integration testing. It loads up an entire conductor (or multiple conductors) to host your DNAs. But this isn’t what you want for unit tests, which are meant to test a specific piece in isolation. It also doesn’t support a lot of edge cases — unexpected conductor shutdowns are easy to model, but other situations like hardware errors and malicious peers are impossible.</p><p>So the core devs have introduced a <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/674">mock HDK</a> that lets you simulate host call responses and introduce all the edge cases you like. You can find examples throughout the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/tree/develop/crates/test_utils/wasm/wasm_workspace">WASM test suite</a>; here’s <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/develop/crates/test_utils/wasm/wasm_workspace/crd/src/lib.rs#L24-L103">one that mocks the CRUD host functions</a>.</p> hApp bundle spec ready for basic use <p>We expect a common pattern for hApp development will be mixing-and-matching existing DNAs in new configurations, sort of like an ecosystem of microservices. In fact, we explicitly want to see that happening. We think Holochain will get adopted more quickly if developers can lean on each other’s good work; it saves work and time for developers, and leads to a better user experience when new apps can connect to existing apps and take advantage of users’ existing data.</p><p>To that end, we’ve long held an intention to let developers easily specify a ‘bundle’ of DNAs that make up a full application. There are different needs; here are a few:</p>  Connect to an existing DNA, such as a core app (like DeepKey) or other popular app (like chat or social media)  Make a new copy of an existing DNA so users can enjoy a private space using the same code  Clone a DNA multiple times for separate, small spaces — such as team chat rooms within an organisation  <p>hApp bundles existed in Holochain Redux; now they’re <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/651">coming to RSM</a>. A few of the above scenarios (e.g., <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/619">cloning</a>, DNA versioning) aren’t supported yet, and the bundle spec format isn’t officially stable. But it’s already in use in the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/665">admin API</a> (and soon <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/pull/71">Tryorama</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/675"><code>hc</code> tool</a>), and the parts that hApp devs are already using look pretty robust and probably won’t change much. Here’s what works and what’s changed:</p>  The admin API endpoint <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/d3a61446acaa64b1732bc0ead5880fbc5f8e3f31/crates/holochain_conductor_api/src/admin_interface.rs#L91"><code>InstallAppBundle</code></a> is meant to replace <code>InstallApp</code>, which will be deprecated. It supports all the features of <code>InstallApp</code> already and will support more in the future.  DNA manifests, which already exist and can override properties and UUID in the DNA bundle. DNA manifests have only had a minor tweak to allow referencing DNA bundle files by URL as well as file path.  An app bundle has ‘slots’, which give a human-readable ID to existing or new DNAs in a bundle. In the future, these slots will also be used for cloned DNAs.  In contrast to Redux’s bundle spec, DNAs don’t explicitly depend on each other via bridge specs. The cell can simply make a bridge call to any other cell it has a handle for. Access is granted or denied via <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/concepts/8_calls_capabilities/">capability-based security</a>. (This means you have to be careful about circular dependencies.)   Bonus: signs of ecosystem growth <p>I’ve noticed some things lately that signal to me that Holochain is gaining awareness and support in the open-source developer community.</p>  hApp developers are creating pull requests that add features — both ones that meet their own needs, like being able to <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/685">specify header timestamps</a>, as well as ones that everyone can enjoy, like <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/683">mDNS peer discovery</a> for local networks.  People from outside the Holochain dev community are offering their own gifts, such as in this forum post <a href="https://forum.holochain.org/t/low-code-development-for-holochain-apps/4888">introducing a low-code development toolkit</a> (soon to be open-sourced) and inviting collaboration to make it work with Holochain, as well as this post investigating Holochain’s usefulness for a <a href="https://forum.holochain.org/t/basic-income-community-currency-migration-from-blockchain-to-holochain/4838">popular Kenyan community currency</a>.  Engagement on the developers’ forum has seen a steady climb in the past two months. If I could guess, I’d say this is partly due to the fact that people can now actually see Holochain in action, thanks to <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/elemental-chat-is-live/">Elemental Chat landing on HoloPorts</a>, and partly due to the work we’ve been doing to increase awareness at events like the FOSDEM 2021 and Hello Decentralization conferences.<br>   Connect with us! <p>If you’re a developer and you’re just learning about Holochain, I encourage you to <a href="https://developer.holochain.org">join the developer forum</a> and talk to the other friendly community members. If you’ve got an application (or an idea for an application) and are wondering how it would work with Holochain as a back end, I love talking about the nitty-gritty details of implementation (my username is @pauldaoust). The community also runs courses; there’s an application architecture course currently running and it’s likely to be offered again in the future.</p>

 Digital Transformation needs a narrative  Three takeaways to help define&nbsp;it <blockquote>“It will be the air we breathe. It already is, really. The question now is how to shape&nbsp;it.”</blockquote><p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/diagnostic/home">Diagnostic</a> is a series of essays and hosted conversations exploring the challenges of building more inclusive digital economies. For hosted (virtual) conversations, like the one described below, <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/">Caribou Digital</a> convenes a diverse set of experts and thought leaders with unique insights on an issue, and gives them the opportunity to explore a topic together.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@pkumar26?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Praveen kumar Mathivanan</a> on&nbsp;<a>Unsplash</a><p>The relationship between digital technologies and development is a broad topic, but one that’s critical to unpack. To that end, Caribou Digital invited a group of senior level international development decision makers to have a high level discussion on the topic using <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/transformation-in-a-digital-age-9068338fd778">Caribou Digital’s five key points on digital transformation as a starting point</a>. As a group, we explored three ways to think about digital transformation: concepts, approaches and challenges. The conversation was rich and productive, with participants sharing insights and experiences. This is a summary of what I saw as the key insights and takeaways, and of course the conversation isn’t finished.</p><p>Caribou Digital dedicates this to <a href="https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/news/remembering-professor-benno-ndulu">Professor Benno Ndulu</a>, an inspirational leader of Africa’s digital transformation, who passed away the day before this meeting, because as he would say, ‘the work must go&nbsp;on.’</p> Three takeaways to define digital transformation for development  The international development community has to think&nbsp;big. <p>Approaches to digital transformation for development outcomes have to recognise that digital transformation is already happening everywhere, to everyone. As the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/pdfs/DigitalCooperation-report-for%20web.pdf">UN Secretary General’s High Level Panel on Digital Cooperation report emphasises</a>, digital transformation is enabling the age of interdependence. This means that it’s important to look beyond the usual approach of siloed sectors. As many of the participants who joined our conversation flagged, it’s less about what’s happening in agriculture or health, instead it’s important to look at it from a holistic perspective — there needs to be a joined up, cross-sectoral approach that recognises the interdependent nature of changes in government, economy and society. Approaching it from the perspective of open, inclusive and secure digital ecosystems (at Caribou Digital we like <a href="https://www.digitaldevelopment.org/digital-ecosystems">USAID’s outline of digital ecosystems here</a>) is important to elevate transformation from a narrow focus on the economy or government to a holistic, comprehensive vision for our digital&nbsp;future.</p> There has to be a move from doing to influencing. <p>Thinking about digital transformation in terms of delivery or projects is not helpful — no one organisation is in a position to ‘do digital transformation’. Instead, influencing the existing forces and already happening processes of digital transformation in countries is a better way to ensure that the transformation can be oriented towards development outcomes. Otherwise, as one participant put it, ‘If we don’t shape what’s already happening, it will spiral out of control.’ This has hugely significant implications — demanding that the sector recognises their role in shaping the overall digital landscape — beyond only the economy or the state but to also including social media and civic participation, data protection, privacy and surveillance.</p><p>The group also discussed the importance of ensuring access and connectivity — two key areas of intervention — noting that ‘If we don’t have inclusion, transformation is irrelevant.’ Another space that’s primed for influencing is digital infrastructure, with a number of participants pointing to ‘digital public goods’ efforts such as the GIZ supported UN Digital Impact Alliance’s <a href="https://toolkit-digitalisierung.de/en/ict-building-blocks-cooperation-digital-transformation/">‘Building blocks’ </a>initiative and the NORAD supported <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/">Digital Public Goods Alliance</a>. Both of these efforts are good examples of components of digital transformation, but without an emphasis on outcomes advancing connectivity and public infrastructure may not lead to benefit for individuals and&nbsp;society.</p> The international development community has to influence digital transformation for&nbsp;‘Good’. <p>There was tension and unease about the future trajectory of digital transformation. There is no guarantee about how this transformation is happening and even increased connectivity and state of the art digital infrastructure can lead to negative outcomes, as we can see in the growing use of digital connectivity to discriminate, exclude and persecute. Take privacy for example. There is debate about whether attention to privacy should be a first or second order concern given the desire to leverage digital transformation for economic growth. And while there is increased attention to regulatory approaches others emphasised the importance of broader governance and politics. These have broad implications for the glue that holds digital transformation together — trust in systems, institutions and governance. Given its centrality to use of digital systems, and the diverse<a href="https://www.dai.com/fi-cyber-user-trust-summary.pdf"> cultural and societal factors that shape perception and trust online, how can efforts to shape digital transformation maintain trust and confidence that these processes will deliver developmental outcomes?</a> These were some of the questions we asked ourselves which highlight the need to influence already happening processes of digital transformation for the good of government, the economy and&nbsp;society.</p><p>As one participant noted, digital transformation is not a neutral term. We need to ask ‘of what? For what? By whom and with what impact? We need to understand the political economy of digital transformation — especially now with the rapid pace of change. This is particularly important as it becomes clear that digital transformation has different trajectories, values and politics. If our group of participants included government representatives from China, Japan and Korea, it would have been a very different conversation, bringing different views and important voices to the table. Others emphasised the geopolitical interests behind donor interventions — ‘we see China, Europe, America, with different geopolitical interests. We think digital transformation needs to have a human centric focus with African partners.’ It is critical to define what is meant by ‘good’, by asking ‘What do we value? Efficiency and economic growth or a stable and equal society? Where is our balancing point?’</p> Key Takeaway: the international community needs to agree on a direction and set of&nbsp;outcomes <p>Digital transformation is happening, regardless of any views on it. Given this reality, the challenge for those who want to see technologies help people thrive is to define goals and influence these processes. But without a shared narrative, creating a common agenda amongst diverse stakeholders becomes challenging. This was brought up by participants in the discussion, as one said ‘I don’t think we have a convincing narrative yet on what Good Digital Transformation looks like.’ For digital transformation to strengthen human development, it will require intentional, purposeful interventions guided by an overarching narrative for our digital future. Without that guiding narrative, and without structured, strategic interventions, the process of digital transformation will amplify existing relations of power and patterns of inequity.</p> Participants <p>The following participants joined the conversation — and some who chose not to share their participation.

<p>Certification Authorities and Trust Service Providers from across the globe collaborate with GLEIF to advance trust and transparency across the digital identity ecosystem.</p>



<p>Established by the Financial Stability Board in June 2014, the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) is a supra-national, not-for-profit organization created to support the implementation and use of the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI). GLEIF is headquartered in Basel, Switzerland.</p>



<p>GLEIF manages a network of partners, the LEI issuing organizations, to provide trusted services and open, reliable data for unique legal entity identification worldwide. GLEIF services ensure the operational integrity of the Global LEI System.</p>



<p>InfoCert completed the GLEIF accreditation in December 2019 and is a Local Operating Unit (LOU). Becoming a member of the Global LEI System via GLEIF accreditation is a globally recognized designation of commitment to data quality and customer service.</p>



<p>Accreditation is the process by which the&nbsp;GLEIF evaluates the suitability of organizations seeking to operate within the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-system/gleif-management-of-the-global-lei-system">Global LEI System</a>&nbsp;as issuers of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei">LEIs</a>&nbsp;and custodians of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/common-data-file-format">LEI reference data</a>.</p>



<p>GLEIF also makes available the technical infrastructure to provide, via an open data license, access to the full global LEI repository free of charge to users. GLEIF is overseen by the LEI Regulatory Oversight Committee, which is made up of representatives of public authorities from across the globe.</p>



 On March 2021 GLEIF announce a new collaboration with CAs and TSPs to drive the use of LEIs within digital Certificates 



<p>11 March 2021 – Basel – The Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) has announced a new collaboration with Certification Authorities (CAs) and Trust Service Providers (TSPs), to drive the use of Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) within digital certificates.</p>



<p>GLEIF has launched a CA Stakeholder Group to facilitate communication between GLEIF, CAs and TSPs from across the world, as they collectively aim to coordinate and encourage a global approach to LEI usage across digital identity products. Participation has already been confirmed by China Financial Certification Authority (CFCA), DigiCert Inc, InfoCert, Entrust Datacard, ICAI India, and SwissSign.</p>



<p>The collaboration announcement follows news last year that ISO has standardized the process of embedding LEIs in digital certificates. In accordance with ISO 17442-2, the CA Stakeholder Group will develop and promote best practice guidelines and use cases for LEI integration across the digital identity industry. This will help members of the group, who are all committed to incorporating the LEI into their digital identity products, to progress their own implementations. GLEIF will also welcome participants’ views on current and future LEI services.</p>



<p>The use of the LEI in digital certificates will deliver significant identity management benefits in a digital environment. Certificates linked to verified, regularly updated and freely available entity reference data by a unique, universal identifier are easier to manage, aggregate and maintain. There will also be greater transparency overall across the digital identity ecosystem.</p>



<blockquote><p>This is an important step in promoting the LEI’s capacity to enhance trust and add enormous value across the digital identity management systems which power the private sector. A unified and proactive global approach to embedding LEIs in digital certificates will rapidly extend the benefits of LEI adoption beyond regulatory use cases. Our aim is for the LEI to be harnessed as an enabler of advanced transparency in digital transactions and exchanges, and for its positive impact to deliver advantage and opportunity across the economy and society. We look forward to working with our new stakeholder group members and reporting developments in this space very soon.</p>Stephan Wolf – GLEIF CEO</blockquote>



<blockquote><p>CFCA is committed to incorporating the LEI into our digital identity products and we are already advanced in our related work efforts. We fully support this industry collaboration and are happy to be part of an initiative which brings the benefits of the LEI to a broad global audience, through an enhanced digital ID ecosystem.</p>Jonathan Sun – CFCA Strategic Development Department</blockquote>



<blockquote><p>DigiCert looks forward to participating in this important initiative to advance standards that strengthen online identity protections for users. Widespread use of LEIs, among other enhancements, may improve user confidence in websites, devices and online applications and this is in the best interest of all internet participants.</p>Dean Coclin – Senior Director of Business Development at DigiCert Inc</blockquote>



<blockquote><p>InfoCert is fully behind participation in the GLEIF CA Stakeholder Group initiative. We recognise the value in the industry collaboration intended to share knowledge and coordinate efforts and actions to promote usage of the LEI within digital certificates and more widely, across the digital identity industry. We are excited to play our part.</p>Cristina Andreoli – Business Compliance Consultant at InfoCert</blockquote>



<p>GLEIF welcomes CAs and TSPs to join and participate in the CA Stakeholder Group’s quarterly meetings. For more information <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/">https://www.gleif.org/en/</a></p>

 Consensus through Collators: <br>KILT as a Nominated Proof of Stake&nbsp;Network <p>By Ingo Rübe, founder of KILT Protocol and CEO of&nbsp;BOTLabs</p><p>In my previous <a href="https://kilt-protocol.medium.com/kilts-path-to-parachains-ad3be644db8a">blog post</a> I outlined why KILT needs a parachain and provided a roadmap on how we plan to roll out KILT Protocol. Here, I will provide an update on how we envision the KILT Protocol as a Nominated Proof-of-Stake network.</p><p>KILT Protocol is designed to be a fully decentralised permissionless blockchain network. That means that KILT is being built to evolve into a blockchain that is run for the community, by the community, with all decisions being made by KILT token&nbsp;owners.</p><p>Following the model used by <a href="https://kusama.network/">Kusama</a> and <a href="https://polkadot.network/">Polkadot</a>, in order to achieve decentralisation KILT is set out to become a Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS) network. Consensus in the system (agreement on the information on the KILT blockchain) will be achieved by collators who produce “blocks” of data on KILT and pass it to the validators in Kusama/Polkadot, who then pass the information to the Relay&nbsp;Chain.</p><p>These collators will be backed by nominators — KILT token holders who trust the collators and use their KILT tokens to back them. For this system to work, a way to incentivise the collators and nominators needs to be built into the system, similar to that used by the Kusama and Polkadot networks.</p><p>In Kusama and Polkadot, validators (the equivalent of collators) and nominators receive staking rewards for participating on the network. Such rewards on Kusama and Polkadot are a result of their on-chain network inflationary mechanisms and performed in their native tokens KSM and DOT. In KILT Protocol, collators and nominators will be rewarded by a similar mechanism, receiving KILT tokens for participating on the decentralized network.</p><p>At maturity, KILT is set out to be fully decentralised and run as described above. In addition to the security provided by collators on the network, KILT benefits from a major and ground-breaking feature of Kusama and Polkadot: shared security. All parachains connected to the Relay Chain share in security of the network as a whole. This is provided by the validators and NPoS&nbsp;design.</p><p>Being part of the Kusama network also enables highly secure interactions between the KILT blockchain and other parachain projects on Kusama and, when a connecting bridge is enabled, also to Polkadot projects. This is a very valuable feature, because it puts the KILT functionality in the center of the most promising blockchain ecosystem to date. It makes KILT Credentials and DIDs easily available for an increasing number of highly valued projects, which will greatly increase the usage of&nbsp;KILT.</p> Obtaining a Parachain Lease <p>Parachain leases on Kusama and Polkadot will be obtained by <a href="https://polkadot.network/obtaining-a-parachain-slot-on-polkadot/">auctions</a> which are expected to begin soon. When a project puts down a bid for a parachain lease and wins the lease, then the bid (KSM or DOT) is locked for the duration of the lease. This means the tokens cannot be staked or used for any other purpose as long as the lease is running. At the end of the lease, the bonded KSM/DOT are automatically unlocked again and returned to the bidder. This way, the projects which obtain a lease just pay the opportunity cost of not using the KSM/DOT for other purposes during the lease&nbsp;period.</p><p>KILT aims to secure one of the early parachain slots on Kusama, so that the KILT functionality will be available for other parachains projects at the earliest possible time. Securing a Kusama parachain slot brings us one exciting step closer to KILT mainnet launch and full decentralisation.</p>

 Spherity becomes Partner in German Government’s Secure Digital Identity&nbsp;Project <p>Spherity announces that it has become a partner of the <a href="https://idunion.org">IDunion</a> project. The project is funded within the innovation framework “Showcase secure digital identities” of the German government (Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy). Spherity is entrusted on the application of cloud identity technology in the healthcare industry.</p>Spherity joins IDunion Trusted Identity Ecosystem<p>IDunion aims to provide identity solutions for business, government, and citizens that are user-friendly, trustworthy, and economical. The consortium and its partners will establish a decentralized identity ecosystem for individuals, companies and machines.</p><p>Within the IDunion project Spherity is entrusted with the application of cloud identity technology in the healthcare industry. Secure and portable identities are necessary prerequisites for seamless e-health applications. In this context, secure digital identities are equally necessary for patients, healthcare professionals and healthcare institutions.</p><p>Applying a decentralized digital identity (SSI*) approach to the management of e.g. patient data, legal requirements for data protection can be fulfilled, patient rights can be strengthened and the efficiency of digital system solutions can be significantly improved.</p><p>In the project, these decentralized technologies will be linked with central systems such as Gematik infrastructure and health insurance systems for issuing and storing certificates, so that a corresponding hybrid architecture is created. Demonstrators and field tests will be created in the areas of telemedicine, e-prescription or electronic certificates of incapacity to work or digital vaccination cards.</p><p>Spherity will further operate a node of the decentralized, heterogeneously distributed <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IDunion?src=hashtag_click">IDunion</a> test network, which will be European legal framework (GDPR and eIDAS) compliant.</p> About IDunion <p><a href="https://idunion.org/?lang=en">IDunion</a> develops a basic infrastructure for the verification of identity data. For this purpose, a distributed database will be jointly operated, which will be managed by a European cooperative. The network will be set up and managed by various actors consisting of private companies, associations, cooperatives, government institutions, educational institutions and other legal entities.</p> About Spherity <p><a href="https://spherity.com/">Spherity</a> is building decentralized digital identity management solutions to power the fourth industrial revolution, bringing secure identities to enterprises, machines, products, data and even algorithms.

 MetaMUI Pre-IEO Sale — Introducing Reservation feature <p>Our team at SWN Global has always taken pride in actively listening to our active community of users for their feedback, issues and suggestions. As the first round of MetaMUI Pre-IEO Sale was closed out in<a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/metamui-pre-ieo-sale-first-round-completed-within-35-minutes-f1554aad9cfa"> just 35 minutes</a>, many users were unable to enter due rapid nature of the&nbsp;sale.</p><p>As due to the high demand some users couldn’t access the First Round of sale, we’ve decided to enable a Reservation feature for the Second Round of the sale. This allows users to deposit their BTC/USDT/ETH ahead of time, and thus guarantee their participation in the MetaMUI Pre-IEO sale. Reserved funds would stay locked until the day of the sale (25th of March). Once the sale starts, you will then receive an amount of MetaMUI which is based on the market price of the reserved currencies at time of the&nbsp;sale.</p><p>The Reservation feature will be enabled on Monday, 15th of March at 7am Estonian time (2PM Korean time). Reservations will be possible until Wednesday, 24th of March at the&nbsp;latest.</p><p>To learn more details about the Second Round of MetaMUI Pre-IEO sale, please check out our recent Medium announcement on the following link: <a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/metamui-pre-ieo-sale-first-round-completed-within-35-minutes-f1554aad9cfa">https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/metamui-pre-ieo-sale-first-round-completed-within-35-minutes-f1554aad9cfa</a></p><p>SWN Global&nbsp;team</p><p>— — —&nbsp;—</p><p>More About The&nbsp;Project</p><p>Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/MUIcommunity">Twitter</a><br>Join our <a href="https://t.me/muicommunity">Telegram Community Chat</a><br>Get the latest from our Telegram <a href="https://t.me/SovereignWallet_Official">announcement Channel</a><br>Signup to our Bi-weekly <a href="https://sovereignwallet.substack.com/subscribe?utm_source=menu&amp;simple=true&amp;next=https%3A%2F%2Fsovereignwallet.substack.com%2Fpeople%2F22565213-sovereign-wallet">community Update</a><br>Read the MUI MetaBlockchain <a href="https://sovereignwallet-network.github.io/whitepaper/MUI-MetaBlockchain-White-Paper.pdf">Whitepaper</a><br>Download the MUI MetaWallet on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=id.metablockchain.metawallet">Android </a>and&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mui-metawallet/id1546698261">IOS</a></p>

			 Public securities experience high levels of trading 
<p>Public markets already have well established trading venues where digital platforms offer a wealth of opportunities for investors. Companies can file for an IPO and, albeit a lengthy and costly process, gain access to an electronic market that enables easy asset and price discovery for investors. Due to this, public markets experience high levels of trading activity. More and more, these markets are made accessible to smaller investors with new robot advisors and FinTechs offering innovative investment services, such as the well known Robinhood. However, only a few securities are made accessible: the biggest ones.</p>
 What about the millions of other private market securities? 
<p>Private market securities are very hard to access because they lack infrastructure. They operate in an industry that is extremely fragmented and still heavily reliant on paper-based processes. Old technology such as fax machines are still being used. As a consequence, the industry has poor asset and price discovery and barely any secondary trading activity. Investors miss out as private markets usually provide higher returns.</p>
<p>Blockchain technology has already opened a new and more efficient way to issue, manage and transfer digital assets. Utility tokens, cryptocurrencies and stablecoins are already accessible and traded by millions of users on centralized marketplaces such as Binance or Coinbase and on decentralized ones like Uniswap or IDEX. The ICO bubble of 2017 and the rise of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have pushed the relevance of tokens issued on decentralized networks. More and more, money and assets are beginning to be tokenized.</p>
 Security tokens as the solution 
<p>The same technologies and protocols can be used with compliant securities: Compliance rules that govern private markets can now be programmed into security tokens. As investors need websites and mobile applications to use the blockchain easily, the arrival of high quality and compliant assets on a global blockchain infrastructure is helping many service providers and digital marketplaces emerge and scale. These are taking the form of traditional financial institutions or FinTechs that utilise and deliver the digital and compliant technological solutions for their audiences. These marketplaces are materializing to enforce the trust between issuers of tokens and investors by leveraging blockchain solutions.</p>
<p>At Tokeny Solutions, we see Digital Asset Marketplaces (DAMs) as the solution to this problem. Cryptocurrency exchanges were the first type of Digital Asset Marketplaces (DAMs) to emerge. A few of them such as Binance and Coinbase now mostly concentrate on the development of their audiences, having already successfully delivered easy-to-use and optimized web platforms for buyers and sellers of crypto-tokens. However, no one can claim to be the marketplace for security tokens. As an investor, if I want to invest in digital securities in order to lower custody fees and improve the liquidity of my portfolio, where should I go? Soon, DAMs will be the destination for these investors.</p>
<p>We’re looking forward to explaining more in the next article. If you can’t wait, this is an excerpt taken from the ebook we published with CoinTelegraph, download below:</p>

           <p>When the Canadian Cookbook author and food writer <a href="https://technologyinfosec.com/world/canada/buttergate-goes-viral-putting-palm-oil-fat-supplements-in-spotlight/">Julie van Rosendaal</a> reached out on social media to ask her fellow consumers whether they noticed anything different about the texture of butter, the response from across the country was overwhelming. No, the butter was not as soft as it used to be, and yes, there was definitely a change in texture.</p>
<p>Could the cause be the pandemic, as in more people taking up baking at home? Not necessarily, for two decades Canadian farmers – and maybe in other countries as well – started using palmitic acid, a saturated fat found in palm oil, to boost milk production and increase the fat content.</p>
<p>Some scientists say that it cannot be proved that palm oil is the culprit, nevertheless the <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/dairy-farmers-lobby-asks-members-to-stop-using-palm-as-it-investigates-buttergate-1.5323703">dairy farmers lobby</a> are asking their members to stop using it during the investigation.</p>
<p>Is Palm Oil production sustainable and is consumption healthy?</p>
<p>If Palm oil could be linked to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/palm-oil-health-impact-environment-animals-deforestation-heart-a8505521.html">tropical deforestation</a>, then why continue adding it to our food. 75 million metric tons of palm oil are produced annually in Canada alone, and a staggering 90 % is used by the food industry.</p>
<p>It is also debatable whether Palm Oil is <a href="https://www.doctorshealthpress.com/food-and-nutrition-articles/health-risks-of-palm-oil/">beneficial for consumption</a>, and while the use of dairy feed supplements is in line with federal standards, there could be reason for concern regarding the implications this could have. Consumers are noticing this in the consistency of butter, but what are the implications of this – visible, tangible or otherwise – in all other dairy products? What could be the consequences to the health of the cattle, the meat industry, to the fertilizer industry and thus the environment, the water supply? What reactions does it cause to the overall human body, to baby food, to consumers with heart disease, auto-immune disease, obesity, IBS?</p>
<p>It’s a matter of Accountability</p>
<p>Today’s consumers will become more and more demanding and will require honest and accurate information regarding the products they want to purchase. If you, as a farming company and a brand name producer, are not using Palm oil or its derivatives and you can provide all the stakeholders down – and up – the supply chain, all the way to your end consumer that your products are ‘Palm Oil Free’, your customer’s choice will be easy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I think people are always surprised to learn about how the food system works … and how consumer demand affects how our food is produced and made.”<br>
Julia van Rosendaal</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our solutions create a Digital Thread where each item or batch will be represented by a Digital Twin. The Product DNA then follows the whole product’s lifecycle, from the first raw product producer to the logistics, transportation, the production distribution and all the way to the end consumer. Each actor in the food chain can provide and share truthful, detailed, verified and accurate information such as feed ingredients, temperature, weight, location in a transparent way, building trust both up and down the chain.</p>
<p>Customers and consumers will decide to buy your product, because you can guarantee the Authenticity and the Product History. They will have a choice to buy sustainable and eco-friendly products, especially if you can show them you – as a producer – have chosen to take a responsible choice for both the health of your customers and nature’s valuable resources.</p>

 A byline by Ontology’s Founder — Li&nbsp;Jun <p>*Note* this byline was originally published in <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-guide-to-self-sovereign-identity-a-deep-dive-by-ontology">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p> What Is Self-Sovereign Identity and Why Do We Need&nbsp;It? <p>Ever since the early days of mass internet usage, questions have swirled about the nature of our online selves. Each and every one of us has countless <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/digital-identity">online personas </a>that we use to log in to various online services, from social media platforms to online banking. Just for a moment, stop and think about how many different accounts you have created across the web — a trail of digital breadcrumbs that represent your digital identity, albeit fragmented and unrecognizable.</p><p>Each time we log on to use a new service, the process is the same: we provide some of our personal information and, in exchange, we are granted a digital identity by the service provider that permits us to use their platform. But, in considering the order of this exchange, it becomes clear that something is amiss and that we’ve been doing things backwards for years. Firstly, we don’t need a company to bestow us with an identity because we have one already — surely all we should be doing is verifying that fact. And secondly, we have provided social networks and service providers with our most valuable asset — our information — and we’ve done so free of charge and without asking for much in return, besides the use of their services, which, of course, they are only too happy to&nbsp;grant.</p> The Value of Our&nbsp;Data <p>It is only in recent years that we have come to the realization that we have merely scratched the surface when it comes to the true value of our data. Do you know what your data is worth? Do you know who has access to it and how it is used? The majority of us do not know the true answers to these questions.</p><p>The topic of data privacy has gained huge momentum in recent years — the challenges of which have been compounded over the past 12 months due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. We have witnessed data challenging the likes of oil as our most valuable asset, which further bolsters the need for an education surrounding the use of our information and the way in which it’s bought and&nbsp;sold.</p><p>Every day, the world makes millions of digital transactions through online shopping, communicating via mobile apps and generally sharing information, but who decides what happens to our information and at what cost? Many of us are familiar with how organizations gather our information in order to provide a better, more bespoke customer experience. Organizations, large or small, track the activity of their customers, whether it be the number of times they visit a website, the type of items they like to buy or simply whether or not they clicked on a link in an email. This information provides them with an insight into the needs of the consumer, and can often be mutually beneficial for both parties. The information collected can then be leveraged by the organization to improve its products and services based on the customer’s unique feedback.</p><p>The concept of data collecting and sharing has the potential to take a more sinister turn when an individual is unaware of what information is being shared or sold to third parties. Contrary to popular belief, multinational companies often do not share the data they have collected from their customers, as it’s too valuable and is often what holds the key to their&nbsp;success.</p><p>For example, in a bid to be more transparent, PayPal has released a comprehensive list of third parties with whom they share customer information, including the name of the company, why they share the information and exactly what information they&nbsp;share.</p><p>It should be noted that in deciding to release this comprehensive list, PayPal is an exception: more often than not, details such as this are hidden within lengthy terms and conditions or through the acceptance of “cookies” upon entering a website. Cookies, which track website traffic, allow companies to paint a vivid picture of the visitors to a website, and are under heightened scrutiny as increased attention is being paid to data privacy, although many users blindly allow many websites to use cookies without knowing the consequences. But should the onus be on the consumer to take more responsibility when it comes to sharing their information?</p><p>In order to take on this responsibility, consumers need to be equipped with the right information and the right tools. Emerging technologies such as blockchain can play a critical&nbsp;role.</p><p>Blockchain’s ability to store information on either a public or private network enables key parties to access critical information, and then only what the individual allows. This way, the power is placed back into the hands of the individual, where they can choose who they share their data with, and to what&nbsp;extent.</p><p>So, now that we know what’s wrong with the current scenario, where does the solution lie? The alternative is a concept called Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), which places control of personal information with the user, enabling them to log in to all of their online services using just one ID. No more forgotten passwords or having to hand over all your personal information; this is a concept that could dramatically change how we use the internet.</p> How Does Self-Sovereign Identity&nbsp;Work? <p>To better understand how SSI works and the particular benefits it provides, let’s take a look at one specific example: Ontology’s decentralized identity framework, ONT ID. Based on the specifications for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) laid out by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), ONT ID provides a self-sovereign system of data authorization and ownership confirmation, thereby granting true control to the respective users of a particular asset. It can be used to generate and assign digital, cryptography-based identities to different entities such as individuals, institutions, objects and content and supports collaborative services such as distributed and diverse ownership confirmation, identification and authentication of the aforementioned entities.</p><p>In a system that utilizes SSI, all users are granted unique identifiers that they can use to manage their identity to access online services. In the Ontology ecosystem, for instance, this solution is a mobile digital ID application and decentralized framework called ONT&nbsp;ID.</p><p>By combining ONT ID and a mechanism that uses verifiable claims, Ontology has successfully established a decentralized trust model and a distributed trust delivery system. The system uses zero-knowledge proofs to assure that services only access the specific data they require to verify identity, thereby ensuring the privacy protection of verifiable claims. Through solutions like ONT ID, it is also possible to incorporate various authentication service agencies and facilitate multi-source authentication to achieve a more complete picture of the respective entity’s identity.</p><p>In addition to building a trust network that relies on certain central entities, different entities can also build strong trust relationships amongst themselves. Such a credibility based network is generated through mutual authentication between entities. The higher the number of successful authentications, the higher the credibility of a particular entity. High credibility ratings would make the entities more reliable and trustworthy, and authentication from a high credibility entity will equate to higher credibility for said&nbsp;entity.</p> What’s Next for Identity Solutions? <p>As with other SSI solutions, ONT ID allows users to securely manage their digital identity by storing their data locally on a phone or on trusted cloud storage with a private key that grants access only to the verified user. Once the user is set up with ONT ID, they can use this single online identity to access a range of useful products and services, such as managing digital assets, paying for concert tickets using cryptocurrency or even settling insurance payments. In time, it is envisioned that this SSI will not only be useful online, but in the physical world as&nbsp;well.</p><p>The evolution of the internet and the steady online migration of essential services such as banking and healthcare has led to a resurgence of old questions about who the true owners of our online identities are. SSI will finally put an end to this debate, putting data back in the hands of the consumer and empowering them to use it as they see&nbsp;fit.</p><p>Decentralized and backed by <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain">blockchain</a>, self-sovereign identity solutions place an increased focus on verification, security and data management, and are a fundamental step towards achieving a new system where users are in control of their data and can seamlessly collaborate with enterprises while trusting that their data still belongs to&nbsp;them.</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/a-guide-to-self-sovereign-identity-a-deep-dive-by-ontology-3fe0f12c3be2">A Guide To Self-Sovereign Identity: A Deep Dive by Ontology</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Universal Identity has an inherent focus on human usability, which results in a unique mix of goals, ideas, and approaches to tackling the self-sovereign identity problem. As a complement to this subjective point of view, we strive to also understand the world as objectively as possible.</p><p>Our effort first aims to build a detailed map of the identity industry and underlying ecosystems, both of the historic and future versions, and with detailed drill downs into areas likely requiring significant evolution in future technology waves. Ultimately we have to understand the markets and ecosystems across multiple domains and disciplines.</p><p>This article formalizes the meta-structure (legend) of said map, through defining the concepts used in its composition. It also describes the multiple levels and layers of this map based on economic scale and varying disciplinary perspectives.</p> Methodology <p>Building the mentioned industry map is essential to our approach at Universal Identity. We take the following general approach to building understanding across a number of dimensions, as well as planning and building for the&nbsp;future:</p>  Problem — Formulate and iterate on a clear, concise and applicable problem statement. This can be achieved through, analyzing and modeling the ecosystem, markets, stakeholders, users and security, as well as understanding the what users and customers go through. As part of this effort we will have developed a multi-layer map describing the different aspect of the industry, ecosystems, markets, and products.  Solution — Define a set of products, standards and business models, based on the understanding established above. Being armed with a clear map of the industry and ecosystems, allows for a more effective solution definition.  Implementation — For each of the major ecosystem entities and their products, plan for operations, engineering, organizations and information dissemination. Start off the ecosystem by implementing the public organization’s products such as standards, reference information and source code, as well as helping any private vertical pieces required for initial&nbsp;usage.  <p>Parts of these steps may occur in parallel or out of order, however the general sequence remains as shown above. Throughout this effort the map of industry in its current and future forms comes together gradually.</p>Methodology and&nbsp;mapping Meta-map <p>The comprehensive map we are putting together should encompass all levels of activity in the industry, starting from the very top level (industry itself), continuing down to the various ecosystems, underlying markets and use-cases, and drilling down to the specific products, scenarios and features.</p><p>At all of these levels we will be able to apply the lenses, tools and perspectives described above, in order to build an even more comprehensive understanding. See the appendix for definitions of meta-subjects such as lenses, tools, perspectives and&nbsp;domains.</p>Meta-map and&nbsp;examples Levels <p>There is a certain hierarchy to the industry map with multiple levels, each corresponding to different economic activity value orders of magnitude. The exact dollar calculation for each level activity is not precise or even feasible to obtain in some cases. Nonetheless we have included approximate values for illustrative purposes only, meaning these exact figures should not be taken too seriously.</p><p>Below are the levels used in the map, followed by their estimated economic order of magnitude:</p>  Industry — $100B-$1T  Ecosystem —by technology wave and/or segment — $10B-$100B  Market— by solution or product category— $1B-$10B  Use case — $100M–$1B — may be served by multiple competing products  Product — $100M-$1B — may be satisfying multiple use&nbsp;cases  Scenario — $10M-$100M  Feature — $1M — $10M  Sub-scenario — $100K-&nbsp;$1M  Sub-feature — $10K-&nbsp;$100K   Industry <p>The industry scope represent the space of all economic activities related to a specific subject, as well as all the businesses and offerings that add value in that general area. Most often this is related set of human needs such as with the entertainment and hospitality industries. At other times it revolves around a specific set of supporting activities for other industries such as with the information technology industry, or its subset the digital identity [systems] industry. Example of the identity industry pertains to all of the businesses and offerings that focus on adding value to the greater economy through the uptake, usage and support of identity&nbsp;systems.</p><p>The greater space may encompass vastly different customers, modes of delivery and technologies, each of which will form a separate sub-ecosystem based on categories such as customer segments or technology waves.</p><p>Ecosystem — The ecosystem perspective focuses on the significant relations and economic interactions between the industry players. An effective way of doing this is following the flow of value between different types of players all the way to the end-customers.</p><p>These ecosystems can be further divided down into sub-ecosystems, often based on how flow of value converges within certain groups of ecosystem players. The identity space or ecosystem for examples can be divided into the consumer, business and government segments, or separately separated based on the type of technology (digital, physical, etc) and technology wave (on-premise, web 2.0,&nbsp;etc).</p><p>Technology wave — The larger sub-ecosystems of an industry are formed based on specific technology waves that transform that industry by pushing the frontiers of efficiency and significantly affecting the cost and revenue models. For example, the advent of digital packet switching in tandem with Moore’s law transformed the information systems industry, due to the dramatically lower cost of information transmission using digital technology, and lead to emergence of the internet.</p><p>Segments— We can pivot economic activity inside an ecosystem based on the final customer they serve, ignoring cross segment activities. Some ecosystems do not have significantly cross segment activity, and so can be cleanly subdivided into sub-ecosystems corresponding to each given market segment. In such cases we can safely deal with segment ecosystems as mostly separate spaces. For example the identity ecosystems for consumer and business are largely independent in terms of economic activity, so we can consider them in isolation.</p> Market <p>The market scope represents the space of all activities meant to provide offerings for a specific set of use cases. The markets generally have two sides, one side will be the providers with the offering, and the other side will be the customers, who make the final decision about purchase and usage. The offering described may take the form of one product or in more complex settings it may consist of multiple solutions or products from various providers.</p><p>Segment — Given that customers generally fall within certain categories, based on their needs and conditions, marketing professionals tend to segment the markets based on customer type. The most common segments used in large markets are consumer, business (consisting of small, mid-market, enterprise), and government (sometimes as institution and nonprofits).</p><p>Use case — With every product or solution, most often there are a handful set of use-cases that describe the way users and customers receive value through usage. These are descriptions of user interaction with the product interfaces, including the specific action that yields value per user’s cognitive processes. Our recurring activities everyday are rife with examples of use cases, such as using a social media app to consumer or publish content, or using a refrigerator to store and retrieve food&nbsp;items.</p><p>Use cases are often what is associated in customers’ minds with some type of economic or behavioral (also a form of economic) value, and significantly effects purchasing decisions. The extent of this value and its substitutes in turn determines aspects of the business model such as pricing, profit and&nbsp;cost.</p> Product <p>Product generally describes a self-containing unit that a provider offers a customer. The customer’s involvement is limited to learning about a product, and eventually making purchase decisions (positive or negative) after further learning and interactions. The provider is responsible for defining the scope of a product, the functionality it offers, its brand and positioning relative to other substitutes.</p><p>There is a lot that goes into defining, building and supporting a superior product, but it all starts with scoping the product in terms of use-cases, functionality and audience. For example, in the case of smartphones, each iPhone product line is scoped for a specific audience (with specific financial capabilities for example), and iPhone’s general use cases are targeted for non-technical consumers who want a device that just works for daily common tasks. Other products, such as say a Samsung Android phone, defines a different scope, namely for more technical users who value productivity and customization use cases as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Scenario — is a common descriptive tool used to communicate specific functionality of a product as well as its temporal relation to users and other actors along a certain class of interactions. Scenarios, at various level of granularity, can be used to breakdown and reassemble the full functionality that a product provides, and so they make the perfect scoping vehicle for the product’s internal development.</p><p>Feature — is a self-containing unit of function provided by a product for a specific purpose. These are perceived and accounted for by customers in their mental valuation and decision making process. Specific customers may value a specific feature differently based on their wants and needs. Continuing with our smartphone example, the face recognition feature may be offered on specific lines of products, with the mixed purpose of providing quicker access to the phone for productivity, as well as showcasing the latest technology for tech enthusiasts.</p> Entity <p>Entities represent the private goods or public goods organizations that may exist at various levels of the map. Generally we enumerate the following types of entities:</p>  Individual — Person or household  Business — Private business organization  Non-profit — Public good, non-profit organization  <p>For example, standards organizations are public good organizations, that exist at the ecosystem level and help in developing that ecosystem by allowing market participants to benefit from predictable interoperability rules. Technology companies are often for-profit private goods organizations that focus on introducing products to one or many markets and each of which fulfills a given use case. Customers in turn can be people or organizations depending on where in the ecosystem we are&nbsp;looking.</p><p>Worldview — In order to better understand the activities of a given entity, we can model their point of view. In the case of organizations, this is often formally and thoughtfully defined in the form of topics such as vision, mission, and goals. Building this model allows us to better predict an organization’s future behavior as part of the greater ecosystems they participate in.</p><p>Competencies — Most organizations are formed around a well-known set of competencies in a well-known domain of industry. Part of these competencies are common in a given industry, but part of them are specific to that organization’s formation. This usually allows a firm to differentiate its products and create a unique advantage.</p><p>Brand — is the most subjective aspect of and entity as perceived by individual stakeholders such as users, customers, partners, employees and investors. It consists of various sensory and narrative components such as the the visual graphics used for the brand, the lexical name of the brand itself, as well as the brand’s positioning narrative and&nbsp;tagline.</p><p>For example the Universal Identity brand is an aspirational and descriptive name for a universally interoperable digital identity protocol enabling a large and increasing number of everyday digital activities.</p> Charting a new&nbsp;course <p>As part of proposing a new solution to an existing problem, one has to provide detailed prescriptions around missing pieces or required changes in approach. In the case of proposing a new category of identity systems, based on the digital decentralization wave of technologies, we have the opportunity to describe the essential pieces of such a new ecosystem ahead of time, and to prescribe the implementation of the parts that will be essential for kickstarting it into existence.</p><p>We cannot just discuss technologies without reference to how they will solve real people’s problems. Having a list of real use-cases with associated personas and economic value for example really helps in steering technology discussions in a direction that can have a lot more business tractions. We also cannot propose technical architectures without considering the future shape of the ecosystem in terms of its players, power dynamics, and value flow&nbsp;chains.</p><p>Diving into the creation of a new ecosystem, will require understanding of the existing web 2.0 ecosystem in terms of markets, products, use cases, user experiences as well as their current real-world economic value. Part of what determines the success of such an effort is the clarity of the map visualizing its future state, and the road to get there. Every assumption and detail has to be thought out throughly and tested against historical data of previous ecosystems based on older waves of technology.</p><p>Some key determinants of success will be the correctness of predicted ecosystem structures, standards, and key entities that will drive the ecosystem’s creation and growing traction past the tipping&nbsp;point.</p> Conclusion <p>There are a number of players in the new decentralized digital identity, all aiming to build a new identity layer for the internet. However we at Universal Identity believe this can only be achieved if it is positioned to serve the identity owners and their everyday digital needs, and is ultimately designed for usability and interoperability. With this approach, we have chosen to focus on building a full understanding of the user needs before prescribing a technology solution.</p><p>With this article we are kickstarting an effort to map the identity [system] industry, and publish it as a public good. We have described and formalized the map’s meta-structure, and defined the concepts used in its composition. We intend to work with the community to fill in the missing pieces of this map. Please check out <a href="https://map.universal.id">https://map.universal.id</a> and consider contributing to this common&nbsp;effort.</p><p>We hope this approach ultimately enables a more robust solution for all players in the decentralized digital identity space as we chart a new territory together. As for us at Universal Identity, we will consult the resulting map for our initial solution proposal, as well as subsequent iterations, to the interoperable and usable decentralized digital identity&nbsp;problem.</p> Appendix — Meta-concepts <p>The so called meta-map of the industry, uses a series of high level concepts which we will define here. These helps us understand and describe the different aspects of industry realities, including with perspectives such as markets and ecosystems. The ultimate goal here is improving the vision for Universal Identity and increasing its chances of&nbsp;success.</p>Meta-concepts<p>Of course, this type of a meta-mapping and mapping exercises can be applied any other industry, though here we are specifically applying it to the identity [system]&nbsp;space.</p> Domains Domains and&nbsp;examples<p>Domains refer to high level areas of knowledge and skills that have to do with differences in nature of the main subject matters, namely: humans, technologies and the&nbsp;economy.</p>  Human — The general discipline of design and humanities deals with humans as subjects, and accounts for their unique nature in its embedded areas of knowledge and skills. This set of skills is often represented in businesses by graphical or industrial design teams under product organizations.  Technology — The general discipline of engineering aims to domesticate technologies and deal with their diversely unique natures, through its various sub-disciplines. These days, engineering organizations are a major source of competitive advantage in technology companies.  [the] Economy — The economy can be defined as the greater set of economic interactions in human society, which are mostly monetary. It is the subject of endless policy and business strategy discussions. Disciples of the more general “business” discipline, seek knowledge and skills to understand, manage and interact with aspects of the economy. Sub areas include marketing, business development, strategy, organizational management, public relations, etc.  <p>Many types of careers fit nicely within one of the above domains. One factor contributing to the above observation is the extended amount of time and resources required to master any discipline within a domain. Another factor is the fundamental differences in the nature of the domain’s subjects, which generally means that a disciple of each of these domains fits an approximate psychological profile. For example, those interested in understanding human beings are likely to become disciples of design or humanities.</p> Basic lenses <p>At the lowest level, most domains and and perspectives can be viewed and broken down using the elemental lenses described below. These are used to analyze and model the world and ultimately better predict future&nbsp;trends.</p><p>For example, the systems lens is the most prevalent way to look at the world when it comes to engineering. Or the design perspective takes advantage of the cognitive view when tackling user interactions and experiences.</p><p>Systems (mechanics) — A generalized systems-based view of analysis and modeling. It starts with viewing actors as systems that interact and which in turn have organized functional components.</p><p>Economics — A generalized economics-based view of analysis and modeling. It starts with the&nbsp;view</p><p>Cognition — A human view focusing specifically on state of human minds involved and the acts of interaction and communication between them. In most cases this view can further be broken down and recomposed back into the systems and economics views.</p><p>Probability — Is a view focused on assigning probabilities to future and seemingly random events. It is the primary view used to build prediction models in order to invest wisely in future outcomes for highest&nbsp;returns.</p> Basic tools <p>These are the fundamental tools used in most or all of the various disciplines, in order to build an objective understanding of the area, and be able to reason about applying changes to&nbsp;them.</p><p>Analysis — Breaking down areas and systems into their parts based on environmental and historical data. The process helps identify independent variables attributed to specific agents or environmental forces, as well as starting to experiment with the outcomes of making changes to those variables.</p><p>Modeling — Understanding systems and their interactions with the world by modeling their components as well as interactions. This often involves recognizing the things, patterns, actors and behaviors that consistently describe those interactions, and building objective models of these. The models can in turn be tested for validity and usefulness as their output is compared to real world historical data.</p><p>Optimization — Determining a set of goals and metrics and optimizing a known model to maximize said goals and metrics. Maximizing profit for a business model can be one example of using optimization as a tool. Waste-minimization in an operational process can be considered as another example. Simplifying a user interface for minimal cognitive overhead is yet another example of its&nbsp;use.</p><p>Prediction — Enables more effectively planning for seemingly random future events. For example, optimizing on future economic outcomes are most effective when paired with a sound probabilistic model of outcome and formal prediction mechanisms. Of course these mechanisms will be based on historic data and assumptions that may prove incorrect, however probabilistically they give us the best odds given we iterate them following learnings from external data and assumption tests.</p> Perspectives <p>Perspectives refer to the patterns and viewpoints used to understand and interact with external realities. They often nicely align with the individual disciplines represented in most major businesses, such as marketing, engineering, design etc, as reflected by organization structures at the leadership level, such as Chief Marketing, or Product, or Information etc. Officer positions.</p><p>Below are the list of these so called perspectives, in turn containing a list of significant encompassed topics:</p>  Industry — Ecosystem, stakeholders, incentives, alliances, power dynamics, game-theory, standards  Market — Audiences, needs, wants, use cases, positioning, promotion, branding, pricing, psychographics  Design — Personas, experiences, sentiment, brands, habits, mental&nbsp;maps  Security — Expected outcomes, risks, vulnerabilities, damages, mitigations  Product — Solutions, Products and services, interfaces, delivery, user-tasks, features, state and storage, specifications, support  Business model — Customers, agreements, transactions, income, costs, profits, pricing,&nbsp;strategy  Operations — Procedures, logistics, projects, waste-minimization, scenarios  Engineering — Architecture, infrastructure, building, fixing, upgrading, maintaining, monitoring, servicing, scenarios  Organization — Vision, mission, culture, leadership, functional orgs  Information — Concepts, structures, descriptions, contexts, instructions, media  Narration — Worldview, memes, media, public positions, founding&nbsp;myth  Jurisdiction — Legal entity, governance, compliance, taxes,&nbsp;lobbying  <p>And below are the definitions of each perspective:</p><p>Industry — Is the perspective of looking at the space from the macro level, generally with a focus and general economics and game theory of the various groups of players. Disciplines such as strategy, business development and part of finance are covered&nbsp;here.</p><p>Market — One can look at the space from the perspective of the individual markets where solutions and products are offered to paying customers, and where the decisions to purchase are made based on the customer’s perspective and needs, as well as the products’ position and branding.</p><p>Design — This focuses on the perspective of users and how the understand and interact with products. It considers the users’ mental maps, sentiments, interaction mechanics, and user types in the form of personas, as well as helps with define the product’s user experience.</p><p>Security — With an almost paranoid view, security focuses on all the possible undesirable outcomes in the lifetime of a service or product, and builds an understanding of which types of vulnerabilities, attacks and mitigations the product and its encompassing support should&nbsp;address.</p><p>Product — This perspective focuses solely on the surface and structure of product itself, how it is defined, built and delivered to customers. This is arguably one of the most impactful perspectives in defining the customers’ and users’ final experience with purchasing and using the product. Product overlaps with and helps converge a number of other perspectives namely industry, market, design, business model, operations and engineering.</p><p>Business model — This perspective ultimately helps understand and define the financial viability of an entity, based on understanding the customers’ economic parameters, as well as modeling other factors such as costs, revenues, profits based on the product’s features and pricing. There is a bit of overlap with industry in terms of strategy, and some overlap with marketing around&nbsp;pricing.</p><p>Operations — Focuses on predictable and consistent performance and creation of value. As such it pays special attention to things like project and program management, as well as general efforts to minimize waste in recurring processes that are the heart of a business, product and services.</p><p>Engineering — This area focuses on the sustainable building and maintenance of systems by applying technology. Expertise in topics such as architecture, infrastructure, automated servicing can create significant advantages for an organization.There may be overlaps with other disciplines around scenarios and project management.</p><p>Organization — is the perspective of guiding an organization of people to work together towards the same goal. The all-encompassing part of this perspective has to do with creating and curating a culture that is aligned with the organization’s identity. There are various areas of overlap with other disciplines such as with human resources on managing people and their aspirations, as well as with organizational management on helping develop effective leaders.</p><p>Information — focuses on compiling, organizing and disseminating information and data in a way that advances the organization’s goals. It covers compilation and organization of shared concepts, contexts and instructions that would be heavily used in the organization’s lifetime. It also covers the methods and media to make said information available, such as through a&nbsp;website.</p><p>Narrative— This area pays attention to the narratives that shape perceptions of the organization inside and outside the organization. Internally narratives shape beliefs and culture, as well as motivate members of the organization to pursue shared goals every day. Externally the narrative about the existential identity of the organization inform how all stakeholders, including the general public, customers, users, partners, and investors, relate to the brand and organization.</p><p>Jurisdiction — focuses on public policy, legal enforcement and balancing them across multiple physical (and virtual) jurisdictions. It deals with ensuring compliance with the specific jurisdictions that an organizations decides to operate within.

<p>Okay, we’re live. Hi Heather, thanks for joining me today.</p>
<p>Thank you for having me.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Heather, I’ve been looking forward to this conversation. I was researching you online and reading about some of the experiences you’ve had. The one that stuck with me was the children’s book series that you co-authored. The books teach kids all about cybersecurity, and I find that fascinating. In this decentralized identity industry that we’re in, we could definitely work to improve our ability to completely break down a topic like that and explain it clearly to kids. Would you mind talking to me about yourself and your experiences?</p>
 The CYNJA Series 
<p>Heather: Our books are called “The Cynja Series.” C-Y-N-J-A, which stands for Cyber Ninjas. The world has a lot of ninjas out there, especially when you’re 9 or 10 years old. Being a Cyber Ninja? That’s a special kind of ninja: with unique expertise, that’s trained and learned over time. It all happened around the same time I got into decentralized identity. I was developing threat intelligence solutions with Chase Cunningham and said, “I have a project for us! Let’s write a children’s book about cybersecurity that’s really awesome and cool.” Chase Cunningham and I co-authored the books along with Shiro Darasu, who’s a fantastic artist. We realized that kids didn’t fully understand the dangers that were lurking in cyberspace. When we looked at most of the typical cyber education materials, they included spaceships and fuzzy bunnies —neither of which live in cyberspace, exactly. There’s nothing out there that was capturing the interest, especially of a certain nephew of mine. So, that’s where the book started. I wanted to inspire a kid like my nephew, who, at the time, didn’t think bad guys lived in cyberspace.</p>
<p>Instead of wanting to be a cyber warrior, he was more interested in slaying dragons. I tried to explain to him that job opportunities are pretty limited in that field, but job opportunities slaying Botnets and Worms; now we’re talking! That’s how we developed the <a href="https://www.cynja.com/cyber-safety-for-kids-the-cynja-books">Cynja book series</a></p>
<p>As we talk about decentralized identity, the next frontier is trying to explain this. Not only to kids, but to adults: business executives, lawyers, accountants, and so on. This is something where we have to develop the story for multiple audiences, multiple personas, and explain it. On the one hand, I guess you know what my next children’s book topic is! On the other hand, we’re committed to it within <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a>, as well.</p>
<p>Mathieu: That’s amazing! It takes a special talent to be able to break a topic down to the right principles and the right basics to be able to explain it to any type of audience. As I mentioned earlier, I think that’s badly needed in SSI or in decentralized identity. It’s impossible to underestimate the importance of visuals. Not only for conveying complex topics but also in catching interest where someone genuinely wants to spend the time to learn.</p>
<p>Heather: Since we’re talking on a podcast, I want to mention that it’s visually astounding to see the images of the artists that we work with. Shiro Darasu is a software engineer who happens to be an amazing graphic artist. He understood the concepts, and we all got on the same page of “What could this world look like? Let’s visualize it.” We need to go through the same activity here in <a href="https://northernblock.io/">self-sovereign decentralized identity</a> and explain how this world works for multiple learners. That could be for someone who wants to read, or is perhaps a visual learner, or maybe that’s someone who likes this podcast and wants to listen while driving in the car. We have to make sure that those of us who are developing and working in this space convey that information in multiple ways and through various channels.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Then, I guess you moved into the centralized identity arena. At a later point, you were the CEO of the <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin Foundation</a>. For those who don’t know Sovrin: Sovrin is a decentralized network that serves as a public identity utility for several decentralized identity projects. Heather, you were the CEO of Sovrin — do you mind talking about how you got into that space and then about your experiences with Sovrin?</p>
 Heather’s career trajectory to Sovrin 
<p>Heather: To talk about how I got to that position at Sovrin, we have to go back a few years. There were a lot of people who spent hours and years of work to reach the point where Sovrin was. I became involved in what’s now known as self-sovereign identity in perhaps 2011. About ten years ago, I worked with the company Nustar, and we were doing some initial research and development around what became the “respect network.” When I was involved in the respect network, we had done some research with Drummond Reed, who helped create that network. I was, and still am, very focused on children’s data safety and privacy around children. When I left Nustar to focus on my Cynja books, I also was getting asked by parents right-and-left: “How do I protect my kids online?” So, Chase and I developed the first commercial application on the respect network, called Cynja Space. Cynja Space allowed parents to effectively control and manage how their children’s data was stored when they were online or on their iPad. That’s how I became involved with what evolved to be Sovrin. I served on the board of directors of Sovrin, and things continued to mature. Eventually, I moved into the role of CEO of the Sovrin Foundation.</p>
<p>Mathieu: How did Sovrin evolve? Sovrin’s still running today. If you go to Sovrin’s website, there are tons of different organizations that are associated in one way or another with Sovrin and that use Sovrin. It seems to be one of the most popular implementations today in that decentralized self-sovereign stack. How has Sovrin evolved today from the time you got into it? Also, perhaps you can begin talking about Indicio: what got you into that, and what are the big differences between Indicio and Sovrin?</p>
<p>Heather: Sovrin is a success story of a tremendous community effort. When I say community, we’re talking people from all over the world; various companies of different sizes, across industries sizes, and different solutions and visions for where they want self-sovereign identity to go. Someone new to the field needs to understand that Sovrin’s not one person or one particular effort. Sovrin is a collection of the world’s beliefs and support for the concept that an individual must have the ability to manage and control their own digital identity. I saw at Sovrin that our goal is to adopt decentralized identity (or self-sovereign identity). We need to move away from the centralized database model, where a company gives you an identity, and you’re locked into that database. In that model, you can’t prove something about yourself without someone looking into their database.</p>
 What Heather’s working on at Indicio 
<p>The vision is something that we all believe in and want to achieve, but it’s important to remember it takes a lot of steps to get there. At Sovrin, we saw the challenges that organizations had. We saw the challenges, the blockers, the learning curves, and the frustrations. At Indicio, our motto is “no blocker is too big or too strong.” Our goal at Indicio is to simply accelerate the creation, adoption, and the widespread use of <a href="https://northernblock.io/verifiable-credentials-for-fintech/">verifiable identity credentials</a>. In that way, people have control over their digital identities and how they share their personal information in a way that’s secure and protects their privacy. Our mission is to achieve that goal by helping any organization that encounters a blocker that they don’t understand when working through their digital identity initiatives. Another way I like to think of it is like a homework helpline. “Not sure where to go in decentralized identity? Bring your question to us!”</p>
<p>With Indicio, we’re trying hard to make verifiable credentials easy to adopt and easy to use across all stages of the decentralized identity journey. We realized that in order to make that happen, it’s not merely a technical challenge. Indicio does offer technical help. We have a team of engineers and architects who can help you work through any kind of blocker. Alternatively, maybe you’re trying to figure out an architecture, or you’re trying to figure out <a href="https://northernblock.io/building-self-sovereign-solutions-for-fintechs/">how to build a decentralized identity solution</a>. We’re there. If you’re trying to implement into a proprietary solution, we’ll help you do that too. Essentially, whatever it’s going to take (from a technical point of view), to help your SSI adoption of decentralized identity, we are going to be there side-by-side helping your team do that. What we learned is that a lot of organizations need training. We offer instructor-led training, programming from: “what’s a Verifiable Credentials” all the way to “how to set up your own Indy-based network.” Indeed, we customize the training programs, or we have modules that we’ve used with various clients. If you don’t teach how decentralized identity works, if you can’t get everyone on your team or the partners you work with on the same page, it’s going to be extremely challenging to move forward with a common language. So Indicio offers training.</p>
<p>There’s another blocker in determining the business strategy behind the changes. In other words, what’s the strategy of the solution I’m trying to build? What’s the strategy of my company, and how do I explain this new decentralized world? How do I explain the benefits of decentralized identity to my internal executive sponsors? So, we work on business strategy. Then, you’ve got to go out and explain this. We offer marketing and professional services around marketing. We can help organizations do slide decks, crafting their compelling stories. We help with technical writing; we help with writing press releases; we help with writing white papers; we support social media strategies. We’ll work on anything that can go out to the market and help explain what decentralized identity is. We have an awesome marketing team, with writers, editors, or social media digital marketers, ready to work with clients on that front. Lastly, we have a practice that’s solely focused on decentralized identity governance. There are multiple efforts in that regard. Sovrin has a governance framework that’s been years in development. You have the Trust-over-IP efforts, or you have governance efforts coming through other organizations. We have a governance team that helps organizations understand or review different governance documents. Some organizations want to write their own governance, and we help with that.</p>
<p>That explains the whole offering of what Indicio does, but it all boils down to “bring us your blocker.” One of the five areas I’ve just talked about is probably going to be able to help you move through that blocker and successfully continue down the path of adoption of decentralized identity.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I think people underestimate the strategy and thinking that needs to go behind implementing a successful decentralized identity, or decentralized anything strategy. We’ve been dealing with this for years now, in the blockchain and crypto and the centralized technology space. It’s something that must be faced as soon as you want to take advantage of trusted data, transparency, and credentialing solutions, all together within a broader ecosystem.</p>
<p>In reality, your business model is likely to change because you need to evaluate where you fit in this new ecosystem. It’s an excellent philosophy for you to take that broader range approach of different services you offer. It’s not just one thing, like providing a blockchain, for example, or providing a use case. There’s so much that goes into properly defining a strategy altogether. You mentioned the governance side of things, which is quite interesting, and we’re facing some challenges there also. We’re in conversations in the Trust-over-IP initiative, as one example, and there’s a lot of work happening there. Based on Indicio’s experience of working with different clients, how much do people underestimate the need for governance, and how early do you need to start talking about it?</p>
<p>Heather: Sometimes, dealing with governance issues can be overwhelming if you’re new to this space. To have adoption, you need to have a lot of people who are new to the space become involved. Our focus is to make it less daunting. What do we mean by governance? Let’s go through a governance framework; let’s walk through the different components; let’s talk about what’s needed. How does this apply to what we call machine-readable governance? It’s nice to have a legal document, but how does that apply to the actual code and operation of your agents, of your network? We try to talk about governance from the very first step in building your systems and understanding the roles of governance involved. The existing governance that we’ve adopted in our community over time is not a one-size-fits-all. Sometimes, we have to walk through understanding the particular, unique parts of a use case or regulatory demands. We have to look through the governance best practices that we have thus far and evolve this to the next step. Then, how do you implement that, and how do you explain that to the partners? We go back over the marketing; how do you explain the governance on up to your boss? How do you explain governance in a way that helps accelerate adoption instead of slowing it down?</p>
<p>That’s one of the challenges for those who are already in the space. Governance has actually slowed their adoption, so what can we do to help explain the role of governance? Maybe, to their legal teams or general counsel, who are going through their own internal reviews. With our support, they can go through the review more quickly. Perhaps, they can work with the council to talk about their concerns or how they apply to the frameworks that they’re looking at.</p>
 Indicio’s TestNet 
<p>Mathieu: One of the most interesting aspects coming out of Indicio, which is also visible within this utility foundry working group that I’m a part of in the Trust-over-IP movement, is this Indicio network or the TestNet.</p>
<p>This is another piece to the puzzle in the whole stack, and it’s probably a piece that Indicio has identified as being a barrier to entry or increasing friction. We’re seeing more partnership announcements happening with Indicio, such as Trinsic and GlobaliD.</p>
<p>Are people looking for a fully-managed blockchain-based utility network? Is that the purpose of this Indicio TestNet, and what does the future of this network look like for you?</p>
<p>Heather: IdRamp and IDUnion’s Lissi Wallet both made announcements recently about working with Indicio. The effort originated with clients who are focused intensely on interoperability, especially the enablement of interoperability of networks. You need at least two networks to do that development. It began as a laboratory-based experimental network that clients could use to develop solutions. You can issue a credential on one network and read it from another. What’s fascinating is that innovation created the test network because we had clients wanting to push forward aggressively on interoperability, which is crucial to success. That’s where the Indicio TestNet started. When you’re focused on innovation, having someone there to call and help with your blockers is an important part of that. It allows our customers to have another brain to bounce ideas off of. By offering a professional staff supporting that network, it enables our clients to innovate and move faster. They’ve got that extra resource, they’re ready to go with them in the same direction, and it means there’s a support that’s committed to their success.</p>
<p>Mathieu: For this to be widely adopted, you need these solutions to be accessible. They need to be inclusive, and they need to be usable. I know Indicio was part of the Department of Online Security’s design challenge. Going back to your story of being able to explain stuff to kids, you need to be able to explain it in a similar way, depending on the user you’re trying to get it across to. How do you look at design? And, what do you think are the biggest contributions people could make in that space that would help the whole industry?</p>
 Inclusion, Interoperability, &amp; Transparency 
<p>Heather: It’s interesting when you talk about inclusion. We could have stood up the TestNet and said, “Oh, only certain organizations get to innovate on interoperability between networks.” Instead, we made sure that the first thing we did was to open it up so that anyone who wanted to use the TestNet, would be able to use the TestNet. You can go to the Indicio website right now for instructions on how you can use the TestNet. Part of the story here is inclusion: making sure that when we do something, we contribute it back to the community, the test not being one of those. The next one would be the Department of Homeland Security Digital Wallet Challenge.</p>
<p>Indicio doesn’t have <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-digital-wallet/">a digital wallet</a> — we are not a proprietary product shop. But, what we do have is a tremendous amount of insight, having worked with a variety of clients and industries around the world. We have a team where some of the members were new to this space, and they brought brand new ideas. We have a team at Indicio that’s multi-generational, and we have a team working within a robust intern program. So, we’re getting points of view from dual natives, and I would even say that the generation before digital natives is involved all the way through. Within Indicio, we have representation from every generation on our team, and what that brings is a fascinating point of view.</p>
<p>We saw this digital wallet challenge, and we decided we would put together an entry as a challenge for ourselves. This is going to be our team project to push ourselves to the next level. Everyone on our team contributed, but we had a core group who led the effort. We put together the submission, which was very much based on relationships that you have in the digital world, and we were selected as a finalist. That shows me that we often get caught in engineering, driving the effort, and saving budget. Whatever the reasons are, they’re driving the design. In order for decentralized identity to succeed and ultimately be adopted at the consumer level, you have to have representation and inclusivity. It’s necessary to have different types of experiences, jobs, ages, backgrounds, or geographies and develop your wallet from that point of view. That was what was so incredible about the DHS digital wallet challenge. I’m sure the DHS could have put the prize money towards developing all different kinds of code for a wallet, but they put it behind UI/UX. That is a very important signal towards the future of what our industry needs to be focused on. That is, ultimately, a focus on those who will use the wallet. Again, at Indicio, we want to contribute and help drive the adoption of decentralized identity. Once this wallet challenge wraps up, we will be open-sourcing our final design and all the components for anyone to use, if that will help their projects to succeed.</p>
<p>For these mass adoption, consumer-focused critical applications, it’s essential to take all these things into consideration and build a strong foundation of knowledge. You can do that by doing tests and taking different representations of people into your design decisions at the outset, even before thinking about technology or implementation. If you don’t have this methodology in place, then what you’re trying to do is just not going to work; whether you’re talking about public sector issuance of credentials or general societal use of decentralized identity. Two days ago, we announced the Aries Bifold project, and Indicio is helping the community lead to get to a full mobile agent. Indicio made the initial code contribution to the mobile agent. Within that code was our first contribution to the UI/UX that we developed as part of the DHS digital wallet competition. Our next contribution will be our final entry. There are different ways of thinking and varied points of view. An organization may use the UI/UX that we put out there or not. Our code could provide inspiration to help gain traction, help them get over a hurdle that they have, or think differently. No matter what, if it succeeds, that’s what our hope is with these contributions that we’re making back to the community. We want to help everyone move forward together.</p>
<p>I love that among the close community that we work with, and even the public sector, everyone seems to be all about this openness — open contributions and providing transparency into what’s happening. The whole movement that we’re seeing here is all about transparency. It’s all about bringing high levels of assurance and security, and being able to provide control for people to manage their own credentials in their lives. There’s a broad ecosystem, and with everyone putting the contributions together, that’s how this is going to keep advancing. Some of the decisions that Indicio made on the corporate level were driven by our wanting to make a social impact with this technology. We don’t necessarily want to be tied down to the traditional pressures of shareholders, or investors, or whoever’s involved in the company. This feeling led Indicio to completely rethink the corporate structure.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Would you mind speaking about that? You took an interesting decision to steer the ship that way.</p>
 Indicio’s Structure as Public Benefit Corporation 
<p>Heather: In December, we incorporated as a <a href="https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/advantages-of-turning-your-business-into-a-public-benefit-corporation">public benefit corporation</a>. That’s an option that is offered in just over 30 states in the USA. A public benefit corporation is an organization that balances its overall goals along with shareholder returns. Decisions are driven by a question – are you meeting the overall public benefit goals? At the same time, you’re also returning value to the shareholders who are involved, so they go hand in hand. We’re not saying, “Oh, we’re not going to pay our bills, so we’re not going to have a strong financial performance.” Instead, we’re going to have good performance while still embracing the goals and vision that our company was founded upon. We’re going to use the two together as a “north star” for our future. It wasn’t a decision we made overnight. Indicio was founded right after the pandemic began, and we thought about it for a number of months. We did analysis, we discussed it, we had our own internal meeting with our team, and we discussed it with others. We took our time and were very thoughtful. Ultimately, in December, we took the step of reincorporation as a public benefit corporation.</p>
<p>At Indicio, every single person on our team, from interns through our tech team, our marketing team, our government team — we all believe wholeheartedly that decentralized identity is going to have a transformative impact on society. Just as we believe we have a right to control our identities in our privacy offline, we also have the right to control our identities and verify in an online setting. We see verifiable digital credentials as something that enables everyone to have a permanent, portable digital identity and to have control and consent (key point) over who they share their personal data with. At the DNA level of our company, we wanted to recognize that decentralized identity is the foundation for this transformational change. So, we dedicated ourselves to building a successful and sustainable business based upon this commitment to the value of decentralized identity. We think that’s the most effective and accountable way to bring decentralized identity into existence. We’ve set out a charter that explains our mission, our values, our principles, and the commitments that we’ve made to pursuing them. At the end of every year, we’re not looking only for financial performance. That’s very important to us, but equally important to us is our performance against our mission. Together, we believe that is going to lead to growth, success, and ultimately the advancement of decentralized identity — which will benefit everyone.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I love what you said about the consent. I believe that that is truly key in everything we’re doing here. If you want to empower people to have a consent-driven life with what they’re doing, it’s all about consent. I love the public benefit corporation direction. For some who don’t know, there are well-known companies, like <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/activism/">Patagonia</a> for example, which is a public benefit corporation. In several of these really disruptive spaces, there’s so much benefit for people of this planet. If green energy companies and other similar industries could be able to take that structure, it would slightly realign the incentives. That way, you could not lose sight of your mission and why you started doing this.</p>
<p>Heather: It’s important that the technology that we’re working on reflects our mission accurately. In addition, how we operate as a company reflects our values and our mission. We’ve made commitments to our own employees on how we operate as a company; we’ve made commitments on our approach to sustainability in the environment. We have made commitments to inclusion — not only inside our own company but also to how we can help the community. That includes those who may not have access to the technical training, or for non-profits who don’t have large budgets. We make sure that we’re able do everything we possibly can for inclusion at every step of the way. Not only within our own company, but also for the clients that we serve, the decentralized identity community that we’re a part of, and then the community that we live in every day.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I want to take a couple points as my segué here. I’m going to try to combine two things together: first, you mentioned sustainability in the environment, and then you mentioned the incentives. In the space that we’re in, when we’re dealing with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger">distributed ledger technology</a> or blockchains, we typically get associated with the discussions of crypto, and bitcoin, and energy consumption, and mining, and stuff like that. It’s quite comical sometimes, some of the things that we need to explain in FAQs and other communications: “No, we’re not burning energy by mining and by running our technology.”</p>
<p>One of the things that “proper” crypto does very well is they have excellent designer incentive mechanisms in place. They often use their native tokens inside of that network. Is the concept of using a native token, or a digital token or digital currency, an idea that you have considered that could maybe help fuel and grow a decentralized public identity utility?</p>
 Emerging Decentralized Identity 
<p>Heather: We spend a lot of time thinking about the emerging economy of decentralized identity. To me, it’s more than a token. The question is, what is this emerged economy that’s being created? While there’s a token and network portion of it, there are other ways to look at networks and how they can be monetized. We work on that with clients and the community to define what is the best economy for decentralized identity. We don’t have a 100% solid answer to give today, but let’s explore all the different ways that you can exchange value through decentralized identity.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the questions:</p>
 
 
 
 Do you want to exchange value through decentralized identity? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Do you need to exchange value? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 What does exchanging value mean to you? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 What does exchanging value mean to your organization or your industry? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 What’s the important value stemming from the ecosystem or collaboration you’re part of? 
 
 
 
<p>We work through a whole litany of questions to understand. Once we understand what value means in that particular use case that’s developing, we need to understand how it’s applied to the technology:</p>
 
 
 
 Is it at a network level? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Is it an agent level? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Is it part of a membership program? 
 
 
 
<p>If a token could be one of those answers, then what does that token do or mean, and so on. I don’t think the token is the ‘magic bullet’ that’s going to do it all if you don’t have a clear answer on what value is to begin with, in your particular use case.</p>
<p>Mathieu: For example, let’s take your particular use case of a node operator. We might say, “Hey, we really want to build this solid and sustainable network that could support the growth of this new paradigm that we’re pushing forward.”</p>
<p>Are tokens or some form of payments for node operators something that you think about? Let’s keep aside the end users for the moment, and focus on the sustainability of the network. We don’t want to find ourselves in a space where people are potentially leaving the network, because there’s not necessarily a good enough business model to be a node operator. If we avoid all of the nodes becoming centrally stored in some big cloud solution, does it makes sense, from a node operator perspective, to have some sort of token economy?</p>
 Finding Value for the Node Operator 
<p>Heather: Yes, it goes down to the question of what is the value for the node operator? What kind of value are they looking to get out of it? It may not actually be tokens, or it may be tokens. I had an interesting conversation two days ago with the CEO of another company. We were talking about precisely this question: what is the benefit a node operator wants?</p>
<p>His first answer was, “Look, I’m just trying to develop a solution here. I’m happy not being a steward, or whatever you want to call that particular role, because I get so much out of the community and it helps me build my solution. Instead, I see the future as my solution in how I’m solving problems. I don’t see my business hinging on how much monetization I get out of running a node.” That was a fascinating conversation. In a way, when I was trying to have this exact conversation with him, he was giving me the cart with the horse.</p>
<p>I want to go out and prove that this technology works. It’s successful, and we can build a viable business on it. Once I feel confident about that, then I’m going to worry about time, energy, and being compensated for being a node operator or a steward. But, right now, the cost that I spend operating that node is so small compared to the cost I’m putting into building my solution. He just did not see that, and after that conversation, I can appreciate his point of view. Once again, I do think our focus is on getting traction on decentralized identity actually being used. We’ll find value to deliver to those who operate the nodes on the network to make sure that we continue to have that distributed environment. I feel confident that it can be done, and value can be given to those node operators. We just don’t know what the best value is at this point.</p>
<p>Mathieu: From our perspective, based on the clients we’re doing deployments with, the biggest barrier is the ecosystem design. In other words, who’s doing what, who’s benefiting from what, who needs to do what, and who needs to be in this ecosystem. We need a better understanding of how value creation happens within a specific ecosystem. We’re seeing both sides. We’ve seen, and still see in the blockchain and overall in the decentralized technology space, that some people are coming at this from the perspective of a start-up or an entrepreneur. They’re looking to <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-enterprise-cloud/">build an ecosystem solution</a> like a marketplace, and then on the other side, you have the large enterprise or the public sector agency that is looking to explore and deploy the stuff as well.</p>
<p>As a company that’s really focused on removing blockers for your customers and for the industry, do you see the same blockers being present on both sides? On one side with the start-ups, and the other side for the large enterprise or public sector players?</p>
<p>Heather: I’ll call what we see the “boil-the-ocean” blocker. An organization may have gotten so far down the road, asking themselves: “will we have enough node operators to operate the network?” When In reality, we still haven’t even proven that the slides that you’ve built can actually work and benefit your clients. When it comes to actually running a network, that’s something that can be solved. But, let’s start first with the simple requirements. We are always relying on the belief that the simpler the system you make, the more likely you are to be successful. So, focus exclusively on taking the steps, accomplishing the simple, and things will build upon each other.</p>
<p>On the network decision, go to a network, or roll your own network. Whatever it takes to get things stood up and working, then you can start figuring out what the right network environment should be, and what the right compensation in a network should be for your particular use case.</p>
<p>We’re very focused on simple <a href="https://northernblock.io/services/ssi-implementation/">deployments of decentralized identity</a>. What do I mean by a simple deployment? Decentralized identity that is concentrated on the relationship between a credential issuer, the credential verifier, and the credential holder. Once those participants are determined, then you can start deploying what we call a closed ecosystem. Make sure that that use case works, then move it over to the ecosystem. That simple use case actually may be inside your own company. You wouldn’t even need an outside partner to deploy a closed ecosystem that proves out the value of decentralized identity. Especially taking a global view, there are probably hundreds of enterprises that have use cases inside their own organization. They can deploy and use decentralized identity, and then they’re not wrapped up in a larger conversation about monetization of networks when they can focus on the success inside. That automatically starts opening things up. Success inside opens up success with partners; success with partners opens up success with collaboration consortium. As it continues, it keeps growing and growing, and then you can start focusing on the larger ecosystem issues. What we found is that if organizations aren’t focused on a simple solution, they can lose years to discussion and slide deck presentations. “Years” is not something the bosses like to see; they like to see traction, and deliverables, and building on a stepwise approach.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I’m starting to see a trend with your thinking, of keeping it simple with self-sovereign identity, with explaining cybersecurity to children. Often it’s the simple approach that allows you to make the most progress, because a lot of the pieces are ready. It centers around being able to test things out, try it out, and make it easy. Are there any exciting use cases that you see, or low-hanging fruit? What are the most exciting things you’re seeing today ?</p>
 Looking Forward – 
<p>Heather: The first thing that I’ll talk about is the structure that we’re seeing. With these exciting things I talk about, how did they even start? In reality, exciting things got started because of the three-legged stool: one is that they had one part of their early proof-of-concept or pilot focused on the technical solution. The credential issuer or verifier holder had the ability to write cryptographic messages to a digital ledger and retrieve them. So, you have the team that was able to do the technical success.</p>
<p>Then, working together, you had another group who was focused on the business of that solution:</p>
<p>What problem is it solving? Who are the issuers? How do we explain this?</p>
<p>How do we create presentations? How do we create blogs? How do we write about it?</p>
<p>How can we go get it funded? How can we get an executive sponsor?</p>
<p>How can we get a pilot working with actual users, that are not people working at the company?</p>
<p>The third group, or portion of this leg of the stool, is around governance. Even with a simple use case, it still needs governance — even if the governance is one line. The focus of the governance is:</p>
<p>How do users get and use credentials? How does this deployment comply with the ever-expanding global regulations on data stewardship?</p>
<p>When you have the technology, the business, and the governance working together on a very simple use case, then you apply it to the really exciting stuff that I think that people are constantly looking at. When talking about the cool use cases, we often overlook the arduous effort it took to get to cool. Because cool doesn’t happen overnight.</p>
<p>When we speak to use cases for our COVID world, we’re in a situation where you have data from one industry (healthcare), trying to convey authoritative data around a health status, to another industry that had no vision that they would ever need to interact with the healthcare system. Whether that’s something as simple as attending an event, or going to school, or doing anything that we used to do just over a year ago. We’re seeing a lot of use cases around getting back to pre-COVID life, however we can create that.</p>
<p>We’re also seeing some really cool early use cases coming out of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things">IoT</a> (Internet of Things). We often talk about decentralized identity and think about humans, but there are a lot of devices out there who (1) are connected to humans or (2) need to communicate device-to-device. That’s an area that hasn’t been a primary focus in the decentralized community, but I think it’s starting to gain traction. We’ll see start to see some intriguing developments there.</p>
<p>Lastly, <a href="https://northernblock.io/verifiable-credentials-for-fintech/">fintech in the banking world</a>. I think we all see the importance of authoritative data that can be used to speed transactions along, especially now in a world where people don’t want to go to offices; they don’t want to carry paper in. The reliance on digital records is more important than ever. Having the validity of those records built into the system is becoming more important, so we see those use cases coming out of the banking industry.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Wonderful! Well, Heather, I want to thank you very much for doing this with me today. I look forward to our next conversation — I would love to do this again in a few months from now.</p>
<p>Heather: I’m sure we’ll have a lot of new ideas and progress made between now and then, but yeah, thank you very much for doing this. I was really happy to be here, and thank you for asking me.</p>

 <p>Usually I am more energized by building tech than by talking about it, but I am so excited about what my son and I <a href="https://github.com/holochain/syn">did over winter break</a>, that I just have to share about it here. In an odd kind of busman's holiday, I spent a good chunk of my time off writing a Holochain application. Coding with my kid is just pure pleasure for me, but I have to describe the additional incredible experience of having spent 4 years building a tool, and now suddenly being able to use that tool to build what it was meant for: creating collaboration applications.</p><p>My passion for Holochain has always been sourced in upgrading our collective intelligence, which means making it easier and more joyful to collaborate together. In early December, Art and I <a href="https://github.com/holochain/syn/blob/main/DESIGN.md">sketched out</a>, in an afternoon, a generalized pattern on Holochain for real-time collaborative apps like Google docs where you can type in the same document as others simultaneously, and see their cursor moving around.</p><p>Over the holiday break, it took <a href="https://github.com/qubist">qubist</a> and me just one week to prove out SynText, a peer-to-peer collaborative text editing application.</p><p>Not only will it be incredibly easy (see the postscript) to add other such applications on top of the UI pattern and Holochain DNA that we built, but this pattern will allow git-like branching, forking, and merging, in a user-friendly way for any type of collaborative work, not just code.</p><p>My deep excitement in this achievement is two-fold: it’s both practical and also deeply philosophical:</p>  Syn demonstrates the technical threshold that we’ve crossed in landing Holochain. It was just easy and fast to build it, and things are working like a charm.  The patterns in the app bring a level of awareness and embodiment of the deep principles of Holochain's architecture to the forefront. These patterns are all about creating thrivable social-coherence. And by that I mean the kind of social-coherence that arises not from structural coercive centralization, but from peers collaborating by consent. This matters to me. &nbsp;  <p>So, here's the story about Syn, and bear with me through some back-story because it's important.</p> Back-story: Agent-Centric Data Enables Collaboration <p>If you've been following the Holochain/Holo story at all, you've probably heard that Holochain is "agent centric". Strictly speaking this is true, but unfortunately it has hidden a deeper truth about Holochain. Let me explain: we used the term *agent-centric* to distinguish Holochain from other software architectures (especially in the blockchain world) that are philosophically *data-centric*. The prime concern of blockchain ledgers is to create a single "consensus" view on a data reality in the distributed peer-to-peer world, where that's a known hard problem. In the case of Bitcoin, the idea is to create a data reality of the location of digital coins: who spent them and with whom. In the case of Ethereum, the idea is to create a data reality of not just coin locations, but also the state of a global computer that you can write and run programs on, i.e. "smart-contracts". &nbsp;</p><p>The reason creating these data realities is a hard problem in the decentralized network world is that it's impossible to determine the absolute ordering of events. This is a simple fact of physics. In the client–server paradigm this isn’t even a problem, because we start from a centralized server where there is a canonical notion of what the data is and a canonical time. The central server stores the data reality. The brilliance of blockchain is that it provides a protocol for distributed peers to hold data reality together, be it the order of transaction of Bitcoins, or the ordering of computation steps on Ethereum. But it does this by enforcing a single ordering of events. The stupidity of blockchain is that the protocol it uses to enforce this single ordering of events is incredibly expensive, extremely wasteful of computation power, and generates obscene amounts of greenhouse gases. On top of all that, for almost all distributed collaborative applications it's not even necessary to keep one single global ordering of events. It’s easy to make this mistake of thinking so if your purpose is a trustless system that’s trying to track the location of digital coins, but it turns out that you can still solve that same problem a different way.</p><br><p>Where is true data?</p><p>Ordering of….</p><p>Merge of Perspectives?</p><p>Data-Centric,<br>Centralized client-server&nbsp;</p><p>Central server, canonical version</p><p>...content is absolute as performed by the central server.</p><p>Forced (There is only one central perspective.)</p><p>Data-Centric, Bitcoin</p><p>All peers hold copies of data processed via a validation protocol</p><p>...transactions is based on randomized selection of one miner’s sequencing for each block to construct Consensus of token reality.</p><p>Forced (One perspective is kept for each block, all others discarded)</p><p>Data-Centric, Ethereum</p><p>All peers hold copies of data processed via validation protocols</p><p>...content is based on randomized selection of one miner’s or staker’s sequencing for each block to construct Consensus of the state of a dApp or smart contract.</p><p>Forced (One perspective is kept for each block, all others discarded)</p><p>Agent-centric, Holochain</p><p>Peers hold data they’ve authored, as well as data they’ve validated from other peers. Agents can see or create different realities/times</p><p>...content is based on its actual local order, since data is only truly sequential in the experience of an agent.&nbsp; Relative ordering across many people’s local state orderings can be established by explicit protocols and agreements to create shared reality in a case-appropriate way.</p><p>Merges only when needed, functions like git. All perspectives are preserved.</p><p>Enter Holochain. The **agent-centric** view point starts from the understanding that data is derived from agency. It does not have “primary” ontological status.</p><p>Data is essentially and fundamentally a record of a particular agent’s experience, be that a human, a sensor, or a device. In reality, agents see/sense/detect different things and receive feedback in different orders representing different realities. If any record’s provenance is separated from it, then the “data” represented by that record is fundamentally broken. We can only make sense of data if we know who sensed the data. This is why absolute ordering of massively simultaneous computation is impossible.</p><p>But herein lies the "unfortunate" part that I mentioned before. I have seen people jumping on Holochain's agent-centricity as if it were an ideological stance about the supremacy of individual rights. It is true that the agent-centric approach will help achieve some crucial goals in individual rights, especially around privacy, and preventing inappropriately centralized entities (corporate or governmental) from abusing data privilege. But this is only the first part of the story. &nbsp;</p><p>A Holochain application's architecture is better described as **collaboration-centric**. Start with the reality of agency. Don't dis-empower these agents. Instead fully empower them to enter into non-coercive play together with agreed upon rule-sets. Then what you get is thrivable social-coherence. This is what Holochain is designed to embody. And it's working!</p><p>So, enough back-story on the philosophy and infrastructure, now for the “front-story”.</p> Front-Story: Combining the two <a href="https://eric.harris-braun.com/blog/2016/03/16/id-328">mother apps</a> of collaboration <p>So here’s the big deal for me about Syn: It creates the possibility of merging the two most powerful aspects of collaboration software and doing so in the fully decentralized world. This merge, will, I believe have some really interesting consequences, but first the aspects are:</p>  Real-time multi-user “document” editing  Alignment of multiple realities: i.e. branching and merging  <p>I’m assuming that point #1 above isn’t controversial, as I will bet that upwards of 75% of everyone reading this has switched from a local word-processor to Google Docs or HackMD for almost all of their text editing.</p><p>Point #2 probably ought not be controversial as indicated by the prevalence of git in software development, but it might need a little explanation for those readers that don’t do team coding and therefore aren’t making code commits and branching, forking, and merging many times a day. Even for those of you who are, if you grew up doing so always with your git repos centralized on GitHub, you may be missing a key part of the decentralization story.</p><p>For me, the first time I understood what distributed software and peer-to-peer really meant as an architectural reality was when I switched from Subversion to Git for version control. Subversion was based on the mental model of a centralized repository (a database of changes to the code’s text files) from which coders would 1) make local check-outs of that source code 2) edit the files, 3) and then make a commit (which is storing back into the database a set of such changes), but 4) you might have to merge your changes before you could make the commit if someone else had committed first, which entailed resolving any conflicting changes. Coders could also make a branch (which was a copy of the repository) and create a bunch of commits on that branch and merge those in too, but the mental model was still of some central place with a single “canonical” reality that the group of coders was updating.</p><p>Git was different. Git assumes no center point. It assumes that each coder has their own copy of the code repository and can pull and push changes to any other distributed copy of the repo they have permission to access. It assumes that all changes are made to local branches and that branches will be created and merged all the time. It embraces locally divergent realities and eventual group consistency. </p><p>If you think that your git repository on GitHub is somehow special, well from git’s perspective it isn’t. It’s just a repo that a bunch of agents have agreed to use in a hub-and-spoke synchronization pattern. Your “git push” could be directly to your friends repos if they gave you access and you added them as a remote. In that case you would just be agreeing to a more mesh-like collaboration pattern. &nbsp;</p><p>Of course github has loaded lots of collaboration value-add on top of just being a place to embody the hub-and-spoke pattern, with issues, pull requests, kan-ban boards, integrated CI, etc. This is an important part of the story which is part of a pattern that repeats: decentralized public-domain protocols spawn centralized proprietary value-add silos built on top of those protocols. The detailed story of another example of this—about how AOL, GEnie, and Prodigy created chat-rooms, news services and all kinds of proprietary value-add on top of the primary feature of the internet’s SMTP protocol that provided the core service, email—is one I will tell some other time. But the key there is that proprietary value-add was erased by the arrival of another set of open protocols: http and HTML. And I think that Holochain/Syn may be yet another example of this story of the orders-of-magnitude value level-up that happens in this evolutionary process.</p><p>I’ll show how in a bit, but first it’s important to understand what it takes to build Syn apps.<br>To make a Syn app you have to do just a few things:</p>  Define a state model that represents your application. In the case of a text document this state model might be just two strings, the title and the document body.  Create patch grammar that defines all the transformations that you can do to the state. In our text doc example that might be just three things: insert a character at a position, remove a character from a position, and set the value of the title.  Create a delta function which, given a state and a transformation, produces a new state. This is<a href="https://github.com/holochain/syn/blob/488f165fd0befcc33e7cc862265d8c531f302f07/ui/src/App.svelte#L15"> pretty easy to do </a>with simple patch grammars.  Create a UI that:<br>a. renders the state when it gets notified that the state has changed, and<br>b. creates Syn transformations when the user would like to make a change.  <p>Once you’ve done that, Syn takes care of the heavy lifting of coordinating between all the agents making and synchronizing changes, all without a central server.</p><p>That’s aspect 1 from the consequences of collaboration software above:real-time multi-user collaboration. With one additional app-design task, Syn’s architecture also handles aspect 2, Alignment of multiple realities, in a general way:</p><p>5. Define a merge strategy for resolving differences between states and transformation sets.</p><p>This last task is where things get tricky to do well, and in general can’t always be done in a fully automated way. However, the idea is that when necessary, a merge strategy would include human intervention: manually (i.e. using human judgement) resolving the differences between conflicting change sets. This is nothing new to git users who handle merge conflicts all the time! Note that it’s important that merge strategy is not generalized and specified per-app. This is part of the power of the Syn approach. </p><p>Once this fifth task is done, Syn becomes a general framework for adding branching and merging to any collaborative app. At any given time, Syn has the notion of a session, which is just like a branch in git. It’s a commit to treat as a starting point for a series of changes. Unlike Google Docs which just has a single revision history, Syn provides, at the low level, a space for multiple version histories based simply on which session users join and start making changes. With merging, the realities these branches represent can become aligned. Because Syn supports generalized UI for creating/viewing/switching sessions and can insert the merging strategy defined by the particular app, this is a powerful pattern that used to be available only to coders using git. Now, suddenly, it can be applied to arbitrary collaboration apps. In a way, it’s two-level collaboration, synchronously on the “same” state, and asynchronously on divergent/convergent state.</p><p>To me this is a big deal. If collaboration is about empowered agents entering into non-coercive playing together by agreed upon rule-sets, then this pattern in Syn is a massive level up meta-rule-set for doing so.</p><p>Imagine Wikipedia articles with multiple branches that reflect the true differences we have rather than just being fights in the talk pages, frozen around the assumption that there is a single, neutral point-of-view. And because of their many branches, they can actually merge when people find a way to represent those divergences in ways that can be understood by those who were arguing. That’s next-level collaboration.</p><p>Imagine creating branched spreadsheets where each branch models entirely different scenarios off of a core set of assumptions that can then get merged together as reality shows us what happens. That’s next level collaboration.</p><p>Imagine the concrete vocabulary of conflict resolution that emerges as we develop new and interesting merge strategies for conflicting change sets in different application contexts. What does it mean to resolve two different color choices applied to the same object by different people in a drawing program? I can imagine an ad-hoc Syn app spinning up that lets people on the fly make proposals and vote, or do rock-paper-scissors, or whatever… all as part of resolving a merge conflict in another Syn app! That’s next level collaboration.</p><p>Do you see the implications? I’m excited.</p><p>P.S. The holo-hosting team has been using an online-stickies tool to manage choosing topics for our virtual retros. On seeing Syn one of <a href="https://github.com/robbiecarlton">our team members</a> dove right in and got this working in no time:</p><p><br>P.P.S. a little teaser for the hyper-nerdy reader</p><p>P.P.P.S &nbsp;A number of folks helped with this article: Thanks first of all to Will for being a co-conspirator-in-syn-itself and for detailed edits and clarifications here. Thanks Jean Russell for supporting and pushing me to get this out, and especially for the initial draft of the comparison table. Thanks to Pospi, Guillem Cordoba, Siddharth Sthalekar, Hedayt Abedijoo, Emaline Friedman for comments edits and suggestions that made this article much better. And finally thanks to Art Brock for the usual co-creative sketching out of things that we can then turn into reality.<br><br></p>

<p>The Shyft Network is a blockchain-based solution for centralized and decentralized technologies, like decentralized finance (DeFi). It’s a technology layer that aggregates and embeds trust into data stored on private and public ecosystems.</p><p>It essentially creates a protected data transaction layer for industry and the public sector, bringing, among other things, digital identity into the 21st century. In this article, we explore the Shyft Network technology and one of it’s most relevant use cases: compliant DeFi.</p> What Is&nbsp;Shyft? <p>In a hyper-networked world, effective online trust solutions can offer users and organizations sufficient protections while providing a framework in which all parties could be assured freedom from censorship, fraud, and unsanctioned use of shared&nbsp;data.</p><p>We believe that your information is only as secure as the weakest link in the chain of connected services and devices which handle it. That’s where Shyft Network comes&nbsp;in.</p><p>Shyft Network was designed as an interoperable standard for use cases that require multiparty trust and validation. We took a fundamentally different approach to data and identity thanks to its founders’ long history with Bitcoin, dating back to early&nbsp;2010.</p><blockquote>The Shyft Network enables identity verification, validation, and the sending of credentials and other data across multiple different blockchains and networks.</blockquote><p>The true goal of identity entails not having to give entities your information to verify who you are every time you open a new account. The question we asked is, How do you derive digital identity? We baked identity into the&nbsp;network.</p> Shyft Network never keeps or touches any personal identifiable information on the blockchain. <p>We ensure that privacy of the data itself is only stored across the participants with whom you already work. Since no data sits on the network, we created an encrypted way of validating institutions to certify or validate on your behalf without violating your&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Since Shyft manages identity information in a receipt-esque system, a digital receipt acts as proof that you have hitherto worked with another participant or entity on the network. Moreover, there’s a revocation process, where the protocol can invalidate a former receipt, depending on the compliance requirements, which differ across jurisdictions and situations.</p><p>With a focus on the requirements of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), as well as the KYC compliance issues that the blockchain ecosystem faces today, we’ve set out to ensure identity information is secure so that exchanges can forward customer data without violating privacy.</p><p>Technologically speaking, the Shyft Network’s identity solution can be thought of as an OAuth2-type interface for Web 2.0 and 3.0 applications with 2FA applications. Users can negotiate the exchange of their information, giving them control over their&nbsp;data.</p><p>By enabling the secure and auditable messaging between users and trusted parties, the Shyft Network empowers these parties to onboard new users in accordance with global compliance. The trusted parties can then, assuming user consent, send proof of relevant information about users to other parties by request. User data can be protected by their personally identifiable data through an opt-in framework.</p><blockquote>Our focus is on institutions and public networks. We work with everyone from banks, institutions, exchanges, regulatory bodies, as well as central banks and governments, bridging the crypto ecosystem to the traditional world.</blockquote> Who Uses&nbsp;Shyft? <p>The Shyft Network is composed of certain types of participants: Trust Anchors, Data Owners, Data Consumers, and Shyft Ring&nbsp;Nodes.</p> Trust Anchors <p>Trust Anchors custody regulated data, which they receive from consenting Data Owners, and maintain, review, read, write, confirm, and validate it. This data forms the basis of a user’s digital identity. Trust Anchors are regulated entities, such as financial institutions, cryptocurrency exchanges, regulatory bodies, and social media networks, which can set their own rules and work with other actors in the Shyft Network ecosystem, while individuals enjoy data&nbsp;rights.</p> Data Consumers <p>Data Consumers are those third-party services that do not custody “hard data” and are not regarded as fully-trusted parties on the Shyft Network. Data Consumers will offer Data Owners pre-approved services that require attestations of trusted data. When they request information from the network, they pay a small fee to the Data Owners and Trust Anchors in exchange for the attested information.</p> Data Owners <p>Data Owners can be individuals or entities that sign up for a service at a Trust Anchor or Data Consumer. These individuals or entities have the authentication-based right to control, share, and revoke private data via their private keys. Only they have access to these private keys, and can grant access to their data via Shyft’s consent-based framework, whereby they are incentivized to share their&nbsp;data.</p><p>Data Owners receive offers from Data Consumers for pre-approved services that require proof of trusted data. Data Consumers pay a small fee to the Data Owners and Trust Anchors for valid information.</p> The Shyft&nbsp;Ring <p>The Shyft Ring is the public-facing blockchain-enabled software for global consensus. A fork of the Ethereum codebase, we’ve incorporated our own extensions. Shyft Ring participants validate the entire state of the network as local connection nodes for non-full-node users, and complete PoW hashes to propagate blocks and establish security. The validators are incentivized based on the workload distribution necessary for optimal efficiency of the Shyft&nbsp;Network.</p> Key Network&nbsp;Features  The Shyft Block&nbsp;Explorer <p>Certain blockchain networks rely on a single block explorer. Ethereum, for instance, relies upon just EtherScan. Shyft, however, provides all nodes on the network with the tools to launch their own block explorers. This removes a potential point of failure. The Shyft Block Explorer offers a feature set previously unavailable to the ecosystem, like the option to view the individual transactions that make up “internal transactions,” which composes a critical part of the token&nbsp;economy.</p> Smart Contracts <p>Many key network functions have been regulated by a set of purpose-built smart contracts. Certain contracts facilitate KYC/AML checks, ensuring the needs of cross-jurisdictional regulators and required compliant entities.</p> Shyft Safe <p>The Shyft Safe is a smart contract powered bookkeeping software to manage and protect assets on the network so that users’ can self-custody the assets. A Safe asset is cross-attested into multiple blockchains, and addresses data invalidity and single-point-of-failure problems.</p> The SHFT&nbsp;Token <p>SHFT fuels the Shyft Network; think of it as gas that powers the engine. SHFT is a means of payment, a mechanism for bonding value, and an instrument for governance value capture. SHFT, depending on the use case, can be utilized in a multitude of ways which includes a monetary instrument and value capture system, as well as an authorization system for long-term validation.</p><p>SHFT is a currency for identity and data transmission, as well as a governance mechanism for coordination across ecosystems that enables entity-to-entity governance, compliant asset creation, and a system for compliant defi and other applications. Enabling a new side of the existing ecosystem will drastically expand the size of market participants and increase the size of asset participation across all decentralized projects, protocols, and marketplaces.</p><p>You can read more on the SHFT token&nbsp;<a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/the-shft-token-15743ba0e2d8">here</a>.</p> Interoperability <p>We built the Shyft Network with interoperability in mind, ensuring our protocol would work across the existing applications in the Ethereum environment and other networks. Therefore, we’d also be able to gain from a lot of the innovation happening.</p><p>For instance, certain blockchains might serve different business logics better than others. That’s why the Shyft Network must be compatible across blockchains. Shyft’s interoperability bridging layer works across other networks to leverage the advantages that these networks&nbsp;hold.</p><p>We create the layer that assigns and proves data. Collaborative interoperability is paramount to the Shyft Network vision so that projects can work across diverse ecosystems and ensure that they conform to certain requirements when necessary.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/oasis-protocol-project/shyft-network-to-build-opt-in-compliance-primitives-on-the-oasis-network-393388c51f71">Here’s </a>one example of what Shyft Network can do for the Oasis&nbsp;Network.</p> Shyft Network Use Case — Introducing Compliant DeFi <p>Our goal is to create the premiere, compliant and scalable DeFi ecosystem across centralized and decentralized markets.</p><blockquote>Traditional financial institutions strictly adhere to Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering (AML), and Combating The Finance of Terrorism (CFT) guidelines. As permissionless, opt-in, trustless p2p networks without a central authority to enforce these requirements, blockchain-based networks often fail to do&nbsp;so.</blockquote> The Current&nbsp;Problem <p>The current DeFi ecosystem is prone to trust issues since participants conduct activities anonymously, violating compliance requirements imposed on financial institutions.</p>  Large Liquidity Providers are blocked from interacting with the DeFi space because of regulatory constraints and lack of clarity on existing and upcoming regulations which requires them to obtain information on the source and destination of&nbsp;funds.  Similarly, platforms within the DeFi space are blocked from accessing deeper capital markets because of the small opportunity space relative to the total potential addressable market assuming regulatory compatibility.  Regulators are forced to comprehend the space through the lens of (potentially obsolete/irrelevant) loosely-matching, past environments that regulations have applied to previously.   The Shyft Network solution for&nbsp;DeFi   Identity Verification. We provide an opt-in framework for gathering, storing, and sharing user identification data on a need-by basis. Our platform acts as a trust anchor and a bridge between users, DeFi platforms, and centralized organizations by providing the required data in a secure manner. <br>We can facilitate trustless transactions in a decentralized environment by helping the parties to comply with all the regulatory requirements imposed on centralized systems. The platform achieves this by acting as a Trust Anchor that validates the personal data and transaction details by publishing their proof on the blockchain.  Creation of Compliant Assets and Asset Pools. Only verified individuals and organizations will be able to create compliant DeFi assets and asset pools such as loans, liquidity pools, derivatives, governance tokens etc.<br>The Shyft Network can function as a validator for DeFi participants. Verified players will have their addresses whitelisted, enabling them to participate, create, and have access to compliant assets.<br>Malicious and suspicious actors will be blacklisted as a precaution to other users, which is aimed at minimizing risk.  Compliant Decentralized Credit Scoring. As part of its continuous development plan for 2021/2022, Shyft Network plans to deploy a blockchain-based credit scoring method that relies on users’ data stored on nodes rather than using their credit scores from the legacy financial system.  <p>This framework will help generate better credit scores for an open and independent DeFi ecosystem. Our goal is to tackle the over-collateralization problem in DeFi, improve access to credit, and open the door for legacy lending institutions’ entry into the ecosystem.</p><p>Shyft empowers users to take data and assign or validate it against multiple different participants. It is a network based on trust so participants can derive identity or data for compliance requirements, and much more, so that crypto can thrive in the traditional world.</p><p>Bring crypto to the world with Shyft, and join the network&nbsp;today.</p><p>Shyft Network aggregates trust and contextualizes data to build an authentic reputation, identity, and creditability framework for individuals and enterprises.</p><blockquote>Join our <a href="https://www.shyft.network/signup?userType=network">Newsletter</a></blockquote><blockquote>Telegram (<a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">https://t.me/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Follow us on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/ShyftNetwork">https://github.com/ShyftNetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our website (<a href="https://www.shyft.network/">https://www.shyft.network</a>)</blockquote>

<p>While the Kusama and Polkadot ecosystems are eagerly waiting for parachain auctions, we at KILT Protocol are preparing to secure one of the first Kusama parachain slots and then launch our mainnet. Today we are happy to announce our new releases of the KILT <a href="https://github.com/KILTprotocol/mashnet-node/releases">mashnet-node 0.24.0</a> and <a href="https://github.com/KILTprotocol/sdk-js/releases">SDK 0.20.0</a> as the next phase of our development.</p><p>The mashnet-node received a second runtime for the parachain and multiple updates to run on Rococo using the newest version of Substrate (3.0.0). The SDK was multilaterally improved and restructured by splitting it into several separate packages.</p> Mashnet-node: It’s parachain time! <p>These consecutive updates of our Substrate blockchain were required to sync with the official Rococo parachain testnet. Rococo has been rebooted multiple times and always required us to be on the bleeding-edge of Substrate and&nbsp;Cumulus.</p><p>Apart from that, we made major improvements to the readability and structure of three of our KILT pallets: Attestations, Delegations and DIDs. On the one hand, we refactored the on-chain data types to be distinct Structs instead of tuples. On the other hand, we replaced our custom error pallet with Substrate errors and improved the order of checking for&nbsp;these.</p><p>Moreover, we added benchmarking to all our extrinsics. During this process, we had to introduce two limits for revoking Attestations and Delegations. You now have to specify up to which limit you enable the transaction to recursively check for the parent delegation until it matches the owner of the delegation you would like to revoke. Since revoking a Delegation automatically revokes all of its children recursively, you also have to submit such a limit for the number of children. We require both these bounds in order to be able to calculate the transactions fees and weights correctly.</p> SDK: Split it&nbsp;up! <p>After switching to <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp">yarn v2 berry,</a> we decided to make use of the supported workspaces and split up the SDK into multiple packages, at least some of which are independent of each other. This enables builders to pick the exact packages they need from our SDK when they want to build on top of it, and reduces the overhead (bundle size, required dependencies etc.) of requiring the entire SDK. Moreover, we can version each package separately.</p> SDK: Transaction improvements <p>We enabled multi-transactions which allow you to trigger blockchain transactions successively in one go, e.g. you are not required to wait for one transaction to finish before calling the next one. This is accomplished by counting up the next nonce on the client-side, if possible, and by resigning transactions if the returned error from the chain is recoverable</p><p>In addition, we made all our transactions explicit. Whereas before you implicitly submitted a signed transaction when storing an Attestation or CType, revoking an Attestation or making any kind of transfer, you are now rather generating an SubmittableExtrinsic. Upon signing and submitting this, the transaction is then executed on the blockchain.</p> SDK: Add Config Service &amp; improve chain connection <p>We introduced a new Config Service that can be used to configure the node address to which you want to connect and set the log level, for now. In the future, this will be expanded whenever we introduce new configurations.</p><p>As a result, you no longer need to (and also cannot) provide an address parameter to the connection function Kilt.connect(). Instead, the configured address will automatically be&nbsp;used.</p> SDK: Use sr25519 as default identity key pair&nbsp;type <p>Whereas in our last release we added the support for <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-keys#what-is-sr25519-and-where-did-it-come-from">sr25519</a> and ECDSA signatures, we have now switched our default identity key pair type from ed25519 to sr25519. We are mainly following the direction of Polkadot. Another motivation was that it is much easier to create an sr25519-based account in the polkadot.js apps or polkadot.js browser extension. Of course, ed25519 is still supported by adding it as an option to the identity&nbsp;builder.</p><p>Since sr25519 relies on polkadot.js crypto functions, which themselves rely on an included WASM library, you need to wait for the crypto library to be ready. Thus, we added this wait to our initialization function KILT.init({…}) which combines the configuration functionality of KILT.config with asynchronously waiting until the crypto library is&nbsp;ready.</p> SDK: Add message (de-) compression <p>Another feature we have added is the possibility to compress and decompress messages. As these can be used for communication between Claimers, Attesters and Verifiers, it is important for them to be shrinkable.</p> SDK: Switch to JSON-LD based hashing algorithm <p>During the preparation of the VC-Export package we found a potential exploit where labels could be re-ordered and still lead to the same root hash. This was fixed by switching to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-LD">JSON-LD</a> based property hashing algorithm.</p> SDK: Remove portablegabi <p>Lastly, we decided to remove our experimental anonymous credential feature “portablegabi” which we introduced in our last release. The main reason is that the portablegabi library handles its cryptography in a Go-Wasm binary which can only be called asynchronously via callbacks. As a result, the instantiation of identities and other protocol functions had to be made asynchronous as well. Moreover, the Go-Wasm binary caused issues when using the SDK in applications like React&nbsp;Native.</p><p>This was a disappointment not only for us but also for other teams that build on top of KILT. We are already investigating alternative solutions and will keep you posted on our effort to incorporate an anonymous credential solution (which won’t be portablegabi). But this is a non-critical feature and thus won’t be part of the launch candidate. For now, our focus is to launch the KILT chain with secure code and an easy-to-use SDK.</p> Outlook   Majorly improve documentation by gathering all documentation combined in one place: <a href="https://dev.kilt.io/">https://dev.kilt.io</a>  Prepare release candidates for the chain&nbsp;launch  Do security audits for mashnet-node and&nbsp;SDK  Mashnet node: Add governance and&nbsp;staking  SDK: Improve KILT’s usage and compliance of/with DIDs and&nbsp;VCs   TLDR; <p>Mashnet-node updated from Substrate 2.0.0-rc5 to 3.0.0 (<a href="https://github.com/KILTprotocol/mashnet-node/releases">release&nbsp;notes</a>):</p>  Added separate parachain runtime  Added proper benchmarking  Improved recursion checks for Delegations  Simplified how to run a&nbsp;node  Cleaned up, updated and improved documentation  <p>SDK was split into multiple separate packages (<a href="https://github.com/KILTprotocol/sdk-js/releases">release&nbsp;notes</a>):</p>  Switched to yarn v2&nbsp;berry  Improved handling of transactions, blockchain connection and&nbsp;logging  Switched default account keytype to sr25519 from&nbsp;ed25519  Fixed potential hashing exploit by using JSON-LD based property hashing algorithm  Removed experimental anonymous credential feature portablegabi  Added message compression and decompression

<p>Consumers are growing&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">more vocal</a>&nbsp;in their demand for privacy and a large cohort is taking action—so much so that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/cybersecurity-series-2019-cps.pdf">Cisco</a>&nbsp;has coined a new term: ‘Privacy actives’.</p>



<p>‘Privacy actives’ are highly motivated privacy-aware individuals. They care about privacy, are willing to act to protect theirs, and many have already done so.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/cybersecurity-series-2019-cps.pdf">2019 Cisco Consumer Privacy Survey</a>&nbsp;revealed this new demographic. Cisco first identified respondents&nbsp;who care about privacy (a massive 84 per cent of survey respondents). These people “care for their own data, they care about the data of other members of society, and they want more control over how their data is being used”. From there, Cisco discovered that, of this group, 80 per cent also said they are willing to act to protect their privacy: “They are willing to spend time or money to keep their data safe, they see data privacy as an important factor influencing their buying decisions, and they expect to pay more for products and services with better protection”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From that segment, Cisco found that nearly half (48 per cent) had already switched companies or providers based on a company’s data policies or data sharing practices. The result is 32 per cent or one-third of respondents care about data privacy, are willing to act, and have already acted to protect their privacy—voila, the “privacy actives”.</p>



<p>For brands, privacy actives should be on the radar for two reasons. First, privacy actives tend to be younger and do more shopping online, which Cisco says makes them a “surprisingly large” and “attractive demographic” for brands. Second, these individuals see respect for privacy as core to the brands with whom they want to do business. They favor brands that take conscious, positive steps to protect their customers’ privacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cisco says 90 per cent of privacy actives believe that how their data is treated indicates the way the brand will treat them as a customer and 91 per cent won’t buy from a company if they don’t trust how their data will be used.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Already companies are feeling the effects of this new cohort’s approach to privacy, with the Cisco survey also showing 87 per cent of companies are experiencing sales delays caused by their customers’ privacy concerns. This aligns with other data from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/14/half-of-americans-have-decided-not-to-use-a-product-or-service-because-of-privacy-concerns/">Pew Research</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cisco says: “People today are more concerned about privacy; they are asking more questions about what data is collected, how it is used, who has access to it, and how long it is retained. The fact that more consumers are willing to choose (or change) providers shows evidence consistent with this trend”.</p>



<p><a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/12/apple-forces-data-privacy-further-into-the-spotlight/">Apple’s recent decision</a>&nbsp;to require app developers to disclose the data they collect and what they do with it is more solid evidence of brands responding to consumer pressure for greater privacy and control over their personal data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We said in our&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/">Vision of privacy</a>&nbsp;article that brands that get privacy right will build a competitive advantage. Cisco confirms this by reporting that 97 per cent of companies in their survey “recognized they were realizing benefits such as competitive advantage or investor appeal from their privacy investments. With a large number of consumers closely associating a company’s privacy practices with its brand, it makes sense that companies are realizing these business benefits well beyond any compliance requirements”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cisco will continue to monitor the size, demographic composition, and behaviors of the privacy actives segment.</p>



<p>If you’d like to capitalize on the business benefits of the significant privacy actives segment, Anonyome Labs has two market-leading privacy solutions:&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>, the complete privacy toolkit for enterprises to rapidly integrate privacy into new and existing applications so they collect customers, not their personal data</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/tolbert">John Tolbert</a></p><p>STG <a href="https://stgpartners.com/2021/03/08/mcafee-announces-sale-of-enterprise-business-to-symphony-technology-group-for-4-0-billion/" title="announced">announced</a> that they intend to acquire McAfee’s enterprise business for around $4B. The McAfee brand will continue to operate and focus on consumer cybersecurity. STG will pick up MVISION, Global Threat Intelligence, database security, unified endpoint security, CASB, CSPM, CWPP, DLP, SIEM, SWG, XDR, and policy management products and services.</p>
<p>STG <a href="https://stgpartners.com/2020/09/01/rsa-emerges-as-independent-company-following-completion-of-acquisition-by-symphony-technology-group/" title="picked up">picked up</a> RSA from Dell in September 2020. When the deal closed, STG stated that RSA would remain independent and would pursue growth in their most successful product lines: Archer, SecurID, NetWitness, and the Fraud &amp; Risk Intelligence suite. These products cover risk management, compliance, authentication, access control, single sign-on, identity governance, fraud reduction, EDR/NDR/XDR, SIEM, SOAR, and UBA.</p>
<p>In 2019, STG <a href="https://stgpartners.com/2019/04/10/redseal-announces-equity-investment-from-stg-partners/" title="became majority owner">became majority owner</a> of RedSeal, which offers security solutions for cloud, compliance, and vulnerability management.</p>
<p>STG is clearly making a major investment in cybersecurity technologies. For now, there are no indications that these companies will be merged. However, that may change after the transaction is finalized for four major reasons:</p>
 
 Functional overlaps between products: software development and maintenance costs are redundant in those areas and lead to less profitability. 
 In areas where these overlaps exist, there are product and innovation leaders and challengers. Combining capabilities into single products could make them much stronger and more competitive in the market. 
 The breadth of coverage that these products and services provide could be integrated into a suite that enable cross-selling and up-selling for current customers of each separate brand. 
 CIOs and CISOs, the buyers of these kinds of products, generally prefer integrated stack solutions to a multiplicity of point solutions. They’re easier to manage contractually and can be more cost-effective for enterprise customers. 
 
<p>To summarize: With the broad set of technologies owned by the various companies, there is a potential for building stronger, more integrated solutions and services and positioning the entity as a one-stop-shopping for major areas within cybersecurity. This will require a vision and well-thought-out strategy, underpinned by a roadmap that is consequently executed. However, with the obvious synergies across the portfolio, there is a strong potential if the various companies become fully integrated. We rate this potential as way higher than the inherent risks of any merger.</p>
<p>For existing customers, there is no immediate need for action. If the companies do not integrate and innovate, you should revisit the tools you have in place on whether they still meet your business requirements. This should be done for all software and services regularly anyway as part of a recurring portfolio review and optimization process.</p>
<p>On the other hand, an integrated approach, if done right, will enable these companies to attract more new customers and thus grow in the market.</p>

<p>Spurred by an Explosion of Use Cases and High ETH Fees, Civic Joins Growing Solana Ecosystem</p>



<p>Civic Brings Digital Identity to the Future of Blockchain,&nbsp;Prioritizing Low Fees, Speed and Scalability</p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO (March 11, 2021) — Civic, a leading innovator in digital identity solutions, today announced a technology integration with Solana, a project implementing a new, high-performance, permissionless blockchain. The collaboration will allow for improved privacy, regulatory compliance and ease-of-use as digital identity takes center stage as the cornerstone of the new wave of consumer-first blockchain infrastructure.</p>



<p>“Early blockchains have been good testing grounds, but with high fees and slow transactions, many consumers and applications are simply priced out of the ecosystem,” said Vinny Lingham, co-founder and CEO of Civic. “Now, with Solana, we’re making identity foundational to the blockchain and broader ecosystem that’s ready for the future and built to scale for mainstream consumption.”</p>



<p>Currently, high ETH transaction fees are blocking mainstream adoption of DeFi. These high rates more than erase any returns for the average investor, making investment in the ecosystem unattractive and unsustainable. Solana’s low fees scale as the ecosystem grows, and with Civic’s identity-based key management, key recovery and practical experience, Civic will help make financial tools more accessible to mainstream consumers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to the identity elements Civic is bringing to the Solana ecosystem for any project to leverage, the company is also building a consumer friendly gateway to DeFi on Solana starting with a wallet experience that enhances the vision started with their mobile app on Ethereum. The wallet will offer intuitive design, identity-backed key management and a safe place to store tokens. Because of Solana’s technology, the wallet will be high-speed and have low transaction fees. The company plans to eventually merge the new wallet with its existing mobile Civic Wallet. Civic believes that identity will be a necessity for businesses in Solana’s ecosystem in order to comply with global regulations in the near future if DeFi is to truly scale for mainstream consumer adoption. These new products will offer more privacy and a more secure experience for DeFi products and other application layer technologies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Civic uses Identity.com’s open-source identity verification ecosystem to power its identity products. Identity.com recently announced <a href="https://www.identity.com/embedding-identity-into-the-blockchain-with-solana/">its own integration with Solana</a>, focusing on refining decentralized identities and the next version of its marketplace. Together, the organizations are building consumer-first, privacy focused frameworks for better compliance and regulation, so that more safeguards may be brought in as the industry scales.</p>



<p>“Identity verification is a key component of the web2 stack, and I am thrilled to see companies like Civic building to support a decentralized web3 world.” said Anatoly Yakovenko, President of the Solana Foundation.</p>



<p>As leaders in the decentralized identity space, Civic is focused on a few real-world applications of its blockchain-powered technology. When a user signs up with Civic Wallet, they are authenticated as a real person by securely verifying their identifiable information and incorporating groundbreaking blockchain-based technology. Once they have a Civic Wallet, users are able to selectively share parts of their verified identity with third parties, for example, purchasing age-restricted products anonymously. The company also recently launched a flexible <a href="https://www.civic.com/">identity verification product</a> that helps organizations verify identity quickly with minimal integration.</p>



<p>Solana is a fast, low-cost Layer-1 blockchain designed to scale with advancements in hardware technology. Currently, Solana can handle up to 50,000 tps with sub-second finality and transaction fees as low as $0.00001. By comparison, Ethereum supports a maximum of 15 transactions per second. Most importantly, Solana’s blazing speed and low fees scale as the ecosystem grows without sacrificing censorship resistance or security. Solana has already seen growing interest in the DeFi space with established DEXes and AMMs, such as <a href="https://projectserum.com/">Serum</a> and <a href="https://raydium.io/#/">Raydium</a>, already processing billions of user transactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>About Civic Technologies</p>



<p>As leaders in the decentralized identity space, Civic is focused on a few real-world applications of its blockchain-powered technology. The company offers flexible identity verification technology for businesses and is using digital identity as a gateway for decentralized finance on the Solana blockchain. Civic uses identity.com’s open-source, blockchain-based ecosystem to verify credentials. Civic was co-founded in 2015 by serial entrepreneurs Vinny Lingham and Jonathan Smith.</p>



<p>About Solana</p>



<p>Solana is a high-performance Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain focused on delivering scalability without sacrificing decentralization or security.</p>



<p>Until now, blockchains have been single-threaded computers, guaranteeing no two transactions conflict if executed in parallel. Solana unlocks concurrent GPU-parallelization for the first time, using <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fsolana-labs%2F7-innovations-that-make-solana-the-first-web-scale-blockchain-ddc50b1defda&amp;esheet=52302773&amp;newsitemid=20201008005380&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Proof+of+History&amp;index=9&amp;md5=164f8f8a07b1e1f31657a58e672464f5">Proof of History</a> (PoH), a clock before consensus, delivering high speed, low latency, and inexpensive transactions, all at layer 1 without sharding. </p>



<p>Developed by a team of former Qualcomm, Apple, Intel, and Dropbox engineers, Solana is stewarded by The Solana Foundation and is advanced by a loyal community of decentralized developers around the world.

<p>Today, Civic announced news that it is integrating with Solana blockchain. We were founded on the belief that everyone should have more control, access and privacy when it comes to their personal data. With the visionary, lightning fast, scalable Solana platform, we believe we finally have the opportunity to make identity work the way it should, as a cornerstone of blockchain infrastructure. For us, this means giving consumers an upgraded experience across the board.</p>



<p>As a startup, and as with any good business, we make progress by prioritizing our resources. For Civic, prioritizing the Solana integration means making a trade-off with another workstream. That’s why we’ve made the tough call to halt the development of our Covid-19 vaccination projects, and today we’re bittersweet to announce that we are sunsetting Health Key by Civic.</p>



<p>Last summer, when we announced Health Key by Civic, the path forward in getting the world back to work, school and daily life was unclear. Now, as the vaccine continues to roll out and variant strains develop, the way forward has continued to unfold through large, established companies and trade associations that have stepped in to fill the void. While we still know there’s a need and desire for privacy and protection when it comes to sensitive personal data, we believe that Civic’s strengths and competitive advantages will fare better in another industry. And, with the underlying power of the Solana blockchain driving our technology, we believe that Civic will be better positioned to serve&nbsp; as a gateway to the next wave of financial products.</p>



<p>So, as we bid adieu to our Health Key by Civic solution, we are proud to stand firmly with our new direction, which we believe will take Civic and identity verification to an even greater future.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/small">Mike Small</a></p><p>On Wednesday March 10th at 1am in the morning a fire started <a href="https://www.lefigaro.fr/faits-divers/strasbourg-important-incendie-sur-le-site-de-l-entreprise-ovh-classe-seveso-20210310" title="that destroyed a major data centre ">that destroyed a major data centre</a> that provides cloud services from <a href="https://www.ovh.ie/news/press/cpl1786.fire-our-strasbourg-site" title="OVHcloud">OVHcloud</a>. Thankfully no one was injured but this should be a wake up call for cloud service users to check that they have factored the use of cloud services into their business continuity plans.</p>
 Digital Transformation must include Business Continuity Planning 
<p>As organizations go through digital transformation, they increasingly turn to using cloud services.&nbsp; These allow them to develop new applications and create new ways of doing business without the need for capital expenditure or procurement delays.&nbsp; However, digital transformation also increases the dependency of the organization on these new digital services.&nbsp; One aspect of the digital transformation plan that is often forgotten is ensuring business continuity.</p>
<p>A key objective of IT services is that systems, data, and applications are available to authorized users when and where they are needed. The requirements for availability and the consequences of non-availability are increased by digital transformation.</p>
 Responsibilities are shared 
<p>Organizations often believe that because their applications are running in the cloud their data is automatically backed up and that the cloud service is always on.&nbsp; Neither of these assumptions is correct.&nbsp; The responsibility for security and compliance is shared between the tenant and the CSP (Cloud Service Provider).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CSP provides an SLA for the availability of their service and the tenant is always responsible for their data.&nbsp; Typical SLAs by major CSPs are around 99.99% - that may seem very high but that could mean on average 52 minutes per year that the service is not available.&nbsp; That does not include the additional time that you may need to reconfigure and restart your business-critical applications after an outage.</p>
<p>CSPs take significant steps to protect their tenants’ data including holding the data on multiple physical devices. However, if the service holding the data is down you may not be able to access it.&nbsp; In addition, if you delete the data by mistake you cannot expect the CSP to recognise this was an error.</p>
 Many possible causes 
<p>Natural disasters: earthquakes, floods and fires could have long term consequences on cloud service data centres.&nbsp; Loss of power or other utilities could render the cloud service unavailable. &nbsp;Access to the cloud service as well as the service itself depends upon communications systems which are also vulnerable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are actually 4 buildings on that site, and these appear to provide some form of co-hosting rather than being pure cloud.&nbsp; Only one of the buildings was completely destroyed but the impact of the incident has spread to services in the other buildings.&nbsp; This emphasises the need to look at physical locations and what exactly is meant by availability zones carefully when planning.</p>
 End to End Service 
<p>Use of a cloud service depends upon the infrastructure needed being available from end to end. Not only must the equipment and services at the CSP be operational, but the network and the customer equipment must also be available and working. Therefore, the cloud customer, as well as the CSP, needs to ensure the availability of components under their control as well as including cloud services in their business continuity plans.</p>
 Tenant Responsibilities 
<p>Our <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/an72561/cloud-services-and-security/" title="advice to users of cloud services">advice to users of cloud services</a> is:</p>
 
 Ensure that the level of availability specified for the service meets the business requirements. 
 Include the end-to-end infrastructure and any on-premises elements involved and not just the cloud service in this assessment. 
 Use <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/an72564/security-organization-governance-and-the-cloud/" title="independent verification">independent verification</a> to assure that the service is designed, managed and run in a way that conforms with the claims.

 <p>Data theft is a reality. Forgetting passwords is your daily life. This guide from <a href="https://cozy.io/en/features/#pass">Cozy Pass</a>, the French open source password manager, presents steps you can easily implement to minimize the impact of data theft and tips to keep you safe online in 2021 and beyond.</p>
<p>And don't forget: it's 2021, you've been using the password Mom1234 or Post-it notes for years so it's high time to change it.</p>
 You should use a password manager 
<p>We all have our own way of remembering our passwords: the same password everywhere, post-it notes, a google doc or even your year's calendar. Some use variations of the same password depending on the website, others save them on their browser. The method you have chosen may be just right for you. And changing your online habits is not always easy.</p>
<p>However, using a password manager such as <a href="https://cozy.io/en/features/#pass">Cozy Pass</a>, Dashlane, LastPass, 1Password or Keepass is becoming more and more common.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>The answer is simple: it's a tool that does its job perfectly.</p>
 Find out what makes Cozy Pass different from other options available on the web 
<p>While storing your passwords in your browser may seem like the easiest solution, it doesn't always offer the ability to sync your keychain to find it wherever you need it, on your phone or on the go.</p>
<p>The "Sign in with Gmail" option and other social network login options make you dependent on platforms that use this option to collect more and more data about your habits. Password managers are the most secure option.</p>
<p>Unlike other solutions, password managers automatically enter your login, personal and payment information, saving you a lot of time.</p>
 The only universal solution 
<p>At the launch of <a href="https://cozy.io/en/features/#pass">Cozy Pass</a>, some Cozy users told us that they were already using the Apple Keychain or Chrome, and that they didn't see the need for a password manager.</p>
<p>When you're surfing the web, a pop-up window appears asking you to save the password, and you click yes or no. When you come back to the web later, you'll see a pop-up window asking you to save the password. When you come back to this page later, your password may be saved.</p>
<p>But you'll run into a problem when you try to log into an account from your iPhone while browsing the web with Safari. The passwords you saved on Chrome are then not available. Even worse, the passwords saved in Keychain may be different! You might even find yourself in a situation where you reset a password because you can't access a certain account, which makes the password registered in Chrome invalid.</p>
<p>This situation can drive you crazy and is not sustainable over time.</p>
<p>Maybe you use Chrome at home, but if your company network only allows Internet Explorer or Firefox, your passwords stay "at home".</p>
<p>Users of <a href="https://cozy.io/en/features/#pass">Cozy Pass</a> can easily access all their passwords on all platforms, whether they use a PC for work, a Mac at home, an Android device or an iPhone. Cozy Pass works on all devices and all browsers. So your passwords follow you wherever you go. No black boxes. No duplicates. Only you have control over it.</p>
<p>What you need to remember: With our personal and professional lives becoming more and more digital, where the vast majority of people use several devices in different ecosystems, a password management solution that wants to be effective must work everywhere, which is the case of the various password managers available on the market.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the differences and advantages of each one.</p>
 The different password managers 
<p>Cozy Pass is a password manager integrated to a <a href="https://cozy.io/en">private and secure personal cloud, Cozy</a>. French and open source developed by Cozy Cloud, your passwords are encrypted from end to end of all data stored and hosted in France.</p>
<p></p>Auto-fill with Cozy Pass<p></p>
 
 
<p>it saves and fills in all your passwords in one click when you browse the Internet,</p>
 
 
<p>it synchronizes your passwords between your computers, browsers and phone: they are now accessible at any time and from anywhere,</p>
 
 
<p>it simplifies the recovery of your data within your Cozy by proposing you the brands to connect for which you already have an account,</p>
 
 
<p>it avoids manual handling when you change your password: the connector configured within your Cozy will immediately receive the update,</p>
 
 
<p>it easily imports your passwords stored in your browser or in another manager</p>
 
 
<p>it uses an open-source and audited protocol from <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a>. No black box effect!</p>
 
 
<p>it enters for you the right identifiers each time you browse the web and simplifies your online shopping!</p>
 
 
<p>last but not least, your passwords and other data are hosted on French servers.</p>
 
 
<p>Managing passwords is not just about saving a few of them so you don't have to type them in again. Password management is about taking back control of your digital life and therefore of your online sites. This is already the mission of Cozy, the personal cloud that integrates the Cozy Pass application.</p>
 Save time and money 
<p>Password managers allow you to access your accounts wherever you are, while ensuring that your information is secure. Last but not least, by automatically entering all your passwords, personal data and payment information on the web, this tool saves you a lot of time that you would otherwise waste filling out endless forms and searching for credentials that you forgot.</p>
<p>The important thing to remember is that unlike other password systems, password managers automatically enter your personal data, payment information and passwords, making it easy for you to move from one site to another.</p>
<p></p>
 Comparison 
<p>We won't lie to you: we just launched Cozy Pass and some features like password sharing or the web version are not yet available (but planned!). Users who want to focus on ease of use and ergonomics will turn to paid services especially when they have a professional use (sharing passwords with their team for example) and when their company offers them a solution paid in advance. The big names in this field are <a href="https://www.dashlane.com/">Dashlane</a>, <a href="https://1password.com/en/">1Password</a>, <a href="https://www.lastpass.com">LastPass</a> and <a href="https://keepass.info/">Keepass</a>.</p>
 Dashlane 
<p>Dashlane is probably the most complete service. Its interface is clear and pleasant to use. It offers interesting additional features to those offered by Cozy Pass:</p>
 
 the possibility to store notes or attachments in a secure way (up to 1 GB of storage space) 
 alerts when a password can be compromised, when a site communicates about a data leak or an attack 
 monitoring of the dark web. Dashlane analyzes the data published on the dark web, and verifies that your accounts and passwords are not part of it 
 the possibility to change your password in 1 click, for the main websites 
 a VPN, to secure your connection, for example on public wifi 
 sharing passwords with other people, and the possibility to add trusted contacts to your account 
 several premium offers (individual, family and business) 
 but...hosting your data on Amazon AWS 
 
 LastPass 
<p>LastPass is a popular password manager solution.</p>
<p></p>LastPass solution web interface<p></p>
 
 a modest price for most of the functions expected from a password manager whether for individuals (€2.90 per month or €3.90 per month) or for companies (from €2.90 per user/month to €7.50 per user/month) but soon LastPass will limit the number of synchronised devices (mobile OR laptops). 
 an extension compatible with a number of browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Edge, as well as on smartphones with an application on iOS, Android, and even Windows Phone. 
 Host your data on Amazon AWS 
 
 1Password 
<p>1Password is for Mac and iPhone users.</p>
<p></p>1Password solution web interface<p></p>
<p>It is possible to synchronize your passwords between your Mac and iPhone via your wifi network. The synchronization is then done on the local network, and not via the internet. For Apple users, this can be a good compromise between a Keepass and a service a little more modern and pleasant to use. While keeping control over where the data is stored.</p>
<p>For the rest, 1Password looks like Dashlane. With a few less features (no VPN, no darkweb monitoring).</p>
 
 If you travel a lot, 1Password also offers a roaming feature. You delete your sensitive data from your device while you travel. And you restore them when you arrive. 
 Available on Windows, Mac, Linux, and even ChromeOS for Chromebook owners. 
 
 Keepass 
<p>Keepass is a well-known password manager, free and open source.</p>
<p></p>Keepass solution web interface<p></p>
<p>Its great strength: it is known to be one of the most secure. In fact, it is the only one whose security has been audited by the ANSSI (National Agency for Information Systems Security).</p>
 
 Keepass is open source, which allows to audit its code. No black box effect like Cozy Pass. 
 Keepass allows you to keep control of where your passwords are stored... like <a href="https://cozy.io/en/features/#pass">Cozy Pass</a>. 
 
<p>You know everything. Thanks for reading! I hope this article has motivated you to install a password manager (Cozy Pass of course!) and change your digital habits.</p>

 Digital Property Rights with Bitmark NFTs — Evolving The Artist’s Reserved Rights Transfer and Sale Agreement <p>On March 19th, at 10AM PST, Bitmark is proud to <a href="https://feralfile.com">launch Feral File</a> with the software art exhibition Social Codes curated by renowned artist and Processing programming language co-creator Casey Reas. The following is adapted from <a href="https://feralfile.com/close-ups">Close-Ups on Feral&nbsp;File</a>.</p>Social Codes curated by Casey Reas, featuring artists Andrew Benson, LIA, Dmitri Cherniak, Raven Kwok, Anna Carreras, Manolo Gamboa Naon, Maya Man, Frederik Vanhoutte, Saskia Freeke, Dave Whyte. (Image courtesy of Dmitri Cherniak.)<p>At Bitmark, we believe that agreements around digital property (data, artwork, collectibles) cannot be resolved purely through traditional legal contracts or technology-based smart contracts. Legal contracts can’t handle the fidelity of digital assets (such as defining and enforcing the boundaries of digital property) at scale, technology-based smart contracts can’t handle the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incomplete_contracts">incomplete nature of contracts</a>. No contract, and thus no software code, no matter how well constructed, can account for every possible contingency. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)">The DAO</a> highlighted this issue on the Ethereum blockchain several years&nbsp;ago.</p><p>This is why Bitmark NFTs combine the best of software code (technology) and property law to create robust agreements for all stakeholders. For example, <a href="https://feralfile.com">Feral File</a>, the Bitmark-secured NFT art marketplace, builds upon the classic 1971 legal agreement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Artist%27s_Reserved_Rights_Transfer_and_Sale_Agreement">“The Artist’s Reserved Rights Transfer and Sale Agreement</a>.” Feral File’s “<a href="https://feralfile.com/docs/artist-collector-rights">Artist + Collector Rights</a>” evolves that agreement for the digital age. It uses the blockchain to record each edition and transfer of ownership.</p><p>Here’s how Bitmark’s code and law work together:</p>  A blockchain record (Bitmark NFT) defines and connects rights to an asset. This is similar to a “bundle of rights” from traditional property&nbsp;law.  Each edition from Feral File contains a unique agreement, digitally signed by the collector and the artist. This agreement is hashed along with the artwork itself to form a unique identifier that is recorded in the Bitmark Blockchain.  Secondary sales are also standardized in the agreement. This allows artists to take part in the value created when their work appreciates.  <p>Our hypothesis is that by cryptographically linking artworks with their legal agreements, we can establish a more sustainable and transparent market for digital artworks. The Bitmark blockchain was purpose-built to process the rights around digital assets at scale. It is more energy efficient, less expensive, and faster at these transactions than other solutions while remaining decentralized, secure, and censorship resistant.

<p>The traditional mortgage process can feel cumbersome to borrowers and loan officers, especially when the digital solutions dominating our lives have us accustomed to fast, convenient, and simple processes. Slow and complex mortgage workflows are more than inconvenient and unfortunately all too common. They require input at every step, back and forth between multiple partners even for some of the simplest tasks. Traditional, manual mortgage processes can also hinder lenders from reaching the full potential of their organizations.</p>
<p>Fortunately, <a href="https://www.finicity.com/lend/">Finicity Lend</a>’s Mortgage Verification Service (MVS) enables lenders to build a simple, streamlined mortgage verification experience with the flexibility to adapt to different mortgage lending use cases and enhance the lending experience for all.</p>
 The Drawbacks of Yesterday’s Mortgage Process 
<p>Gathering documents, calling employers, and conducting manual verifications add time to the origination process and can be a source of stress for prospective borrowers who have to hunt down paperwork. All that paper shuffling can also <a href="https://www.mba.org/x142727.xml">increase the chance of fraud and risk</a> for lenders. High-friction lending experiences are frustrating for borrowers who have become accustomed to digital experiences in all aspects of their lives.</p>
<p>And while adopting a digital mortgage solution can simplify this otherwise cumbersome process, adapting digital solutions can be daunting when your organization is accustomed to a particular traditional workflow. Do you have to ditch everything about your current process? Are the returns of a digital mortgage solution worth the time and resources to transform your organization?</p>
<p>Let’s find out.</p>
 Finicity MVS: The Simple and Flexible Mortgage Verification Experience 
<p>Finicity Lend’s Mortgage Verification Service addresses these problems with traditional mortgage lending and the concerns lenders face when confronted with the thought of changing their workflow. It comes down to two key components that have been core to MVS’s development from the beginning: simplicity and flexibility.</p>
 MVS Simplicity 
<p>Thanks to Finicity’s open-banking platform, MVS can deliver the financial data necessary for accurate, GSE-accepted, reliable verification of assets, income, and employment. And it gets better: MVS enables lenders to receive the verifications they need with only a single permissioning experience by the consumer, from multiple data sources. Even adding paystub data to bank and payroll data for a more comprehensive picture of income can still only take one permissioning experience that feels right at home in the digital lifestyle of today’s borrowers.</p>
<p>Data-driven verifications cut the risk of manual verifications and toss out the paper chase that came with ‘paper-based’ (from actual paper to digital documents) processes. The all-in-one, one-touch experience further streamlines and simplifies the lending process and improves the overall experience for both borrowers and lenders, potentially <a href="https://singlefamily.fanniemae.com/applications-technology/day-1-certainty">cutting up to 12 days</a> off the origination timeframe.</p>
 MVS Flexibility 
<p>Every lending scenario is as different as the borrowers that come to you. These unique scenarios mean that there can’t be a one-size-fits-all digital mortgage solution. It needs to be flexible. MVS is flexible enough to adapt to unique mortgage lending use cases and workflows and balance the appropriate level of borrower friction, optimizing the overall process.</p>
<p>With MVS, lenders can request only the data they need to validate income, assets, or employment, or they can request all the verifications at once. No need to sort through unnecessary information to assess a borrower’s risk. For example, a refinancing may not require the asset verification necessary with a new home purchase. MVS provides what you need, when you need it, and in the best, most simplified way with clean, easy-to-read reports.</p>
<p>And while MVS’s one-touch experience is ideal, some use cases or customer experiences require more than one permissioning experience with the borrower. Some consumer flows, for example, only require asset data in one step, and then <a href="https://www.finicity.com/how-digital-mortgage-lenders-streamline-verification-of-income-with-fintech/">request income data</a> separately. Or, your flow may attempt a complete verification from transactions only, and you may return to the borrower for a second permissioning experience for paystub data later. MVS can as easily adapt to these two-touch scenarios as the one-touch experience, enhancing lender flow rather than replacing it, and allowing lenders to balance friction with borrowers on their own terms.</p>
<p>Regardless of the permissioning experiences required for accurate and reliable risk assessment, borrowers and lenders will always enjoy a streamlined, fast, secure permissioning process through Finicity Connect for less friction and more time saved. Thanks to this flexibility, MVS helps lenders balance what you believe is the best experience for the borrowers with the tools you need to get the highest possible verification success rate.</p>
<p>With Finicity’s MVS, you can enjoy the benefits of a streamlined, simplified, and flexible digital mortgage experience without sacrificing what makes your lending process unique to your organization. And to top it all off, you get the most accurate data, courtesy of open banking and consumer permissioning. Enhance your lending with <a href="https://www.finicity.com/mortgage/">Finicity Lend’s MVS</a>.</p>

That includes movies, too,&nbsp;BTW.</p> 2. RIP&nbsp;cookies Photo: The Creative&nbsp;Exchange<p>Google has officially killed the cookie.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/google-says-it-wont-track-you-directly-in-the-future-as-it-phases-out-cookies.html">CNBC</a>:</p><blockquote>Google on Wednesday clarified its plans for targeted advertising, promising not to use other ways to “track” users around the internet after it ends support for cookies in Chrome by early&nbsp;2022.</blockquote><blockquote>The company said in a blog post it will only use “privacy-preserving technologies” that rely on methods like anonymization or aggregation of data. Google announced plans in January 2020 to end support for third-party cookies, which fuel much of the digital advertising ecosystem, in its Chrome browser within two&nbsp;years.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/googles-privacy-pr-move-the-informations-tech-briefing">The Information’s briefing</a> is a bit skeptical:</p><blockquote>For one thing, there was little real “news” here. The online ad giant announced the main part of this a year ago. Today’s announcement was a follow-up, confirming that a particular kind of digital ad targeting is likely to die. More to the point, the impact of Google’s new approach is much more limited than people might realize. When you’re within Google’s walls — on search, YouTube or maps — you can still be tracked. That’s true for Apple, which helped kick off this privacy push but is also building its own ad-sales business on the App Store and Apple News, as well as other ad-based platforms like Snap or Pinterest. All of those platforms will still have detailed pictures of their users’ activities, which they can deploy in selling&nbsp;ads.</blockquote><blockquote>Yes, it will be harder for anyone to build a profile of you based on your cross-web browsing habits. So for instance, in the future your search on a recipe website may not lead to a related ad being shown to you when you’re on a news site. But Google could still use your search activity to target YouTube ads at you. Is one necessarily worse than the&nbsp;other?</blockquote><p>What’s undeniable is the impact this will have on the ad industry. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-to-stop-tracking-individuals-web-browsing-precision-ad-targeting-2021-3">BI</a>:</p><blockquote>While Google acknowledged that other providers may continue to offer advertisers the ability to track individuals across the web, its decision could still upend the digital advertising industry, which has long relied on these types of tracking technologies.</blockquote><blockquote>Temkin said that Google believes these types of tracking methods don’t “meet rising consumer expectations for privacy, nor will they stand up to rapidly evolving regulatory restrictions, and therefore aren’t a sustainable long term investment.”</blockquote><blockquote>The plans throw a wrench into advertising-industry efforts to create cookieless “universal identifiers” that use more privacy-conscious methods of user tracking, such as encrypted email addresses or login information. Shares in The Trade Desk, which created the Unified ID 2.0, for example, were trading down more than 7% on Wednesday morning.</blockquote><blockquote>Google’s rivals and other participants in the advertising ecosystem have been watching Google’s moves closely. The UK’s competition regulator is even investigating a complaint from an advertising-industry group alleging that Google’s decision to remove third-party cookies from Chrome and replace them with technologies from its Privacy Sandbox would limit competition in the digital ad market. Other companies have been adding feedback and discussing their own proposals for cookie alternatives in subcommittees of the World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C, a key web-standards group.</blockquote><p>And as <a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a> notes, this is awesome validation for GlobaliD’s vision:</p><blockquote>This is really big news. It’s the end of an era when it comes to monetizing with tracking. This is Google admitting they will change their model, paving the way for identities and control around your own data. Apple already won that battle with Facebook. And now Facebook will lose another fight with Google/Android.</blockquote><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/05/technology/tim-wu-white-house.html">A Leading Critic of Big Tech Will Join the White&nbsp;House</a>  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-investigates-apple-over-suspected-anti-competitive-behaviour">CMA investigates Apple over suspected anti-competitive behaviour</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-d1b78a14-7eb5-4737-9310-fd707cbf7b08.html">Arizona’s crusade against app&nbsp;stores</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/googles-privacy-pr-move-the-informations-tech-briefing">Google’s Privacy PR Move: The Information’s Tech&nbsp;Briefing</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebooks-1-billion-kustomer-acquisition-faces-extensive-antitrust-review">Facebook’s $1 Billion Kustomer Acquisition Faces Extensive Antitrust Review</a>   3.

Greg’s&nbsp;take:</p><blockquote>Ripple’s well reasoned response (read pg 1–8) to the SEC complaint. The logic is crystal clear: If a fiance receives a diamond ring for an engagement, they don’t mistakenly believe that their lover has given them an investment in the De Beers diamond mining company. A diamond is NOT an investment contract with De Beers. Nor is XRP an investment contract with&nbsp;Ripple.</blockquote><blockquote>The SEC’s pretense that they are protecting investors or fostering capital formation by destroying the very things that Congress invoked them to defend is a caricature of what has gone amiss with the administrative state. Hopefully justice will be done with clarity for all other worthy blockchain endeavors.</blockquote><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-exchanges-discussed-xrps-status-with-sec-ahead-of-listings-ripple-says">Ripple: Exchanges Checked XRP Status With SEC Before Listing — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/ripple-wants-in-on-central-bank-digital-currencies-cbdc/">Ripple wants in on Central Bank Digital Currencies — Ledger Insights — enterprise blockchain</a>   4. What we can learn from China about the creator&nbsp;economy. <p><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-china-embraced-the-creator-economy-before-the-west-did">The Information</a>:</p><blockquote>Executives at Facebook, Twitter and Snap recently realized that if they don’t help the people who produce videos and other content for their apps make money, these creators will take their talents, fans and potential revenue streams somewhere else.</blockquote><blockquote>In China, mobile video apps figured that out six years ago. That’s when Kuaishou, which started as an app for teenagers uploading 8-second videos to share with friends, overhauled its product so the teens could also stream themselves live and be paid directly by their fans via tips. That move propelled Kuaishou (pronounced “kwai-show”) to a public market capitalization of $170 billion after an initial public offering in Hong Kong last month. Hurst Lin, a venture capitalist who sits on Kuaishou’s board and whose firm’s early $40 million investment in the company is now worth around $15 billion, told The Information in an extended interview that Kuaishou’s move to tipping wouldn’t have happened if not for a desire for “revenge” against a&nbsp;rival.</blockquote><blockquote>Necessity also drove the direct-payment model. At the time, China’s online advertising market was still too small to support mobile video apps, let alone individual content creators. And the idea of tipping performers who stream themselves live was pioneered in China before the smartphone era by a company previously known as&nbsp;YY.</blockquote><blockquote>When Lin’s VC firm DCM first invested in Kuaishou in 2014 at a $60 million pre-money valuation, “we had no idea if Kuaishou was going to have any commercial value,” he said. The teens who used it at the time mostly hailed from China’s smaller, less affluent cities. But the app’s daily active users have since grown by at least 30 times to 300&nbsp;million.</blockquote>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-china-embraced-the-creator-economy-before-the-west-did">Why China Embraced the Creator Economy Before the West&nbsp;Did</a>   5. Is Jack Dorsey’s Tidal purchase an NFT&nbsp;play? <p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/square-buys-majority-of-tidal-adds-jay-z-to-its-board-in-bid-to-shake-up-the-artist-economy/">Square buys majority of Tidal, adds Jay-Z to its board in bid to shake up the artist economy — TechCrunch</a> (via <a href="https://global.id/junhiraga">/junhiraga</a>):</p><blockquote>“And then there’s the question of NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, a new form of digital asset that have recently become the cause célèbre of the cryptocurrency community.

It is hard to argue that the current day Internet isn’t the best it can be. However bad it is, we can fix it and make it a healthy digital space. That is the objective of the&nbsp;<a href="https://publicspaces.net/conference-2021/">Public Data Spaces Conference</a>: to foster cooperation between organisations and developers to tackle the task of making the Internet a better, safer and more collaborative place.




 




“<a href="https://publicspaces.net/timetable/event/building-connections/">Building Connections</a>” is one of the sessions at the conference that will explore these important themes. Given so many initiatives exist that form a part of what we need, such as Redecentralize network, MyData Global, Mozilla, CC, how do we best connect?




 




How do we create a ‘network of networks’ where people are able to find their complement and find what they need?&nbsp;<br><br>How do we evaluate what is relevant and what isn’t?&nbsp;<br><br>What are the best ways of working together and building on each other’s work?&nbsp;<br><br>A panel moderated by&nbsp;<a href="https://publicspaces.net/conference-2021/speakers/sander-van-der-waal/">Sander van der Waal</a>&nbsp;(Waag) will provide the opportunity to discuss and address these important questions and will include the following:&nbsp;




 





  <a href="https://publicspaces.net/conference-2021/speakers/andre-wilkens/">André Wilkens</a>&nbsp; – Director of the European Cultural Foundation  <a href="https://publicspaces.net/conference-2021/speakers/solana-larsen/">Solana Larsen</a>&nbsp;– Mozilla Foundation  <a href="https://publicspaces.net/conference-2021/speakers/ian-forrester/">Ian Forrester</a>&nbsp; – R&amp;D @ The BBC&nbsp;  <a href="https://publicspaces.net/conference-2021/speakers/katryna-dow/">Katryna Dow&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;Founder &amp; CEO of Meeco  





 




<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katrynadow/">Katryna Dow</a> is also a member of the <a href="https://mydata.org">MyData Global</a> Board, and active member of the community since its formation. <a href="https://www.meeco.me">Meeco</a> is also a founding member of <a href="https://datasovereigntynow.org">Data Sovereignty Now</a>, as is MyData. <br><br>As a result, Katryna brings a unique cross community perspective on how common goals and shared values bring people and organisations together.&nbsp;




 




MyData Global is an award-winning international non-profit. The purpose of MyData Global is to&nbsp;empower individuals by improving their right to self-determination regarding their personal data. It is based on the&nbsp;<a href="https://mydata.org/declaration/">MyData Declaration</a>.




 




MyData Global&nbsp;has over 100&nbsp;<a href="https://mydata.org/list-of-organisational-members/">organisation members</a>&nbsp;and close to 400 individual members from over 40 countries, on six continents, facilitating the 2000+ strong MyData Global community working on the ethical use of personal data. MyData is both an alternate vision and guiding set of technical principles.




 




<a href="https://datasovereigntynow.org/">Data Sovereignty Now</a>&nbsp;is a relatively new initiative. It was formed in late 2020 through a coalition of leading Europe-based technology companies, research institutions and not-for-profit organisations. The goal in joining forces is to enable a more equitable digital economy. Both Meeco and MyData Global&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.meeco.me/new-coalition-launches-campaign-for-data-sovereignty-now/">are founding members</a>, demonstrating the power of aligned collaboration.&nbsp;

 Freedom, Privacy and the Covid Pandemic 
<blockquote><p>How do you provide your populace with freedom whilst you’re still controlling the pandemic? Well, we now have technology around for that and unfortunately still they’re absolutely right. Have you got COVID? The question is have you been in contact with someone, do you have symptoms? As easy as that, how are they doing this at the moment?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Write on a piece of paper when you get to the place, use no we can’t do that, that’s not the right way todo it, let’s let’s use an app so they, belatedly a lot of countries have an app but those apps are centralised, taking data on people and they were rejected. So what we found is proliferation of those devices was especially in the UK, the centralised version the UK came out with was rejected by the public and didn’t get any uptake and it wasn’t illegal not to have it, it was seemed to be a duty but unless you’re in some of the more authoritarian countries where actually it is illegal then you must do it, otherwise wouldn’t turn you, there wasn’t that uptake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you need to do is provide technology which doesn’t infringe on the civil liberties, IE. a decentralised system but provide technology which will be give you the ability to move around, so a freedom pass.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now imagine the pass and this is what BLOK Solutions have been trying to provide through BLOK bias science and the and the BLOK pass, a decentralised freedom pass that you can use and say I haven’t got COVID, whether that’s a vaccination or whatever and you can use it not only to go into work you can use it also to get in to the cinema you can use it to get on the bus, you can use it if you’re a teacher to say, actually I’m free of this and I should be able to teach my children or conversely that the people around you, the teachers working around you have been scanned and they have a passporting system which is providing privacy to the individual but providing protection to the community from the pandemic and those tools are now available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BLOK BioScience has with BLOK paths the first and only so far, completely self-sovereign and certified by ID 2020 which is the World Health Organisation backed organisation that looks after self-sovereign identity solutions, certified as the only one in the world at the moment that can provide that health pass at the moment, so we believe we’re not only protecting people’s identities and their data but we’re also protecting or giving the tools to industry and to governments to be able to protect their populations and to be able to get the country’s industries going again.</p></blockquote>

				  When we eventually look back at the legacy of Covid-19, what technological change will we see? What’s happening now that will define the coming decade?&nbsp;  
			   
				
				
				 <p>When it became apparent that Covid-19 would scale to a problem of world historical proportions, speculation immediately turned to its legacy. Pandemics are agents of change, and in our mass adaptation to new challenges, we would quickly discard practices and processes whose rationale for existing conflicted with immediate needs; we would adapt new technologies to wider use; we would innovate.</p>
<p>While the legacy of Covid-19 is a work in progress, we can identify a strong signal of systemic change that the pandemic has accelerated: decentralization.</p>
<p>Decentralization was quickly normed as a logistical necessity for business, as company offices became no-go areas and workers were forced to recreate their jobs from their kitchens and spare rooms. While this created new problems—rickety VPNs were not up to the task of connecting administrators and developers to their work or providing robust network security—the big “surprise” was that productivity didn’t fall off a cliff; it turned out that many workers were more productive from home because they were spending more time working.</p>
<p>Yes, hours and hours of Zoom meetings weren’t and aren’t necessarily fun, and for some tasks being in a room with colleagues is vastly more efficient; but teleconferencing wasn’t a radically new concept that required a new set of processes to master (where failure occurred, it was more a question of forgetting to follow old norms, like putting on your pants). People had the equipment they needed—computers and phones—if not quite the network infrastructure to connect them; but they adapted to significant behavioral change because the technology made it relatively easy for them to do so. Offices will return because business has social drivers; but the future looks like it will offer far more decentralized work opportunities than before.</p>
<p>This is a massive behavioral and economic shift, at least for information workers. The commute, the clock-in, the be-seen-to-be-sitting-at-your-desk paradigm is over. It now looks unnecessary, expensive, and inefficient. It didn’t measure the right things in terms of productivity—and we have a massive natural experiment to prove that against—what?—a commonly shared intuition that if you weren’t watching your workers they would skive off. Working from home will, of course, create a new set of problems, and some will be solved by being in a social work setting some of the time. But we think differently now because different now works better.</p>
<p>These shifts in the way we live seem to happen all of a sudden and yet with little fuss, perhaps because the underlying principles, the big ideas as tectonic plates, have been grinding away beneath our feet for a long time, creating lots of small shockwaves and incrementally triggering us to do things differently. And when you start thinking about decentralization, you begin to see its inexorable force everywhere. What is a 401k except a decentralized retirement mechanism? People once relied on a single company pension; now they rely on returns from many companies. Uber decentralized taxi services; AirBnB decentralized hospitality; both decentralized trust because the aggregate rating of all or many users is more likely to be trustworthy than a single rating or small number of ratings.</p>
<p>Much as the poet Yeats wondered how to tell the dancer from the dance, it is difficult to separate the idea of decentralization from the technology to implement it. It is hard to imagine how to decentralize a currency without a blockchain. Needs drive technology—but technological innovation creates opportunities to solve problems and to do things that were once unimaginable.</p>
<p>In this, decentralization’s frontier is identity. And we have finally reached it. Decentralized identity answers the question “how can we use the many to authenticate the one?” In this case, the many is a complex stack composed of distributed ledger networks, communications protocols, cryptographic keys, and apps; the one is you or some fact about you that you want to prove to someone else, identity.</p>
<p>Online, we’ve been living with centralized identity since the birth of the Internet. We create an identity profile and a password to access it, and someone else holds that information and—to try and prevent identity fraud—other facts about you. The more valuable the service you access, the more of your identity you have to hand over to continually prove you are who you say you are. The failures of this way of doing things are legion, from data hacks to abuse of privacy.</p>
<p>But much as a company staff that doesn’t need to all show up in the same physical space to work, decentralized identity means the attributes that we use to prove our identity don’t all need to show up in a central data silo to verify that we are who we say we are. This is possible because the content of an identity (such as the personal information about you in a passport) doesn’t need to literally stand for the form of that identity (the passport itself). The technology enables the form and ownership of the passport to be verified without the need to access the content. This means that decentralized identity is able to create uniqueness out of an otherwise infinitely copyable digital world.</p>
<p>Conceptually, that’s an enormous shift—no more passwords, profiles, or third-party storage. Every interaction involving identity can be direct, unique, and verifiable. And at the front end, it requires no technological heavy lifting. It may be tough to understand at the back end, but it is experienced by the user through forms and behavior that will be familiar and intuitive to anyone who uses apps or instant messaging.</p>
<p>If Covid-19 drove the decentralization of our working selves, that work is now driving the need for decentralized identity. One of the biggest technical headaches in managing a decentralized workforce is identity management—or, “is our remote workforce really who they say they are when they log on?” This challenge is driving adoption of zero-trust security practices, which require continuous identity verification for access to a network. What makes such verification easy? Decentralized verifiable credentials (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAT85zebRLM&amp;list=LLtwBqR2xCF583_xVy4isxSQ&amp;index=2&amp;t=2202s" title="The Future of Privacy and Security: Decentralized Identity and Zero Trust">Listen</a> to Indicio.tech CEO Heather Dahl discuss decentralized identity and zero trust with Chase Cunningham, Chief Strategy Officer of Eircom Software at a recent Washington DC Hyperledger Meetup).</p>
<p>With zero trust becoming the dominant paradigm in cybersecurity (a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/insights-zero-trust-network-security/" title="Current state of Zero Trust">recent</a> Forrester survey for Cloudflare found that 80 percent of security leaders said their organizations were committed to adopting zero trust), expect to see verifiable digital credentials increasingly employed to manage workforces—and then be adapted to manage other complex processes, services, and products.</p>
<p>More obviously, expect to see decentralized identity provide a compelling solution to the current dilemma over Covid-19 test or vaccine “passes” for travel. While a specific vaccine pass raises issues over social equity and liberty, the immediate and compelling value proposition of a decentralized Covid-19 test credential is that it enables health provider information to be directly sent to and held by an individual without any need for a third party to store it or manage it.</p>
<p>This eliminates the problem of health data privacy regulation. And because the credential’s form—its specifications and the unique way it proves ownership—are written to a blockchain, it is virtually impossible to forge or tamper with the contents. The user gets to decide who they share their data with—be it a border official or an airline or a restaurant—and it can be as easy as presenting a QR code for a negative test. The back-end infrastructure does all the authentication.</p>
<p>Think about what this means: Companies don’t have to store personal data to make identity verification work. The risk for being out of compliance with GDPR and other data privacy law disappears. People have a way to prove that they have been tested or vaccinated without giving their data to a tech giant.</p>
<p>Decentralized identity will make our increasingly decentralized lives easier. Or maybe our decentralized lives will make decentralized identity easier. Or both. Either way, this big idea is happening now.</p>

<p>This is the second in a series of blogs providing edited extracts of key points made by Mydex CIC in its response to the UK Government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/uk-national-data-strategy-nds-consultation">consultation around a new National Data Strategy</a>.</p><p>The first one addressed the question “<a href="https://medium.com/mydex/how-to-unleash-the-full-potential-of-data-3676db8d7c03">how to unleash the full potential of data?</a>” Others look at <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/transforming-the-system-a-roadmap-for-practical-implementation-411e8821ed19">Achieving Change at Scale</a>, and C<a href="https://medium.com/mydex/misconceptions-that-kill-progress-in-personal-data-4736b1d883c6">ommon Misconceptions that Derail Progress</a>.</p><p>To catch up on progress on our Macmillan My Data Store Pilot <a href="https://medium.com/macmillan-my-data-store-pilot">click&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>The central plank of Mydex CIC’s consultation response is that the UK needs to build a new layer of data logistics infrastructure that:</p>  Includes citizens in the workings of the data economy, empowering them with the ability to collect, store, use and share data about themselves independently of any data controllers they may have data relationships with.  To achieve this, the Government needs to ensure that every citizen is provided with their own personal data store, which enables citizens to collect, store, share and use their own data, under their own control, for their own purposes, independently of any organisation that may have collected data about&nbsp;them.  These personal data stores should be designed to act as neutral, enabling nodes in a vibrant data sharing network, whereby citizens can obtain copies of their data held by organisations and can forward relevant elements of this data (such as Verified Attributes) to other data users under their control, as and when beneficial and necessary.  <p>Such a citizen empowering data logistics infrastructure is key to enabling <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/how-to-unleash-the-full-potential-of-data-3676db8d7c03">a MUMU data economy to grow</a>: one where the right personal data can flow to and from the right parties at the right times, in ways that protects citizens’ privacy and make them active participants in service provision.</p> Benefits of the new personal data infrastructure <p>Ensuring every citizen is provided with their own personal data store would <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/killing-many-birds-with-one-stone-6dc5ae40c556">kill many birds with one stone</a>. Specifically, it&nbsp;would:</p>  Enable order of magnitude reductions in friction, effort, risk and cost for both bona fide service providers and&nbsp;citizens  Ensure built-in privacy and data protection for all processes involving the collection and use of personal&nbsp;data  Ensure built-in fair pre-distribution of power and rewards relating to the collection and use of personal data, resulting in inclusive economic growth, enabling social inclusion and helping to tackle the digital divide and ‘poverty&nbsp;premium’  Act as a platform for innovation, enhancing capabilities, capacity and flexibility   Cutting costs <p>The most compelling immediate reason to introduce personal data stores is their cost-cutting potential.</p><p>By enabling citizens to easily, safely and securely obtain electronic copies of data held about them by organisations (as per the data portability provisions of GDPR/Data Protection Act) a personal data store-based data logistics infrastructure would enable data ecosystems to move from ‘make afresh every time’ to ‘make once use many times’ modes of operation.</p><p>Under the current organisation-centric system, if an organisation needs to know something about an individual it has to obtain the necessary information for itself, even though another organisation might have already obtained the same information. Very often, organisations don’t need the actual information itself: they just need confirmation that a particular piece of information is valid, up-to-date and correct (e.g. that an individual is over 18, lives at a particular address, has a valid driving licence, has passed certain exams, is entitlement to certain benefits, etc).</p><p>Responsible organisations that have already checked information can easily and cheaply generate secure electronic tokens verifying these bits of information. These are called <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/unleashing-the-potential-of-verified-attributes-fe001e01b091">‘Verified Attributes’</a>. Enabling this information to be ported to a personal data store and forwarded to other service providers, would eliminate vast amounts of duplicated effort for both service providers and service users, significantly reducing the time, money and effort they invest in collating and confirming the data they&nbsp;need.</p><p>The Scottish Government has already successfully conducted tests to confirm the technical viability of such a process in its <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/10/Attribute-Prototype-Report-new.pdf">Verified Attribute prototype</a>. The prototype</p><blockquote>“enables public sector organisations to provide individuals with verified attributes, for individuals to store these attributes in their own Attribute Store, and for these individuals to be able to share these attributes with other public sector service providers as and when&nbsp;needed.”</blockquote><p>Because of the way these verified attributes work (using secure API links) other parties can rely on the accuracy and provenance of this data without having to undertake their own checking processes or asking citizens to fill out yet another form. (Some people say that such a process cannot work, asking who takes liability if a piece of shared data happens to be wrong. In fact, relying on data provided by other people happens in multiple processes all the time without any liability model. Whether to accept the information is down to the user’s own assessments of related&nbsp;risk.)</p><p>By enabling the sharing of Verified Attributes and other data, personal data stores render many previously essential data processing tasks unnecessary (thereby freeing up time and resources) while enabling service providers to access more, better quality data, more quickly. The potential power of this approach is demonstrated by the <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/10/Smart-Entitlements-Research-Recommendations-and-Report-for-the-Scottish-Government-FINAL.pdf">Scottish Government’s work on ‘smart entitlements’</a> which examines just how big the opportunity is and how to realise&nbsp;it.</p><p>The sharing of verified attributes also cracks the problem of online identity: an ‘identity’ is simply an accepted collection of verified attributes.</p> Built-in privacy and data protection <p>It is now universally accepted that citizens should be able to assert more control over how their data is collected and used. Compliance with new data protection regulations remains a major challenge. By creating mechanisms that ensure that personal data is shared and used by the citizens whose data it is, a new personal data store based data logistics infrastructure would ensure privacy and data protection by&nbsp;default.</p><p>A failure to build such citizen empowering personal data infrastructure can only result in ‘more of the same’ problems.</p> Rebalancing the workings of the data&nbsp;economy <p>It is now widely recognised that status-quo approaches to the collection and use of personal data have resulted in huge competition- and growth-restricting, unfair and socially divisive imbalances of power and reward. There is now ongoing debate as to how to ‘fix big tech’ with the UK’s Competition and Market Authority recommending the creation of a new Digital Markets Unit to curb the power of big tech data monopolies.</p><p>While regulatory intervention is part of the answer, regulation alone can not do the job. We also need to embed new, fairer ways of working into day-to-day data management practices. Providing every citizen with a personal data store achieves this, ensuring fair pre-distribution of power over personal data and resulting rewards.</p><p>The Financial Times recently observed much effort is now going into ‘fixing big tech’.&nbsp;But:</p><blockquote>“The real game-changer would be if Europe could pioneer the creation of a radically different and more decentralised data economy.”</blockquote><p>A personal data store-based data logistics infrastructure would achieve this decentralisation.</p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1N9kVpPWT48YZFFx3uBEU_xcrt20YLaFi">The Future of Citizen Data Systems</a> report by the Government Office for Science, notes research that using such an approach may be closest to economically optimal, citing an economic modelling study&nbsp;that:</p><blockquote>“investigated how different models of data control could affect how far data is shared when consumers prioritise both their privacy and gains from use of their data. A scenario where consumers control their use of data was closest to optimal, with maximised benefits from data sharing and privacy. Consumers kept some data private, but shared other data with many more organisations and companies, compared to a scenario where firms controlled data.”</blockquote><p>One important aspect of this rebalancing is tackling the poverty premium. Currently, data exclusion is a major cause of social exclusion. Those with the greatest needs for access to services are also those who have to spend the greatest amounts of time, effort and money filling in application forms, trying to find data and prove credentials. By enabling individuals to build up banks of pre-verified facts about themselves — facts that they can reuse when applying for services — the new data infrastructure would go a long way to enabling social inclusion.</p> A platform for innovation <p>Organisations use data for many different purposes e.g. for the purposes of measurement, analysis, decision-making, operations planning, coordination and implementation, and administration to manage their operations better. Enabling individuals to do the same with their own data would open up a tidal wave of innovation.</p><p>Individuals should be able to collect, store and use their own data for the same purposes (of measurement, analysis, decision-making, operations planning, coordination and implementation, and administration) in order to manage their lives better. <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/a-practical-vision-for-personal-data-empowerment-1d366ed792f">This applies across all ‘life departments’</a> whether it is managing a home and dealing with suppliers, making big financial decisions such as planning for retirement, coping with long-term illnesses such as diabetes or cancer, or advancing their education and&nbsp;careers.</p><p>Personal data stores enable service innovation in such areas by enabling citizens to safely and efficiently combine data from many sources, and to add extra information about themselves (e.g. plans, preferences, goals) to build rich new-to-the-world person-centric data assets that weren’t possible before (because previously the data was dispersed across many different organisations).</p><p>The Government has already recognised some of this innovation potential with its Open Banking initiative. However, with Open Banking, data is ported from one organisation to another and never back to the individual whose data it is. This is a very restricted form of data portability which requires costly and heavy regulatory oversight and risks creating a complexity catastrophe as it tries to scale. It also actually reduces individuals’ control over their data. As individuals’ data gets spread across an increasing number of different organisations, it gets more and more difficult for individuals to keep tabs on their&nbsp;data.</p><p>In contrast, personal data stores allow a person’s data to be aggregated around that person, making it possible for service providers to gain permissioned access enhanced, enriched data sets to provide enhanced, enriched, personalised services. Given that this information is critical to service provision across every major sector of the economy including financial services, health, public administration, transport, education/skills development, housing and leisure, this has the potential to become a significant driver of innovation and economic&nbsp;growth.</p><p>Once every citizen has been provided with their own personal data store, the Government will have created personal data infrastructure with near infinite flexibility: the ability to handle any data for any purpose. With the infrastructure in place for example, when the Government introduces a new policy requiring access to data (as happened with the Covid pandemic) it can use the infrastructure to enable the right information to get to and from the right people at the right&nbsp;times.</p><p>Given that companies like Mydex CIC have already built the infrastructure that is needed to achieve all the above, there is now no good reason why the UK Government cannot implement provision of this new infrastructure at&nbsp;speed.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-we-need-new-nationwide-personal-data-infrastructure-56513fb6daf4">Why we need new, nationwide personal data infrastructure</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Recently, Binance launched its “BSC” dashboard, which lists&nbsp;ONT.    Li Jun, Founder of Ontology, was interviewed by CointelegraphCN and shared his thoughts on blockchain’s globalization. He was invited to speak at “Web 3.0 TALKS”, on the topic of Decentralized Identity. The discussion touched upon how Ontology is developing the building blocks for a better&nbsp;web.  Li Jun had two opinion articles published. See links&nbsp;below:  <p>— Global Banking and Finance: ‘<a href="https://www.globalbankingandfinance.com/why-privacy-should-be-esg-investors-next-big-priority/">Why Privacy Should Be ESG Investors’ Next Big Priority</a>’</p><p>— Nasdaq: ‘<a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/data-regulation-in-2021%3A-more-small-steps-or-a-giant-leap-2021-02-04">Data Regulation In 2021: More Small Steps Or A Giant&nbsp;Leap?</a>’.</p>  An original video called “Decoded Decentralized Identity” was uploaded by Ontology, to share our opinions about data and identity.  Our “ONTO Red Packets For You &amp; Me” campaign launched, which allowed users to send Red Packets on ONTO for a 10,000 ONG bonus. A two-week “Open ONTO with me” campaign was launched, which was a tremendous success and attracted nearly 1,000 users. ONTO supported Binance Blockchain Week’s online broadcast. By scanning a QR code on their screens, users were entered with a chance to win a portion of a limited number of 2,000 DEGO&nbsp;NFTs.  <p>Keep up with us on&nbsp;social!</p><p>Find Ontology elsewhere…</p><p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-monthly-report-february-2021-52be751cbd6d">Ontology Monthly Report — February 2021</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 The Basics <p>Verus is among the easiest cryptocurrencies to stake and earn rewards. Unlike many staking systems your Verus is completely accessible while it’s staking, it isn’t locked up, inaccessible, or out of your control in any way. You just have to flip a switch in your wallet to turn it on, and your Verus remains in your wallet the whole time, and can be spent at any&nbsp;time.</p><p>Verus uses a novel consensus mechanism called <a href="https://verus.io/technology/verus_proof_of_power">Proof-of-Power</a> (PoP) which is a hybrid half Proof-of-Work (PoW), half Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system. Half of the blocks are mined using VerusHash, and the other half are “minted” via staking. This means that both miners and stakers are doing the work to process transactions and secure the network, and that attackers would need BOTH a significant share of mining hash rate AND of the available supply of Verus (VRSC) to attack the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Every block has a chance of being won by staking, and over time it averages out that half of the blocks are solved by mining and half by staking. The average block time on Verus is 1 minute. If you stake a block you’ll get the block reward and any transaction fees paid by users to have their transactions processed. At the time of writing, the block reward is 12 VRSC, and there is a halving (the reward drops in half) approximately every two years, the last of which was in November&nbsp;2020.</p><p>The chances of staking and receiving a block reward for any given block are proportional to the amount of Verus you’re staking. There is no minimum amount of Verus required to stake, and any funds kept in a transparent address or a VerusID that have been there for at least 150 blocks (about 150 minutes) may be used to&nbsp;stake.</p><p>Your wallet must be running, connected to the internet, and synced with the Verus blockchain with staking enabled in order to stake. Addresses/wallets should only be staked from a single computer. By default staking is disabled to prevent unintentionally staking from multiple computers or creating problems with accounting for staked funds when they’re not expected.</p> Staking Requirements <p>To stake successfully your wallet must meet these requirements:</p>  Funds held in one or more transparent addresses or VerusIDs in the&nbsp;wallet  Wallet is running, online, synced to the Verus blockchain on a system with an accurate system&nbsp;clock  Staking is enabled in the wallet&nbsp;software   Verus Desktop (GUI) Staking&nbsp;How-To <p>To enable staking in the Verus Desktop wallet you’ll open the wallet and go to the Mining tab. Here on the mining dashboard you can enable staking by clicking the icon of the dollar sign with the slash through&nbsp;it.</p><p>Or, from the mining dashboard you can click on Verus on the left side, then toggle staking on in the main interface.</p><p>That should get you staking. With staking enabled you’ll get a dashboard showing estimates for potential staking returns given the current network conditions that looks like&nbsp;this:</p><p>The calculator is always only an estimate, since the whole system is based on statistical averages over time, and dependent on changing network conditions. In particular, these estimates and your results will vary based on how much Verus is being staked on the rest of the network by all participants in any given&nbsp;moment.</p><p>Notice in that calculator that it shows only a portion staking — this is because a portion of the balance is unavailable for staking, having recently staked, and will be available again in 150 blocks. For more information on this aspect see the UTXO Details section&nbsp;below.</p><p>You’ll know you’ve successfully staked when you see staking transactions and rewards in your transaction list, and when your balance goes up accordingly.</p> Verus Command Line (CLI) Staking&nbsp;How-To <p>You might prefer to use Verus on the command line, either to run on much lighter-weight hardware or headless systems, for the ability to script and integrate with Verus, or just for more granular control over your&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>This assumes you are already familiar with the command line and have verusd running and have met the other prerequisites for being eligible to&nbsp;stake.</p><p>You can enable staking in a running wallet using this&nbsp;command:</p> verus setgenerate true 0 <p>This will turn your mining threads down to zero if you were mining. If you want to also re-enable solo mining you can follow this&nbsp;with:</p> verus setgenerate true X <p>where X is the number of threads you want to mine&nbsp;with.</p><p>You can disable staking AND mining&nbsp;using:</p> verus setgenerate false <p>You can get your current staking/mining status&nbsp;using:</p> verus getmininginfo <p>which will return something like&nbsp;this:</p> { <br> “blocks”: 1424603,<br> “currentblocksize”: 0,<br> “currentblocktx”: 0,<br> “averageblockfees”: 1.20011909,<br> “difficulty”: 1004965568496.515,<br> “stakingsupply”: 41243165.47632869,<br> “errors”: “”,<br> “genproclimit”: 0,<br> “localhashps”: 0,<br> “networkhashps”: 351834027116,<br> “pooledtx”: 1,<br> “testnet”: false,<br> “chain”: “main”,<br> “generate”: true,<br> “staking”: true,<br> “numthreads”: 0,<br> “mergemining”: 0<br>} <p>The “stakingsupply” figure is an estimate of how much Verus has been staking on the whole network recently. Your approximate chances of staking any given block can be calculated by dividing your eligible staking balance (funds at least 150 blocks old in transparent addresses or IDs) by the staking&nbsp;supply.</p><p>To enable staking after verusd is restarted you can add the following to your VRSC.conf file:</p> mint=1 <p>or pass -mint to verusd when launching it.</p> Enabling StakeGuard <p>StakeGuard is a system for <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/how-verus-solved-nothing-at-stake-and-weak-subjectivity-proof-of-stake-problems-b4dd6a85086e">solving the Nothing-at-Stake problem</a>. By configuring StakeGuard you have a chance of receiving the ill-gotten staking rewards from those who are trying to cheat the network (or potentially from those who make the mistake of staking their wallet from different computers at the same time, since the network can’t tell these two cases&nbsp;apart).</p><p>To enable StakeGuard on the Verus Desktop GUI go to the main wallet screen for Verus and click the green Receive button under Private Balance. Then click the copy icon for an address you’d like your StakeGuard proceeds to go to. If you don’t yet have a private address, click the “new private address”&nbsp;button.</p><p>With your private address copied, click on the gear icon in the upper right corner to enter settings, then click on Coin Settings on the left. Make sure Verus(VRSC) is selected in the dropdown right below the settings icon. Then paste your private address into the StakeGuard address field and save your&nbsp;changes.</p><p>That’s it for the&nbsp;GUI.</p><p>To enable StakeGuard in the CLI wallet you’ll edit your VRSC.conf file and add a z-address in a line formatted like&nbsp;this:</p> cheatcatcher=ZADDR <p>or pass it as a parameter to verusd when launching using the parameter like&nbsp;so:</p> -cheatcatcher=”ZADDR”  UTXO Details <p>A few notes on some of the finer points of staking — you can ignore this part and do just fine with staking, but this might be useful to you if you’re looking for the slightly deeper&nbsp;dive.</p><p>The balance in your wallet is made up of the sum of the transactions that have been sent to an address or VerusID in your wallet that haven’t been spent. When you’re staking it is actually each individual <a href="https://blog.komodoplatform.com/en/whats-utxo/">unspent transaction output (UTXO)</a> that’s eligible to&nbsp;stake.</p><p>When a UTXO stakes it is actually spent, being sent back to the same address again. This means it still shows up in your balance, but it becomes ineligible to stake again for 150 blocks. For the next 150 blocks after a stake you’ll notice that the value of the UTXO that staked will be missing from your eligible staking balance, but also notice that your other UTXOs remain eligible to stake during this&nbsp;period.</p><p>For this reason, if you’re staking a large balance you’ll likely have better staking performance by making sure your balance is split up between multiple UTXOs — by having sent it to the wallet in multiple transactions rather than a single large transaction or otherwise redistributing it within the wallet. This keeps a larger portion of your funds available for staking while the successful stakes have to wait 150 blocks to be available for staking again. There are quickly diminishing returns here though, and having too many small transactions can decrease your wallet’s efficiency in scanning all of them for eligible stakes. My recommendation is to not bother breaking up any UTXOs smaller than 5,000&nbsp;VRSC.</p><p>The odds of each individual UTXO staking are independent, and proportional to their value. This means that one 10,000VRSC UTXO has the same odds of staking as a group of ten 1,000VRSC UTXOs.</p> Verus Vault <p>Verus Vault will soon move from Testnet to the main Verus network. Verus Vault allows a VerusID to be locked and prevented from spending until it is unlocked and a specified cooldown time has passed or a specific block height is reached, or until the ID is revoked and recovered. Verus Vault allows the funds in a locked ID to stake, so users protecting their funds this way won’t miss out on staking opportunities.</p> Currencies and&nbsp;PBaaS <p>Also on the Verus Testnet right now is functionality for creating and trading using currencies. I recommend starting with this article on <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/vbasics-verus-defi-118da0b13f35">Verus DeFi</a> to understand more. It is mentioned here to make it clear that currencies on Verus will not be able to stake; only Verus can stake. Also, Verus that resides in the reserves (the liquidity pool) of a fractional currency is unable to&nbsp;stake.</p><p>PBaaS (Public Blockchains as a Service) chains have their own coin, which is mineable and/or stakeable on that chain, but not on the Verus network directly.</p> Fees and the Fee&nbsp;Pool <p>In addition to the block reward miners and stakers are rewarded with the fees users pay to have their transactions processed by the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Another Testnet feature that will soon migrate to the main Verus network is the fee pool. The fees that go to the miners and stakers (such as transaction fees, ID registration costs, and others) will go into the fee pool, and each miner or staker will get to take 1% of what is in the fee pool along with their block reward. This makes mining/staking proceeds from fees more stable over time, rather than having occasional blocks with high fees from high-fee events like ID registrations. It also helps align incentives by making sure no potentially malicious miner or staker might want to mine for a previous block if the fees were particularly lucrative, since those fees are averaged out over&nbsp;time.</p> Troubleshooting <p>If you believe you’re having problems with staking here are a few things to&nbsp;check:</p>  Check your eligible staking balance. Funds in a private address (z-address) aren’t eligible to stake. Also any funds received, transacted with, or staked within the last 150 blocks aren’t eligible. So keep these in mind when assessing your eligible balance. If there’s a discrepancy between your wallet balance and your eligible staking balance not explained by these considerations, there might be something to investigate with the help of the <a href="https://verus.io/discord">community-support or staking channels on the Verus&nbsp;Discord</a>.  Check to ensure that staking is enabled. If you’re using the command line wallet or if you want to look under the hood on the Verus Desktop wallet use the getmininginfo command to see that staking is enabled (“staking”:true) (on the CLI: verus getmininginfo&nbsp;; in the GUI wallet: Settings-&gt;Coin Settings, then run getmininginfo in the command&nbsp;window).  Check your system clock to make sure your time is accurate.  Check in with the community on the <a href="https://verus.io/discord">Verus Discord</a>. If you describe your issue in the community-support or staking channels they’ll be able to help, or can put your mind at&nbsp;ease.  <p>One point of confusion worth reviewing — staking on Verus doesn’t provide a steady trickle of proceeds, instead it is all-or-nothing in each block, earning the full block reward plus fees each time, and the frequency with which you stake a block is based on the amount of Verus you have staking. It’s also all a matter of statistical averages, you may have lucky periods and dry spells, the specifics of when you stake and when you don’t are matters of utter randomness and should even out over long periods of time as a matter of averages. If you have a relatively small amount of Verus your staking rewards may be very infrequent, but there’s always a chance, and over a sufficiently long time there’s a good chance you’ll stake at some&nbsp;point.</p><p>Good luck and happy&nbsp;staking!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-beginners-staking-guide-efbbdc4de951">Verus Beginner’s Staking Guide</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin">Verus Coin</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Last month <a href="https://bloom.co/blog/2021-community-grants/">we announced</a> new community grants totaling 40 ETH toward the exploration, research and development across three important topics. We received an incredible number of submissions from our community and pored over numerous exciting and innovative ideas. While we wish we could fund all entries, after a careful review and selection process we have determined four project recipients for this year’s grants.</p><p>We are pleased to announce the following grant winners:</p> Research Grant: Token Economics <p>Award amount: 5 ETH | Winner: Omni Analytics</p><p>Omni Analytics is a data science company that performs research for several projects in the cryptocurrency industry, including the Ethereum Foundation, Numerai and Lykke Labs. They seek to link the attributes of a token’s initial distribution to their adoption as measured by on- chain metrics such as wallet total locked value and market capitalization. Utilizing data from across the blockchain they hope to find meaningful insights that can be used to guide and predict the future growth of decentralized protocols.</p><blockquote>We're excited to be partnering up with Bloom to unearth data driven insights into how a token's initial distribution will affect their market adoption in the short and medium term.</blockquote><p> - Lawrence</p> Research Grant: Token Economics <p>Award amount: 5 ETH | Winner: Square 1</p><p>Square 1 is a podcast and content series that aims to surface the design patterns present in today’s token networks, DAOs, decentralized products and communities. The platform seeks to create information that is insightful for crypto-natives and approachable for crypto-novices, alike. Square 1 has completed audits of MakerDAOs governance system and is continuing to focus on similar audits across a number of prominent platforms and DAOs within the community.</p><blockquote>I’m extremely encouraged and grateful for Bloom Network’s early support of Square 1. They’ve proven to be an amazing team to work with. </blockquote><p>– James Duncan</p> Build Grant: Unsecured Lending Vaults <p>Award amount: 20 ETH | Winner: Tilly Loan</p><p>Tilly Loan is an unsecured lending platform that leverages both on-chain and off-chain components to not only bring the value of DeFi to the real world but to democratize modern credit infrastructure for emerging markets. Tilly Loan is building an open banking platform in Africa, seeking to correct the many issues it has identified with how lending is performed throughout the region. The platform allows anyone to draw a credit line from an Aave credit delegation vault based on a risk assessment performed using the individual’s traditional financial data.</p><blockquote>The Bloom team brings a wealth of expertise in decentralized identity and credit infrastructure; the grant not only supports initial development of the platform but the mentorship and guidance is invaluable. </blockquote><p>– Victor Akinwande</p> Build Grant: Utility Experiments <p>Award amount: 10 ETH | Winner: Steven Yuan</p><p>Steven’s project aims to determine if a tokenized and decentralized identity platform like Bloom can help local governments build new tools to deter fraud and malicious actors from pushing their agenda in public meetings. As a remote-first lifestyle set about by the events related to COVID-19 allow everyday citizens to dial into government meetings, Steven’s project seeks to validate and incentivize good citizens to participate, while creating a medium to allow this at the government level.</p><blockquote>As a deep advocate for design thinking, I strongly believe that good research and critical thought into the problems that Bloom could potentially solve are the precursor to ensuring that the protocol will thrive in the future. This grant will help us thoroughly study the needs in this space, as well as set up incentivized experiments to determine if we are able to effectively address those needs. </blockquote><p>– Steven Yuan</p> Stay Tuned <p>We’re excited to see how these projects innovate in their respective fields and expand on their initial thesis. We intend to follow up and provide an update on our blog to keep our community informed on their progress and their eventual outcome. We also plan to do similar grants for other topics in the near future, especially as we see the space rapidly evolving with new and novel uses cases appearing overnight. These are exciting times for cryptocurrencies and the larger blockchain sector, and we envision the increased need for decentralized digital identity solutions in the near term and future.</p><p>Please email <a>grants@bloom.co</a> if you'd like an invite to our discord to collaborate with our community and stay up to date with the latest announcements.</p>
