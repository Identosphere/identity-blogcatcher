Here’s the latest from our development efforts.  SpruceIDSpruce    </a><p>At SpruceID, we’re letting users control their identity and data across the web. Here’s the latest from our development efforts:</p> SpruceKit <p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/introducing-sprucekit/">SpruceKit</a> is a collection of libraries that power your application to accept digital credentials from users on their terms, originate trusted information for users, and interact with user data vaults. SpruceKit consists of the following open-source libraries:</p>  Reference Wallet  SSX  Sign-in with Ethereum  DIDKit  TreeLDR  SpruceKit also provides access to Kepler and Rebase   OpenID and Reference Wallet <p>We are working on implementations of OID4VCI and OID4VP and have recently refactored them to match the latest version of the specifications (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/oid4vci-rs/pull/10?ref=blog.spruceid.com">oid4vci-rs#10</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/oid4vp-rs/pull/3?ref=blog.spruceid.com">oid4vp-rs#3</a>)</p><p>Work is underway to update our <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/wallet?ref=blog.spruceid.com">reference wallet</a> (formerly known as Credible Wallet) and refactor it as a collection of our mobile-related technologies which include credentials and keys management but also the OID4VCI protocols.</p> DIDKit/SSI <p>DIDKit provides Verifiable Credential and Decentralized Identifier functionality across different platforms. DIDKit's core libraries are written in Rust due to Rust's expressive type system, memory safety, simple dependency web, and suitability across different platforms, including embedded systems, but the comprehensive DIDKit SDK includes many libraries and interfaces for using it almost everywhere.</p>  Merged an initial implementation of SD-JWT (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/529?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ssi#529</a>)  A major refactor of ssi continues to be underway. This refactor will help us to better handle Linked Data and generally improve our implementation of the various Verifiable Credentials and Decentralised IDs specifications (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/508?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#508</a>). The general API redesign is over, and we are now rewriting all ssi tests and making sure the new implementation does not introduce regressions.   Rebase&nbsp;   Rebase was refactored to support multiple async runtimes, this allows developers to use Rebase in popular Rust async runtimes like Tokio. Before, it only supported WASM.  Rebase is being refactored to support witness flows without issuance. All previous issuance work will still be available, but developers will be able to use the witness flows to simply determine if a fact is true and no longer have to issue a credential at the conclusion of the flow. This supports more flexible implementations in apps that call Rebase libraries.   <p>About SpruceID: SpruceID lets users control their data across the web. SpruceID provides an ecosystem of open-source tools for developers that let users collect their data in one place that they control, and show their cards however they want.

 Change announcements: 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Changes to FIDO2 authentication methods and Windows Hello for Business</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beginning January 2024, Microsoft Entra ID will support <a href="https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpasskeys.dev%2Fdocs%2Freference%2Fterms%2F%23device-bound-passkey&amp;data=05%7C01%7Csdriggers%40affirma.com%7C67b44af499d14988c81108dbd404460c%7C65265dd04b2044a4aca4b7ecbb143664%7C0%7C0%7C638336889010878570%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=%2BLpGtZFtGXHPKMbnR5ifT8fFFrl0nOCa3L4K87QgoQk%3D&amp;reserved=0">device-bound passkeys</a> stored on computers and mobile devices as an authentication method in public preview, in addition to the existing support for FIDO2 security keys. This enables your users to perform phishing-resistant authentication using the devices that they already have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will expand the existing FIDO2 authentication methods policy and end user experiences to support this preview release. For your organization to opt-in to this preview, you will need to enforce key restrictions to allow specified passkey providers in your FIDO2 policy. Learn more about FIDO2 key restrictions <a href="https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fazure%2Factive-directory%2Fauthentication%2Fhowto-authentication-passwordless-security-key&amp;data=05%7C01%7Csdriggers%40affirma.com%7C67b44af499d14988c81108dbd404460c%7C65265dd04b2044a4aca4b7ecbb143664%7C0%7C0%7C638336889010878570%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=ac9DQ7dxszepy0kftYRCNrGS4hqqwUq46SMrAPagpgc%3D&amp;reserved=0">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, the existing end user sign-in option for Windows Hello and FIDO2 security keys will be renamed to “Face, fingerprint, PIN, or security key”. The term “passkey” will be mentioned in the updated sign-in experience to be inclusive of passkey credentials presented from security keys, computers, and mobile devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Azure AD Graph Updates</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following a three-year deprecation period, we <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/important-azure-ad-graph-retirement-and-powershell-module/ba-p/3848270">announced in June 2023</a> that we are entering the retirement, or shut down, cycle for Azure AD Graph APIs, which are now out of support (other than security-related fixes). This aligns with our <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/versioning-and-support">Breaking Change Policy</a> that promises a minimum two (2) year deprecation period before API retirement. In June, we also described that this retirement would happen in stages and with advanced notice between each stage. The first stage will involve newly created Applications being unable to use Azure AD Graph APIs (by default). &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>While there are limited substantial updates to share at this point, we do want to provide an interim update. Our goal is to be transparent and establish a regular cadence of communication as we work with and support our customers through this service retirement. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>September 2023 updates:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Some customers have told us that it is hard to identify or find which applications are using the retiring Azure AD Graph APIs, and at what scale. We are now working to deliver an analytics experience through <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/overview-recommendations">Identity Recommendations</a> that will provide the information that you need to identify and prioritize applications that require update or modification to avoid further disruption. We will provide an estimated release date for this experience soon. 
 As described in our prior communication, the first stage of retirement for Azure AD Graph APIs will involve a change that prevents newly-created <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/application?view=graph-rest-1.0">Applications</a> from using Azure AD Graph APIs (by default). We will provide a minimum of three (3) months advance notice before this date. At this first stage, only newly created Applications, and not existing Applications, will be impacted.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a near-future update, we will provide more detail on the timeline and actions needed to avoid disruption for (new) Applications that are not yet migrated to Microsoft Graph. We have not yet set the date at which newly created Applications will be prevented from using Azure AD Graph APIs, but we are working diligently towards providing that clarity and to deliver experiences that will help support customer efforts in migrating applications away from this retiring API service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Required Action:</p>
<p>Identify and migrate applications that are using Azure AD Graph to use equivalent Microsoft Graph APIs. Microsoft Graph is a feature rich API platform that provides a unified API surface for many Microsoft services, including Microsoft Entra, Exchange, Teams, SharePoint, and the full Microsoft 365 portfolio.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Migrate Sign-in risk policy and User risk policy and from Entra ID Protection to Conditional Access</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have User risk policy or Sign-in risk policy enabled in Entra ID Protection (formerly Identity Protection) today, we invite you to migrate them to Conditional Access following <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-configure-risk-policies#migrate-risk-policies-from-identity-protection-to-conditional-access">these steps</a>. The UX in Entra ID Protection for these two risk policies will be retired on October 1, 2026</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Configuring Sign-in risk and User risk policies in Conditional Access provides these benefits:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Manage all access policies in one place. 
 Report-only mode and Graph API support.&nbsp; 
 Greater flexibility by combining risk conditions with other conditions like location for granular access control.&nbsp; 
 Enhanced security with multiple risk-based policies targeting different user groups or risk levels.&nbsp; 
 Improved diagnostics experience by viewing which risk-based policy applied in Sign-in Logs.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Registration campaign improvements</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help your users&nbsp;<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/it-s-time-to-hang-up-on-phone-transports-for-authentication/ba-p/1751752">move away from publicly switched telephone networks (PSTN) such as SMS and voice</a>, we’re making improvements to the&nbsp;<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/how-to-mfa-registration-campaign">Registration campaign feature (aka Nudge)</a>. We’ll allow users to skip the prompt a maximum of three times, after which they will have to go through the registration flow. Note: admins can decide if they want to opt out of the “limited” 3 snooze configuration or give their end users the ability to snooze indefinitely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, for Entra ID tenants that are Microsoft managed, we’re enabling the feature for users that are fully dependent on PSTN methods (SMS and voice) today for their MFA. Beginning&nbsp;September 2023, we will initiate a phased rollout of this change for Entra ID premium tenants.</p>

The first supported application is&nbsp;Outlook mobile. It’s a great alternative for users who can’t or aren’t willing to download another&nbsp;work&nbsp;app on their phone but already have&nbsp;Outlook set up on their mobile device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, Authenticator Lite is only available to organizations who manage Microsoft Authenticator in the <a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fazure%2Factive-directory%2Fauthentication%2Fconcept-authentication-methods-manage%23authentication-methods-policy&amp;data=05%7C01%7CPadma.Prasad%40microsoft.com%7C5723979d9d5d431bcb2c08dbaf172fa8%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638296286347271878%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=xRuXa6iKsZ92fRhu2QzLGrM6vrQf1Rk2mxs%2B6J22vyI%3D&amp;reserved=0">modern authentication methods policy</a>. We're now also making it available as a part of the "Notifications through mobile app" method in the per-user MFA policy. Starting mid-September 2023, we'll update&nbsp;the&nbsp;"Notification through mobile app" method in the per-user MFA policy such that if it's enabled, then Authenticator Lite is also enabled. Organizations that don't want to use Authenticator Lite will need to disable it following the instructions <a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fazure%2Factive-directory%2Fauthentication%2Fhow-to-mfa-authenticator-lite%23disabling-authenticator-lite-in-azure-portal-ux&amp;data=05%7C01%7CPadma.Prasad%40microsoft.com%7C5723979d9d5d431bcb2c08dbaf172fa8%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638296286347271878%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=IGbTW%2Fo%2FMFoVs%2Bf8GIBPc8PRsKmbprYbr1UEclVM91k%3D&amp;reserved=0">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Optimized MFA OTP delivery via WhatsApp</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>Today,&nbsp;Entra ID&nbsp;(Azure AD) MFA supports delivering one-time passcodes (OTPs) via <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-phone-options#sms-message-verification">text message</a>. These texts get sent to the default messaging app on a user's phone depending on the phone's operating system. In many countries though, these default apps aren't users' primary messaging apps. To help deliver OTPs to users on their preferred messaging platforms, Entra ID will roll out OTP delivery to WhatsApp in select regions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting mid-September 2023, users&nbsp;in India, Indonesia, and New Zealand may start receiving MFA text messages via WhatsApp. Users that fit the following criteria are subject, but not guaranteed, to receive the updated experience:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Enabled for text messages / SMS as an authentication method 
 Already use WhatsApp 
 Have a phone number with a country code in one of the listed countries 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations with users in the listed countries that don't want their users to receive MFA text messages through WhatsApp will need to disable text messages as an authentication method in their tenant(s). Depending on where they manage their authentication methods this means they need to disable "Text message to phone" in the <a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Faccount.activedirectory.windowsazure.com%2FUserManagement%2FMfaSettings.aspx&amp;data=05%7C01%7CPadma.Prasad%40microsoft.com%7C5723979d9d5d431bcb2c08dbaf172fa8%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638296286347271878%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=2wENNOj7suQmnsgX%2BErw3SzyGW2dKlEjo7%2BZ7GumgTY%3D&amp;reserved=0">per-user MFA policy</a>&nbsp;and / or "SMS" in the <a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fentra.microsoft.com%2F%23view%2FMicrosoft_AAD_IAM%2FAuthenticationMethodsMenuBlade%2F~%2FAdminAuthMethods%2FfromNav%2FIdentity&amp;data=05%7C01%7CPadma.Prasad%40microsoft.com%7C5723979d9d5d431bcb2c08dbaf172fa8%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638296286347428104%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=47wDN5b8%2FVhKNbOlUc4UEyXhEtBhR9tBKn9kWBe1gac%3D&amp;reserved=0">Authentication methods policy</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Changes to My Groups admin controls</p>
<p>[No action is required]</p>
<p>Starting June 2024, the existing Self Service Group Management setting in the Microsoft Entra admin center which states, “Restrict user ability to access groups features in the Access,” will be retired. This means disabling My Groups will no longer be possible. In June, a new setting that enables admins to restrict end users from viewing and managing security groups in My Groups will take effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This change will occur automatically—admins and users won’t need to take any action:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 If the existing setting for Restrict user ability to access groups features in the Access Panel is configured as Yes, the new setting will restrict users' ability to see and edit security groups in My Groups. 
 &nbsp;If the existing setting is configured as No, the new setting will expose security groups in My Groups. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To learn more, please see this <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/groups-self-service-management#make-a-group-available-for-user-self-service">documentation</a>. Note: Admins can still manage end users' ability to create Microsoft 365 and security groups using the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/groups-self-service-management#group-settings">group settings</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enable HTTP/2 on the Graph service endpoint</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>As <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/microsoft-entra-change-announcements-september-2022-train/ba-p/2967454">previously announced</a> in September of 2022, the Microsoft Graph engineering team plans to begin rollout of HTTP/2 support on the Microsoft Graph service endpoint on September 15, 2023. HTTP/2 support will be in addition to existing HTTP/1.1 version support. Once HTTP/2 is enabled on the Microsoft Graph endpoints, clients that support HTTP/2 will negotiate this version when making requests to Microsoft Graph. Focus for improvements in the HTTP/2 specification concern performance, including perceived latency, and network and service resource usage (reference <a href="https://http2.github.io">https://http2.github.io</a>), including multiplexing, parallelism, and efficiency through binary encoding and header compression. These benefits may offer substantial value to Microsoft Graph clients and customers. HTTP/2 is expected to be entirely backwards-compatible with HTTP/1.1 and to require no code changes in client applications. It's possible, in rare cases, that negative impact may occur with some client applications, if the application does not adhere to HTTP specifications concerning case-insensitive comparisons for Header keys.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Government organizations with significant technical debt require modern approaches for delivering services. Deploying services using DevOps techniques and a DevOps-enabled identity and access management (IAM) platform can improve application performance, availability, and scalability, while reducing maintenance and deployment costs.</p>

 Why DevOps? 

<p>DevOps is a methodology that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve collaboration, communication, and efficiency in delivering software applications.</p>

<p>Docker and Kubernetes are two foundational technologies that can be used for any deployment methodology — not just cloud computing — because they support building applications that can run on any modern operating system, and in any environment.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/docker/docker">Docker</a> is a tool designed to make it easier for developers to quickly create, deploy, and run applications at scale and in any environment by using containers. Containers allow a developer to bundle an application with all of the parts it needs — such as libraries, code, and other dependences — and deploy it as one package.</p>

<p><a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> is an open source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.</p>

<p>Together, Docker and Kubernetes enable developers to focus on writing code without worrying about the systems that it will be running on. The combination enables them to orchestrate and deliver faster services with flexible deployment options, whether they are to run in an on-premises, hybrid, or multi-cloud environment.</p>

 The benefits of DevOps-based IAM 

<p>Time is of the essence when developing and deploying capabilities that support the growing need for digital government services or for mission-critical applications used in denied, degraded, intermittent, and limited (DDIL) environments.</p>

<p>One of the best ways to speed deployment, scale for peak demand, and increase efficiency and security is by using a modern, comprehensive IAM solution that supports a multi-cloud DevOps deployment model with Docker and Kubernetes-based containerization and orchestration technologies. With the cloud now a top government strategic priority and more workloads shifting to cloud platforms every year, it's imperative to protect these workloads, no matter where they reside.</p>

<p>Large government agencies and organizations that are using older, on-premises IAM systems can't deliver the scale and security needed for digital government services for constituents or mission-critical applications used in intelligence and defense. Traditional IAM solutions are often complex and difficult to deploy, lacking the scalability and flexibility needed for quickly rolling out new services, upgrades, or releases.</p>

<p>In contrast, DevOps-friendly IAM solutions are designed to support automated and continuous delivery requirements, which are essential for DevOps practices across any environment.<br>
By containerizing IAM using tools like Docker and Kubernetes, government agencies can achieve greater flexibility when deploying IAM solutions.</p>

 Comparing DevOps-based IAM with legacy and cloud-only solutions 

<p>ForgeRock fully supports DevOps-based IAM and offers several advantages over legacy, monolithic IAM solutions and cloud-only IAM:</p>

  Deploy anywhere, online or offline: DevOps-based IAM can be deployed in any environment: on-premises, in private or public cloud, and in offline access scenarios such as on military vessels with intermittent internet connectivity. Our Cloud Deployment Model (CDM) adheres to the DoD Enterprise DevSecOps Reference Design for deployment in a containerized environment. 
	 Best of both worlds: The comprehensive ForgeRock IAM platform provides the features, capabilities, and customization you need, without the hassle of maintaining a monolithic IAM system. Cloud-only IAM solutions offer agility and scalability, but they may not be suitable for government agencies and organizations that are managing complex use cases or DDIL low-bandwidth and offline requirements. 
	 Up-to-date security: Unlike a monolithic IAM solution, DevOps-based IAM can be patched quickly for security updates and new features without taking the entire solution offline. 
  The ForgeOps deployment methodology 

<p>Customers that use the ForgeRock DevOps deployment model called <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/forgeops/7.4/cdm/intro.html">ForgeOps</a> have accelerated projects by three to six months, saving 25% on implementation costs. Agencies can deploy updates between their containerized applications and ForgeRock with the ability to test, QA, and deploy ForgeRock into Kubernetes clusters in minutes by running a simple command. And they can choose the operating system that meets their needs.</p>

<p>Government agencies requiring high security often choose OpenShift, an on-premises platform-as-a-service Kubernetes implementation that supports public cloud, on-premises, hybrid cloud, or edge architectures. The ForgeOps-provided Kubernetes scripts can be modified to support an OpenShift deployment.</p>

<p>With the right identity solution, organizations can easily protect workloads in any cloud; support millions of identities of any type; enable rapid solution development in a repeatable way; and conduct fast, simple, and highly available deployments — all without sacrificing rich features and extensibility. This ultimately leads to immediate business benefits, including accelerated time to market, increased flexibility in rolling out new services, availability and scalability, and time savings.</p>

 The ForgeRock difference 

<p>By making it easy to utilize Docker and Kubernetes technology, ForgeRock provides the fastest and most flexible multi-cloud IAM deployment options. Our cloud deployment model removes complexity and can help you accelerate development, making it easy to deploy millions of identities in minutes, on any cloud – whether it's a private cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure.</p>

<p>You can validate deployment options against ForgeRock benchmark results and analyze the most cost-effective cloud solution based on multiple factors so that your organization can reduce costs and ensure optimal performance, availability, and reliability to meet customer demand quickly.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the year, we laid out a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/announcement/fueling-digital-transformation-with-ibm-power/">new strategy</a> for IBM Power under the leadership of Ken King, who will be retiring by the end of 2023 after forty years with IBM. It is with immense gratitude that I thank Ken for his leadership not only across IBM Power, but for his service to IBM in various roles spanning IP, strategy and software during his distinguished IBM career.</p>



<p>I am excited to announce, therefore, that a few months ago I took on the role of IBM Power general manager. As Ken passes the baton, I want to take stock of the progress we’ve made — and point to where we are prioritizing — across four critical areas to help address our clients’ digital transformation imperatives:</p>



 
 Continuing to innovate key capabilities for core business workloads by strategically investing in three operating environments on IBM Power: AIX, IBM i and Linux 



 Driving growth with SAP HANA on Power on-premises and in the cloud 



 Supporting clients’ banking and industry modernization journey 



 Providing greater flexibility with subscription services and Power as a Service 
 



<p>Our value proposition is the ability to combine hybrid cloud and AI with clients’ trusted data on IBM Power to fuel business outcomes. Let’s dig in to some specifics.</p>



 Down to the core 



<p>We’ve continued to innovate and invest in operating environments on IBM Power to help ensure business continuity, reliability, availability, serviceability and security for clients. In the latest IBM i Technology Refresh — IBM i 7.5 TR3 and 7.4 TR9 — announced in October, we listened to feedback from our IBM i Advisory Councils and prioritized advancements in ease of use, productivity, and automation with enhancements to Navigator for i and new additions to SYSTOOLS for automating Db2 for i.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also have a new release of AIX — AIX 7.3 TL2 — building on Power10’s high <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/EVMWVOE9">availability leadership</a> with performance and scale enhancements to Live Kernel Update (designed to give the ability to update AIX without unplanned downtime), optimized file system performance and enhancements designed to improve AIX encryption performance and audit event checking. You can learn more about this latest release on the <a href="https://ibm.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1638273&amp;tp_key=cb358c99cd&amp;sti=sales">AIX webcast</a> on November 14.</p>



<p>We are expanding IBM Db2 Warehouse on Power with a new Base Rack Express at a 30% lower entry list price, adding to today’s S,&nbsp;M&nbsp;and L configurations,&nbsp;while still providing the same total-solution experience, including Db2 Data Warehouse’s connectivity with watsonx.data to unlock the potential of data for analytics and AI.</p>



<p>Oracle will be releasing <a href="https://support.oracle.com/knowledge/Oracle%20Database%20Products/2766930_1.html">Oracle Database 23c on Power</a>, as part of their next Long Term Release as reported in April 2023. Separately, in 2024, clients will be able to look forward to continued enhancements to the AIX, IBM i and Linux roadmaps.</p>



 Accelerating business transformation with SAP HANA on Power&nbsp; 



<p>As the <a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2022/09/25/the-impact-of-2027-on-sap-customers/">2027 end of mainstream maintenance for SAP’s legacy ERP</a> is approaching, our customers are all in different stages of their business transformation journey. SAP is accelerating this journey by offering the current ERP, S/4HANA, as a managed service offering with SAP RISE. IBM Power is supporting our customers in their business transformation journey by offering customer infrastructure solutions designed to meet customers where they are. Whether they need Power10 systems on-premises to upgrade their SAP landscapes, Power Virtual Server capacity to accelerate migration to S/4HANA, or SAP RISE in IBM Cloud on Power, we are providing solutions on Power infrastructure.</p>



<p>In addition, IBM is also offering a hybrid cloud consumption model that will allow flexibility for both on-premises and cloud expenditures. Initially this program will allow clients to leverage the investment of on-premises hardware and, with a commitment to IBM Power Virtual Server, receive cloud capacity credits for IBM Power Private Cloud.</p>



<p>With this hybrid cloud consumption program, clients can leverage the benefits of cloud while also nurturing their on-premises SAP on Power environments as they build out their long-term hybrid cloud strategy.</p>



<p>To continue our momentum on AI with SAP, in 1Q24, as we <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/announcement/combining-ai-with-a-trusted-data-approach-on-ibm-power-to-fuel-business-outcomes/">announced</a> in September, we will also be delivering the first release of SAP ABAP SDK for watsonx, which is intended to simplify and accelerate customers’ ability to consume watsonx services from their custom ABAP environments.</p>



 Driving industry modernization 



<p>Whether clients need to deploy large language models (LLMs), integrated with watsonx, close to their data and transactions, or integrate mission-critical data into their data fabric architecture, Power10’s powerful core can help embed AI-driven insights into business processes and safeguard AI workflows.</p>



<p>For instance, a Thai hospital chain was facing a challenge with its current pathology process which prolonged the overall workflow, resulting in delayed responses to diagnosis, patient management, and support for more patients. By deploying an AI inference solution for both Speech-to-Text and Image analysis on Power10, the pathology unit was able to increase sensitivity in detecting lesions to prioritize higher probability cases. These are important steps for their mission to achieve better clinical outcomes, a faster time to treatment for patients, and an efficient reduction in pathologist workloads.</p>



<p>Later this month, clients will be able to take advantage of expanded data science services with the release of IBM Cloud Pak for Data V4.8, which will deliver the underpinnings for watsonx.ai, IBM’s next-generation AI studio. To further help our clients on their AI journeys, we continue to double-down on hybrid cloud with Red Hat so that workloads can run in a best-fit environment. To that end:</p>



 
 Red Hat OpenShift 4.14 has just been released and is available to run natively on IBM Power, providing support for multi-architecture compute (MAC) worker nodes across Power, IBM Z, ARM, and x86 environments. 



 Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform components now run natively on IBM Power. Clients can consolidate their environments and run Ansible Automation Platform on the same Power servers where their business-critical workloads are already running, instead of having to run Ansible automation hub and automation controller on separate x86 processor-based servers to manage Power endpoints. Read more <a href="https://www.ansible.com/integrations/infrastructure/ibm-power-systems">here</a>. 
 



<p>A vibrant ecosystem enables a range of use cases for our clients running software on Power. Finacle is a leading digital banking suite from Infosys. With Finacle solutions on Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Power, IBM and Finacle are expanding on our 20+ year collaboration. I’m happy to share that clients can soon leverage solutions from the <a href="https://www.edgeverve.com/finacle/solutions/">Finacle Digital Banking Suite</a> using Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Power to meet evolving customer demands, regulatory, and market dynamics. &nbsp;</p>



 Power as a service 



<p>To meet client demand, throughout the year, we’re focusing on transforming the Proof of Concept (PoC) experience for IBM Power Virtual Server. We’re simplifying the process, making network configuration easier, adding power edge routers, and implementing a step-by-step automated modernization approach for IBM i, AIX and Linux that’s designed to be as straightforward as an on-premises migration from Power9 to Power10.</p>



<p>We’re also moving away from a “Do It Yourself” (DIY) model for High Availability/Disaster Recovery (HA/DR) solutions to a prescriptive and automated one. The goal is to provide clients with a clear path forward for business continuity, ensuring a smoother and more efficient process.</p>



<p>For more on our fourth quarter plans to meet clients’ expectations for running production workloads effectively on IBM Power Virtual Server, read <a href="http://www.ibm.com/blog/are-you-looking-to-expand-your-hybrid-cloud-journey-and-move-your-ibm-power-mission-critical-workloads-to-the-cloud">here</a>.</p>



 IBM Power backed by IBM Expert Care 



<p>We’re also making strides in our service offerings for IBM Power. IBM Power10 can be sold together with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/4QEDVMAZ">IBM Power Expert Care</a>, a tiered support model that makes it easier for clients to choose the right level of support for their needs and budget at the time of sale. Earlier this year, IBM adjusted the IBM Power E1080 Expert Care Premium tier to align to client expectations for proactive support. IBM Power Expert Care Remote Support and Parts is also now available in many countries with no physical IBM presence.</p>



<p>Additionally, all IBM Power support contracts come with access to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/support-insights">IBM Support Insights</a>, which provides clients with actionable insights for multivendor IT infrastructures to proactively assess and remediate IT risks. The IBM Support Insights Pro subscription, announced on September 12, is designed to expand and strengthen the scope of security risk coverage to include community open source, provide prioritized actions by vendor and product family to speed IT lifecycle decision-making, and further address reliability with an extended case history and analysis to better learn from previous support issues.</p>



 What’s next for IBM Power 



<p>We’ve listened to our community and advisory councils, and we’re dedicated to creating solutions with partners and clients so we can continue to strive to provide the most trusted and open computing platform for mission critical, scalable transaction processing, and data serving workloads. Our goals include making it easier for clients to run AI workloads closer to their data with on-chip AI acceleration, improving total cost of ownership and performance, increasing availability with up to 8x9s (99.999999%) for mission-critical workloads and fewer outages as compared to x86 servers, and enhancing security and sustainability features.</p>



<p>I’m extremely excited for the road ahead. We’ll continue to meet our clients where they are in their digital journey and strive to make the path to success as simple as possible, whether it’s by making more aaS options available, increasing pathways for workloads to move across hybrid environments, or helping to extract even more value from SAP workloads on Power.</p>

<p>YeshID is now <a href="https://trust.yeshid.com/">SOC II compliant</a>! 🎉 Not sure why this is important? In an increasingly digital world, safeguarding sensitive information, especially during <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">employee IT onboarding and offboarding</a>, is of critical importance. SOC II compliance represents a major commitment to data security and privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to share this news with you for two reasons:</p>
 
 To help deepen your trust in YeshID as your tool of choice for secure onboarding and offboarding.&nbsp; 
 You might want to achieve SOC II compliance for your growing company one day too! We’re hoping our journey can help you with yours.&nbsp; 
 
<p>In this blog post, we’ll explore what SOC II compliance means, its significance for YeshID, and how it benefits your organization.</p>
 What is SOC II compliance? 
<p>SOC II, or Service Organization Control 2, is a rigorous auditing process that evaluates a company’s controls relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy of customer data. Achieving SOC II compliance demonstrates that YeshID has undergone thorough assessments and meets high industry standards in data security.</p>
<p></p>
<p>SOC II compliance is usually conducted by a third-party assessor that measures the following:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Security: Assesses measures in place to protect the organization’s systems, data centers, networks, access controls, and more from unauthorized access, physical and otherwise 
 Availability: Examines downtime, disaster recovery, and business continuity planning to assess the reliability of systems and services as agreed upon with customers 
 Processing integrity: Evaluates if data is processed accurately, completely, and in a timely manner&nbsp; 
 Confidentiality: Assesses access controls, encryption, and data privacy measures to focus on the protection of sensitive data from unauthorized access or disclosure 
 Privacy: Assesses the management of personal information and its compliance with relevant data privacy regulations 
 
<p>There are companies that help you achieve SOC II compliance. For example, YeshID worked with <a href="https://www.vanta.com/products/soc-2">Vanta to help automate the SOC II process</a> and find a vetted third-party auditor.</p>
 Why does SOC II compliance matter? 
<p>SOC II compliance ensures that any company undergoing the process has implemented robust security measures to protect sensitive information. This is particularly essential for YeshID because during employee onboarding and offboarding, personal and confidential data is frequently exchanged. Achieving SOC II compliance shows our strong commitment to data security and privacy.</p>
<p>SOC II compliance helps reduce potential risks and vulnerabilities in your data management processes. It safeguards your organization against data breaches and regulatory fines. It also sends a signal to your customers, investors, partners, and stakeholders that data privacy and access management is a top priority for your company.</p>
 SOC II-compliant IT onboarding and offboarding with YeshID 
<p><a href="https://trust.yeshid.com/">SOC II compliance</a> is a milestone that strengthens our commitment to data security and privacy. By choosing YeshID, you can trust that your sensitive information is in safe hands during employee onboarding and offboarding processes and that you are complying with the highest data protection standards. This means that you are that much closer to achieving SOC II compliance by using a SOC II-compliant onboarding and offboarding provider.</p>
<p>In an age where data breaches and privacy concerns are ever-present, SOC II compliance is your assurance that YeshID is dedicated to maintaining the utmost standards of data security. Let us help you <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">unlock a new era of security and efficiency in your organization’s processes</a>.</p>

<p>Sounds promising, right? Experts have been talking about the dangers of uncontrolled AI proliferation for years. James Cameron warned us about <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088247/">AI gaining self-awareness</a> forty years ago! Elon Musk has been <a href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/">calling for a pause in AI development</a>, citing grave dangers for our society.

And yet, major world superpowers have been engaged in an AI arms race in recent years, and just a week ago, the US president has issued a landmark <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/">Executive Order on trustworthy development and use of AI</a> to strengthen his country’s position in this race.</p>
<p>So, why such a sudden demonstration of unity amidst an ongoing global conflict? British prime minister Rishi Sunak called the Bletchley declaration “a landmark achievement… helping ensure the long-term future of our children and grandchildren”, but can we really expect any substance from this claim, or should we treat this paper as a mere symbolic gesture?</p>
<p>After all, the entire summit was full of overt symbolism. Bletchley Park, the location of the event, is, of course, the historic site where during the World War II, top British experts worked to break the secret communications of the Axis powers, especially the notorious German Enigma machine. And of course, this valiant work was led by none other than Alan Turing, the same guy that later proposed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">eponymous test</a> to measure a machine’s ability to exhibit intelligent behavior. How cool is that?</p>
<p>Well, I don’t know about you, but I’m well aware of the fact that the actual cracking of the Enigma code was mostly done by Polish mathematicians years before, as well as of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#Death">appalling treatment of Turing himself</a> by the British authorities that led to his suicide, and this alone makes the entire symbolism a bit too shallow for me. But even if we ignore the history and only focus on the Turing test itself, we should keep in mind that it was a ground-breaking (and highly controversial) philosophical concept back then, but it bears very little relevance to the modern AI developments that the declaration is supposed to regulate.</p>
<p>Does it really matter if a chatbot can fool you into thinking that you’re communicating with a human? There are much more urgent and practical technological, cultural, and moral problems that need to be addressed soon: for example, who is responsible if a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car_liability">driverless car runs over a pedestrian</a>? Or a multitude of much smaller but equally critically important issues like dealing with bias and prejudice, ethical consequences of AI tools making carrier-defining decisions for humans, deepfakes, etc., etc. Or defending against threat actors wielding their own AI tools…</p>
<p>Surely, all these issues must be addressed, and regulation is the most efficient way to do that. But there is an important distinction between regulating AI usage and its development. The latter is simply meaningless, especially around technologies that can be easily weaponized. No matter how many times governments agree not to create “killer robots”, then will continue developing them anyway because having killer robots at your army’s disposal is much better than not having them, especially if your country is planning another war.</p>
<p>So no, I do not consider this declaration a landmark achievement. It was merely an empty gesture to make British politicians feel a bit more important than they perhaps deserve. An imitation game, if you will. Or, more likely, a <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/the-cargo-cult-of-cybersecurity">cargo cult</a>. And of course, the AI battle between the US and China will continue. And nobody will voluntarily give up productivity tools like ChatGPT and surely, the black market of AI-based threats and exploits will continue to thrive.</p>
<p>But perhaps sometime in the future, when AI safety summits are attended by industry experts and not politicians, we will see more practical developments tailored to specific issues in certain fields or geographies. Until then, we will have to defend ourselves from the evil AIs ourselves. And a great place to discuss your immediate risks and challenges is the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023">cyberevolution</a> conference, which opens next week in Frankfurt, Germany, as well as online. Will we see you there?</p>

<p>Generative AI-powered assistants are transforming businesses through intelligent conversational interfaces. Capable of understanding and generating human-like responses and content, these assistants are revolutionizing the way humans and machines collaborate. Large Language Models (LLMs) are at the heart of this new disruption. LLMs are trained on vast amounts of data and can be used across endless applications. They can be easily tuned for specific enterprise use cases with a few training examples.</p>



<p>We are witnessing a new phase of evolution as AI assistants go beyond conversations and learn how to harness tools through agents that could invoke Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to achieve specific business goals. Tasks that used to take hours can now be completed in minutes by orchestrating a large catalog of reusable agents. Moreover, these agents can be composed together to automate complex workflows.</p>



<p>AI assistants can use API-based agents to help knowledge workers with mundane tasks such as creating job descriptions, pulling reports in HR systems, sourcing candidates and more. For instance, an HR manager can ask an AI assistant to create a job description for a new role, and the assistant can generate a detailed job description that meets the company’s requirements. Similarly, a recruiter can ask an AI assistant to source candidates for a job opening, and the assistant can provide a list of qualified candidates from various sources. With AI assistants, knowledge workers can save time and focus on more complex and creative problems.</p>



<p>Automation builders can also <a href="https://www.ibm.com/community/ibm-techxchange-conference-keynote-4/">harness the power of AI assistants</a> to create automations quickly and easily. While it may sound like a riddle, AI assistants employ generative AI to automate the very process of automation. This makes building agents easier and faster. There are two essential steps in building agents for business automation: training and enriching agents for target use cases and orchestrating a catalog of multiple agents.</p>



 Training and enriching API-based agents for target use cases 



<p>APIs are the backbone of AI agents. Building API-based agents is a complex task that involves interacting with a user in a conversational manner, identifying the APIs that are needed to achieve a user goal, asking questions to gather the required arguments for the API, detecting the information provided by the user that is needed when invoking the API, enriching the APIs with sample utterances and generating responses based on API return values. This process can take hours for an experienced developer. However, LLMs can automate these steps. This enables builders to train and enrich APIs more quickly for specific tasks.</p>



<p>Assume Bob, an automation builder, wants to create API-based agents to help company sellers retrieve a list of target customers. The first step is to import the “Retrieve My Customers” API into the AI assistant. However, to make this automation available as an agent, Bob needs to take several manual and tedious steps which include training the natural language classifier with sample utterances. With the help of LLMs, AI assistants can automatically generate sample training utterances from OpenAPI specifications. This capability can significantly reduce the required manual effort. Once the foundation model is fine-tuned for semantic understanding, it can better understand business users’ prompts and intents. Bob can still review and manipulate the generated questions using a human-in-the-loop approach.</p>



<p>Soon, the process of building agents will be fully automated by identifying APIs, filling slots and enriching APIs. This will reduce the time it takes to create automation, reduce technical barriers and improve reusable agent catalogs.</p>



 Orchestrating multiple agents to automate complex workflows 



<p>Building automation flows that use multiple APIs can be technically complex and time consuming. To connect multiple APIs, it’s important to identify, sequence and invoke the right set of APIs to achieve a specific business goal. AI assistants use LLMs and planning techniques to simplify this process and reduce technical barriers. LLMs can work as a powerful recommendation system, suggesting the most suitable APIs based on usage, similarities and descriptions.</p>



<p>Builders must align the inputs and outputs of multiple APIs to compose multi-agent automations, which is a tedious and error-prone process. LLM-driven API mapping automates this alignment process based on API attributes and documentation. This makes it easier for automation builders to reuse existing APIs from large catalogs without manual intervention.</p>



<p>Now, suppose our automation builder, Bob, wants to create a more complex multi-API automation that allows sellers to retrieve a list of customers and subsequently generate a list of personalized product recommendations. After importing and enriching the “Retrieve My Customers” API agent, the LLM-infused sequencing feature can automatically recommend the “Generate Product Recommendations” API. This means Bob does not have to sift through each API individually to discover the most suitable one from the extensive catalog of agents.</p>



<p>In addition, each API contains fields of varying data types. The source API provides output fields that represent information about a set of customers. The target API presents input fields that also represent customer information. Typically, Bob would have to spend time manually mapping each field in the target APIs to a corresponding field in the source API. This tedious effort would be exacerbated as the number of source APIs and target fields increase. The API mapping service can generate a set of alignment suggestions which Bob can quickly review, edit and save.</p>



<p>IBM® <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watsonx">watsonx</a> <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-orchestrate">Orchestrate™</a> uses a combination of AI models (including LLMs) to simplify the process of building AI agents through API enrichment, sequencing and mapping recommendations. In the new phase of evolution, AI assistants will be able to sequence multiple APIs at runtime to achieve business goals defined by non-technical knowledge workers, which further democratizes automation. By leveraging AI assistants, enterprises can accelerate their automation initiatives and redeploy significant resources toward more value-generating areas.</p>

Because the systems in place to stop it are slow, outdated, or unintuitive. In this article we’ll explain how verifiable credentials can fix the issue.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Systems to prevent fraud and scams are in place across every industry; and yet, the FTC reports <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/02/new-ftc-data-show-consumers-reported-losing-nearly-88-billion-scams-2022">fraud increased by 30%</a> from 2021 to 2022. Some may point to the number of chances that bad actors have: the US averages <a href="https://capitaloneshopping.com/research/number-of-credit-card-transactions/#:~:text=Total%20global%20credit%20card%20transactions,one%20transaction%20every%201¾%20days">1,739 credit cards swiped per second,</a> with the average card holder making <a href="https://capitaloneshopping.com/research/number-of-credit-card-transactions/#:~:text=Total%20global%20credit%20card%20transactions,one%20transaction%20every%201¾%20days">210 credit transactions per year.</a> Surely, with that many transactions systems can’t catch everything. Maybe not. But it is troubling that even as security technology advances, fraud is trending ever upward.</p>
<p>2023 saw many technological advances, with one of the most noteworthy being <a href="https://chat.openai.com/auth/login">ChatGPT,</a> an artificial intelligence program that generates “human-like text.” Almost immediately, it was misused: a study by SlashNext found a <a href="https://slashnext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/SlashNext-The-State-of-Phishing-Report-2023.pdf">1,265% increase in general phishing</a> attempts since ChatGPT launched in November of 2022, and a <a href="https://slashnext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/SlashNext-The-State-of-Phishing-Report-2023.pdf">967% increase in credential phishing</a> attempts. And with ChatGPT built on open-source code, it wasn’t long before malicious actors began making their own programs to do even more damage, leading to the creation of <a href="https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/wormgpt-and-fraudgpt-the-rise-of-malicious-llms/">WormGPT and FraudGPT.</a></p>
<p>Instead of playing “spot the scam,” against a background of ever more complex scams, we need a better way of knowing for sure who we are interacting with. This is where verifiable credentials come in. Someone once described verifiable credentials to me as “multi-factor authentication for life.” Imagine a world where before you even opened the email you could be certain who it was from because there was an authentication process built into the sending.</p>
<p>Today, if you get an important-looking email from the government or your bank, the onus is on you to verify it. Some people might call to double check (and get that second point of authentication), but many might just respond, or worse yet click on links they shouldn’t and&nbsp; provide personal information. The extra step to verify is time consuming. People want convenience, and, frankly, the main line of defense against phishing and other cyber scams shouldn’t be to inconvenience them. We need a fast, easy to use, technical answer.</p>
<p>Indicio believes that verifiable credentials are this answer because we’ve seen them work across a variety of use cases for different customers. With a simple scan of a QR code you can be sure of who you are interacting with and who has issued their credential. Think of your bank issuing you a verifiable credential for your bank account. Every time you connect with your bank, it knows you’re the person it issued the credential to, automatically. Similarly, you know you are interacting with your bank and not some fake version of it. And this all occurs before any data is shared. Combine this with the way parties can prove that information shared from a credential hasn’t been tampered with, the use cases are innumerable. Trust is foundational to all business and social activity, and now we have a way to trust each other and what we share online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to see how fast and easy verifiable credentials make accessing something like your bank account you can see a demonstration <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMZlop-TvnQ">here.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>We recognize the unique skills, experience, and dedication that veterans bring to the table. As such, we actively seek veterans to join our team and contribute to our mission to secure our ever-changing world. In this blog post, we share the story of one of our Veterans Alliance members, Mark Joynes, CD, and highlight the parallel between his military experience and the rewarding career opportunities he has built at Entrust over the last 25 years.</p>
<p>The Road to PKI</p>
<p>Mark embarked on his career in the Canadian military in 1976. He started as a ground and air-to-ground photographer and spent eight years serving in Canada and West Germany during the Cold War era. However, his true transformation began when he was commissioned from the ranks and trained in the Security Branch. In his last four years, he served in the Computer Security Shop of Defense Headquarters, diving into the very early days of computer security (and before any thought of Zero Trust technologies).</p>
<p>Mark’s exposure to computer security continued in 1985 when he attended a secure systems design course at NCSC in Baltimore. He was later assigned as a Lieutenant to the Computer Security Shop, highlighting the military’s recognition of his abilities and potential in cybersecurity. Soon after leaving the military, Mark was with Canada’s Communications Security Establishment (CSE) as the Canadian government deployed the Canadian PKI root. This experience laid the foundation for his now 30-year expertise with PKI (public key infrastructure), a pivotal technology that has shaped data security.</p>
<p>PKI and Mark’s Contributions</p>
<p>Mark’s journey in the military led him to become a PKI Product Marketing Director at Entrust, where he plays a crucial role in driving the commercialization of our comprehensive ePassport PKI architecture. Leveraging his extensive experience, Mark was instrumental in deploying CSCAs (Country Signing Certification Authorities) and signers in the UK, US, and Singapore. His ambitious vision also led to the development of the EAC (Extended Access Control) based PKI investment for 2nd generation ePassports, setting new standards in the European market.</p>
<p>As a result of Mark’s contributions, Entrust now provides the trust architecture for over 40 countries worldwide. In fact, approximately 50% of the ePassports in circulation feature the signed booklets from Entrust PKI, a testament to the trust and confidence placed in our technology.</p>
<p>Why Veterans Make a Great Fit for Our Company</p>
<p>We understand that the military instills exceptional qualities in individuals, including agility, empowerment, and a sense of urgency. These traits, combined with a “can-do” attitude and a passion for security, align perfectly with the opportunities available at Entrust.</p>
<p>In addition to appreciating the valuable skills veterans bring, we also recognize the importance of fostering capability and supporting individuals in realizing their ambitions. Our company culture emphasizes leadership development and personal growth, ensuring that each team member can contribute to our collective goals while fulfilling their own aspirations.</p>

<p>We live in an era of unprecedented technology breakthroughs and opportunities. Recent advances in areas like AI and quantum computing offer transformative potential for businesses, but may also bring new risks and security challenges. IBM is working to address these challenges and evolving threats by helping organizations support highly secure, resilient and durable storage through technology like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/cloud-object-storage">Cloud Object Storage</a>.</p>



 Securing sensitive data in an evolving landscape 



<p>Advancements like those in AI and quantum computing can pose new challenges to customers, especially those in highly regulated industries such as financial services, healthcare, telecommunications and more. As organizations look to keep up with these changes, they need a solution built to address the unique needs of their industry. Here is how IBM Cloud Object Storage supports clients’ goals and addresses these new challenges.</p>



 1. Embracing an industry framework for security and compliance 



<p>IBM Cloud Object Storage is a cloud service for storing large volumes of data. It provides security and data durability, complimented with immutable data retention and audit controls capabilities — ideal for supporting IBM Cloud’s objectives to support clients with their resiliency, security, compliance and performance goals. IBM Cloud Object Storage is built on the <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-about">IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services</a>, which was designed to help clients focus on their security and compliance postures. The framework was developed by leveraging the collective intelligence of the IBM Financial Services Cloud Council — a network of more than 140 financial services CIOs, CTOs and Risk and Compliance officers. Only ISVs and SaaS providers that are validated to be compatible with the framework are eligible to deliver offerings on the IBM Cloud for Financial Services. By meeting the requirements of the IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services, IBM Cloud Object Storage has been validated to be in alignment with IBM’s Cloud Framework.</p>



 2. Addressing the evolving regulatory landscape 



<p>In response to the evolving regulatory landscape, government agencies have imposed stringent requirements on data retention. IBM Cloud Object Storage supports data retention by making it truly immutable at the storage layer, safeguarding it from tampering or manipulation. This level of secured retention is not only helpful for banks and other financial institutions, but also can be foundational for cyber vaults and cyber recovery strategies for defending against advanced threats such as ransomware attacks and is broadly compatible with data protection ecosystems.</p>



 3. Supporting compliance and audit goals 



<p>Compliance and accountability are paramount in regulated industries. IBM Cloud Object Storage is a storage capability that is designed to help clients address their security and compliance needs. Examples of&nbsp;security capabilities include encryption and key management, granular access restrictions, activity and access logging, and continuous monitoring of these controls along with workloads using the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/security-and-compliance-center">IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center</a>. This platform is a suite of modernized cloud security and compliance solutions designed to help enterprises mitigate risk and protect data across their hybrid, multicloud environments and workloads.</p>



 4. Creating a space for AI 



<p>Organizations are beginning to realize the benefits of AI and implementing technology to support it. However, executing AI at scale can be a difficult process, especially when one considers the challenges with processing the data required for AI models. IBM Cloud Object Storage manages data files as highly resilient and durable objects. This type of data management makes it an ideal solution for enterprises to scale AI workloads.</p>



 5. Utilizing quantum-safe cryptography 



<p>It has become clear that this is the “<a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/403">quantum decade</a>,” when practical quantum computing solutions could impact computing strategies across industries. But it may also profoundly alter how we secure our digital data fabric through cryptography. We have seen organizations are already examining how to upgrade their cybersecurity to prepare for this new computational era of cryptographically relevant quantum computers. By utilizing quantum-safe algorithms that are available now, customers can help secure their data sent to IBM Cloud against threats such as harvesting encrypted data sent over Internet now to be decrypted later, when cryptographically relevant quantum computers are available.</p>



 A resilient future for your data 



<p>As Gregor Frimodt-Møller, Group CEO of Anycloud, recently said: </p>



<blockquote>
“Cyber data security in the digital age is indispensable for companies seeking to harness emerging technologies for innovation and a competitive advantage. In the absence of a robust data backup and protection strategy, businesses leave their valuable data vulnerable to cyber threats. The most effective defense against cyber data loss involves the implementation of a comprehensive and meticulous data protection and backup plan. To confront worldwide cyber threats, Anycloud solutions hosted on IBM Cloud seamlessly incorporates and utilizes IBM Cloud Object Storage for backup repositories, capitalizing on its features that address data protection, security, and scalability.” 
</blockquote>



<p>The combination of IBM Cloud and IBM Cloud Object Storage can help you keep your data secured. As technology continues to shape our world, IBM Cloud remains committed to providing state-of-the-art solutions that empower organizations to embrace innovation while safeguarding their most precious asset: data. We take our responsibility seriously to ensure that the advancements we are leading deliver on the promises we make while helping you navigate the evolving landscape of data security to ensure a resilient future for your critical information.</p>

<p>The supply chain plays a pivotal role in delivering goods and services to both businesses and consumers, serving as the connective thread between industries, nations, communities and all components of the value chain. Our dependence on supply chains is most pronounced in ensuring food supply. However, over the decades, the supply chain has grown longer and increasingly intricate, which means consumers may find themselves more distant from the origin of the products they consume.</p>



<p>Supply chains comprise multiple tiers and it is crucial for all stakeholders&nbsp;— including distributors and retailers — to make consumer safety a top priority. The FDA’s Food Modernization Safety Act (FSMA) has sparked a significant amount of discussion, and rightly so. Though the rule doesn’t go into effect until January 2026, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/ifoodds-and-ibm-forge-new-path-to-food-safety-with-ibm-food-trust/">companies must proactively and strategically prepare</a> their supply chain now, as this complex regulation will require companies to collect and maintain detailed information about the ingredients, processing and distribution of certain products. This process entails gathering new data, identifying existing challenges, and taking the necessary steps to ensure compliance. As a result, regulatory compliance is closer than it may initially appear.</p>



<p>This new rule is a part of a worldwide effort and call for increased traceability and transparency. Similar acts — such as the <a href="https://www.nsf.org/training/series/safe-food-canadians-regulations">Safe Food for Canadians Act</a>, the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/german-supply-chain-due-diligence-act-scdda-explained/">German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act</a>, the <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/trade/forced-labor/UFLPA">Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act</a> and <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-supply-chain-integrity/drug-supply-chain-security-act-dscsa">Drug Supply Chain Security Act</a> — call for greater safety for consumers, laborers and the environment.&nbsp;Companies can strategically take steps to achieve compliance, thereby unlocking added value. By capturing new data, they can harness this information not only to fulfill FSMA requirements but also to offer stakeholders and the public greater transparency.</p>



 The change, challenge and benefits are here 



<p>FDA FSMA&nbsp;will have significant <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/fda-voices/fda-food-safety-modernization-act-10-reflecting-our-progress-and-path-forward#:~:text=With%20each%20year%2C%20the%20FSMA,journey%20into%20a%20New%20Era.">global implications</a> for traceability. For the first time, the rule establishes additional recordkeeping requirements for any US-based entity that manufactures, processes, packs or holds foods on the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-safety-modernization-act-fsma/food-traceability-list">Food Traceability List</a>. This list includes 16 wide categories, such as all soft cheeses, nut butters, crustaceans, leafy greens and fresh-cut fruits.</p>



<p>Depending on the role a company plays in the value chain, they’ll be required to provide their partners with specific information, <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/163132/download">known as key data elements (KDEs)</a>, for certain critical tracking events (CTEs) in the food’s supply chain. This data will then be used to create a “traceability chain,” which can be used to quickly identify and remove contaminated food from the market. We saw this happen between Dole and Walmart in 2022 when a particular brand of lettuce—Ocean Mist Farms brand Romaine Hearts—had to be recalled. Being able to trace contaminated food from a grocery store to farmer and from that farmer to grocery stores, allows grocers to specify pulling from less shelves.</p>



<p>To achieve that outcome, the FDA FSMA comes with a bundle of new policies, procedures and penalties. For example, companies must maintain records for two years from the date created or obtained, and they must be ready to provide information to the FDA within 24 hours upon request. Failure to comply triggers a range of penalties, including court actions (such as seizure or injunction) and administrative actions (such as detention to gain control of adulterated or misbranded products, mandatory recall of violative food, or suspension of a facility’s food registration to prevent the shipment of food). However, it’s essential to recognize that fines aren’t the sole negative consequence of non-compliance.</p>



<p>Companies that intentionally and holistically incorporate FDA FSMA into their digitization efforts will get an edge over competitors who view the FDA FSMA as an isolated rule. With greater tracking and traceability, for example, comes real-time demand insight. When a customer is in the process of checking out at a grocery store, it provides real-time insights into the current demand for specific items. If the store can embed that data point back into its inventory management system, it will be able to better align supply and demand for individual items. Furthermore, companies that are doing ongoing product hierarchy work, like streamlining SKUs across their business, would be wise to think about how they could include this data traceability work at the same time, as doing the work in tandem could reduce costs significantly.</p>



 Leveraging FMSA to innovate beyond visibility 



<p>Regardless of your position within the food supply chain, there are three compelling reasons — aside from potential fines — that make intentional compliance a smart choice for your business:</p>



 
 Cost avoidance: Prevent seizure of goods, mitigate fines and fees from product recalls and grievances; avoid any financial penalties from regulations; avoid revenue loss from sustainability-focused scandals; and reduce the risk of a supply chain collapse or losing the license to operate. 



 Cost reduction: Reduce food waste from recalls by having full visibility and traceability for food items and lots; reduce inefficiencies and cost throughout the entire value chain with improved data management, tracking and reporting, including costs from energy use in owned and operated facilities, distribution costs via better predictability (hence less inventory and D2C), and empty miles and inefficient distribution routes. 



 Brand credibility: Increase market share with existing customers due to sustainable products; gain new customers from sustainable product branding; increase interest from ESG-conscious investors (62% of personal investors say their portfolios take environmental sustainability into account, up from 48% in 2021); and reduce talent lost due to lagging sustainability practices and branding. 
 



<p>The objective of the FDA FSMA is to safeguard consumers, enforce accountability within the private sector, establish uniformity across the value chain and promote collaboration. The global food supply chain is an interconnected and complex network that doesn’t always follow a linear path: while some companies are responsible for providing their data requirements, they may also rely on upstream parties for previous historical visibility. The more value chain parties can collaborate, the more power there might be in standards and acts such as FSMA.</p>



<p>The FDA FSMA will require companies to think deeply about their entire digitalization efforts. While 2026 may appear distant, when you consider S4 upgrades, evaluating a new ERP or data capture system, and the steps involved in integrating any new technology into the supply chain process, the sense of urgency becomes evident. Digitalization is not one-size-fits-all.</p>



 3 steps to position your company now for success in 2026 



 
 Gain a clear understanding of preparedness: Identify your current data capabilities and alignment requirements. 



 Create a compliance roadmap: Outline the necessary activities for compliance encompassing data, systems, processes and supplier collaboration. 



 Execute and set up reporting: Implement the system with the capability to monitor and measure through automated reporting (including tracking missing data and data health, as well as origin traceability). 
 



<p>Companies that approach this process intentionally will not only achieve compliance but also unlock additional value. They will be able to:</p>



 
 Utilize reporting to identify trends and risks within the product supply chain for mitigation and improvement. 



 Collaborate with supply chain partners to share sustainability and ESG metrics, leading to enhanced supplier performance and decarbonization. 



 Access analytics for product lifecycles for inventory management, distribution, freshness and cold chain. 
 



 Engage IBM Consulting to assist in infusing intentionality into your compliance strategy. 



<p>As the world takes note of more sustainable business operations and practices, how are you planning to prepare? How can this preparation become a part of your other transformation activities? How can you be intentional with your solutions? How can you leverage your existing resources today to gather data for tomorrow?</p>



<p>Collaborate with IBM Consulting to support your organization in preparing for this transformation in traceability. We assist businesses in taking a holistic approach, considering both the customer and supply chain aspects within the solution while examining the entire data landscape. We aid in addressing data gaps in a cost-effective manner, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. Our approach is more than just another end-to-end task; it’s about creating a comprehensive solution.</p>



<p>Although FSMA won’t come into effect until 2026, the right time to integrate compliance into your ongoing digitalization efforts is now.</p>

<p>For business leaders exploring ways to apply generative AI within their companies, it can be difficult to discern where to start, what will scale easily and what will deliver the greatest ROI. But the answer may be much simpler than it seems: automation. When AI is integrated into automation technology it’s referred to as “intelligent automation,” and it’s a high-impact way for businesses to put generative AI to work.</p>



<p>The IBM Institute for Business Value recently published its latest global study, “<a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/ai-and-automation">Seizing the AI and automation opportunity</a>,” an analysis of 2,000 interviews with executives from across industries, which reveals C-suite leaders are recognizing the operational, and ultimately financial, benefits of intelligent automation. According to the report, a stunning 92% of executives surveyed expect to digitize their organization’s workflows and leverage AI-powered automation by 2026.</p>



 Why automation?  



<p>As businesses undergo digital transformation efforts and integrate data and technology throughout their operations and processes, they create the opportunity to automate business initiatives — however small or large — such as administrative tasks, workflows, monitoring, and integration across platforms. At the same time, digital transformation also greatly increases the complexity of the technology systems, platforms and infrastructure businesses run on, so it’s no surprise that IT organizations have been at the forefront of automation. The study shows that executives expect automation rates in IT service management, DevSecOps and IT operations management to double or more over the next three years.</p>



<p>For example, once a company is far enough along in its digital transformation, its systems may be so complex — with so much data running through it so quickly — that it’s nearly impossible for engineers to monitor on their own. This is one area where automation isn’t just nice to have, it becomes a business imperative. The right automation tool can monitor enormous amounts of information faster than any human brain, and alert engineers to issues based on pre-set rules around energy use, storage capacity, cost and other business-critical factors.</p>



<p>Now, apply generative AI to the already impactful automation technology. With generative AI, it’s not just monitoring; it’s identifying and learning patterns. And it’s not just alerting engineers to a problem; it’s drafting reports about likely causes and suggesting solutions — all before the issue even occurs.</p>



<p>IT organizations may seem like an obvious place to observe an ROI on intelligent automation, given the overwhelming amount of data that’s produced at speeds impossible for the human brain to process in real time. But just as IT systems are becoming more complex, so are business units across organizations.</p>



 Empowering teams across the organization 



<p>So where else does the combination of generative AI and automation prove powerful? All departments and employees are now expected to process more information more quickly and manage more data across more, sometimes incompatible, tools and platforms. Automation can be just as useful to streamline processes and eliminate the drudgery of repetitive tasks for these teams as it is for IT, but there has been one important barrier — the non-technical teams don’t have the necessary engineering skills to program automations.</p>



<p>Now, apply generative AI to the automation tool so non-technical employees can use natural language to program what they want automated, and that barrier is broken. Many business leaders are thinking about how they can implement technology in the workplace to empower employees and unlock productivity. In fact, 54% of executives surveyed said they are evaluating roles of automation and AI in delivering new ways of working.</p>



 Capitalize on automation opportunities 



<p>Digital transformation is necessary for any business to survive in today’s competitive, rapidly evolving global economy. It may bring complexity, but it also creates the opportunity for automation and the application of generative AI. Business leaders who want to find ways to apply generative AI should start by looking where automation could make — or perhaps is already making — a marked impact in their organizations.</p>



<p>The study found that 8 out of 10 C-suite executives agree that the benefits of generative AI are worth the potential risks. When you discover the power of generative AI and automation, it’s easy to see why.</p>

<p>ICC DSI’s recently published <a href="https://www.dsi.iccwbo.org/_files/ugd/8e49a6_2d93b2f219cf404ab91bafd028e31fcc.pdf">Key Trade Documents and Data Elements</a> kicks off with this beautiful diagram:</p>Figure 1: ICC DSI’s beautiful diagram.<p>The diagram displays the data elements, many of which are duplicated, that belong to seven major global trade documents. The red and green circles at the bottom denote the trade parties responsible for exchanging the documents.</p><p>From a modern technology perspective, the top row screams Linked Data. The bottom part maps equally well to Verifiable Credentials’ digital signatures issuance and downstream verification.</p><p>We will explore this further based on this sample implementation:</p>Figure 2: Sample implementation: two issuers, carrier and seller respectively issue and present BL and PL to a shipper, which in turn presents both documents to&nbsp;customs. Actors <p>On the ICC DSI diagram, Packing Lists are exchanged from Seller/Exporter to Buyer/Importer. While true, this is not the full story; for example, Customs also require Packing List documentation.</p>Figure 3: The Three Party Model. Source: <a href="https://unece.org/sites/default/files/2023-08/WhitePaper_VerifiableCredentials-CrossBorderTrade_September2022.pdf">UN/CEFACT</a>.<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials data model</a> maps perfectly to how trade documents are actually passed through multiple parties along the supply chain. Throughout the entirety of the supply chain, data can be verified, cryptographically tying back to the original&nbsp;issuer.</p> Relationships <p>The top row of ICC DSI’s diagram lists numerous relationships, which can be broadly categorized as Collections, Repetition, and Relationships.</p> Document Pouches <p>Documents are often presented to the same actor at once, in a “pouch.” A pouch of documents is expected to be related in customs and trade finance use&nbsp;cases.</p>Figure 4: A data graph representing a Packing List and a Bill of Lading Verifiable Credentials, joined together as part of the same Document&nbsp;Pouch.<p>Above, two credentials are joined by the same <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability#workflow-instance">Workflow Instance</a>, explicitly indicating relation across multiple <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#presentations-0">Verifiable Presentations</a>.</p> Inter-Document References <p>Documents typically carry identifiers and reference each other. For example, a Commercial Invoice typically references a Purchase Order, usually with a Purchase Order number, which is unique to the two organizations’ business relationship.</p>Figure 5: Expanding data graph elements, illustrating common nodes and repeated data elements.<p>As you can see on figure 5, both the Packing List and the Bill of Lading references the same Unique Resource Identifier (the yellow&nbsp;node).</p><p>Note that the trade parties are also represented by the same green nodes, referenced from both documents. “Seller Inc.” is the Issuer, Seller and Ship From party on the Packing List, and the consignor on the Bill of Lading. This is because the documents reference URIs, in this case Decentralized Identifiers.</p> Repeating Elements <p>Non-identified values are usually just repeated on the documents where they are required. For example, a weight measurement is typically not identified (although it could be), so the values are repeated whenever required. For example, a shipment’s product Gross Weight is listed both the Packing List and the Commercial Invoice.</p><p>Also shown on figure 5, the goods weights and measurements are repeated on the Packing List and the Bill of Lading. Automating a consistency check to confirm that the documents represent the same shipment is trivial when the data comes with strong semantics in this&nbsp;way.</p> Conclusion <p>I wrote this article based on a quick implementation of ICC DSI’s model using prevalent, modern web technologies. This was quickly done using the open source for example these <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability#PackingListCredential">PL</a> and <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability#MultiModalBillOfLadingCredential">BL</a> schemas, and our Verifiable Data Platform for credentials management and constructing the corresponding <a href="https://platform.transmute.industries/marketplace/adapters/urn:transmute:adapter:neo4j">data&nbsp;graphs</a>.</p><p>The intention of this article has been to present a direction, from the ICC DSI model towards a scalable, interoperable implementation model.</p><p>Similarly, talking about Linked Data, Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers in the abstract can be rather alienating. But as we have seen, they address some very tangible elements of global trade, beautifully introduced by the ICC&nbsp;DSI.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@nis.jespersen">Nis Jespersen</a>, Transmute’s Solutions Architect, is editor of the United Nations CEFACT JSON-LD Web Vocabulary project and author of the W3C Traceability Vocabulary specification.</p><p>Connect with Nis on<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nis-jespersen/"> LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/nissimsan">Twitter</a>, &amp;&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/nissimsan">GitHub</a></p><p>Sign up for free on Transmute’s Verifiable Data Platform on <a href="https://platform.transmute.industries/">https://platform.transmute.industries</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/digital-trade-document-relationships-2f263b410e3">Digital Trade Document Relationships</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The holiday season is a time of gift-giving and therefore increased online shopping, which naturally increases the risk of cyber threats. As we shop for presents online, we expose our digital identities to potential risks. Cybercriminals are always looking for opportunities to exploit vulnerabilities and steal sensitive information. In this blog, I’ll provide essential tips for keeping your digital identity safe while holiday shopping.</p>
 Use Strong, Unique Passwords 
<p>One of the most basic yet crucial steps in safeguarding your digital identity is using strong, unique passwords for each online account. Avoid using easily guessable passwords like “123456” or “password”. Instead, create complex passwords that include a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters.</p>
<p>To manage these passwords and encourage the use of strong passwords, consider using a trusted password manager, which can generate and store them securely.</p>
 Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) 
<p>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) provides an extra layer of security for your online accounts. An example of this is Two-Factor Authentication which typically involves something you know (your password) and something you have (e.g. a code sent to your mobile device). The other option is something you are, which generally means biometric authentication – such as a fingerprint or facial recognition. Enabling MFA can significantly reduce the chances of unauthorised access to your accounts, even if someone obtains your password.</p>
 Shop from Secure Websites 
<p>When holiday shopping online, always make sure you are on a secure website before providing any personal or financial information. Look for “https://” in the URL and pay attention to trust badges or seals from reputable security providers. Be cautious when dealing with unfamiliar or suspicious websites. And remember, even familiar websites may be duplicated to phish your login details.</p>
 Avoid Public Wi-Fi 
<p>Public Wi-Fi networks may be convenient, but they are often not secure. Avoid making online purchases or accessing sensitive information while connected to public Wi-Fi. If you need to shop online while on the go, consider using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt your connection and add an extra layer of security.</p>
 Be Wary of Phishing Scams 
<p>Cybercriminals often use phishing scams to trick people into revealing sensitive information. Be cautious of unsolicited emails, text messages, or links, especially if they seem too good to be true. Never click on links or download attachments from unknown sources. Always verify the sender’s authenticity before sharing any personal data.</p>
 Monitor Your Accounts 
<p>Frequently monitor your bank and credit card statements for any unauthorised transactions. Set up account alerts to notify you of any unusual activity. The sooner you catch any fraudulent charges, the easier it is to resolve the issue and prevent further damage to your digital identity.</p>
 Keep Software Updated 
<p>Regularly update your operating system, web browsers, and antivirus software to patch any security vulnerabilities. Outdated software can be exploited by cybercriminals to gain access to your device or personal information.</p>
 Use a Protected Payment Method for Online Purchases 
<p>Protected payment methods offer better protection against fraudulent charges than standard debit cards, for example. When making online purchases, consider using a protected payment methods such as a credit cards or payment apps, especially with MFA setup, which reduces your risk of hackers being able to access your details and account.</p>
 Educate Yourself 
<p>Staying informed about the latest cybersecurity threats and best practices is essential. Educate yourself and your family members on the risks and preventive measures to ensure a safe online shopping experience.</p>
<p>Holiday shopping online offers convenience and access to a vast array of products, but it also exposes your digital identity to potential risks.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Marius Goeddert</a></p><p>In their constant quest for keeping organizations secure, cybersecurity professionals always need to look into the future in order to assess the likelihood of potential attacks. They need to combine their knowledge of the past and the present with their evaluation of the development of prominent attack vectors and come to a risk assessment for their work in the future.</p>
<p>In his discussion with our CEO Berthold Kerl, Jonathan Blanchard Smith, Director and Fellow at SAMI Consulting, suggests that “foresight consulting is explicitly not looking into the crystal ball”. Instead, when he and his team created the SAFIRE scenarios for the European Commission, they focused on the fact that there is not just one possible future but many. Hence, you need not only prepare for the future, but for several futures.</p>
<p>Tune in to Jonathan’s cyberfile today and take a glimpse into his two-part workshop on future scenario analysis which he will give at cyberevolution 2023 on Tuesday, November 14. Join us in Frankfurt or online.</p>
<p>Part one “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5650/1">Shaping the cybersecurity landscape of the future using the SAFIRE Scenarios</a>” deals with exploring the intricacies of future scenario analysis using the cutting-edge SAFIRE methodology and decoding the interplay of societal, technological, economic, environmental, and political factors that shape our digital future.</p>
<p>Part two “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5653/1">SAFIRE Scenarios – four Futures for the world (continued)</a>” is all about enriching your strategic thinking and scenario-building skills with the SAFIRE approach.</p>

<p>Fission is the lead organizer for IPFS Connect Istanbul. During the event, we are thrilled to be putting on our own workshop showcasing IPVM. </p><p>IPVM, or the InterPlanetary Virtual Machine, aims to be the easiest, fastest, most secure, and open way to run WebAssembly functions anywhere.</p><p>Using content-addressed data, public key infrastructure (PKI), and capabilities, IPVM liberates computation from its dependence on pre-negotiated services and paves the way for interoperability.</p><p>If you've been following our work at Fission, you'll note that IPVM has been our vision from day one. But we knew that before we could get to distributed compute, we had to build the auth and data layers first. Now that <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg">UCAN</a> and <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg/">WNFS</a> are done, we're ready to launch <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/">IPVM</a>. </p><p>The IPVM workshop will be the first-ever interactive workshop. You can get hands-on without having to go to the <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/homestar">repo</a>. Here are the details:</p><p>IPVM Workshop: Running WebAssembly Workflows with IPFS</p><p>November 16th, 1:30 - 3:30 PM</p><p>Join the Fission team in a live workshop about the InterPlanetary Virtual Machine (IPVM), an open protocol for decentralized computation.</p><p>We'll be walking through how to set up and install a Homestar node, an IPVM reference implementation written in Rust optimized for running WebAssembly (Wasm) functions in workflows. </p><p>Workshop participants should bring their laptops. We'll walk through the following experiences:</p>  Install a Homestar node  Connect to Homestar node peers in the workshop  Run example workflows  Share results of computation between local peers  Experiment with authoring your own workflows and functions   <p>Let's break each of these experiences down:</p><p>Install a Homestar node and connect to Homestar node peers - Homestar is Fission's Rust + Wasm implementation of IPVM. During the workshop, users will be able to install Homestar on their machines and connect to other Homestar nodes </p><p>Sneak Peak at the Homestar Mascot!</p>Homestar Mascot designed by Bruno Monteiro<p>Run Example Workflows - A workflow is a series of individual tasks (also known as a step function) wired together. In the IPVM Workshop, we will demonstrate a couple of workflows to showcase some of the capabilities of IPVM. </p><p>There will also be a control panel that will serve as the UI where the user can track their activity, view the receipts they are outputting, review pre-deployed WebAssembly tasks, and more.</p><p>Share results of computation between local peers - This is a fun one! One of the impressive features of IPVM is the more IPVM is used, the more efficient it is! That’s because every time a task is run, the output is saved in the network as a CID and is used in future computations. Think of it like global caching! The technical term for this is memoization. Homestar keeps a table (like a spreadsheet) of the ID for the function, its arguments, and its result. It allows the user to skip running the task and substitute the result. Just like IPFS's table that associates hashes to data to let anyone find and download the content, this does the same for function results. During the workshop, we will see this play out in real-time as we run computations and share those results with our fellow workshop attendees/node peers.</p><p>Experiment with authoring your own workflows and functions - Once attendees start getting comfortable with IPVM, they can begin to play with workflows, tweak parameters, and even bring their own Wasm functions.</p> <p>Who should attend this workshop?</p><p>IPVM is for Front End Web Developers</p><p>Anything you would normally need a backend for, IPVM can do for you. For example, IPVM can help you resize images. If you need to parse a large text document and it's too big to do locally on your machine, give it to IPVM. IPVM can pull data off of IPFS so you can operate on it and generate a new CID to pass around. You can even build map tiling. OpenStreetMap, for example, utilizes too much data for your phone or browser to work with, but you could parallelize that work across many machines and have them send you back the rendered map.</p><p>IPVM is an excellent serverless computing option. Whether you want to use the cloud, someone else's machine, your own machine, or a mix, IPVM is the solution you've been looking for.</p><p>IPVM is for Web3 Developers</p><p>Similar to a computation rollup, but instead of needing to be on-chain, it also extends off-chain. Imagine if you need to call something out in the real world, like Twitter, Bluesky, or an email server. You want to talk to external systems. </p><p>For example, say you want to take your NFT and make it gray-scaled. </p><p>Option 1: Do the image manipulation on-chain. The problem with this is the cost of gas would be prohibitively high. As in thousands and thousands of dollars. </p><p>Option 2: Run a server. This would work, but now you're no longer Web3 and paying money to a centralized cloud provider. </p><p>Option 3: IPVM. You get the benefits of decentralization, but the functions can run off-chain, saving you money and compute resources. </p><p>In the same way that IPFS saves developers from storing their NFTs on-chain, IPVM saves developers from having to run computations on-chain.</p><p>IPVM is for ETHGlobal Hackathon Participants</p><p>For those participating in the <a href="https://ethglobal.com/events/istanbul">ETHGlobal Istanbul Hackathon</a>, IPVM is a great tool to have in your toolkit. You'll probably do some computations locally, but if they slow your machine down, you can always push them to the hosted IPVM node to do the heavy lifting. Unlike centralized cloud platforms that require users to go through the network for everything, IPVM lets you choose where you want to do your computations, so you are always in control of how you allocate your resources.</p> <p>In conclusion, we're so excited for you to get your hands on Homestar. This is an early version for folks to experience and learn how decentralized compute with content addressing can work. Run it yourself and get ready to plug into a larger network of function writers and node providers. </p><p>Sign up for the IPVM Workshop by purchasing a ticket to <a href="https://istanbul2023.ipfsconnect.org/">IPFS Connect Istanbul</a> and <a href="https://forms.gle/kr5UedcVEcdnnYdi7">letting us know which of the workshops you'll be attending</a>, including options from our friends at Iroh and Web3 Storage + Saturn (you can attend all three!)</p><p> Can't make it to the event?

<p>Over the past decade, we’ve seen <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/serverless">serverless computing</a> take the cloud computing world by storm. Serverless is a cloud computing application development and execution model that enables developers to build and run application code without provisioning or managing servers or backend infrastructure.</p>



<p>When developers first started using serverless technology, they were mostly only using it for Function-as-a-Service, or FaaS. This was useful for event-driven functions, but it was very limited. Recently, we’ve seen serverless expand far beyond FaaS: there is a lot more value by using this technology for more large-scale, compute-intensive workloads. This can include supporting large container-based architectures or even running batch jobs at scale.</p>



<p>As we head into KubeCon 2023, we’ve identified several trends to watch around serverless. We’ve also asked our colleagues at MongoDB to weigh-in with their thoughts on this transformative technology.</p>



 Serverless is a developer-first technology 



<p>As the role of the developer continues to evolve to meet increasing demands, it’s crucial for organizations to adopt technology that simplifies and enhances the developer experience. Serverless is one of those technologies that is improving developer efficiency. Since serverless platforms often utilize pre-made integrations, developers can quickly utilize application functionality and accelerate market deployment. It’s allowing them to push new boundaries without hindering performance.</p>



<p>At IBM, we’ve built a single, unified serverless platform that is driven by developers who liked the idea of not managing servers, but also disliked working within the small space that FaaS supports. It also allows them to concentrate on coding by freeing up time that was spent managing the infrastructure. IBM Cloud Code Engine takes serverless to the next level. With IBM Cloud Code Engine, developers have a single deployment experience whether they’re running containers, building and deploying source code, or submitting larger batch workloads to the IBM Cloud with a common API and user experience, from one management dashboard, leveraging a simple pay per use consumption model.</p>



 Serverless can prevent vendor lock–in 



<p>IT professionals across industries have a desire for flexibility and adopting technology that don’t create vendor lock-ins. Recent IBM research found that nearly 80% of C-suite executives said workloads being completely portable with no vendor lock-in​ is important or extremely important to the success of their digital initiatives.</p>



<p>While some serverless technology is proprietary and creates vendor lock-in, recently there have been more serverless solutions built on open-source technologies such as Kubernetes, Istio, knative and Paketo. This means that the workloads running are more portable compared to the proprietary options. IBM believes that today’s organizations need to work with an ecosystem of partners to succeed, even if they’re competitors. Our partner ecosystem approach upends the traditional paradigm of competition, moving away from rivalries toward a more fluid and collaborative path to success. Through this lens, serverless can help put an end to complexities brought on by vendor lock-in.</p>



 Serverless supports compute intensive workloads 



<p>Enterprises today are rapidly adopting more compute intensive technology, such as High-Performance Computing (HPC) and AI. While these technologies can be incredibly valuable, the costs and skills associated with these solutions can prohibit adoption. For example, HPC users tend to have domain expertise — such as EDA, simulations, financial modeling — but they don’t have the skills to provision, manage and secure infrastructure. Serverless does all that for them. AI workloads need to come to the market quickly because of tremendous competitive pressures. They’re also usually very expensive, so businesses want an infrastructure that enables rapid enablement and pay-per-use models, which serverless achieves.</p>



<p>We also had Chris Shum, Director, Product Management, MongoDB weigh-in with his thoughts on where serverless is going:</p>



<blockquote>
“We’re seeing a paradigm shift where serverless is becoming a developer’s best friend for building modern applications. With databases being the backbone of applications it’s important that they too, embrace this shift to deliver a developer-first experience. At MongoDB, developer centricity is a cornerstone of who we are as a company and our mission is to make developers’ lives easier when working with data – so for us, embracing serverless is critical. Not only in ensuring our developer data platform, MongoDB Atlas, can be seamlessly integrated into serverless architectures but that the core tenets of serverless are also embedded into everything we offer. This enables developers to focus on what matters — building innovative applications rather than managing their database. Together with partners like IBM, we can give developers solutions to capitalize on the benefits of serverless with a modern, elastically scalable database alongside a fully managed containerized environment to run their code, so they can meet the demands of the most dynamic applications without being bogged down by infrastructure complexities.” 
</blockquote>

<p>For Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), compliance with the FATF Travel Rule isn’t just about adhering to regulations — it’s also a significant operational consideration that impacts the bottom&nbsp;line.</p><p>Travel Rule solutions come with a variety of pricing models, each with its distinct advantages and challenges. To simplify it, we have prepared this comprehensive guide that demystifies these models, providing VASPs with the insights needed to make informed decisions that balance cost with compliance.</p> Sign-up Fee + Annual Fee&nbsp;Model <p>In the sign-up fee plus annual fee model, VASPs pay an initial fee to gain access to the Travel Rule compliance service. After this initial payment, they are charged recurring annual fees that cover ongoing access to the service, including regular updates and customer&nbsp;support.</p><p>Sygna Bridge, for instance, follows this model. It requires VASPs to pay an upfront fee for integration into their network, followed by an annual fee that provides ongoing compliance support and secure information exchange capabilities.</p><p>Pros:</p>  Predictable annual budgeting due to fixed&nbsp;costs.  Continuous access to compliance updates and&nbsp;support.  Potentially lower costs for VASPs with high transaction volumes due to spreading the fee across numerous transactions.  <p>Cons:</p>  High initial sign-up costs can be a barrier to entry for smaller&nbsp;VASPs.  Annual fees apply regardless of actual usage, which may not be cost-effective during periods of low activity.  Less flexibility to scale costs with the business’s transactional demands.   Monthly Charge&nbsp;Model <p>The monthly charge model entails a regular monthly fee that covers the operational costs of the compliance solution. This cost often becomes more economical as more members join, thanks to shared expenses.</p><p>An example of this is TRUST by Coinbase, which allocates operational costs across its members on a monthly basis, with the cost per member potentially decreasing as more join the initiative.</p><p>Pros:</p>  Consistent monthly expenses make financial planning straightforward.  As more members join, individual costs can decrease due to shared operational expenses.  No large upfront payments are required.  <p>Cons:</p>  Costs may be relatively higher for smaller VASPs with fewer transactions.  Monthly fees accrue regardless of service usage, which can be inefficient for intermittent compliance needs.  Possible overpayment during slower business&nbsp;months.   Two-Tiered Pricing&nbsp;Model <p>A two-tiered pricing model offers a base service tier at a fixed cost and an advanced tier with more features, which may have customized pricing.</p><p>Notabene, for example, provides a ‘SafeTransact-Rise’ plan for basic compliance requirements and a ‘Full-Feature’ platform that caters to more complex needs, with specific pricing determined following a product demonstration.</p><p>Pros:</p>  Offers a choice between basic and advanced services to match different compliance needs.  Lower tier may provide an affordable entry point for smaller&nbsp;VASPs.  Higher tier can be customized, potentially offering a better fit for larger VASPs with complex&nbsp;needs.  <p>Cons:</p>  The basic tier may not be sufficient for all compliance requirements, leading to eventual upgrade&nbsp;costs.  Customization in the higher tier can be more expensive and time-consuming to negotiate.  VASPs may end up paying for unused features in the tiered structure.   Free Trial and Premium Plan&nbsp;Model <p>This model offers a complimentary trial period with fundamental service access, after which users can opt for premium plans that provide a wider range of services for a&nbsp;fee.</p><p>Sumsub exemplifies this model by giving VASPs a six-month free trial for their compliance services, after which there are options to upgrade to more comprehensive premium or enterprise plans.</p><p>Pros:</p>  Free trial period allows for testing the service without financial commitment.  Opportunity to evaluate the solution’s effectiveness before investing in a premium&nbsp;plan.  <p>Cons:</p>  After the trial, VASPs must commit to premium plans, which can be&nbsp;costly.  Transitioning from free to paid service may require budget reallocation.  Premium plans may include features that some VASPs don’t need but still pay&nbsp;for.   Membership Fee&nbsp;Model <p>With a membership fee model, organizations pay an annual fee based on the company’s size and type, which grants them access to the service network and its resources.</p><p>Open VASP, for example, uses this model where the fee structure varies based on the size and type of the company, catering to both VASPs and non-VASPs.</p><p>Pros:</p>  Annual membership provides clarity on yearly expenses.  Access to a network of compliance solutions and peers in the industry.  Fees can be tailored to company size, making it fairer for smaller organizations.  <p>Cons:</p>  Fees are due regardless of the level of service utilization.  Membership costs can be substantial, especially for larger&nbsp;VASPs.  Additional costs may arise for services not covered by the membership fee.   Pay-as-you-go Model <p>The pay-as-you-go approach is flexible and cost-efficient, particularly suitable for entities with fluctuating service needs, where they pay solely for the services utilized.</p><p>Veriscope is the only Travel Rule Solution that offers this model, allowing VASPs to pay in alignment with their transaction volumes, avoiding upfront costs, and ensuring the scalability of the compliance solution.</p><p>Pros:</p>  Ultimate flexibility with payments aligned to actual service&nbsp;usage.  Ideal for VASPs with fluctuating transaction volumes.  No upfront costs, allowing better cash flow management.  <p>Cons:</p>  Can become expensive, in general, if transaction volumes are consistently high.   Concluding Thoughts <p>The diverse pricing models of Travel Rule solutions, as we have explored, cater to the varied needs and capabilities of VASPs — ranging from startups to established financial institutions.</p><p>Each model presents a distinct approach to cost management, from the predictability of sign-up and annual fees to the flexibility of pay-as-you-go options, such as the one offered by Veriscope. This particular model is designed to adapt organically to the VASP’s activity levels, providing a cost-effective solution for those with fluctuating transaction volumes.</p><p>VASPs must weigh these options carefully, considering both short-term financial implications and long-term compliance strategies. Whether seeking a trial to test the waters, a simple membership to join a community of peers, or a comprehensive service plan for extensive transaction needs, the key lies in selecting a model that aligns with the organization’s transaction patterns, size, and growth trajectory.</p><p>Ultimately, the decision is a testament to a VASP’s commitment to not only meet the regulatory standards but to embrace the evolving digital asset landscape with a forward-thinking approach to compliance and operational excellence. The pay-as-you-go model exemplifies this commitment, offering an agile and scalable financial framework that stands as a testament to Veriscope’s understanding of the sector’s dynamic&nbsp;nature.</p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

  <p>We‘ve repeatedly emphasized the importance of multifactor authentication (MFA) and emphasized that not all MFA is equal – the Authenticator is much more secure than phone authentication (so hang up!). Through the implementation of number matching, we've successfully thwarted criminals engaging in MFA fatigue attacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this has been very effective, attackers attempting these methods can still annoy users, and Authenticator prompts—while extremely helpful when a user is trying to log in—can provide a “hook” for social phishing when triggered by a hacker. In response to this, we took additional steps to keep users happy and secure by suppressing Authenticator pop-up notifications when a request is anomalous. The rollout of these changes was completed at the end of September, and we’ve successfully reduced the number of otherwise unworthy notifications. We've prevented more than 6 million passwordless and MFA notifications since the deployment began. By the vast majority, these were hacker-initiated notifications serving no value to customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 About Suppressing Risky Authenticator Notifications&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the deployment of this feature, we now suppress Authenticator notifications when a request displays potential risks, such as when it originates from an unfamiliar location or is exhibiting other anomalies. This approach significantly reduces user inconvenience by eliminating irrelevant authentication prompts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;When everything looks acceptable, users receive notifications on their mobile devices as depicted below:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But in the event of a login request that looks risky to us, the standard notification will not be sent to the user. Instead, they’ll be given the following instructions: “Open your Authenticator app and enter the number shown to sign in,” with no corresponding notification displayed on the user's phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the user opens their Authenticator app, it will present the request, allowing the user to take appropriate action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the user opens the Authenticator App, the request will be available for the user:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Retrieving Authenticator Notifications&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s important to note that the notifications are not deleted. They’re simply suppressed and can still be accessed by the user within the Authenticator App. If a user encounters a genuine request from an unusual source, they can retrieve the notification by accessing their authenticator app. The app serves as a repository for all authenticator notifications, ensuring users have a convenient way to retrieve any missed requests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Implementation of this feature has led to a smoother and more secure experience for users. As technology evolves, enhancing user convenience while also enhancing security is crucial, and this <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-authenticator-app">new approach</a> is a great example.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/malware">Malware</a>, a portmanteau of “malicious software,” refers to any software, code, or computer program intentionally designed to cause harm to a computer system or its users. Virtually every modern <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cyber-attack">cyberattack</a> involves some type of malware. These harmful programs can range in severity from highly destructive and costly (<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/ransomware">ransomware</a>) to merely annoying, but otherwise innocuous (adware).</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sonicwall.com/2023-cyber-threat-report/">Every year</a>, there are billions of malware attacks on businesses and individuals. Malware can infect any type of device or operating system including Windows, Mac, iPhone, and Android.</p>



<p>Cybercriminals develop and use malware to:</p>



 
 Hold devices, data, or enterprise networks hostage for large sums of money 



 Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or digital assets 



 Steal login credentials, credit card numbers, intellectual property, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/pii">personally identifiable information</a> (PII) or other valuable information 



 Disrupt critical systems that businesses and government agencies rely on 
 



<p>While the words are often used interchangeably not all types of malware are necessarily viruses. Malware is the umbrella term describing numerous types of threats such as:</p>



<p>Viruses: A computer virus is defined as a malicious program that cannot replicate without human interaction, either through clicking a link, downloading an attachment, launching a specific application, or various other actions.</p>



<p>Worms: Essentially a self-replicating virus, worms don’t require human interaction to spread, tunneling deep into different computer systems and moving between devices.</p>



<p>Botnets: A network of infected computers under control of a single attacker known as the “bot-herder” working together in unison.</p>



<p>Ransomware: One of the most dangerous types of malware, ransomware attacks take control of critical computer systems or sensitive data, locking users out and requiring exorbitant ransoms in cryptocurrency like Bitcoin in exchange for regained access. Ransomware remains one of the most dangerous types of cyber threats today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Multi-extortion ransomware: As if ransomware attacks aren’t threatening enough, multi-extortion ransomware adds additional layers to either cause further damage or add extra pressure for victims to capitulate. In the case of double-extortion ransomware attacks, malware is used to not only encrypt the victim’s data but also exfiltrate sensitive files, such as customer information, which attackers then threaten to release publicly. Triple-extortion attacks go even further, with threats to disrupt critical systems or extend the destructive attack to a victim’s customers or contacts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Macro viruses: Macros are command series typically built into larger applications to quickly automate simple tasks. Macro viruses take advantage of programmatic macros by embedding malicious software into application files that will execute when the corresponding program is opened by the user.</p>



<p>Trojans: Named for the famous Trojan Horse, trojans disguise themselves as useful programs or hide within legitimate software to trick users into installing them.</p>



<p>Spyware: Common in digital espionage, spyware hides within an infected system to secretly gather sensitive information and transmit it back to an attacker.</p>



<p>Adware: Considered to be mostly harmless, adware is typically found bundled with free software and spams users with unwanted pop-ups or other ads. However, some adware might harvest personal data or redirect web browsers to malicious websites.</p>



<p>Rootkit: A type of malware package that allows hackers to gain privileged, administrator-level access to a computer’s operating system or other assets.&nbsp;</p>



 Milestones in malware&nbsp; 



<p>Due to the sheer volume and variety, a complete history of malware would be quite lengthy. Instead, here’s a look at a few infamous moments in the evolution of malware.</p>



 1966: Theoretical malware 



<p>As the very first modern computers were being built, pioneering mathematician and Manhattan Project contributor John von Neumann was developing the concept of a program that could reproduce and spread itself throughout a system. Published posthumously in 1966, his work, <a href="https://cba.mit.edu/events/03.11.ASE/docs/VonNeumann.pdf">Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata</a>, serves as the theoretical foundation for computer viruses.</p>



 1971: Creeper worm 



<p>Just five years after John von Neumann’s theoretical work was published, a programmer by the name of Bob Thomas created an experimental program called Creeper, designed to move between different computers on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">ARPANET</a>, a precursor to the modern Internet. His colleague Ray Tomlinson, considered to be the inventor of email, modified the Creeper program to not only move between computers, but to also copy itself from one to another. Thus the first computer worm was born.</p>



<p>Although Creeper is the first known example of a worm, it is not actually malware. As a proof of concept, Creeper wasn’t made with malicious intent and didn’t damage or disrupt the systems it infected, instead only displaying the whimsical message: “I’M THE CREEPER : CATCH ME IF YOU CAN.” Taking up his own challenge, in the following year Tomlinson also created Reaper, the first antivirus software designed to delete Creeper by similarly moving across the ARPANET.</p>



 1982: Elk Cloner virus 



<p>Developed by Rich Skrenta when he was just 15 years old, the Elk Cloner program was intended as a practical joke. As a member of his high school’s computer club, Skranta was known among his friends to alter the games and other software shared among club members—to the point that many members would refuse to accept a disk from the known prankster.</p>



<p>In an effort to alter the software of disks he couldn’t access directly, Skranta invented the first known virus for Apple computers. What we’d now call a boot sector virus, Elk Cloner spread by infecting the Apple DOS 3.3 operating system and once transferred from an infected floppy disk, would copy itself to the computer’s memory. When an uninfected disk was later inserted into the computer, Elk Cloner would copy itself to that disk, and quickly spread among most of Skranta’s friends. While deliberately malicious, Elk Cloner could inadvertently write over and erase some floppy disks. It also contained a poetic message that read:<br><br>ELK CLONER:</p>



<p>THE PROGRAM WITH A PERSONALITY</p>



<p>IT WILL GET ON ALL YOUR DISKS</p>



<p>IT WILL INFILTRATE YOUR CHIPS</p>



<p>YES IT’S CLONER!</p>



<p><br>IT WILL STICK TO YOU LIKE GLUE</p>



<p>IT WILL MODIFY RAM TOO</p>



<p>SEND IN THE CLONER!</p>



 1986: Brain virus 



<p>While the Creeper worm was able to move across computers on the ARPANET, prior to the widespread adoption of the Internet most malware was passed along over floppy disks like Elk Cloner. However, while the effects of Elk Cloner were contained to one small computer club, the Brain virus spread worldwide.</p>



<p>Created by Pakistani medical software distributors, and brothers, Amjad and Basit Farooq Alvi, Brain is considered to be the first virus for the IBM Personal Computer and was initially developed to prevent copyright infringement. The virus was intended to prevent users from using copied versions of their software. When installed, Brain would display a message prompting pirates to call the brothers to receive the vaccination. Underestimating just how widespread their piracy problem was, the Alvis received their first call from the United States, followed by many, many more from around the globe.</p>



 1988: Morris worm 



<p>The Morris worm is another malware precursor that was created not for malicious intent, but as a proof-of-concept. Unfortunately for the creator, MIT student Robert Morris, the worm proved to be much more effective than he had anticipated. At the time, only about 60,000 computers had access to the internet, mostly at universities and within the military. Designed to exploit a backdoor on Unix systems, and to stay hidden, the worm quickly spread, copying itself over and over again and infecting a full 10% of all networked computers.</p>



<p>Because the worm not only copied itself to other computers but also copied itself repeatedly on infected computers, it unintentionally ate up memory and brought multiple PCs to a grinding halt. As the world’s first widespread internet cyberattack, the incident caused damages that some estimates placed in the millions. For his part in it, Robert Morris was the first cybercriminal ever convicted of cyber fraud in the United States.&nbsp;</p>



 1999: Melissa worm 



<p>While not as damaging as the Morris worm, about a decade later Melissa showed how fast malware can spread by email, infesting an estimated one million email accounts and at least 100,000 workplace computers. The fastest spreading worm for its time, it caused major overloads on Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Exchange email servers resulting in slowdowns at more than 300 corporations and government agencies, including Microsoft, the Pentagon’s Computer Emergency Response Team, and roughly 250 additional organizations.</p>



 2000: ILOVEYOU virus&nbsp; 



<p>Necessity being the mother of invention, when 24-year-old Philippines resident Onel de Guzman found himself unable to afford dialup internet service he built a macro virus worm that would steal other people’s passwords, making ILOVEYOU the first significant piece of outright malware. The attack is an early example of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/social-engineering">social engineering</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/phishing">phishing</a>. De Guzman used psychology to prey on people’s curiosity and manipulate them into downloading malicious email attachments disguised as love letters. “I figured out that many people want a boyfriend, they want each other, they want love,” said de Guzman.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once infected, the worm did more than steal passwords, it also deleted files and caused millions in damages, even shutting down the United Kingdom’s Parliament’s computer system for a brief period. Although de Guzman was caught and arrested, all charges were dropped as he hadn’t actually broken any local laws.</p>



 2004: Mydoom worm 



<p>Similar to ILOVEYOU, the Mydoom worm also used email to self-replicate and infect systems around the world. Once taking root, Mydoom would hijack a victim’s computer to email out more copies of itself. Astonishingly effective, Mydoom spam once accounted for a full 25% of all emails sent worldwide, a record that’s never been broken, and ended up causing $35 billion in damages. Adjusted for inflation, it is still the most monetarily destructive piece of malware ever created.</p>



<p>Besides hijacking email programs to infect as many systems as possible, Mydoom also used infected computers to create a botnet and launch <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/ddos">distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks</a>. Despite its impact, the cybercriminals behind Mydoom have never been caught or even identified.&nbsp;</p>



 2007: Zeus virus 



<p>First identified in 2007, Zeus infected personal computers via phishing and drive-by-downloads and demonstrated the dangerous potential of a trojan-style virus that can deliver many different types of malicious software. In 2011, its source code and instruction manual leaked, providing valuable data for both cybersecurity professionals, as well as other hackers.</p>



 2013: CryptoLocker ransomware&nbsp; 



<p>One of the first instances of ransomware, CryptoLocker is known for its rapid spread and powerful (for its time) asymmetric encryption capabilities. Distributed through rogue botnets captured by the Zeus virus, CryptoLocker systematically encrypts data on infected PCs. If the infected PC is a client in a local network, such as a library or office, any shared resources are targeted first.</p>



<p>In order to regain access to these encrypted resources, the makers of CryptoLocker requested a ransom of two bitcoins, which at the time were valued at roughly $715 USD. Luckily, in 2014 the Department of Justice, working with international agencies, managed to seize control of the malicious botnet and decrypt the hostage data free of charge. Unluckily, the CyrptoLocker program is also spread through basic phishing attacks as well and remains a persistent threat.</p>



 2014: Emotet trojan 



<p>Once called the “king of malware” by Arne Schoenbohm, head of the German Office for Information Security, the Emotet trojan is a prime example of what’s known as polymorphic malware making it difficult for information security specialists to ever fully eradicate. Polymorphic malware works by slightly altering its own code every time it reproduces, creating not an exact copy, but a variant that’s just as dangerous. In fact, it’s more dangerous because polymorphic trojans are harder for anti-malware programs to identify and block.</p>



<p>Like the Zeus trojan, Emotet persists as a modular program used to deliver other forms of malware and is often shared through traditional phishing attacks.</p>



 2016: Mirai botnet&nbsp; 



<p>As computers continue to evolve, branching out from desktop, to laptops, to mobile devices, and a myriad of networked devices, so does malware. With the rise of the internet of things, smart IoT devices present a vast new wave of vulnerabilities. Created by college student Paras Jha, the Mirai botnet found and took over a massive number of mostly IoT-enabled CCTV cameras with weak security.</p>



<p>Initially designed to target gaming servers for DoS attacks, the Mirai botnet was even more powerful than Jha had anticipated. Setting its sights on a major DNS provider, it effectively cut off huge swathes of the United States’ eastern seaboard from the internet for nearly an entire day.</p>



 2017: Cyber espionage&nbsp; 



<p>Although malware had already played a part in cyber warfare for many years, 2017 was a banner year for state-sponsored cyberattacks and virtual espionage, beginning with a relatively unremarkable ransomware called Petya. Although dangerous, the Petya ransomware spread through phishing and was not particularly infectious until it was modified into the NotPetya wiper worm, a program that looked like ransomware, but destroyed user data even if ransom payments were sent. That same year saw the <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/articles/wannacry-worm-ransomware-changed-cybersecurity/">WannaCry ransomware</a> worm strike a number of high-profile targets in Europe, particularly in Britain’s National Health Service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NotPetya is believed to be tied to Russian intelligence, who may have modified the Petya virus to attack Ukraine, and WannaCry may be connected to similar adversarial sectors of the North Korean government. What do these two malware attacks have in common? Both were enabled by a Microsoft Windows exploit dubbed Eternalblue, which was first discovered by the National Security Agency. Although Microsoft eventually discovered and patched the exploit themselves, they criticized the NSA for not reporting it before hackers were able to capitalize on the vulnerability.</p>



 2019: Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) 



<p>In recent years, ransomware malware has both taken off and tapered off. Yet while the instances of successful ransomware attacks may be decreasing, hackers are targeting more high-profile targets and causing greater damages. Now, Ransomware-as-a-Service is a troubling trend that’s gained momentum in recent years. Offered on dark web marketplaces, RaaS provides a plug-and-play protocol in which professional hackers conduct ransomware attacks in exchange for a fee. While previous malware attacks required some degree of advanced technical skill, mercenary groups offering RaaS empower anyone with ill intent and money to spend.</p>



 2021: A state of emergency 



<p>The first high-profile double-extortion ransomware attack took place in 2019, when hackers infiltrated security staffing agency Allied Universal, simultaneously encrypting their data while threatening to release the stolen data online. This extra layer meant that even if Allied Universal had been able to decrypt their files, they’d still suffer a damaging data breach. While this attack was noteworthy, the 2021 Colonial Pipeline attack is more notorious for the severity of the implied threat. At the time the Colonial Pipeline was responsible for 45% of the eastern United States’ gasoline and jet fuel. The attack, which lasted for several days, impacted both the public and private sectors along the east coast, and prompted President Biden to declare a temporary state of emergency.</p>



 2022: A national emergency 



<p>Although ransomware attacks may appear to be declining, highly targeted and effective attacks continue to present a chilling threat. In 2022, Costa Rica suffered a <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/news/costa-rica-state-emergency-ransomware/">series of ransomware attacks</a>, first crippling the ministry of finance and impacting even civilian import/export businesses. A following attack then took the nation’s healthcare system offline, directly affecting potentially every citizen in the country. As a result, Costa Rica made history as the first country to declare a national state of emergency in response to a cyberattack.</p>

<p>In a tightening economy, small and medium businesses (SMBs) are challenged to grow while protecting thinning margins. Compared to large businesses, SMBs have fewer resources to help them weather an economic downturn or diversify into new value streams. As such, enterprises that serve SMBs must provide solutions that lessen administrative burdens and deliver tangible value. And with <a href="https://advocacy.sba.gov/2019/01/30/small-businesses-generate-44-percent-of-u-s-economic-activity/">SMBs representing 44% of the US GDP</a>, they cannot be ignored.</p>



<p>By adopting these 4 best practices to invest in the right technology and leverage the most recent advances in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/info/generative-ai">generative AI</a>, enterprises can unlock unique services for SMB customers.</p>



 1. Enterprises should create personalized experiences for SMBs based on qualitative and quantitative data 



<p>As SMBs become more cautious about their spending, the enterprises that serve them must drive value through increased personalization. Service providers need technology systems with a centralized customer journey log that can track interactions, sentiment and next steps across every touchpoint to deliver a seamless customer experience. However, this isolated qualitative customer information is not enough to serve a client’s needs. Generative AI tools like IBM <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai">watsonx.ai</a> can analyze high-level customer trends and market forces — as well as specific customer data and historical transactions — to recommend products that meet each SMB’s particular needs. Data-driven personalization is essential in today’s business environment. With <a href="https://www.forrester.com/blogs/transform-your-personalization-strategy-at-forresters-consumer-marking-forum/">89% of digital businesses investing in personalization</a> to enhance the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/digital-experience">customer digital experience</a>, those that fail to do so risk falling behind.</p>



 2. Enterprises must provide tailored support for SMBs as they adopt new products  



<p>Most SMBs do not have massive tech teams to support the adoption of new products and services. To ensure uptake of products, service providers must have the appropriate tech tools to help SMBs understand the value of these products and to help with testing and implementation. Generative AI can turn SMB needs into product use cases, and the appropriate tech systems can allow SMBs to test products in a sandbox. Furthermore, generative AI solutions such as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-code-assistant?utm_content=SRCWW&amp;p1=Search&amp;p4=43700076335928536&amp;p5=e&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwv-2pBhB-EiwAtsQZFP6WvN-4M1LK4tlNaOtrDrUM9jkqHl-2utYLpLJYTnMCHGh1fkkt9xoCd-4QAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">watsonx™ Code Assistant</a> can meet the core technical needs of enterprises. Watsonx Code Assistant can help enterprises achieve a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/ibm-consulting-watsonx-code-assistant">30% reduction in development effort or 30% productivity gain</a>, which allows them to more effectively and efficiently serve SMBs.</p>



 3. Enterprises should strategically align pricing models to the needs of SMBs 



<p>Usage-based pricing models or fixed time-based pricing models — such as monthly subscriptions or one-time payments — allow enterprises to meet the distinct needs of each SMB. With usage-based pricing of products, SMBs pay for only what they use. This method requires the enterprise to have clean data flows from central sources of truth to accurately track and reflect usage. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-data">Watsonx.data</a> allows enterprises to centrally gather, categorize and filter data from multiple sources. Through workload optimization, watsonx.data can reduce the cost of an enterprise’s data warehouse by up to 50%. Paired with IBM’s data consulting services, enterprises can leverage watsonx.data to track usage, generate dashboards and ultimately enable strategic decision making. Alternatively, fixed time-based pricing means SMBs pay a predetermined cost based on what they can afford, and they are able to make full use of the product or service within their purchase period.</p>



 4. Enterprises should offer a digital experience with increased self-service options 



<p>SMBs are lean operations with small workforces that optimize for efficiency. <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/winning-the-smb-tech-market-in-a-challenging-economy">Less than 15% of SMBs</a> want to interact with providers through phone and automated voice systems. To serve this demographic, enterprises must create end-to-end digital experiences from the point of research to post-purchase support. Self-service platforms make small tasks easy: for example, SMBs should be able to update their billing information and contact information without having to contact a provider representative. Conversational AI solutions can <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/ZGL0ZNBE">reduce call wait time by 30% and produce up to a 370% three-year ROI</a>. IBM watsonx Assistant can help address complex tasks by providing intelligent customer care across all touchpoints with an SMB, and it learns and improves automatically over time with every conversation.</p>



 Meeting the needs of SMBs also benefits service providers 



<p>If implemented correctly, these technologies can drive value for both SMBs and the enterprises that serve them. As the SMB grows and matures, the enterprise can meet the needs of the growing business via cross-selling of solutions. The SMB can stay with the same trusted enterprise for their operational solutions, and the enterprise can maximize the customer lifetime value from the SMB by providing solutions across the various stages of the SMB’s growth.</p>



<p>If an SMB is not looking to grow, the enterprise that serves it can still provide strategic solutions that help the SMB increase operational efficiency (such as generative AI for CRM, quicker close to sale, generated smart replies and self-service options).&nbsp;By providing powerful, capable generative AI solutions, enterprises can meet the specific needs of their SMB clients to help them succeed.</p>

<p>Enterprise businesses are continuing to move toward digitalized and cloud-based IT infrastructures. Digital systems enable unprecedented flexibility, scalability and speed when compared to their more traditional, on-premises counterparts.</p>



<p>However, digital infrastructures are highly dependent on application programming interfaces — or <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/api">APIs</a> — to facilitate data transfers between software applications and between applications and end users. As the backend framework for most web and mobile apps, APIs are internet-facing and therefore vulnerable to attacks. And since many APIs store and transfer sensitive data, they require robust security protocols and attentive monitoring practices to prevent information from falling into the wrong hands.</p>



 Explaining API security 



<p>API security refers to the set of practices and products an organization uses to prevent malicious attacks on, and misuse of, APIs. Given the complexity of API ecosystems, the growth of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/internet-of-things">IoT</a> platforms and the sheer volume of APIs organizations utilize (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/04/05/what-organizations-need-to-know-about-external-api-marketplaces-part-one/?sh=6a5d5ccd6438">about 20,000 on average</a>), getting a handle on API security is both increasingly challenging and increasingly necessary.</p>



<p>APIs sit between an organization’s IT resources and third-party software developers, and between IT resources and individuals, delivering data and information at process endpoints. It’s at these endpoints that company and user data is vulnerable to various types of attacks and security risks, including:</p>



 
 Authentication-based attacks: where hackers try to guess or steal user passwords or exploit weak authentication processes to gain access to API servers. 



 Man-in-the-middle attacks: where a bad actor steals or modifies data (e.g., login credentials or payment information) by intercepting requests and/or responses between the API. 



 Code injections/injection attacks: where the hacker transmits a harmful script (to insert false information, delete or reveal data, or disrupt app functionality) through an API request, exploiting weaknesses in the API interpreters that read and translate data. 



 Denial-of-service (DoS) attack: these attacks send scores of API requests to crash or slow down the server. DoS attacks can often come from multiple attackers simultaneously in what’s called a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. 



 Broken object level authorization (BOLA) attacks: occur when cybercriminals manipulate object identifiers at API endpoints to gain unauthorized access to user data. This issue arises when an API endpoint allows a user to access records they normally shouldn’t. BOLA attacks are especially common, because implementing proper object-level authorization checks can be difficult and time-consuming.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p>These and other types of cyberattacks are all but inevitable in today’s dynamic IT landscape. And with cybercriminals proliferating and gaining access to more sophisticated hacking technologies, implementing API security protocols will only become more crucial to enterprise data security.</p>



 API security best practices 



<p>APIs enable businesses to streamline cross-system integration and data sharing, but with this interconnectivity comes increased exposure to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cyber-attack">cyberattacks</a>. In fact, most mobile and web application hacks attack APIs to gain access to company or user data. Hacked or compromised APIs can lead to catastrophic <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-breach">data breaches</a> and service disruptions that put sensitive personal, financial and medical data at risk.</p>



<p>Fortunately, advancements in API security make it possible to prevent or mitigate the impact of cyberattacks by malicious actors. Here are 11 common API security practices and programs organizations can leverage to protect computing resources and user data:</p>



 
 API gateways. Installing an API gateway is one of the easiest ways to restrict API access. Gateways create a single entry point for all API requests, and act as a security layer by applying security policies, helping to standardize API interactions and offering features like request/response transformation, caching and logging.&nbsp; 



 Robust authentication and authorization. Using industry-standard authentication protocols — like OAuth 2.0, API keys, JWT, OpenID Connect and more — ensures that only authenticated users can access enterprise APIs. Also, implementing role-based access controls prevents users from accessing resources they aren’t authorized to use.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Encryption protocols. SSL connection or TLS encryption protocols — like HTTP Secure (HTTPS) — help teams secure communication between the API and client applications. HTTPS encrypts all network data transmissions, preventing unauthorized access and tampering. Encrypting data at rest, such as stored passwords, can further protect sensitive data while it’s in storage. 



 Web application firewalls (WAFs). WAFs provide an extra layer of protection for enterprise APIs, especially from common web app attacks like injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). WAF security software can analyze incoming API requests and block malicious traffic before it reaches the server. 



 Data validation. In the same way that people screen phone calls and avoid opening attachments from unknown senders, organizations should screen everything its servers accept and reject any large data or content transmissions (including those from consumers). Using XML or JSON schema validation and confirming parameters can also be helpful in preventing attacks. 



 Rate limiting. This protects resources against brute force and DoS attacks by restricting the number of requests a user or IP address can make in a certain amount of time. Rate limits ensure that requests are processed quickly, and that no user can overwhelm the system with harmful requests. 



 Security testing. Security testing requires developers to submit standard requests using an API client to assess the quality and correctness of system responses. Conducting regular API security tests — for example, penetration tests, injection tests, user authentication tests, parameter tampering tests and more — to identify and address vulnerabilities helps teams fix vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them. 



 API monitoring and patching. As with any software application or system, regular monitoring and maintenance are integral to maintaining API security. Keep a watchful eye for any unusual network activity and update APIs with the latest security patches, bug fixes and new features. Monitoring should also include awareness of and preparation for common API vulnerabilities, like those included on the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) top 10 list. 



 Auditing and logging. Keeping comprehensive, up-to-date audit logs — and reviewing them often — allows organizations to track all user data access and usage, and record every API request. Staying on top of API activity can be challenging, but implementing auditing and logging procedures can save time when teams need to retrace their steps following a data breach or lapse in compliance. And since they provide a record of normal network behavior, audit logs can also make it easier to spot anomalies. 



 Quotas and throttling. Like rate limiting, throttling restricts the number of requests your system receives. However, instead of operating at the user or client level, throttling works at the server/network level. Throttling limits and quotas protect the API’s backend system bandwidth by limiting the API to a certain number of calls or messages per second. Regardless of quotas, it’s important to assess the volume of system calls over time, as increased volume can indicate abuse and/or programming errors. 



 Versioning and documentation. Every new version of API software comes with security updates and bug fixes that shore up security gaps in earlier versions. And without proper documentation practices, users can accidentally deploy an outdated or vulnerable version of the API. Documentation should be thorough and consistent, including clearly stated input parameters, expected responses and security requirements. 
 



 AI and API security 



<p>Among existing API security measures, AI has emerged as a new — and potentially powerful — tool for fortifying APIs. For instance, companies can leverage AI for anomaly detection in API ecosystems. Once a team has established a baseline of normal API behavior, it can use AI to identify system deviations (like unusual access patterns or high-frequency requests), flag potential threats, and respond immediately to attacks.</p>



<p>AI technologies can also enable automated threat modeling. Using historical API data, AI can build threat models to predict vulnerabilities and threats before bad actors can exploit them. If an organization is dealing with a high volume of authentication-based attacks, it can use AI to install advanced user authentication methods (like biometric recognition), making it more difficult for attackers to gain unauthorized access.</p>



<p>Furthermore, AI-powered tools can automate API security testing protocols, identifying security gaps and risks more efficiently and effectively than manual testing. And as API ecosystems grow, so too can AI-based security protocols. AI enables businesses to monitor and secure many APIs simultaneously, making API security as scalable as the APIs themselves.</p>



 Stay on top of API security with IBM 



<p>The importance of API security cannot be overstated. As we move further into the age of digital transformation, reliance on APIs will only continue to grow, with security threats and bad actors evolving in kind. However, with API management tools like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/api-connect">IBM API Connect</a>, organizations can ensure their APIs are managed, secure, and compliant throughout their entire lifecycle.</p>



<p>Securing APIs will never be a one-time task; rather, businesses should see it as a continuous and dynamic process requiring vigilance, deftness and openness to new technologies and solutions. Using a combination of traditional API security practices, and newer AI-based approaches like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/noname-advanced-api-security">Noname Advanced API Security for IBM</a>, companies can ensure that IT resources remain as secure as possible, protecting both the consumer and the enterprise.</p>

<p>November 3, 2023 –Toronto, Canada –<a href="http://www.aftermathislands.com/"> </a><a href="http://www.liquidavatartechnologies.com">Liquid Avatar Technologies Inc.</a> (CSE:LQID / OTC:LQAVF / FRA:4T5) (“Liquid Avatar” or the “Company”) would like to provide the following update to its shareholders.</p>



<p>As part of its ongoing efforts to maximize available corporate resources, the Company continues to dedicate efforts to its Liquid Avatar Mobile App and Aftermath Islands Metaverse programs. However, given the difficult market conditions, changes in government’s dedicated efforts with digital identity, changing market demands for new fintech services including financial card products, and despite the continuing efforts of Management and the Board of Directors, the Company continues to find itself having difficulty meeting its required capital objectives to further its program development and execution.</p>



<p>On August 21, 2023, the Company announced that it had received a non-binding offer for its controlled subsidiary, Aftermath Islands Metaverse Limited (“Aftermath Islands”) and its Liquid Avatar Mobile App from a private Swiss based Metaverse and virtual experience organization.&nbsp; The offer was contingent on financing amounts and terms to be agreed between the Companies. The proposed buyer has been unsuccessful in its efforts to raise the requisite financing.&nbsp; The Company remains on cordial terms with the proposed buyer, but the non-binding offer has now expired, and it is not expected to be renewed at this time.</p>



<p>An ongoing result of these difficulties resulted in a cease trade order issued by the Ontario Securities Commission on May 5, 2023.&nbsp; The Company cannot raise capital directly into Liquid Avatar Technologies Inc. at this time due to both the cease trade order and its inability to file the Company’s financial statements for the year ended 2022 and its subsequent quarters. The Company anticipates upon raising capital that it will have sufficient resources to file the necessary statements to apply for the removal, in part, or in whole of the cease trade order.&nbsp; However, currently, the Company does not envisage, at least in the foreseeable short term, a revocation of the current cease trade order under the current circumstances.</p>



<p>On June 30, 2023, the Company filed Form 51-102F6V, Statement of Director and Named Executive Officer Compensation.&nbsp; This statement reflected the compensation earned by each member of management and outlined the outstanding unpaid compensation owed to each as of December 31, 2022.&nbsp; No compensation has been paid to management from the date of that filing and accrued compensation now dates back from April 1, 2022, for each member of management.&nbsp; Additional compensation has also been accrued and is outstanding to other employees, consultants, and vendors. Despite the Company’s inability to provide compensation, management, employees and select vendors have largely continued to support the Company’s efforts, including some members of management, on a priority basis, have provided limited loans to the Company for certain critical expenses, which are deemed a related party transaction.</p>



<p>The Company would like to report the resignation of the Chief Financial Officer, Craig McCannell, effective November 1, 2023.&nbsp; Mr. McCannell has offered to make himself available as time allows to support the Company in any future requests related to his former position and / or transition efforts, and we thank him for his years of service to the Company and wish him success in his future endeavors. Management intends to work with the Board of Directors, in due course, to create a selection committee for a new CFO.</p>



<p>“Even under these most difficulty circumstances, the team is working to resolve the current challenges that we are facing as an organization.&nbsp; Further, we believe that the public markets for small and micro-cap markets have greatly suffered under the current market conditions, which may include naked and short selling that has occurred across North America.&nbsp; It is the Company’s belief that it has been the victim of these manipulative trading practices, negatively impacting the Company and our shareholders.&nbsp; We believe that this process has greatly affected the Company’s share price contributing to the Company’s inability to raise the necessary funds to proceed with normal operations, including the regulatory requirements for the Company’s listing on the CSE and compensating its management, employees, and other partners.&nbsp; However, we remain resolved, to the best of our ability, to work to right the ship and continue to move forward,” said David Lucatch, CEO Liquid Avatar Technologies. </p>



<p>The Company continues to dedicate efforts to Aftermath Islands and its complementary programs including Lost Kingdom of T’Sara (LKoT), its play to earn (P2E) platform.&nbsp; In its first year, LKoT users generated over 9.2 million Resource Pack NFTs.&nbsp; The Aftermath Islands metaverse platform has continued to operate in Beta having achieved approximately US$3 Million in gross sales, and subject to further funding by Aftermath Islands, the Company expects Aftermath Islands to continue to develop the platform.</p>



<p>As part of the AIM Creator program (originally Meta Hero Project) Meta Karaoke, an online AI powered Avatar performance platform, was acquired by Aftermath Islands Metaverse Limited, as originally announced on August 3, 2022, from Pegasus (Gibraltar) Limited, a related party of the Company.&nbsp; Further to this agreement, given the current economic and changing market conditions, Aftermath Islands has not fulfilled its agreed upon obligations to pay the appropriate fees for program sales under the terms of the agreement as well as to continue to fund the further development of the program.&nbsp; &nbsp;The parties have agreed that rather than terminating the agreement, the matter will be settled by transferring back up to 80% ownership of the Meta Karaoke program, which is currently in a development stage, to Pegasus (Gibraltar) Limited.&nbsp; Aftermath Islands Metaverse Limited and Oasis Digital Studios will retain a combined initial minority equity interest in the new entity of approximately 20%.&nbsp; Pursuant to Multilateral Instrument 61-101 Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (“MI 61-101”), the transfer back to Pegasus (Gibraltar) Limited constitutes a “related party transaction”.&nbsp; The Company is relying on exemptions from the formal valuation and minority approval requirements of MI 61-101, specifically: (i) the valuation requirement of MI 61-101 by virtue of the exemption contained in Section 5.5(b), as the Company’s Common Shares are not listed on a market specified in MI 61-101, and (ii) the minority shareholder approval requirement of MI 61-101 by virtue of the exemption contained in Section 5.7(1)(a) of MI 61-101, as the fair market value of the assets being transferred back do not exceed 25% of the Company’s market capitalization (as determined under MI 61-101).&nbsp; A material change report will not be filed by the Company as the transfer does not constitute a material change.</p>

<p>I'm pleased to announce that we're helping organizations to more easily manage this situation by creating a new ID Governance license for business guests. This license will operate on a monthly active usage (MAU) model. Customers will be able to acquire licenses matching their anticipated business guest MAU.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help our customers expand least privilege access to their business guests, ID Governance for business guest licenses will be priced at $0.75 per MAU, and we anticipate making them available in spring 2024. In the interim, organizations that govern the identities of their employees with ID Governance can govern the identities of their business guests for no additional cost.&nbsp;Existing Azure AD External ID customers are grandfathered to continue using the subset of identity governance features that are included in Entra ID P1 and P2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why govern the identities of business guests?&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Business guests are external collaborators who need access to an organization’s resources and applications for a specific purpose and duration. Examples of business guests include contractors, consultants, vendors, or partners. Business guests pose unique challenges for identity governance, as they often have dynamic and unpredictable access needs, and they may not follow internal policies and standards. Without proper governance, business guests can introduce access risks, such as over-privileged accounts, orphaned accounts, or unauthorized access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra ID Governance helps address these challenges by enabling you to:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Define and enforce access policies for business guests, such as requiring sponsorship, approval, and attestation.&nbsp; 
 Automate the provisioning and deprovisioning of business guest accounts, based on their project or contract duration.&nbsp; 
 Monitor and audit the access activities and behaviors of business guests and detect and remediate any anomalies or violations.&nbsp; 
 Provide a method for internal sponsors to review and approve their requests.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this step, our customers can ensure that all identities in their organization are governed.&nbsp;Thank you for partnering with us to help protect your digital estates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This challenge was set to provide insights into a pressing geographic location in Africa, Marsabit, Kenya. The ecological well-being of Marsabit has hung in a delicate equilibrium in recent&nbsp;years.</p><p>Climate fluctuations and human undertakings sway the volatility of the general climate in Marsabit, Kenya. This challenge was designed to challenge participants in making accurate, dependable forecasts that could have a profound impact on risk mitigation, insurance pricing, and crop prediction in the region. Data scientists participating in this challenge had the potential to steer the adoption of sustainable practices within the region, as well as have their model and insights shared with decision-makers tackling this&nbsp;issue.</p><p>Ocean was fortunate to host this data challenge in collaboration with <a href="https://shamba.network/">Shamba Network</a>, a leader in monitoring and reporting verification leveraging blockchain technology. Shamba fueled this competition with relevant data sets to conduct our assessment. The data sets provided included:</p>  eVIIRS-NDVI Historical data  Dynamic GeoAPI&nbsp;data  geoJSON coordinates of Marsabit county in&nbsp;Kenya  <p>We received a basket of in-depth reports about this subject. After thorough grading and review by an evaluation committee of experts, we awarded three winners to be compensated for their efforts. The winning reports are as&nbsp;follows:</p> 1st place — Nicolas Landry ($2500&nbsp;prize) <p>Nicolas’ report is available to download via the Ocean Market here: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:61a0bef8cb43e1745435aa0981204da96ad24e7243123f085407dab2c35a6e59">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:61a0bef8cb43e1745435aa0981204da96ad24e7243123f085407dab2c35a6e59</a></p><p>A highlight of this report is Nicolas’ fantastic demonstration of walking readers through the NDVI historical data. As&nbsp;follows:</p><p>“This is in the form of 808&nbsp;.tif images. Each contains 912 by 882 pixels, which have a value between 0 and 255, corresponding to the NDVI value at each&nbsp;point.</p><p>The file name gives us an indication of the year the data is from; for example, ea1207_COG.tif is the 7th&nbsp;.tif picture of 2012. We have the tif starting from this one, ea1207_COG, to ea2316_COG, and then six of them are in the form ea2317m_COG and seem to be negatives/acquired through another&nbsp;process.</p><p>Except for 2012, which starts at 07, and 2023, which stops at 16 or 23m, for each year, we have 72&nbsp;.tif pictures that contain the NDVI value on each&nbsp;point.</p><p>From this 0 to 255 pixel value, it is easy to get the NDVI value at this&nbsp;point.</p><p>You want first to convert the pixel values of each&nbsp;.tif file using the&nbsp;formula:</p><p>NDVI = Pixel value-100100</p><p>The dynamic GeoAPI data asset (for the last 1 month, with 10 days lag) of eVIIRS-NDVI for Marsabit county of Kenya (updated).”</p><p>Nicolas had the highest accuracy metrics overall, which indicated the model created in this report was the best fit. However, one thing that stood out to the scoring committee from a qualitative point of view is that Nicolas’ model only predicted 5 days in advance (i.e., one data point since the data has a 5-day granularity.)</p><p>For this and a stellar presentation layout, Nicolas has been awarded 1st place for this data challenge.</p> 2nd place — Andrey Bessalov ($1500&nbsp;Prize) <p>This report is available to download via the Ocean Market here: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:0273191bae5ef3b7ba71909abfbec8dc453b551e5c22ac1d8aa5185339e43540">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:0273191bae5ef3b7ba71909abfbec8dc453b551e5c22ac1d8aa5185339e43540</a></p><p>Andrey’s model predicted a season in advance, differentiating this report from other contestants. This seasonal prediction is longer term, hence more useful for taking action (e.g., providing anticipatory aid). So, Andrey’s model had lower accuracy than the winning report (MAE of 0.027 vs. 0.01), but it’s more useful given its longer time&nbsp;horizon.</p><p>Andrey’s preprocessing of the data for time series analysis, particularly testing and handling of stationarity, was a more rigorous approach relative to other reports submitted in this challenge. This could be down to the fact that Andrey used SARIMA while other podium finishing reports used linear regression, and the latter model is not as affected by stationarity in the data as the&nbsp;former.</p><p>Pulled from Andrey’s report, the image below shows the average NDVI values with the addition of peak points highlighted as green and orange (max and min), calculated using the scipy.signal.find_peaks() function.</p><p>We see a clear seasonal structure of the graph with different amplitudes of fluctuations. We can also see that the frequency of fluctuations varies slightly from season to season, but in general, the spread of these values is&nbsp;small.</p><p>We have two seasons per&nbsp;year:</p><p>First season (average estimations):</p>  Starts on Feb&nbsp;25  Reaches peak value on May 12 (76 days&nbsp;later)  Ends on Aug 22 (178 days&nbsp;later)  <p>Second season (average estimations):</p>  Starts on Aug&nbsp;22  Reaches peak value on Nov 29 (99 days&nbsp;later)  Ends on Feb 25 (187 days&nbsp;later)  <p>Andrey used more sophisticated models (SARIMA and XGBOOST), while alternative reports only used regression models. While sophisticated models are only sometimes better than simpler ones, our scoring committee thought Andrey explored models more commonly used in time series modeling. This report was also able to show the difference in performance between the two different types of models and thus had a more comprehensive analytical process. Based on these highlights, second place has been awarded to Andrey’s&nbsp;report.</p> 3rd place — Mint ($1000&nbsp;Prize) <p>This report is available to download via the Ocean Market here: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:d05ca461ac6300e86221c2edf588e0eed447a909ff72dd92040175932aab55b4">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:d05ca461ac6300e86221c2edf588e0eed447a909ff72dd92040175932aab55b4</a></p><p>Mint was awarded a 3rd place finish amongst the participants in this data challenge. Mint’s report provided great detail and insights into the transformation &amp; feature creation portion of this challenge. The two-legged task of data transformation and feature creation included the following scoring sections:</p>  Transformation &amp; Imputation: Address any missing values, outliers, or skewed distributions in the dataset. Justify your chosen methodologies.  Feature Creation: Generate new features that enhance the model’s predictive capability. This could include calculating rolling averages, seasonality components, or other relevant&nbsp;metrics.  <p>To showcase this terrific showcase of data science skills, we can see below from Mint’s report that details Time-Related Feature Engineering:</p><p>In the realm of time-related feature engineering, the goal is often to encapsulate the inherent cycles and periodicities within the data. However, simply throwing raw Ordinal time-related features in the mix is unlikely to yield optimal results. Why? Because These raw features do not inherently understand the cyclical nature of time. For example, a raw month feature would treat December and January as vastly different, not recognizing the seamless transition between the end of one year and the start of the&nbsp;next.</p><p>The image above shows&nbsp;us:</p><p>● Ordinal Features: The chart highlights the limitations of using raw ordinal time-related features, which fail to capture the cyclical nature of time. For example, the transition from December to January appears as a discontinuity.</p><p>● Trigonometric Features: Sine and cosine transformations are depicted to capture the cyclic behavior of time, peaking, and troughing in line with natural cycles. However, they may not capture month-specific nuances effectively.</p><p>● Periodic Spline-Based Features: The graph illustrates the power of using splines, which allow the model to focus on specific months. Using the “periodic” extrapolation parameter ensures a smooth transition between December and January, effectively tackling the discontinuity issue.</p><p>Mint’s ability to visualize the data provided, offer insights &amp; takeaways from the issue, and present these findings in business-ready format were key characteristics that awarded this report a podium&nbsp;finish.</p> Summary <p>This challenge showed a great experiment testing machine learning tactics applied to a real-world issue &amp; a changing&nbsp;climate.</p><p>Can other regions globally benefit from predictive analytics from a data challenge with Ocean Protocol?</p><p>Reach out to us in our discord <a href="https://discord.gg/yFRPH9PCN4">#data-science-hub</a> channel: <a href="https://discord.gg/yFRPH9PCN4">https://discord.gg/yFRPH9PCN4</a></p><p>To see past, current, and future data challenges sponsored by Ocean, please visit <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/earn/data-challenges">https://oceanprotocol.com/earn/data-challenges</a>.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Jürgen Schulze</a></p><p>The side effects of (re)generative AI impacting cyber security</p>
<p>Professionally paranoids can't but look at ChatGPT and its siblings from a risk perspective. Well, at least initially. We tend to think in risk vectors, threat actors and alike. Leaving all innovative benefits of the technology aside, there are sensitive elements that require attention. This is how we currently deal with this kind of innovation: Impulse driven …</p>
<p>In a first "impulse", we try to fit what we see into the simple equation where risk equals probability times damage. As a result, we get nervous as, looking at ChatGPT and its siblings, we can do the math neither on probability nor on the potential damage that the use of this technology could bear for us. The deeper we drill, the more questions we get. Scientifically sound answers drip through the tickers only at a slow pace since many of those require research time prior to assessing the effects. And that does not happen over night.</p>
<p>In a second "impulse", we focus on the obvious: the elements, that we are familiar with and which resonate the most in public perception. I.e. those clickbaits which constantly make headlines. This can be the result of a first, publicly prominent traumatic experience in adopting a new technology. It can also be intelligent marketing where our expectations are repetitively framed in order to overshadow those risks, that are not within the "cozy" technology coloured framework of the cyber community.</p>
<p>In a third "impulse", we call for regulation and put the responsibility on the shoulders of the lawmakers as we're lacking all means of dealing with what we can't combat in the very moment. Interestingly enough, that typically does not lead to short term solutions but to a reputation disaster of the cyber community where the classic perception of us hindering innovation is taking over the public discourse. Regulation, on top, is perceived as evil. Even more than the targets of the regulatory efforts. Whoever they are.</p>
<p>In a fourth "impulse", and in absence of any progress in dealing with the tangible and intangible risks, we'll blame what will inevitably go wrong, to those who are putting this new technology to the practice and, in absence of protective measures, awareness and training, unavoidably hit wrong buttons on the way. I call that the "Lieschen Mueller-effect". The blame goes to the weakest link in the chain.</p>
<p>After all those impulses, we'll realize that we wasted time, efforts and money fighting the genie who is irreversibly out of the bottle rather than understanding the various risk factors, what they entail, their interdependence and which experts to consult, in dealing with those and, ultimately, mitigating their impact.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5394">In our workshop</a>, I'll share with you some of my findings of my book and invite you to jointly revisit a selection of those factors that detrimentally impact our cyber security infrastructure such as:&nbsp;Trust, Credibility, Identity, Authenticity, Context, Value, Bias, Control, Intellectual Property, Confidentiality, Convenience, Liability, Ethics, Integrity.</p>
<p>We'll go beyond the obvious and get a better understanding on how to consciously and responsibly put new technology to action. All of that while increasing the security awareness around the use of (re)gen AI.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>I recently had the privilege to spend some time with Kumar and Pallavi to dive into the heart of the <a href="https://www.bhutanndi.com/">Bhutan National Digital Identity (NDI)</a> Project, a pioneering initiative that stands as a testament to Bhutan’s leadership in digital trust.</p>
<p>The origins of Bhutan’s digital program were particularly fascinating for two primary reasons. Firstly, it stemmed from the necessity to empower citizens, especially those in rural areas, with access to essential financial and governmental services. A question of citizen empowerment.. Secondly, the Bhutanese leadership consciously prioritized privacy as a fundamental right for its people. What stands out in this narrative is the clear identification of needs that were not dictated by a technology-first approach. Instead, it was the requirements of empowerment and privacy that naturally led to the adoption of a digital solution, encompassing digital wallets and credentials within privacy-centric frameworks.</p>
<p>This project is not just a technological leap forward but a holistic approach that intertwines the legal, business, and technological threads to weave a robust digital identity framework. I chose to approach our discussion through the lenses of business, legal, and technology, with a deliberate focus on legal aspects first. Why? Because the legal framework is the bedrock upon which the entire edifice of digital identity is built. It’s the underpinning that ensures the rights, privacy, and trust of citizens are not just considered but enshrined.</p>
<p>From there, we transitioned to the business perspective—how this digital identity initiative could catalyze growth, inclusion, and opportunity for all stakeholders. And finally, we touched on technology, the enabler, yet intentionally saved for last. In the grand scheme of things, technology is the tool, not the master; it’s the least important aspect when it comes to the values and impact on the citizens’ lives.</p>
 
 
<p>—</p>
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Kumar, Pallavi and myself in this podcast include:<br>
<br><br>
</p> 
 
 
 
 Background on the Bhutan National Digital Identity (NDI) Project&nbsp; 
<p>Project Goals and Context – What were the overall goals of the Bhutan NDI project, and how do they relate to the specific context and needs of Bhutan? Seeking to understand the project’s objectives and their alignment with the country’s unique circumstances, particularly in terms of accessibility for rural populations.</p>
<p>Financial Inclusion and Digital Identity – How does focusing on financial inclusion as a starting point influence the approach to digital identity in Bhutan? Exploring the decision to prioritize financial inclusion and how this focus shaped the development of the digital identity solution.</p>
<p>Decentralized Architecture Decision – What research and considerations led to the choice of a decentralized architecture for Bhutan’s digital identity program? Delving into the rationale behind opting for a decentralized system over centralized models like Singapore’s SingPass.</p>
 The Legal Lens 
<p>Legal Framework and Privacy – How is privacy integrated into Bhutan’s legislation, and what legal adjustments were made to accommodate digital identity? Discussing the legal groundwork that enables digital identity in Bhutan and the importance of privacy in this context.</p>
<p>Legislative Process Duration and Challenges – What was the timeline and were there any significant challenges in developing the National Digital Identity Act? Understanding the duration and obstacles encountered while establishing the legal framework for the digital identity system.</p>
<p>Governance and Public-Private Partnership – What does the governance body for the NDI look like, and how does the public-private partnership model function? Examining the structure and evolution of the governance body overseeing the NDI and the role of public-private collaboration.</p>
 The Business&nbsp; Lens 
<p>Business Strategy and Ecosystem Growth – How were use cases developed, and what strategies were employed to grow the ecosystem and foster public-private partnerships? Investigating the process of identifying use cases and the methods used to expand the digital identity ecosystem through stakeholder engagement.</p>

<p>Small businesses face special challenges in managing their employee onboarding and offboarding processes with limited resources. Without a fully staffed IT or HR department, there’s often just one person covering “operations” for the whole organization. And in some companies, someone with a totally unrelated job ends up running these functions.</p>
<p>We’re like that, actually. <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/why-are-we-giving-yeshid-onboard-away-for-free/">As a startup</a>, YeshID has a small staff. In addition to my founder duties, I’m the one to handle IT employee onboarding and offboarding for our team. And that’s the way we want it for now — we’re keeping overhead low so we can concentrate on building the best product. But that doesn’t mean we want to skimp on laying a good foundation for tomorrow.</p>
<p>In a situation like this, efficiency and simplicity are so important. It’s not just about <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/a-non-technical-guide-how-to-streamline-employee-onboarding-in-google-workspace/">providing an email address for new employees</a>. You have to add them to the correct organizations and groups in your Google Workspace; keep track of who has permissions for what applications; track the number and cost of app and software licenses, keep up with which teams own which services, and the list goes on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technology can help you streamline, templatize, and automate your user onboarding and offboarding procedures. In this post, I’ll talk about what to look for in a tool.</p>
 User-friendly IT onboarding and offboarding 
<p>The first thing you should consider when evaluating an onboarding solution is its user-friendliness. You need a tool that is easy for both administrators (aka you) and users to navigate. The last thing you want on your already overloaded calendar is extensive training for a complicated system. Look for a solution with an intuitive interface and a straightforward setup process.</p>
<p>One of the most significant advantages of a user-friendly onboarding solution is its ability to templatize and automate repetitive tasks. Look for a solution that offers customizable templates, task assignments, and email notifications. This not only saves time but also minimizes the chances of errors. You’ll also want to make sure the tool lets your employees request access to the apps they need — and that access is routed to the appropriate approver.</p>
 A secure and compliant employee onboarding and offboarding tool 
<p>Handling third-party data can be scary and requires robust security measures. Your onboarding solution should comply with data protection regulations and keep your data safe. Look for features like passwordless encryption and access controls to protect sensitive information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Different industries have specific compliance and regulatory requirements that must be met during onboarding and offboarding. Ensure that the onboarding solution aligns with these requirements. Ideally, you should be able to track provisioning/deprovisioning in a single dashboard to offboard a user with confidence while maintaining compliance and reducing license costs.</p>
 New employee onboarding and offboarding that grows with you 
<p>Your business may be small today, but tomorrow’s looking bright! Consider whether the onboarding solution can grow with you. It should be able to accommodate a growing number of users without significant disruptions. Scalability ensures that you won’t outgrow your onboarding tool as your business expands. And with the right tools, you can actually set yourself up for success by <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/tips-for-building-effective-iam-processes-at-your-startup/">creating good processes from the beginning</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://yeshid.com/post/the-history-of-sso-and-why-its-time-for-a-change/">Beware the SSO tax</a> on this one though. Some access management solutions require you to advance your engineering practices far beyond what most small- to medium-sized businesses need. Don’t settle for a solution that requires you to jump over unnecessary hurdles.&nbsp;</p>
 Cost-effective IT onboarding solutions 
<p>Until someone invents the money tree, it’s essential to consider the overall cost of the tool in relation to the value it provides. This includes licensing fees, implementation costs, and ongoing maintenance. Make sure you’re getting the features and support you need without breaking your budget. A cost-effective solution should offer a good balance between functionality and affordability.</p>
<p>The flip side of this one is to make sure you’re not signing up for a solution that you’ll have to grow into fast. Many of the options in this space are overkill. They are expensive and time-consuming to implement — especially when what you really need is just to get people to work using solid best practices, not advanced technology.&nbsp;</p>
 The best onboarding and offboarding for small businesses 
<p>Identity and access management in the 21st century means digital onboarding, provisioning of the hundred-and-one software apps your org uses, plus traditional hardware setup. It’s become complex (and often frustrating) for both managers and employees. Finding the right onboarding solution for your small business can significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of your onboarding and offboarding processes.</p>
<p><a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">YeshID Onboard</a> provides an option for smaller companies that have embarked on their identity and access management journeys but aren’t in a place yet where they need a very technical (or expensive) solution. We provide a quick and easy way to accomplish your checklist today while setting up the foundational best practices that will help you grow in the future.</p>
 
 Templatize and schedule onboarding and offboarding tasks to set up a repeatable process for ease and speed. 
 Assign application administrator(s) then automatically route requests for provisioning to the proper owners. 
 Track provisioning/de-provisioning in a single dashboard to offboard a user with confidence while maintaining compliance and reducing license costs. 
 Empower employees to initiate requests for new application access that are automatically routed to the proper application administrator. 
 And because it’s in beta, YeshID Onboard is free (<a href="https://yeshid.com/post/why-are-we-giving-yeshid-onboard-away-for-free/">yes, like free free</a>) for the first 100 companies to sign up (must be in Google Workspace and have 50-250 employees). 
 
<p>Start streamlining your onboarding and offboarding processes without the need for budget approval or credit card information. You’ll also get access to an exclusive Slack community of small business hustlers and heroes just like you so we can share, support, and celebrate together. Take something off your never-ending to-do list and <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">sign up today</a>.</p>

  <p>Join identity and experts at KuppingerCole Analysts and BeyondTrust as they discuss the impact of the evolution of business IT, the trends shaping the identity landscape, the importance of identity security, and the role of privileged access management (PAM), cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM), and identity threat detection and response (ITDR).</p>
<p>Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst at KuppingerCole, will look at the convergence of PAM, CIEM, and ITDR, and their place within the Identity Fabric concept. He will analyze why new technologies are required to deal with ever-increasing cyberattacks and the reality of today’s hybrid and dynamic IT, and why a holistic approach is needed.</p>
<p>Marc Maiffret, Chief Technology Officer at BeyondTrust, will explain the value of an identity-first security strategy and the pivotal role of PAM, supported by CIEM and ITDR, in building a next-gen security capability. He will share insights on how to reap the rewards of digital transformation, while keeping the attack surface in check and minimizing risk.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/identity-security-pam-ciem-itdr"></a>

<p>Holochain is a framework that can augment the powers of blockchains by offering control, trust, and transparency in a local, private network — while also being able to reference a specific transaction, action, or other data on a public blockchain. </p><p>In a Holochain application every action is validated and has a cryptographically signed provenance. This validation does not require consensus, making it hyper scalable. It does this by using a mix of technologies from BitTorrent, git, and GNUPG. </p><p>The Fractal Tribute game is a Holochain application designed to address several technical challenges that groups and applications often encounter when looking for ways to deliver NFT content that is both dynamic and decentralized. It also addresses the challenge of bridging state across decentralized systems, in this case from Holochain to an EVM blockchain. Those technical challenges are solved in Fractal Tribute which enables permissionless minting of dynamic content, facilitates the distribution of raised funds based on player activity, all whilst ensuring compatibility with existing NFT metadata consumers, like OpenSea.</p> Permissionless Minting of Content <p>Although there is growing popularity for entirely on-chain NFTs, for the most part NFT content is stored somewhere off-chain for reasons of scalability. It is prohibitively expensive to store content on a blockchain. So, the usual approaches to this would be to either store the content on a network like IPFS or Arweave, or put it behind a centralized API. The former is obviously the preferable option, however if you’d like the content to be dynamic you’re still left with a problem as both IPFS and Arweave only store static assets.&nbsp;</p><p>This problem is solved in Fractal Tribute. Players are able to create artwork with each other in a fully peer-to-peer decentralized Holochain app, then permissionlessly mint it on-chain. The solution involves creating a unique ID for each NFT that combines the content and your wallet address (ID = hash(content + wallet)). This ID is generated within the EVM smart contract and a matching reference is created on the Holochain app. Because it is partly generated from the wallet doing the minting, it makes it impossible for anyone else to create the same ID. A binding between your Holochain agent and EVM wallet is established, ensuring that only you can mint NFTs for your content on both networks.</p> Making the Game Compatible with OpenSea <p>To ensure that content from the Holochain app can be seamlessly integrated with platforms like OpenSea, the project utilizes Holo gateways. These gateways are hosted on Holo, a distributed hosting platform for Holochain apps, and can request content for a specific token ID from the app and generate the necessary metadata in JSON format.</p><p>Going forward, this approach has the potential to be applied in various scenarios where tokenization of events or assets on a peer-to-peer Holochain network is desirable, including identity solutions for private Holochain networks, audits, or backing for real-world assets on-chain.</p> Distribution of Funds <p>The challenge is to fairly distribute funds raised in the minting of the limited open edition NFTs based on a percentage of contribution to the artwork produced in the game. So far, the only link between Holochain and the NFT contract is by ID. The blockchain has no awareness of player contributions in the Holochain app. To address this, a "game steward" concept is introduced. This steward, a participant in the Holochain app, calculates each participant's contributions at the end of the game and signs the percentage claim of the fund pool with their EVM private key. The smart contract on the EVM side only accepts data signed by the game steward, allowing individuals to make their claims. While this system depends on the honesty of the steward, the transparency of the process and the ability to hold the steward accountable mitigate risks.The result? All players of the game will receive a percentage of the sale of any NFT minted during the game.</p> New Utility <p>Three primary technical challenges have limited the ability of NFTs to be both dynamic and decentralized in the current ecosystem. These can be solved by bridging between a Holochain app and an EVM. The NFT is effectively minted on both networks by the binding of a Holochain agent and an EVM wallet that results in a single NFT ID. This demonstration provides significant, new utility to the NFT space and broader Web3 ecosystem.</p> Play Fractal Tribute <p><a href="https://bit.ly/fractal-tribute-blog?ref=blog.holochain.org">Play the game of Fractal Tribute</a>&nbsp;running from November 2nd at 15:00 GMT to November 7th 15:00 GMT.</p><p></p>

<p>Demands by residents for contactless services have accelerated the need for digital government services, but rampant identity fraud is impeding digital transformation and costing taxpayers millions. Stopping fraud means blocking synthetic and stolen identities during the application process and securing resident accounts from phishing and social engineering attacks aimed at account takeover.. At 1Kosmos, we’ve made it our mission to fortify digital identities and empower both government agencies and citizens for a secure and seamless digital future.</p>
 The Power of Credential Service Providers (CSPs) 
<p>A Credential Service Provider (CSP) conducts identity verification during enrollment and subsequently validates identity during each access attempt. This streamlines the allocation of limited resources for organizations, allowing them to efficiently provide online services to eligible individuals. By expediting identity verification procedures and ensuring the security and convenience users anticipate, agencies expedite the delivery of accessible services to genuine residents.</p>
<p>The 1Kosmos CSP managed service offers a contemporary, user-friendly approach to self-service identity verification (e.g., IAL2) and authentication (e.g., AAL2) that works seamlessly on any device, at any time, with a remarkable accuracy rate exceeding 99%. Equipped with an identity-backed, reusable credential, residents gain effortless access to multiple websites, applications, and services. They also gain control over and securely manage the sharing of their personal information, simplifying both privacy and compliance management.</p>
<p>Leveraging a IAL2 certified Full <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/credential-service-provider/">CSP</a> enables organizations to sidestep the constant arms race of security challenges. With 1Kosmos CSP managed services, the burden of staying ahead of the latest security threats, relationships with bureaus, and deep fake mitigation is shouldered by us. Government agencies and organizations can focus on delivering efficient online services to legitimate residents, confident in the knowledge that their security needs are expertly managed.</p>

Our platform matches users’ real biometrics with their government issued IDs to prove their identities each time they access government services. Through its intuitive, user-friendly interface, residents can seamlessly access various sites, applications, and services with a reusable, secure credential in hand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By automating manual identity and credential verification processes, our platform guarantees a secure, rules-based workflow that significantly minimizes errors. With its adherence to the rigorous NIST 800-63-3 standards and verifiable data registries, government agencies can conduct stringent Identity Assurance Level 2 (IAL2) verification, issuing digitally signed Authentication Assurance Level 2 (AAL2) credentials. This process lays the foundation for a secure digital environment, fostering a relationship of trust between citizens and the government.</p>
<p>In the face of increasing threats like phishing and cyber-attacks, 1Kosmos BlockID further enhances security measures through its support for biometric passwordless multi-factor authentication, leveraging a flexible offering of phishing-resistant authenticators to suit many different types of users. Our flexible identity proofing mechanism allows for adaptable levels of identity assertion, catering to the evolving needs of both government agencies and customers. With a comprehensive suite of identification methods, including device biometrics and LiveID, we ensure that every access request is met with the appropriate balance of security and convenience.</p>
 1Kosmos Digital Wallet: The Ultimate Secure Platform 
<p>Moreover, 1Kosmos BlockID’s digital wallet serves as the ultimate secure platform, enabling users to verify their identities in a private and convenient manner. With the assurance that the digital wallet remains securely in the hands of the rightful user, government agencies can streamline management across multiple online services seamlessly. The platform supports an unlimited number of personas or accounts, binding user biometrics via the IAL2 workflow to FIDO2 certified credentials, effectively eliminating the need for usernames or passwords. This advancement empowers users and governments alike, facilitating a smooth transition to a more comprehensive array of online services and offerings.</p>
<p>At 1Kosmos, we take immense pride in being at the forefront of digital identity and security solutions. Our mission is to empower government agencies to navigate the challenges of the digital era with unwavering confidence. Join us in shaping a future where digital identity remains secure, and the trust between citizens and their governments is the cornerstone of a thriving digital society. With 1Kosmos, the future of digital identity is not just a distant dream, but a reality that is within reach.

 An economic stroke of genius or a death knell to a thriving community? IDnow investigates how the Brazilian gambling community feels about the upcoming regulations. 



 



<p>While Brazilian gambling operators eagerly await the approval of online gambling regulations, and the resulting new revenue streams, Brazilian players have rather mixed feelings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In&nbsp;July 2023, an <a href="https://igamingbrazil.com/legislacao/2023/07/26/regulamentacao-das-apostas-esportivas-6-em-cada-10-brasileiros-acreditam-que-sera-positiva/">opinion poll on upcoming Brazilian gambling regulation</a> revealed that only 64% of Brazilians&nbsp;thought that regulating sports betting in Brazil would have a positive impact on the country. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The top benefit of the regulation, according to 45% of respondents, was that the regulation would help reduce fraud. Other benefits mentioned were more security for bettors, and transparency of information offered by bookmakers, at 40% and 39% respectively. Around half of respondents said they would continue to bet with the same regularity as before, but 31% believed that they would bet less because of the regulation.</p>



 What effect will Brazilian gambling regulation have on players? 



<p>While there are clear economic opportunities for Brazilian operators and the government, there are also concerns in the betting community that the new rules, which would require operators to have an office in Brazil, could drive international operators away, which in turn would affect sponsorship opportunities in, for example, the Brazilian football league. An incredible <a href="https://www.gamesbras.com/english-version/2023/3/30/betting-sites-dominate-brazilian-serie-and-sponsoring-39-teams-36411.html">39 out of 40 football teams</a> in the nation’s top two leagues are sponsored by international betting sites. One of the possible consequences of the regulation is a withdrawal of sponsorship, which would <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/futebol/comments/12brzcq/clubes_se_posicionam_sobre_regulamenta%C3%A7%C3%A3o_das/">negatively affect the competitiveness of Brazilian clubs.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some players are also showing their opposition to the way in which they will be taxed. As the proposals aim to only tax&nbsp;profits, and not factor in a player’s history of losses, players are pointing out that as most gamblers lose money most of the time, the few times they will win, they will be taxed, which they believe is unfair. The <a href="https://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/vida-e-cidadania/como-sites-apostas-esportivas-contornam-lei-antijogo-pais/">rate payable is 30% (withheld by operators),</a> and players must declare winnings when filing income tax.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As such, some Brazilian players believe that some of the higher spending and professional bettors will simply utilize VPN services to continue playing on international sites.</p>



 What effect will Brazilian gambling regulation have on operators? 



<p>One of Brazilian operator’s chief objections to the new regulation is the cost (BR$30 million) of a Brazilian gambling license (read more about the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-gambling-license-structure/">Brazliian gambling license structure here</a>), which they say is too much, especially when compared to other markets, such as <a href="https://brazilian.report/tech/2021/09/03/online-gambling-disabilities-venture-capital/">Malta (5%), Greece (5%) and the United Kingdom (15%),</a> which all arguably offer more attractive regulatory environments. However, the UK is itself going through considerable changes to its regulatory environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read more about the plans being undertaken by the United Kingdom Gambling Commission in our blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ukgc-plans-uk-gambling-sector/">‘From government paper to UKGC Plans: What’s next for the UK’s gambling sector.’</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many operators and players are also understandably wary as to where exactly the 18% of Gross Gaming Revenue tax will be generated. Many players have expressed concerns that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/futebol/comments/12q8yd8/apostas_esportivas_ganhador_ter%C3%A1_de_pagar_30_de/?rdt=33846">operators may opt for extra fees, such as account maintenance fees and withdrawal fees</a>.</p>



 A nation ready to risk it all. 



<p>It’s clear to see that&nbsp;while the general population, and of course, the Brazilian gambling industry is in favor of regulating sports betting, due to the anticipated positive impact on the country’s economy, the view from the Brazilian betting community is mostly negative.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is widespread fear that new restrictions could affect the competitiveness of the sector, resulting in fewer active operators, a deterioration in odds, the appearance of additional fees on platforms and even a decline in the quality of national football. Of course, it could also result in players simply deciding to flee to foreign platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, as the Brazilian government expects&nbsp;to receive between BR$6 billion to BR$12 billion per year when the regulated market is operational, it appears to be a risk it’s prepared to take.</p>



 Play on. 



<p>Identity proofing and fraud protection are two areas that will become paramount in the new era of Brazilian gambling.</p>

  <p>In the first post of this three-part series, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/harness-power-your-identity-data">Harness the Power of Your Identity Data</a>, we talked about the importance and potential power of using identity data to grow your business by providing tailored digital experiences. In our second post, we took a closer look at two of the three steps you can take to grow your business with identity data. The first step is to get connected to all of your various and siloed identity data sources. The second step is to leverage the built-in ForgeRock relationship model so that your data is arranged in a way that best supports your specific business needs. Read the details of steps one and two <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/grow-your-business-identity-data">here</a>. And now let's explore the third step.</p>

 Step 3: Scale Your Operations 

<p>Connecting your data silos and designing the desired relationships among different types of identity data lays a strong foundation for a converged identity and access management (IAM) platform. This concept can hold all of your identities in a single system while catering to the unique needs of different identity populations: customers, brands, partners, suppliers, employees, and devices. However, the benefits of bringing everything together under one roof can also introduce new complexity issues if you don't have a scalable way for your IT staff to manage ongoing operations and maintenance.</p>

<p>The identity management capabilities of the ForgeRock Identity Cloud include a feature known as the Organization Model, or Org Model for short. The Org Model is what helps you bring everything together to operationalize your identity data in a way that scales across your IT teams. The Org Model is an out-of-the-box identity object that has pre-defined relationships with other identity objects, such as users, roles, and applications. It empowers you to quickly create a hierarchy of "organizations," each with their own unique identity and attributes that support the tailored experiences you need to deliver for different populations of identities.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The easiest way to understand the Org Model is to imagine the organizational chart of any large company. Visualize interconnected boxes arranged in a top-down hierarchy. The CEO at the top maintains overall control and responsibility for the company, but also delegates specific responsibilities to leaders in finance, HR, legal, marketing, and other functional areas. Those leaders have specific autonomy to define the boxes in their organizations and the people within them. In the same way, our Org Model empowers you to define any kind of hierarchical identity structure that represents the reality of your business. And just like the company's organizational structure, our identity Org Model enables delegation so that the IT administrators that are closest to a given identity population can be put in charge of managing the organization, the users in it, and all the granular permissions and customizations required by that group of identities. This is the first half of how you scale your identity management operations.</p>

<p>With the ability to implement a scalable span of control through delegated administration, the Org Model is similar to how a company's organizational structure scales as it grows and changes over time. Let's look at one more analogy to understand the second half of scaling your identity management operations: inheritance.</p>

<p>Imagine an organization with many franchises around the country or even the world. Whether the franchise is a fast food chain, or an automotive dealership, certain policies and multi-brand experiences need to remain consistent. Other facets of the business need to be flexible to accommodate different supply chains, partners, and local government policies. This is why inheritance capabilities are so important. With the ForgeRock Org Model, changes made to the top-level organization, such as new access policies or authentication requirements, can automatically get pushed down to the sub-Orgs without requiring administrative intervention. And where required, separate organizational structures can maintain distinct policies, all subject to the requirements of the business.</p>

<p>Take the example of an automotive manufacturer looking to manage all of its independent dealerships and you giving them the flexibility to manage their business while maintaining a certain level of central visibility and control. The top CEO box in the manufacturer's Org Model gives the company this level of control in their world of digital identity. Next, the company creates Level 2 boxes, or "Orgs," for each of their defined regions in the U.S. This gives regional managers a level of control over the dealerships in their territory. The Level 2 boxes are connected and roll up to the Level 1 CEO box, just as in a company's organizational chart</p>

<p>At the third level, new Org boxes are created, which also have their own unique identity, relationships in the identity hierarchy, and the ability to have custom attributes. These Orgs are created to represent each dealership. And the owner of each dealership is given the authority (delegation) to manage certain aspects of the user experience. These could be different multifactor authentication (MFA) enrollment choices, for example. Then there's the inheritance factor, which dictates certain configuration consistencies across the entirety of the organization–maybe in this case a password length and complexity policy.</p>

 Using Identity Data to Drive the Runtime User Experience 

<p>Now that your identity data is organized according to your business needs and you have a scalable process for managing the maintenance and dynamic changes that are the reality of your business, it's time to put the data to work on the front lines.</p>

<p>This is where identity data meets access orchestration. With the right data at your disposal and an access management system with dynamic orchestration capabilities, each user's experience can be tailored to their specific needs. In one moment, a customer of yours enters their account name and, based on the data retrieved and fed into the orchestration workflow, this customer experiences a low-friction, passwordless login that is personalized. At the very same moment, one of your suppliers enters their account name into a different application and receives a tailored MFA experience based on the security negotiated between your company and the supplier's company. For this supplier, union rules prevent management from requiring their users to authenticate on their personal mobile phones. So based on your identity data, including this supplier's Org Model affiliation, the user receives a sign-in link by email. When the user clicks on the link from the computer, the user signs in with a passwordless experience that doesn't require the use of a phone.</p>

 We sit down with the Head of Compliance at Hero to discuss money laundering trends, Russians and real estate, and how companies can protect their business and customers from fraud. 



 



 What are some of the new trends you have seen in money laundering in 2023? 



<p>In 2023, the landscape of money laundering has shifted significantly, with the emergence of new methods and the adaptation of old ones. One of the most striking trends is the increasing use of cryptocurrencies. The anonymity provided by these currencies allows scammers to transfer significant funds without detection. In 2022,&nbsp;<a href="https://securityintelligence.com/articles/crypto-fraud-in-2023-how-can-security-teams-fight/">hackers stole $4.3 billion</a>&nbsp;worth of cryptocurrency, marking a 37% increase from 2021. Most of these scams were carried out through social media, highlighting the need for stricter regulation in this area.</p>



<p>Furthermore, real estate remains a favored sector for money laundering. The high value of properties and the ability to transact in cash make it an attractive tool. For instance, in February 2022, Transparency International revealed that Russians linked to corruption charges had invested&nbsp;<a href="https://www.transparency.org.uk/uk-money-laundering-stats-russia-suspicious-wealth">£1.5 billion in the UK real estate market</a>. This trend underscores the importance of implementing stricter regulations to monitor and regulate real estate transactions.</p>



 Is there a noticeable difference in the money laundering techniques deployed in different countries, for example in France, compared to the UK? 



<p>While the basic techniques of money laundering are universal, each country has its nuances based on its regulation, economy, and culture. In France, for instance, the regulation is quite stringent, with bodies like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/fr/glossaire/acpr/">Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution&nbsp;(ACPR)</a>&nbsp;closely monitoring financial activities. This might push criminals to adopt more sophisticated methods or use intermediaries to launder money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the UK, with a broader financial market and a significant presence of international finance, techniques might be more varied, ranging from shell companies to complex real estate transactions. Moreover, Brexit might have created new opportunities for money launderers due to changes in information-sharing and oversight agreements.</p>



 In France, the regulatory landscape for identity verification has changed dramatically with the introduction of PVID. Do you think PVID, and other government-approved Trust frameworks make a difference in rates of fraud and money laundering? How do you see PVID changing in the coming years? 



<p>The PVID is a tangible example of how regulation can adapt to the modern challenges of identity verification. By combining document verification with facial recognition, it provides an added layer of security, thereby reducing the risk of identity theft. This has a direct impact on fraud and money laundering rates, as it’s more challenging for criminals to deceive this system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, as with any technology, it’s crucial to remain vigilant and adapt to new methods that criminals might develop to bypass these measures. In the future, I anticipate PVID to incorporate newer technologies and verification methods as they become available, while strengthening existing protocols.</p>



 What role does technology play in the proliferation of fraud and money laundering? Are there any new uses that are particular causes for concern for you? 



<p>Technology has always been a double-edged sword when it comes to fraud and money laundering. On one hand, it provides innovative tools to enhance fraud detection and prevention like advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence, which can help pinpoint suspicious transaction patterns that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, technology also gives fraudsters new means to impersonate or deceive individuals. Deepfakes, for instance, can be used to fraudulently open accounts or extort money. Moreover, with the rise of cryptocurrencies, criminals have found new ways to launder money outside of traditional financial systems.</p>



 Besides adhering to regulation, what else can companies do to protect their business and customers from fraud? 



<p>Beyond mere regulatory compliance, businesses must adopt a proactive approach to protect their operations and clients. This involves investing in cutting-edge technologies, such as artificial intelligence and data analytics, to detect and prevent fraud in real-time. Utilizing public and private databases can also assist in verifying the authenticity of clients and transactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, data pooling among financial institutions can provide a holistic view of suspicious activities. Lastly, continuous training of employees on the latest fraud techniques and prevention best practices is paramount. Companies must also foster a culture of compliance, where every employee understands their role in fraud prevention.</p>



 What regulations/obligations should different sectors, including the crypto, gambling and financial sectors, expect in the coming years? What changes would you like to see implemented? 



<p>The rapid evolution of technology and financial markets means that regulation must adapt accordingly. In the cryptocurrency sector, we can expect increased regulation, especially in countries that have yet to adopt robust regulatory frameworks for digital assets. This might include stricter KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the gambling sector, regulation might focus more on preventing gambling addiction and ensuring operators aren’t taking advantage of vulnerable individuals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, for the traditional financial sector, data pooling and increased use of artificial intelligence might be encouraged to detect and prevent fraud and money laundering.</p>



 Are there different types of fraud risks that a traditional financial service needs to be aware of compared to a fintech? 



<p>Fintechs and traditional financial institutions face unique challenges when it comes to fraud. Fintechs, especially in their early stages, might have limited resources and feel pressure to quickly onboard clients, potentially making them less vigilant. It’s a delicate balance between risk exposure and the need for growth. However, fintechs also have the advantage of being agile and can quickly adopt new technologies to combat fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, large financial institutions, while having significant resources for staffing, tools, and training, have to deal with massive transaction and onboarding volumes. This can make detecting individual fraudulent transactions more challenging. However, the future looks promising with the prospect of data pooling among financial institutions and increased use of AI for real-time fraud detection.</p>

<p>Fractal Tribute is a collaborative art game built on Holochain and inspired by r/place.&nbsp;</p><p>In this real time game, players make “moves” by placing pixels on a shared canvas, building upon all previous moves, and thus coordinating to draw new patterns and art. Each player is limited in the number of pixels they can place at one time, requiring them to work with other players to shape the canvas into particular designs. It’s a game of community building, artistic expression, and collaborative play.&nbsp;</p><p>Players can also take snapshots of the collaborative art after they make their moves. These snapshots are simultaneously minted as limited open edition NFTs on an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) in this case, using the Polygon network.</p> The Tech Stack <p>The game is built on the Holochain application framework, which manages app networking, data validity, and databasing in a peer-to-peer system without need for a central server. The application runs locally on players computers and is networked between them for collaboration.</p><p>When users sign into the game, they are required to bind an ERC-20 wallet to their instance of Fractal Tribute. It is this binding between Holochain private keys and the crypto wallet private keys that enables full validation of both the art itself and the NFT.&nbsp;</p><p>The Holo hosting network is used as a gateway to the Fractal Tribute application so that anyone can fetch validated content directly from the peer-to-peer game using HTTPS. These always-on nodes provide an easy, low-friction way for players and non-players to view NFT payloads — allowing a marketplace like OpenSea to make them available for purchase.&nbsp;</p> Why Connect Holochain and Blockchain? <p>Fractal Tribute was built as a demonstration of the possibilities opened by combining Holochain and Blockchain. But it is just one possible arrangement of application rules and smart contracts.</p><p>In Fractal Tribute:&nbsp;</p>  Only the original creator of the asset can mint the NFT.&nbsp;  Holochain lets you audit an accountable history of all interactions with the underlying asset. This ensures data provenance.&nbsp;  Storage of the NFT asset is distributed.  Blockchain validates the token in a public space, Holochain validates the underlying asset created in a private application.  A single, shared NFT ID referenceable in both spaces.  <p>Essentially Holochain enables unforgeable NFTs because owners can prove ownership of the NFT on a blockchain, and they can trace back to the digital asset and confirm that the NFT was minted by the creator and owner of the underlying asset.</p><p>When an artist takes a snapshot, they create an immutable bundle of actions that is cryptographically signed within the app directly. Because every move or brushstroke is signed with a private key, every artist involved in the game can audit who did what and when.&nbsp;</p><p>The snapshot is simultaneously minted as a limited open edition NFT on the Polygon network.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of a URL that points to the artwork on a centralized server, which may be taken down or otherwise controlled by someone with admin privileges, NFT payloads created in Fractal Tribute are held in the distributed Holochain application where they were created, which is then bridged by a gateway node running on the distributed Holo hosting network for public visibility.&nbsp;</p><p>Holochain’s data storage isn’t just decentralized, it’s distributed. This means that as a player you will always hold a verifiable copy of your own data, at the same time as it is backed up across the network. With accountable histories, data hashing, and distributed storage, Holochain provides a high level of security in comparison to IPFS and traditional client-server models.</p> What’s Next? <p>Fractal Tribute is a proof of concept, showing the ways that blockchain wallets and Holochain agents can be bound together and what possibilities that binding enables. The interaction between a fully distributed application for collaborative art and an NFT marketplace built on blockchain is just one possible arrangement where we can see the multiplier effects of these technologies working together.&nbsp;</p><p>How will this pattern be used? We see the possibility for creator economies not based around centralized platforms, we see value creation which doesn’t require consensus, we see games where players control their identity and data, we see new ways to create trust and provenance on the web.&nbsp;</p><p>What possibilities do you see?</p> Play Fractal Tribute <p><a href="https://bit.ly/fractal-tribute-blog?ref=blog.holochain.org">Play the game of Fractal Tribute</a> running from November 2nd at 15:00 GMT to November 7th 15:00 GMT.</p>

  <p>In today's digital landscape, the threat of malicious bots and botnets looms large over the retail industry. Manipulated by cybercriminals, these devices and networks can wreak havoc on your e-commerce platform and disrupt your customers' experience.</p>

<p>Bots and botnets are able to vigilantly monitor your inventory for must-have items, pretend to be customers, and swiftly buy up your inventory (before your actual customers have a chance to) — often reselling the items at inflated prices on third-party websites.</p>

<p>Botnets are everywhere, and this type of activity happens all the time. This practice not only impacts your sales, but it also creates a negative customer experience for customers who are eager to buy the latest and greatest item, only to find that it is already sold out. Retailers are not only left to deal with frustrated customers, but often also find themselves processing numerous returns if the bad actors fail to resell the items. The only people who benefit from this trend are the cybercriminals.</p>

 The Crucial Role Digital Identity Plays In Combating Botnets 

<p>The key to fighting back against bots and botnets is to quickly identify and authenticate those behind online activities. For example, retailers must quickly discern whether their products are being purchased by a legitimate, loyal customer who has been eagerly waiting for a new product release — or by an impersonal, automated bot from the darknet.</p>

<p>To do this, you need the ability to examine contextual identity information and use it to make informed decisions. At the same time, rather than burdening your legitimate customers with onerous authentication steps, you need to make sure the process is invisible. This involves striking a careful balance between customer experience and security.</p>

 Beating the Bots With Identity and Access Management (IAM) 

<p>ForgeRock's enterprise-grade digital identity platform enables you to identify and stop bots and botnets without driving away your real customers. With <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">ForgeRock Intelligent Authentication</a>, you can use AI-driven threat detection, plus a range of environmental, contextual, and behavioral factors, to make authentication and authorization decisions in real time — unmasking the bots. Intelligent Access also adapts login and checkout journeys to make them more challenging and complicated when there's a suspected bot. Adversely, legitimate, authenticated customers are able to check out without any hurdles whatsoever.</p>

<p>Don't let retail bots and botnets ruin your customers' experiences or your bottom line. Get an in-depth examination of how a retail bot works and how you can leverage ForgeRock to defend against bots today and as they evolve in the future by reading <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/block-bots-keep-your-customers-coming-back">Block the Bots to Keep Your Customers Coming Back</a>.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>HYPR is expanding its original mission to take a more comprehensive approach to Identity Assurance. We have introduced two cutting-edge products, HYPR Adapt and HYPR Affirm that round out the HYPR platform.</p> 
<p>We grew from a small team around a table to a multi-team organization with a range of talented specialists. Arriving at this milestone after many lessons learnt, we took a pause and looked at what worked over the last 5 years, and how we could apply them going forward.</p> 
 Exciting New Changes  
<p>As part of these changes, we are excited to announce that <a href="mailto:baljeet.sandhu@hypr.com">Baljeet Sandhu</a>, formerly our Chief Architect has been promoted to CTO. Baljeet joined us several years ago and his contributions have been invaluable to the business around too many areas to count. Robert Panebianco, is promoted to the chief architect position after many great years of service here at HYPR. Rob has been our resident cryptography expert and has done amazing things in our efforts to build a highly scalable and secure SaaS platform.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><a href="mailto:shaun.gerner@hypr.com">Shaun Gerner</a>, who was one of our first engineering hires and first mobile engineer many years ago has been promoted to VP of Engineering. He is now responsible for running the various feature teams at HYPR who have been working with Shaun shoulder to shoulder to deliver the amazing products our customers use today.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>We’re also happy to announce that Sal Rizzari is now our official VP of Infrastructure. Sal’s ability to organize a team to automate and deploy HYPR at scale has been a force multiplier for our development teams as well as our customers.&nbsp;</p> 
 Our Engineering Philosophy&nbsp;  
 Solving a Problem&nbsp;  
<p>Building software is, at its core, an exercise in solving a problem for your customers; understanding the things that matter to them. As we grow we want to preserve HYPR’s traditional cycle of working with customers, delivering the next iteration, listening and refining.</p> 
<p>With this in mind, we organized around delivery-oriented feature teams. Each team includes the complete set of specialists needed to deliver the solution — developers, QA, Product and DevOps. The team takes on a customer problem and owns solutioning through delivery. They build, own and operate. It's a close group which relies on each member operating with a high context and owning their role in the team delivery. Working with a high context and problem solving mindset is fun!</p> 
 Iterating Fast  
<p>We believe that software is a process of continuous refinement and ideation. This can only happen if we move forward quickly, in small steps. We love showing our early work to feature partners and gathering feedback. Some of our best ideas have in fact, come from our customers! However, this needs to be balanced with the stability needs of a critical platform like HYPR. We facilitate this by releasing all of our features in alpha, beta and GA cycles. The expectations and guardrails in each of these are well-defined internally. Most of the iteration happens in alpha and starts tapering off as we approach GA. At GA, change control and release compatibility guidelines kick in.</p> 
 Using the Best Tools  
<p>The best available tools are necessary to enable our teams. HYPR’s tech stack uses proven platforms, like JDK, .Net and Node. We upgrade aggressively and are on the latest stable within a few months of release. Being techies at heart, we continuously watch and experiment with a wide variety of new tech. Native images for Java, Flutter for mobile UIs, WebAssembly in browsers, are just a few of the things we evaluated in 2023. Experimentation usually starts on non-critical utilities and moves gradually to core if proven successful.&nbsp;</p> 
 Baking Security In  
<p>We take a <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/identity-security-company-with-a-security-first-approach">security-first approach</a>, baking it into the design at all stages. Security design is vetted by our in-house experts. During build, automated checks in our CI pipeline continuously run static and dynamic analysis. Additionally, separate scans continuously look for CVE vulnerabilities in our libraries. We take CVEs seriously. A CVE trip will break the build at HYPR. During the testing phase, our in-house experts try to compromise the solution. The findings are reviewed with the feature team. But we don’t stop there — we invite even deeper scrutiny through our public HackerOne program.&nbsp;</p> 
 Automation Everywhere  
<p>Running a successful SaaS platform needs fast testing feedback and consistency in deployments. HYPR got this right early on. We treat our test automation code with the same standards as our production code and it lives alongside in code repositories. Highly recommend it! Our DevOps team brings similar discipline to the job. Manual configuration is for experiments only. For everything else there is Infra As Code (IAC).</p> 
 Doing More With Less  
<p>At HYPR we have always taken a pragmatic approach to building software. We choose good tools and keep the number of frameworks limited. We endeavor to apply these uniformly across teams. This gives us an advantage of being able to move people between teams and get up to speed quickly. On a new team, engineers can focus on the difference in product; the tech is already familiar.</p> 
 Our Team and the Work Ahead  
<p>HYPR aims to be the best place for engineers to work. We highly value all team members and are committed to individual empowerment aligned around not just our engineering philosophy but shared values of transparency, collaboration, impact and adaptability. I am extremely excited for our engineering voyage ahead.</p>

				  Indicio NoDe—Node on Demand—makes setting up decentralized ecosystems and networks easy, helping businesses to quickly realize the benefits from verifiable data and identity.&nbsp;  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>SEATTLE/ Nov 1, 2023–Indicio, the market leader in delivering enterprise-class verifiable data solutions, announced today the availability of <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/indicio-public/indicio-node-ubuntu-20?project=sunlit-apricot-360315">Indicio Node on Demand 20.04</a> (Indicio NoDe 20.04) for deployment in the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/find-a-partner/partner/indicio">Google Cloud.</a> Indicio NoDe 20.04 is the newest offering in Indicio’s catalog of products that enable customers to add verifiable credential technology to their existing data systems and applications to reduce fraud, create seamless and secure access and authentication, scalable to any use case, and realized cost savings from seamless operational efficiency. Google Cloud Marketplace makes it easy to set up and manage these solutions in just a few clicks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio NoDe 20.04 is the first quick-to-deploy release of the latest <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/indy">Hyperledger Indy</a> open source code designed to run on Ubuntu 20.0. It can be used to create a network node that can be added to an existing Hyperledger Indy Network or used to build a new distributed ledger network. Enterprises, businesses, and organizations are taking advantage of these types of networks to develop and deploy verifiable credential ecosystems to increase trust and loyalty with their customers, partners, and workforce.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“In a world where speed and scale matter, we’re making it easy and cost effective for developers, companies, and organizations to embrace digital transformation and build seamless processes with verifiable data,” said Heather Dahl, co-founder and CEO of Indicio. “We’re seeing enterprises and governments digging into this technology to deliver better products and services and better customer experiences. Products like NoDe help them do that by allowing them to do what they do best: create value and deliver value. We’re making transformative technology simple to integrate and use.”</p>
<p>Hyperledger Indy is an open-source distributed ledger that supports the use of verifiable credentials to create Trusted Digital Ecosystems. This type of enterprise blockchain allows public-facing identity information, including Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), revocation registries, and schema information to be written, for verifiable credential issuance and then read across multiple organizations simultaneously, for credential verification.</p>
<p>As the demand for creating independent Hyperledger Indy networks grows, Indicio NoDe 20.04, when combined with other monitoring and scanning services, provides core technology for a complete TestNet, DemoNet, or MainNet. These networks can be used for testing, demonstration, pilots, or the deployment of solutions using the tools and protocols offered in the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a> project community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio currently offers complementary use of the Indicio <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-testnet/">TestNet</a> and <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-demonet/">DemoNet.</a> Indicio also offers <a href="https://indicio.tech/deploy-your-own-private-network-for-critical-performance-testing/">private TempNet</a> networks for stress testing products and services. The <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-mainnet/">Indicio MainNet</a> is a fully monitored and professionally maintained Network for paid subscribers.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">Contact Indicio</a> for more information about the Indicio Network or for setting up your own complete Indy Network.</p>

<p>With more and more countries implementing the <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule">FATF Travel Rule</a>, it has become crucial to be prepared and choose <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-ultimate-explainer-on-the-travel-rule-solution#:~:text=Shyft%20Veriscope%3A%20A%20Seamless%20%26%20Privacy,data%20retention%20features%20stand%20out.">a Travel Rule Solution</a> that can meet all your needs. But that is easier said than done, as there are several Travel Rule Solutions available in the market today, each with its specific set of features and functionalities.</p><p>In this analysis, we will juxtapose Veriscope’s features against other notable solutions in the market to provide a clearer picture of where each stands in addressing the challenges and needs of VASPs concerning Travel Rule compliance.</p> Decentralization <p>While Veriscope, Sygna, and TRUST all champion a decentralized approach, it’s Veriscope’s commitment to decentralization that truly stands out. By ensuring that its operations aren’t tied to a single point, Veriscope minimizes vulnerabilities and ensures data integrity.</p><p>This decentralized foundation, when combined with its other robust features, positions Veriscope as a holistic solution in a decentralized ecosystem.</p> No Centralized Storage of&nbsp;PII <p>Veriscope, along with OpenVASP, VerifyVasp, TRP, TransactID, and Trust, places a high emphasis on user&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>After all, in a world where data is the new gold, the decentralized storage of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) becomes pivotal. And by ensuring PII isn’t stored centrally, Veriscope greatly reduces the risks of data breaches, guaranteeing users a safer environment for their&nbsp;data.</p> Open Source <p>Veriscope and TransactID have embraced the open-source model, a testament to their commitment to transparency and innovation.</p><p>This makes a big difference, as open-source platforms invite collective intelligence, allowing a community of developers to contribute, detect vulnerabilities, and enhance the system. It also ensures the platform remains up-to-date and robust against evolving&nbsp;threats.</p> Automatic Counterparty VASP Discovery <p>Veriscope and TRUST take user experience up a notch with their automatic counterparty VASP discovery feature.</p><p>This automation simplifies processes, reducing the need for manual lookups. For businesses and individuals, this means faster, more efficient transactions without the hassle of manual interventions.</p> Secure P2P PII Transmission <p>Among the available Travel Rule Solutions, Veriscope, VerifyVasp, and TransactID prioritize the secure transmission of PII between peers. This is vital in ensuring that personal data remains confidential during transit and is not vulnerable to malicious interceptions or unauthorized access.</p> Robust Counterparty Due Diligence <p>Both Veriscope and TRUST excel in performing thorough due diligence on counterparties. This rigorous process ensures that interactions are made with verified entities, minimizing the risks of fraud and enhancing the overall security of transactions.</p> Pay-as-you-go Model <p>Veriscope is the only Travel Rule Solution that offers a pay-as-you-go model, a feature that is both cost-effective and flexible. Instead of being tied down to long-term commitments, VASPs have the flexibility to pay for only what they use, making it an economical choice.</p> Interoperability <p>Veriscope, along with OpenVASP, NotaBene, Sygna, and TRISA, emphasizes interoperability.</p><p>In an industry where systems need to communicate and integrate seamlessly, this feature ensures that Veriscope can work in tandem with various other platforms, ensuring flexibility and broader usability.</p> Historic Transaction Lookback <p>Veriscope’s historic transaction lookback feature is the only one of its kind among the Travel Rule Solutions.</p><p>This is how it works: when VASPs integrate with the Veriscope network, they are not only positioned to receive current but also historical Travel Rule requests. This ensures that VASPs maintain continuous compliance, regardless of when their partnering VASPs began complying with the FATF Travel Rule or their location globally.</p><p>As such, it confirms transactions right from the beginning and provides VASPs with the opportunity to produce any required records afterward, ensuring everyone adheres to the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p> User Signing (Non-Custodial Wallet Signing): <p>Veriscope is the only Travel Rule Solution that offers user signing for non-custodial wallets. This feature positions Veriscope as the definitive solution for Travel Rule compliance.</p> Address Proofs (Custodial Wallets): <p>Veriscope stands out with its address proofs for custodial wallets. This feature confirms that VASPs truly control the crypto addresses they claim, ensuring accurate data exchange for Travel Rule compliance. It shows that Veriscope emphasizes both user security and operational efficiency.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>The ultimate choice isn’t about simply selecting the Travel Rule Solution with the most features, but rather, one that aligns with specific VASP needs — whether it’s decentralization, secure PII storage, or flexible payment models. As this analysis has highlighted, understanding each solution’s nuances can guide VASPs toward making informed decisions.</p><p>The right Travel Rule solution will allow VASPs to satisfy regulatory obligations while operating effectively within their unique constraints. With the regulatory landscape continuing to evolve, taking the time now to thoroughly assess and identify the optimal Travel Rule solution will establish a strong foundation for success in the approaching compliant future.</p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

 Confused over which crypto regulations are applicable in the UK? Read on to discover all about the Travel Rule, MiCA, and the UK’s proposed regulatory regime. 



 



<p>The release of the UK government’s <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/653bd1a180884d0013f71cca/Future_financial_services_regulatory_regime_for_cryptoassets_RESPONSE.pdf">‘Future financial services regulatory regime for crypto assets: Response to the consultation and call for evidence’ </a> signifies yet another significant step on the UK’s road toward crypto regulation.</p>



<p>In February 2023, in perhaps the clearest sign to date that the UK government was finally taking the challenges and opportunities of the crypto industry seriously, HM Treasury released a consultation paper on the proposed regulatory regime, which is billed by many as the UK’s answer to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">MiCA</a>.</p>



<p>The 77-page document featured information on the current regulatory landscape for cryptoassets, definitions of different types of cryptoassets, and geographic scope of cryptoasset activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As well as more general guidelines regarding cryptoasset investment advice and portfolio management, the paper set out a proposed policy approach to bringing cryptoasset activities into the UK regulatory perimeter.</p>



 Call for evidence on UK’s proposed crypto regulatory regime. 



<p>From February to the end of April 2023, the public and private sector, and those inside and outside Parliament were invited to provide feedback on the proposed policies and legislations. IDnow’s crypto regulatory experts, Rayissa Armata and Jason Tucker-Feltham pored over the consultation paper, and along with 130 other respondents and institutions, provided detailed feedback and analysis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October 2023 <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/653bd1a180884d0013f71cca/Future_financial_services_regulatory_regime_for_cryptoassets_RESPONSE.pdf">HM Treasury published its response to the consultation</a>. In the foreword, Andrew Griffith MP, Economic Secretary to the Treasury said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>The learnings gathered from our engagement have been invaluable for further informing our approach. With the future regulatory framework now taking clear shape and the Financial Services and Markets Act now passed, the UK is the obvious choice for starting and scaling a crypto asset business.</p>Andrew Griffith MP, Economic Secretary to the Treasury.&nbsp;</blockquote>



<p>While the vast majority (80%) of respondents were positive about the proposals, 10% had mixed feedback, and 10% were “largely critical” about the proposals. The main objections were from those who fundamentally disagreed with bringing cryptoassets within the financial services’ regulatory perimeter. Objections fell into three camps: crypto should be banned; crypto should treated in line with gambling regulation; crypto should be regulated on assets, not activities.</p>



 Feedback on UK’s proposed crypto regulations. 



<p>Feedback was collected from a mixture of industry associations, crypto native firms and FinTechs, legal and consulting firms, traditional financial services, and members of public and academia. Twenty themes and topics were identified that need to be addressed:</p>


 
 
 
 1. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) &amp; utility tokens 
 

<p>Clarify proposed treatment of NFTs and utility tokens – especially on what constitutes a financial services use case.</p>

 
 
 
 2. Geographic scope 
 

<p>Give further consideration to the treatment of overseas firms, including making clear the applicability (or not) of the Overseas Persons Exclusion (OPE), reverse solicitation, and intra-group exemptions.</p>

 
 
 
 3. Phase 1 vs phase 2 
 

<p>Delineate phase 1 and phase 2 activities in more detail, and give further consideration to potential challenges for firms and consumers.</p>

 
 
 
 4. Wholesale vs retail 
 

<p>Make stronger distinctions between services provided to professional / sophisticated investors versus retail consumers (e.g. lending, venue disclosures).</p>

 
 
 
 5. Timelines 
 

<p>Provide more clarity on timelines for phase 1 and phase 2, and seek to accelerate the overall implementation programme.</p>

 
 
 
 6. Security tokens 
 

<p>Make clear the proposed treatment of security tokens, and ensure overlapping regimes are avoided (e.g. through an explicit carve-out).</p>

 
 
 
 7. Token scope 
 

<p>Ensure cryptoasset definition used in secondary legislation is not too broad (e.g. make sure it excludes e-money, loyalty schemes, in-game money),</p>

 
 
 
 8. Staking 
 

<p>Provide clarity on the definition and future treatment of staking and consider accelerating legislation process. Consider carve-out from the scope of the collective investment scheme (CIS) regime.</p>

 
 
 
 9. Disclosures liability 
 

<p>Ensure liability framework for disclosures is proportionate –especially for tokens without an identifiable issuer.</p>

 
 
 
 10. Market abuse (cross-venue) 
 

<p>Consider a phased implementation approach toward market abuse surveillance obligations, recognizing issues associated with cross-venue information sharing.</p>

 
 
 
 11. FSMA authorization process 
 

<p>Streamline authorization process – in particular, consider appropriate transition pathways for firms registered with the FCA under its AML regime and/or already authorised under Part 4A of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA).</p>

 
 
 
 12. Custody scope 
 

<p>Clarify definition and scope for future regulated cryptoasset custody activities, especially with regards to self-hosted wallets and third-party arrangements.</p>

 
 
 
 13. Investment advice 
 

<p>Reconsider sequencing of cryptoasset investment advice and portfolio management activities, and ensure these are included in the perimeter.</p>

 
 
 
 14. SMEs 
 

<p>Take steps to minimize barriers to entry for smaller firms – e.g. through careful design of prudential requirements and issuance requirements.</p>

 
 
 
 15. Cross-border enforcement 
 

<p>Clarify how cross-border enforcement can work in practice to ensure fair and level playing field for UK-regulated firms.</p>

 
 
 
 16. Permissionless blockchains 
 

<p>Ensure the regulatory framework appropriately reflects the risks associated with permissionless (public) vs permissioned (private) blockchains.</p>

 
 
 
 17. Trading platform scope 
 

<p>Clarify definition and scope for future regulated trading platform activities, e.g. with regards to airdrops and decentralized exchanges.</p>

 
 
 
 18. Banning crypto 
 

<p>Ban certain cryptoassets from retail consumer use – or treat them akin to gambling rather than bringing them into the financial services regulatory perimeter.</p>

 
 
 
 19. Transitional disclosure arrangements 
 

<p>Consider transitional disclosure arrangements for well-established tokens (e.g. Bitcoin) to differentiate them from recently issued tokens.</p>

 
 
 
 20. International coordination on DeFi 
 

<p>Avoid front-running international work on DeFi by imposing a prescriptive domestic framework.</p>

 
 
 
 


<p>In light of the above, HM Treasury has pledged it will be setting out ‘modifications’ to the original proposals to provide further clarity on key areas of interest. The government’s aim is for secondary legislation to be laid in 2024, subject to Parliamentary time.</p>



<p>“It is important that the regime’s credibility be seen as robust rather than light touch, so I welcome the decision by the UK government to take the feedback from invested parties very seriously,” said Jason Tucker-Feltham, Head of FinTech and Crypto at IDnow.</p>



<blockquote><p>A balanced and well thought out regulatory framework will likely lay the foundations in support of the UK becoming a major global crypto hub.&nbsp;The latest developments are music to the ears of traditional financial institutions, as clear rules for conducting crypto business in and out of the UK provides a level of certainty not yet demonstrated by the jurisdiction.</p>Jason Tucker-Feltham, Head of FinTech and Crypto at IDnow.</blockquote>



 What should crypto firms do while they await crypto regulations?&nbsp; 



<p>While firms await rules outlined in the UK’s proposed crypto regulatory regime, crypto firms that wish to operate in the UK must register with the <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk">Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)</a>, and therefore comply with the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Transfer of Funds Regulations 2017 (including the FATF guideline amendments). Only firms with appropriate <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/#:~:text=KYC%20means%20“Know%20Your%20Customer,KYC%20ebook%20for%20more%20insights">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a> processes, source of funds checks, and proof of funds checks, can be registered to ensure no illicit money is coming through the system.</p>



<p>At the beginning of 2023, out of 300 applications to the FCA, only 41 had become registered. FCA spokesperson, Charles Randell, Chair of the FCA and PSR said that more than 80% of crypto firms that had begun the process to become registered had either withdrawn their applications or been rejected. The most common reasons for not passing were that they did not meet the required AML standards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the UK no longer being legally required to follow the rules outlined in the EU’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld5-anti-money-laundering-directive/">Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive</a> (5AMLD), the UK did decide to transpose the cryptocurrency regulation criteria from 5AMLD and 6AMLD into domestic legislation.&nbsp;Other relevant rules include the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps22-10-strengthening-our-financial-promotion-rules-high-risk-investments-firms-approving-financial-promotions">Financial Promotions Regime</a>, which is currently under consultation, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iflr.com/article/2a647zxame68p5gagy3uo/devil-is-in-the-detail-for-uk-stablecoin-plans">Financial Services and Markets Bill</a><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-law-to-protect-access-to-cash-announced-in-queens-speech">,</a>&nbsp;which includes stablecoin regulation. </p>



 What is the UK’s ‘Travel Rule’?&nbsp; 



<p>From September 1, 2023, crypto firms operating in the UK will be required to store, verify, and&nbsp;share all information regarding crypto transfers, as per <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/fca-sets-out-expectations-uk-cryptoasset-businesses-complying-travel-rule">the ‘Travel Rule’</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although well established among traditional financial service providers, the Travel Rule was extended to incorporate crypto activities in the revised Transfer of Funds regulation, which alongside MiCA, was officially officially published in the European Official Journal on June 9, 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/financial-action-task-force-fatf/">Financial Action Task Force (FATF)</a>, regarded as the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog, recently acknowledged the challenges associated with setting adoption and enforcement timelines across different juristictions and regions. Each FATF member state is currently madating travel rule compliance.</p>



<p>In the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has outlined what it expects from firms:&nbsp;</p>



  Take all reasonable steps and exercise all due diligence to comply with the Travel Rule.&nbsp;  



  Assume responsiblity for complying with the Travel Rule, even when using third-party suppliers.&nbsp;  



  Comply with the Travel Rule when sending or receiving a crypto to a firm in any jurisdiction that has implemented the Travel Rule.&nbsp;  



  Regularly review the implementation status of the Travel Rule in other jurisdictions and adapt business processes as appropriate.&nbsp;  



 Putting the KYC into crypto.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC processes</a> are an integral part in ensuring crypto exchanges can protect themselves and their customers from fraud and money laundering, even amid an <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/british-crypto-balancing-act/">evolving crypto regulatory landscape</a>. Having these controls in place will protect investors from financial losses and add stability to a notoriously volatile market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

				  In a world of scammers attempting to separate people from their hard-earned money, the next step in security is to be able to automatically verify who you are talking to before you tell them anything.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>As of 2022, Forbes reports that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/banking-trends-and-statistics/#:~:text=The%20tides%20have%20shifted%2C%20and,prefer%20to%20bank%20in%20person.">78% of American adults</a> prefer to do their banking digitally through an app or a website. It’s not hard to see why: it’s a quick and easy way to manage your money. Unfortunately, it also provides a new way for bad actors to try to gain access to accounts by pretending to be your bank, usually through text or email. This technique, sometimes known as <a href="https://www.bancosantander.es/en/glosario/spoofing#:~:text=This%20technique%20involves%20sending%20an,or%20any%20other%20criminal%20act.">bank spoofing,</a> can be very convincing, with scammers able to edit the messages to look like they are coming from a legitimate source.</p>
<p>While most consumers will not respond to a message out of nowhere, a small percentage will respond by providing their personal information to sort out whatever problem they’ve been told is happening with their account. The result is devastating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Banks have numerous ways to verify their customers online, but customers have no way to verify their banks.</p>
<p>Currently, if a customer tries to access their bank account online they will need to provide their account name and password, and hopefully either some sort of multifactor authentication tied to their phone or a set of security questions. This provides a degree of security and confidence that only the correct person gets access to the account.</p>
<p>But, if the direction of interaction is reversed, and a customer receives a communication from their bank, they have three options:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Independently verify the message by logging in to their bank portal or showing up in person. (This requires additional time and energy, resulting in poor customer experience.) 
 Ignore it, assuming it is a scam. (It’s never good to have customers dismiss messages by default, particularly if the message is legitimate and urgent.) 
 Do what the message says. (Risk being scammed.) 
 
<p>So how do we tackle this problem?</p>
<p>The answer would seem to be: give banks a way to prove who they are to the customers. But our current systems simply aren’t set up for that. Would we give banks a username and password for them to use when getting in touch with a customer? That leaves the customer needing to remember two passwords, and what if the customer forgets that password? Then we’re back where we started with just having to trust the bank’s outreach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decentralized identity offers a simpler and much more effective way for customers and banks to mutually authenticate each other before exchanging any information. It allows both parties to cryptographically verify that they are who they say they are and to do so automatically and before sharing any data.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>This ability is impossible to spoof and by connecting customers and banks this way, not only can you eliminate the need for passwords and MFA, which can be lost, stolen, or otherwise compromised, the customer can verify that they are indeed interacting with the bank.</p>
<p>According to BioCatch, scams now account for <a href="https://www.biocatch.com/resources/white-paper/digital-banking-fraud-trends-apac-2023">54% of cybercrime</a> across the APAC region, with a 200% surge in voice scams from 2022 to 2023. There is an inherent lack of certainty in knowing who we are communicating with online, which is enabling these criminals. Fraud&nbsp; losses across banks amounted to <a href="https://seon.io/resources/global-banking-fraud-index/#h-costs-of-fraud">$1.6 billion</a> in 2022. Adopting these new systems will save financial institutions real money, improve your customer’s experience, confidence, and retention, and save time and energy combating fraud.</p>
<p>This communications channel can be used for so much more than verification. Once the connection is established, you can be confident in who is on the other end, enabling secure messaging between parties (from both sides the bank can send the customer updates, and the customer can ask questions or send their own messages back), banking functionality such as payments or transfers can be accessed through APIs, and much more.</p>
<p>This article is not to say how we think “oh this would be nice…” or “in a perfect world…”&nbsp;</p>
<p>This technology is here. Now. And it is ready to be used.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As society becomes more reliant on technology, the protection of confidential data increases. One innovative way organizations are keeping information safe is through fingerprint biometrics. In this article, we will explore the science of fingerprint biometrics and highlight its potential for security. We will analyze how security biometrics can be utilized and how this technology shapes our present and future security landscapes.</p>
 Key Takeaways 
 
 Fingerprint Uniqueness: The patterns of an individual’s fingerprints are uniquely influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. They serve as an effective and dependable identification method. 
 Scanner Diversity: Different fingerprint scanners (optical, capacitive, ultrasonic, and thermal) address diverse security requirements. These scanners differ in cost, accuracy, durability, and spoofing resistance. 
 Biometrics Future: Despite the powerful security advantages of fingerprint biometrics, issues like potential data theft and privacy violations demand continuous technological evolution and robust legal safeguards. Future prospects for the field include 3D fingerprint imaging, AI integration, and advanced anti-spoofing techniques. 
 
 What Are Fingerprint Biometrics? 
<p>Fingerprint biometrics is the systematic study and application of unique physical attributes inherent in an individual’s fingerprints. Representing a more dependable identification method than traditional passwords or identity cards, fingerprint biometrics eliminates the issues of misplacement, forgetfulness, or theft. The distinctive nature of each person’s fingerprint ensures a robust barrier against unauthorized access to secure data.</p>
 The Science of Uniqueness: Fingerprints Origins 
<p>Fingerprints are nature’s signature of a person’s identity. Using fingerprints as a biometric identification tool dates back to ancient Babylon and has roots in our evolutionary biology. The friction ridges on our fingertips that comprise these prints have been crucial to human survival, helping us grip and touch objects.</p>
 Genetics and Environmental Factors: The Roots of Fingerprint Uniqueness 
<p>Fingerprints are formed during the embryonic stage and remain unaltered throughout an individual’s life. No two individuals, not even identical twins, share the same fingerprint. The basis for this uniqueness can be traced back to the genetic and environmental factors that influence the development of fingerprints.</p>
<p>Aspects of fingerprints that are analyzed include:</p>
 
 Patterns: The general pattern or type of fingerprint (arch, loop, or whorl) is inherited through genetics. 
 Minutiae: The precise details of the ridges, known as minutiae, are influenced by random and unpredictable factors such as pressure, blood flow, and position in the womb during development. 
 Ridges: Each ridge in a fingerprint contains several minutiae points, which can be bifurcations (where one ridge splits into two) or ridge endings. 
 
<p>The distribution and layout of minutiae points vary in every individual, contributing to the specific characteristics of each fingerprint. It is these characteristics that biometric systems analyze when comparing and matching fingerprints.</p>
 Behind the Screen: How Fingerprint Biometrics Work 
<p>Fingerprint recognition is achieved through three steps.</p>
 
 A fingerprint scanner captures the fingerprint, converting the physical pattern into a digital format. 
 The automated recognition system then processes this image to extract distinctive features, forming a unique pattern-matching template. 
 Finally, the facial recognition system matches this template against stored identification or identity verification templates. 
 
<p>Depending on the exact type of fingerprint scanner a business uses, the scanner may use optical, capacitive, ultrasonic, or thermal technologies. Each fingerprint technology has its strengths and weaknesses and will vary in cost, accuracy, and durability.</p>
<p>While the efficacy of biometric scanners is unquestionable, questions about their safety often arise. Potential challenges of fingerprint and facial recognition systems include false acceptance or rejection and biometric data theft.</p>
<p>Although rare, false acceptance of biometric technology can lead to unauthorized access, while false rejection can deny access to legitimate users. Furthermore, if biometric data is compromised, the repercussions can be severe, given that fingerprints cannot be changed, unlike passwords.</p>
<p>However, continuous technological advancements aim to mitigate these risks. Enhanced encryption techniques, anti-spoofing measures, identity verification, and continuous authentication are ways technology addresses these concerns. Together, these enhancements can improve the reliability and security of fingerprint biometrics.</p>
 In-depth Look at Fingerprint Scanners: Optical vs. Capacitive vs. Ultrasonic vs. Thermal 
<p>There are various types of fingerprint scanners, each with strengths and weaknesses.</p>
 Optical scanners 
<p>Optical scanners are the most traditional type. They take a digital fingerprint picture using a light source and a photodiode (a device that turns light into electrical current). Optical scanners are simple to use but can be easily fooled with a good-quality fingerprint image.</p>
 Capacitive scanners 
<p>Commonly found in smartphones, capacitive scanners use electrical current to sense and map the ridges and valleys of a fingerprint. They offer higher resolution and security than optical scanners but can be sensitive to temperature and electrostatic discharge.</p>
 Ultrasonic scanners 
<p>Ultrasonic scanners are considered more secure than optical and capacitive scanners. They use high-frequency sound waves to penetrate the epidermal layer of the skin. This allows them to capture both the surface and sub-surface features of the skin. This information helps form a 3D image of the fingerprint and makes the scanner less prone to spoofing.</p>
 Thermal scanners 
<p>This type of scanner is the least common of the four. Thermal scanners detect minutiae based on the temperature differences of the contact surface. However, their high costs and sensitivity to ambient temperature make them less popular choices.</p>
 Protecting Biometric Identities: Emerging Methods 
<p>As different biometric authentication technologies become more prevalent, safeguarding these identifiers from data breaches has become increasingly crucial. Biometric data, once compromised, cannot be reset or altered like a traditional password, making its protection paramount.</p>
<p>One of the most cost-effective methods for protecting biometric identities is liveness detection. This technology helps differentiate between a live biometric sample from a synthetic or forged one. These systems can differentiate between a live finger and a spoof by analyzing properties of live skin, such as sweat pores and micro-texture.</p>
<p>By detecting bodily responses or using AI to analyze input data for anomalies, liveness detection can add another layer of security to our biometric identification systems.</p>
<p>Decentralized storage methods, such as blockchain technology, are another avenue for safeguarding biometric data. Instead of storing the data in a central database, it’s dispersed across multiple nodes. These numerous locations make it nearly impossible for hackers to access the entire dataset. While this technology is promising, it’s still nascent and faces scalability and energy efficiency issues.</p>
 Potential Issues with Fingerprint Biometrics and Solutions 
<p>Fingerprint biometrics has its challenges; a common issue users face is the quality of the scanned fingerprint. Poor-quality images can deny legitimate users access to facilities, databases, or other secure locations.</p>
<p>Factors that can affect a person’s fingerprint quality include:</p>
 
 A person’s age 
 Substances on an individual’s hand 
 Skin conditions like dermatitis 
 Manual labor 
 
<p>Furthermore, some systems can be fooled by artificial fingerprints made from various materials like silicone or gelatin, a practice known as spoofing.</p>
<p>Multi-factor authentication, which requires more than one form of identification, is an increasingly used method to enhance security.</p>
 Securing Biometric Data: Ethical and Legal Considerations 
<p>While biometric authentication offers many significant benefits, it presents unprecedented privacy and data security challenges. Biometric data, unlike other forms of personal data, is intimately tied to our physical bodies. This makes its theft or misuse potentially more invasive and damaging.</p>
<p>The legal landscape for biometric data is still evolving. In many jurisdictions, existing privacy laws may not be sufficient to cover biometric data. This leaves gaps in protection. Stricter regulations and law enforcement may be necessary to ensure that all biometric information is collected, stored, and used in a manner that respects individual privacy.</p>
<p>Biometric data security isn’t just about preventing unauthorized access to biometric identifiers. It also involves ensuring that the biometric data, once collected, isn’t used for purposes beyond what was initially agreed. This could include selling the data to third parties or using it for surveillance.</p>
 Fingerprint Biometrics in Action: Real-world Applications and Impact 
<p>Fingerprint biometrics extends beyond personal devices and is a cornerstone of modern security across various sectors.</p>
<p>Fingerprints provide irrefutable evidence for law enforcement and forensics teams by helping identify and track suspects. Moreover, businesses and institutions leverage fingerprint biometrics for physical access control, ensuring that only authorized personnel can enter certain premises.</p>
<p>The advent of smartphones equipped with fingerprint sensors has furthered the customer experience and fortified personal device security. Users can unlock their phones, authenticate payments, and secure apps by simply touching a sensor. This biometric authentication offers convenient access control and security while remaining cost effective.</p>
<p>Smart ID cards incorporating fingerprint biometrics are increasingly used in various sectors</p>
 
 Not surprisingly, government and military operations make frequent use of this type of biometric security. 
 However, an automated fingerprint identification system can also be employed in the healthcare industry to allow individuals to gain access to restricted areas. 
 Employees in the education sector can use fingerprint biometrics to enter schools and universities. 
 The corporate world can use this technology to prevent identity theft. 
 Financial systems also integrate fingerprint biometrics, adding a layer of protection over transactions and access to financial services. It helps reduce fraud and ensure customer trust, making it a valuable tool in banking and financial security. 
 
<p>As these real-world case studies illustrate successful implementations of fingerprint identification and other security biometrics. These include visa applications and the distribution of government benefits. Whether securing a company’s computer systems and premises or identifying criminals, fingerprint biometrics have proven their value and substantially impacted security.</p>
 Beyond the Horizon: Future Trends and Innovations in Fingerprint Biometrics 
<p>Fingerprint biometrics, like all technologies, continues to evolve. Several trends and innovations promise to enhance the capabilities and applicability of this technology.</p>
<p>The most recent advancements include 3D fingerprint imaging, which provides a more detailed fingerprint representation that enhances accuracy. Anti-spoofing techniques are also being developed to combat attempts at tricking fingerprint sensors with fake digital fingerprints too.</p>
<p>Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning offers immense possibilities. These technologies can help improve voice recognition algorithms, making them more highly accurate and adaptable.</p>
<p>Despite these advancements, it’s essential to acknowledge that striking a balance between security and privacy with fingerprint technologies remains challenging. As biometric techniques evolve, unfortunately, so will privacy concerns.</p>
 Diversifying Biometric Security: Face and Iris Recognition 
<p>While fingerprints are common biometric security, they aren’t the only biometric technology method available. For instance, facial recognition technology and iris scanning add more layers of protection.</p>
 Facial recognition 
<p>Facial recognition technology uses machine learning algorithms to identify individuals based on their facial features. This technology has seen an increase in use in recent years, especially in surveillance systems and mobile devices. Despite concerns about privacy and misuse, facial recognition is undeniably a powerful tool in biometrics and homeland security.</p>
 Iris scanning 
<p>Another form of biometric identification is iris scanning. This technique scans a person’s irises using infrared technology and analyzes their individual patterns. Iris scans offer a higher level of security due to the iris’s complex structure, which remains stable throughout an individual’s life. However, it can be more expensive and more complicated to implement than other forms of biometrics.</p>
<p>Integrating these methods with fingerprint biometrics can create a multi-modal biometric system, providing businesses with businesses more reliable and robust security.</p>

 Towards radical transparency — between liveability, affordability, and polycrisis <p>This 2nd blogpost of the series marks the next milestone in the collaboration between <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> and the <a href="https://www.ihrb.org/">Institute of Human Rights and Business</a> (IHRB), to increase transparency regarding the largest urban landowners in four European cities (see: <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/urban-land-ownership-mapping-towards-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-1-72ff315fefff?source=collection_tagged---------0----------------------------">Blog 1</a> explaining the project purpose). This study mapped land ownership in Copenhagen (as of August, 2023) aiming to reveal the largest land owners, patterns in management of land, and resulting power dynamics in city space production.</p><p>Through these findings, we also suggest initial ways forward with regards to city space production and ownership transparency. We would love to hear your&nbsp;views.</p> Summary (short&nbsp;read) <p>Transparency is a cross-cutting human rights principle, which helps to strengthen decision-making to enable better outcomes for people. <a href="http://ihrb.org">IHRB </a>is partnering with <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> to identify the largest owners of urban land in four European cities, as part of its project <a href="https://www.ihrb.org/focus-areas/built-environment/building-for-today-and-the-future">Building for Today and the Future</a>. This recognizes that knowledge of who owns space within a city is one important step (in tandem with many others) to strengthen decision-making, as well as social and environmental outcomes.</p><p>Copenhagen is known for its high quality of living, deeply rooted culture of public welfare and participation, resistance to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/29/blackstone-rebellion-how-one-country-worlds-biggest-commercial-landlord-denmark">speculative foreign investments</a> as well as rich urban planning and architectural scene: it is often held up as an example of equitable space production and a “liveable” city. However, in the recent decades, the d<a href="https://www.lars-mueller-publishers.com/architectures-dismantling-and-restructuring">ismantling and restructuring of the Danish Welfare State</a> and private-led urban development patterns have contributed to Copenhagen’s high levels of unaffordability, as well as spatial disparity and <a href="https://www.justiceinitiative.org/voices/q-and-a-my-fight-to-save-my-home-under-denmarks-harsh-ghetto-plan">discrimination</a>. Across Danish cities, the housing cost overburden (reflecting housing cost as a share in disposable income) is the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/digpub/housing/vis/02_02_01/index.html">second highest</a> in Europe (see also the <a href="https://issuu.com/katlotz/docs/rtd_book_single_pages__final/26">Right to Dwell — Un-liveability Trends, KADK&nbsp;2018</a>).</p><p><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/digpub/housing/vis/02_02_01/index.html">Housing in Europe: Housing cost overburden: cities or rural area - Compare your country</a></p><blockquote>→ Data transparency and accessibility in Copenhagen set an example for other cities, as this information is relatively easy to access. However, from our research it is clear that, in contexts such as this, the understanding of the wider city political dynamics, institutional changes, and local actors’ strategic moves are as important, if not more, than the static accessible ownership data registers.</blockquote><p>One might therefore want to call for an additional set of tools to increase the transparency and accountability for decision-making. Tools which unlock greater insights into areas such&nbsp;as:</p>  the reasons for value appreciation of land and properties (e.g. through public infrastructure development — see <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/a-smart-commons-528f4e53cec2">A Smart Commons</a>);  real estate transactions; and;  their main beneficiaries.  <p>As this might sound complex… the data, at least for Copenhagen, is largely&nbsp;there.</p><p>Accessibility to static <a href="https://nyt.ois.dk/search/706756/bpfg/bbr/bygning/856a5e15-195a-4570-b387-68ef85bcf408">datasets</a> (or <a href="https://nyt.ois.dk/map/706756/bpfg">map</a> interfaces — as the Little Mermaid fortunately resting on the municipal soil) sets a good ground for basic analysis of who owns what, which is still an impossible task in most&nbsp;cities.</p><p>However, extending the sensing infrastructures (civic and public) might render a possibility of updating the predominantly debt-driven land-value capture model → (see: <a href="https://www.oecd.org/cfe/cities/land-value-capture.htm">OECD</a>, 2022 &amp; <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cities+for+free&amp;rlz=1C1ONGR_deDE1034DE1034&amp;oq=cities+for+free&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBggAEEUYOzIGCAAQRRg7MggIARAAGBYYHjIICAIQABgWGB4yCAgDEAAYFhgeMgoIBBAAGIYDGIoFMgYIBRBFGD3SAQgyMzgxajBqOagCALACAA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#">Cities for Free</a>) to better serve the greater public and environmental good in the long-term.</p> The blog that follows&nbsp;shares: <blockquote>1.

Analogously, yet in contrast, in collaboration with <a href="https://www.ihrb.org/">IHRB</a>, we looked at the set of policies, interventions &amp; approaches that have defined urban land management in Copenhagen.

Lynetteholmen — New Municipal Land, Mega Projects &amp; Potentials for City-Region Coordination Capacity <p>To further understand the reasons behind the push for developments described by many as risky, environmentally, and socially questionable one needs to zoom out and look at the Copenhagen Metropolitan Area as a whole, which includes 34 municipalities.</p><p>The famous Finger Plan once aimed to ensure the ecological diversity and functionality of the landscape by incorporated green belts with green wedges for recreational and environmental purposes, as well as a strategy for metropolitan expansion along 5 fingers in multiple municipalities. T he plan has been recognized as one of Europe’s best examples of far-sighted and long-term sustainable urban planning.</p><p>In 2015, the responsibility for the FP was handed over from the Ministry of Environment to the Ministry of Industry, Business and Financial Affairs, indicating economic growth as the main function of spatial planning&nbsp;. Apart from the city population growth and political pressures rooted in economic agendas, the green wedges and the structure of the Finger Plan have been challenged by the administrative division of power and interests of the neighbouring municipalities.</p><p>An emblematic example of the regional competition, rather than coordination in the Copenhagen Region can be another island development — Avedøre Holme, promoted by the Hvidovre Municipality, as Europe’s largest business district.</p> C3.

Snapshot from <a href="https://tingbjerghusene.dk/find-bolig/">Tingbjerg Husene website</a> — offering purchase of private houses on a former non-profit land in between existing buildings in the area listed as “<a href="https://www.kk.dk/sites/default/files/agenda/74024d70-9be0-4c3e-9c23-88b3b59bca03/2001eab6-4fc1-46aa-8300-b9488900dfc9-bilag-10.pdf">hard Ghetto</a>” (when the term was still in use) where the amount of non-profit housing needs to be reduced to 40% by executive order. Conclusion <p>Some of the key reflections include:</p>  One of the key insights from studying land ownership in Copenhagen — a place where data transparency and availability is exemplar, is that understanding the processes, institutional changes, and local actors’ strategic moves are as important, if not more, than the accessible ownership data registers.  Despite some of the aforementioned trends, Copenhagen still remains a city with large amounts of land owned by the municipality and non-profit associations. This provides lots of scope for change in face of unaffordability and future cascading crises incl. the need for climate adaptation. Here, an update to the land-value capture model where climate risks are accounted for might be of&nbsp;value.  The celebrated land-value capture model with multiplicity of its sub-mechanisms (infrastructure levy, developer obligations etc.) needs to be analyzed in its nuance. There are multiple forms of capturing value uplift and some might contribute to progressing unaffordability. For example unbalanced sale (by e.g. provision of affordable housing in the same area) of land to the highest bidder to repay infrastructure loans is still based on economic principles inadequate for the ultra-long term planning horizons cities need to look at in face of the cost of living crisis and climate adaptation necessities (see DML’s upcoming report with the Scottish Land Commission (link upcoming)).  - The attempt of fixing spatial segregation issues with neoliberal means (via the sale of non-profit land, or commodification of non-profit housing) has proven to achieve the opposite, exacerbating city-scale spatial inequalities. Dissolution of the vulnerable neighbourhoods with the goal to create a “<a href="https://issuu.com/katlotz/docs/usc">blended city</a>” in the context of decreasing affordability indicators (Fig 1. are going down) may contribute to a) pushing the “problem” to other locations b) contributing to other forms of spatial segregation and c) nimbyism.  Recognition of lack of institutional capacities to host alternative city and <a href="https://issuu.com/katlotz/docs/rtd_book_single_pages__final/92">housing development models</a>. The dominant debt-driven logic of the city and its infrastructure development which privileges premium price housing units is not only caused by the widely presumed single-mindedness of politicians or greed of developers. How the wider systemic context is structured sets a fertile pre-condition for this pattern: the financing sector, insurance, education and skills within municipalities or capacities to imagine alternative futures are just some of&nbsp;them.  European, and global mobilization for sustainable, affordable and liveable cities. Copenhagen is a great city and one could argue if it became more inclusive and more affordable in the current globalized context, it would face even harsher population increases which eventually would prevent affordability.  Lack of a long-term perspective — the greatness of Copenhagen is dictated not by the upscale starchitecture developments. It is the welfare state heydays stemming commons: the bikes, the open libraries with baby worlds, the work-life balance, the time to enjoy the good quality public spaces, the scale of the city, access to water, or Christiania neighbourhood in the middle of the&nbsp;city.  <p>Finally, several complex questions which require further consideration came out of this initial investigation:</p><p>In addition to relatively transparent ownership &amp; transaction <a href="https://nyt.ois.dk/search/100060818/sfe">databases</a>:</p>  How can we increase political, societal sensing and sense-making capacities that allow us to foresee the socio-economic futures of the city based on ongoing developments e.g. on models such as land-value capture?  <p>Responding to findings around Almene boliger / Tingbjerg</p>  What institutional infrastructures can be built to make citizens resilient to gradual institutional changes that may undermine their democratic mandate? (referring to Almene&nbsp;boliger)  <p>Reflecting on the dominance of land value capture&nbsp;logic</p>  What other types of more equitable <a href="https://issuu.com/katlotz/docs/rtd_book_single_pages__final/92">development models can be employed</a>, if the neoliberal paradigm is a contributor rather than a cure to socio-economic urban issues (incl. spatial segregation)&nbsp;?  How can local and national policy, regulation, spatial planning &amp; institutional capacities efficiently support and create favourable context for these alternative models to be efficiently deployed?  <p>Some ways forward to explore — context specific (broked down&nbsp;above)</p>  Radical, dynamic land-value uplif transparency  Capacity for new modes of governance of whole city-region land governance  Capacity to sense policy and econmic activity effects on socio-economic indicators  <p>Further, basing on DML, UNDP collaboration “<a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58727b5a9de4bbf0b38db631/t/5f12f01c4eab05002211f4a0/1595076643699/ExO+A+Way+Forward_System+Transformation+v07+2.pdf">A way Forward</a>”:</p>  New national statistical offices (<a href="https://pat-kane-xcjl.squarespace.com/s/ExO-A-Way-Forward_System-Transformation-v07-2.pdf">see p.&nbsp;32</a>)  New, and radically trasparent digital infrastructures that enable “<a href="https://nowthenmagazine.com/articles/verbs-not-nouns-how-language-can-shape-alternate-worldviews-giyu-tjauvaljian-yu-chieh-wu">noun to verb</a>” planning.

 The Unified Investor App is Coming… 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in October 2023.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>At Tokeny, we’re thrilled to introduce the new white-label&nbsp;Unified Investor App, an all-in-one platform for&nbsp;issuers&nbsp;to provide their investors with a seamless experience to explore, subscribe, and manage digital securities.</p>
<p>In addition,&nbsp;distributors&nbsp;(including broker-dealers, marketplaces, exchanges, etc) can leverage this app as well to streamline operations with a fully digital experience. Distributors will now be able to effectively offer more capabilities and features for their clients to expand reach and easily handle a high volume of activities.</p>
<p>We’ve integrated the entire investor experience into one streamlined web application without needing to go to different links with all needed integrations (e.g., e-signing and liveness KYC solutions, etc.).&nbsp;Investors can now do everything with their digital securities in one place, from onboarding, searching for suitable investment opportunities, and managing their portfolio; thereby, merging the three.</p>
 The Three Features That are Consolidating: 
<p>Discover tokenized securities:&nbsp;The Invest section consists of opportunities that are available to eligible users directly on your platform.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>Qualifying/subscribing:&nbsp;This part of the investor process pertains to KYC/AML checks, document signing, and payments.</p>

		 
	 
                       
	 
		 
			<p>Manage and trade tokenized securities:&nbsp;A dashboard for the investors to visually organize and see in real-time their portfolio, and to conduct peer-to-peer transfers, as well as to access secondary solutions such as Billboard and exchanges.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			 This consolidation offers several advantages: 
 
 All-in-one UX:&nbsp;A complete and fully digital dashboard simplifying the investor’s journey. It leverages the blockchain infrastructure to make actions possible directly on the buy-side: get qualified, find opportunities, invest, redeem, trade, access asset data, etc. 
 Easier access to liquidity:&nbsp;Investors can access liquidity solutions such as centralized exchanges that issuers authorized,&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-billboard/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--erKLTEKUWtOo_kuIOhCTreB70d4vEcyXFIWVkhInQ6fpqku7RQ6HNNNTzvl-FPtXkFZ9g">T-REX billboard</a>&nbsp;(our white-label secondary market solution for digital securities), or even DeFi protocols. 
 Secure and scalable: The cloud-based platform doesn’t require any maintenance from the operator. It is secure and scalable thanks to Tokeny’s scalable infrastructure. 
 
 How do Issuers and Distributors Benefit? 
<p>Beyond elevating the investor experience, our white-label enterprise platform significantly benefits issuers and distributors alike.</p>
<p>Issuers:&nbsp;From the issuer’s perspective, the platform seamlessly integrates the entire investor journey to reduce investors’ drop rate due to redundant processes and attract more digital-first investors, from onboarding to transferability options.</p>
<p>Distributors: The Unified Investor App is white-label, offering these distributors the opportunity to provide a branded all-in-one distribution platform to their investors. They can list carefully curated digital securities, enabling their audience to subscribe. They can qualify investors, and validate transfers with the same workflows as traditional methods, but with the added benefit of a fully digital and real-time experience.</p>
 Currently in Beta Testing 
<p>The Unified Investor Application is set to launch its first version in November, introducing a groundbreaking technological workflow that allows&nbsp;investors, issuers, and distributors to manage and navigate everything seamlessly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No longer will investors have to use separate dedicated landing pages for utilizing all of these different features, it will all happen in one place.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for our beta set to go live in the near future. We can’t wait for you to experience the convenience and seamless benefits.</p>
<p>Interested in being a beta tester, please contact us&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/contact/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--erKLTEKUWtOo_kuIOhCTreB70d4vEcyXFIWVkhInQ6fpqku7RQ6HNNNTzvl-FPtXkFZ9g">here</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, stay tuned for next month’s edition!</p>

<p>Many crypto wallets are out on the market, but they don't all have the same capabilities. They may be specific to a particular ecosystem or lack dapp functionality. But what if there were a way to expand a wallet's abilities to surpass these limitations? </p><p>The Filecoin network has only a few native wallet clients. How can we increase the adoption of the Filecoin network so developers and users can access the ecosystem while also integrating the benefits of the EVM? <a href="https://metamask.io/snaps/">Metamask's Snaps</a> are one way to add custom functionality to a widely used wallet.</p> Understanding Filecoin Wallet Addresses <p>First, for clarity, let's review some <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/wallet-stack/">wallet terminology</a>. Wallets can contain multiple accounts. Each account has an address. Think of it like a bank account with a checking account number. </p><p>Getting more technical, wallets have Secret Recovery Phrases. Accounts are derived from SRPs, creating private keys that control the account. Addresses are public and are tied to the transactions executed over the blockchain.</p><p>Filecoin has five types of addresses. The ones we'll focus on are F1 and F4. F1 is the Filecoin native address for transactions done solely over the Filecoin network. F4 is the FEVM address. FEVM, or the Filecoin Ethereum Virtual Machine, allows developers to port any existing EVM-based smart contracts straight onto the FVM. The F4 address is a translation layer to the EVM ecosystem. &nbsp;</p><p>EVM-compatible wallets support native Ethereum addresses (Ox) and F4 addresses. But what if you want to send Filecoin from a native F1 address to an F4 or Ox address to take advantage of the FEVM ecosystem? And what if that same wallet could support native FIL transactions?</p> Introducing Filsnap <p>Filsnap is a MetaMask plugin, or <a href="https://metamask.io/snaps/">snap</a>, that adds support for Filecoin native accounts and functionality. MetaMask only supports the EVM ecosystem, so Fission's plugin enables users to utilize MetaMask as a Filecoin wallet.</p><p>Filecoin native wallet: Filsnap can send transactions and receive assets using F1 addresses.</p><p>F1 to F4: Say a person has a wallet supporting only Filecoin native F1 addresses. The user could send their assets to Filsnap and, from there, send assets to F4 addresses. The same goes for exchanges like Coinbase, which doesn't support F4 addresses yet. </p><p>F4 to F1: Say a user wants to withdraw yield from a liquidity pool and put it in cold storage. They can send assets from an F4 address in the Filsnap wallet to the cold wallet that supports F1 addresses via a FilForwarder smart contract. This contract translates from FEVM to native.</p> The Filsnap Library <p>Although Filecoin JS libraries were already available, we chose not to reuse them for a few reasons. First, MetaMask is constantly changing, and we wanted to ensure the code was as up-to-date as possible. Second, the existing libraries are big and weighed down by many dependencies. A lightweight wallet client is preferred for a better user experience when working with the blockchain. Third, because we take security so seriously, we had all of the cryptography dependencies in our library independently audited for peace of mind.</p><p>The new <a href="https://github.com/hugomrdias/iso-repo/tree/main/packages/iso-filecoin">Filecoin JavaScript Library - iso-filecoin</a> is the foundation for three packages - Filsnap, Filsnap Adapter, and Filsnap Adapter React. <a href="https://github.com/filecoin-project/filsnap/tree/master/packages/snap">Filsnap</a> is the snap installed in the MetaMask extension. <a href="https://github.com/filecoin-project/filsnap/tree/master/packages/adapter">Filsnap Adapter</a> enables developers to interact with Filsnap from a dapp. Finally, <a href="https://github.com/filecoin-project/filsnap/tree/master/packages/adapter-react">Filsnap Adapter React</a> includes React-specific hooks for dapp integration. &nbsp;</p><p>As mentioned, there are few native Filecoin wallets, and the existing ones don't expose their functionality to dapps. Filsnap, however, has an API for transactions on the native layer, enabling developers to build apps with native Filecoin functionality! </p> The Filsnap Demo <p>The Filsnap demo supports Filecoin native and FEVM transactions using either Filsnap for native or Metamask for EVM. As mentioned above, it's a great way to manage your assets despite the current technical limitations in wallets and exchanges. <a href="https://filecointldr.io/article/guide-how-to-transfer-fil-from-coinbase-to-a-metamask-wallet-0x">It used to be much more complicated</a>, but now you can do it all in the Filsnap demo app.</p><p>Another benefit of using the Filsnap demo app is security through verifiability. Anyone can verify the snap installed in Metamask through <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/filsnap/v/0.3.2#user-content-provenance">NPM Provenance</a> and the app code using <a href="https://bafybeihevfatvsypn35ywbloc4vrjpjpk5akhqv7yi4d7mrahzaaatcmp4.ipfs.dweb.link/">IPFS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/filecoin-project/filsnap/actions/runs/5984204522/attempts/1#summary-16235152758">GitHub</a>.</p>Release Information: https://filsnap.fission.app/<p>Every app release and git tag is published to IPFS using <a href="https://guide.fission.codes/developers/cli/working-with-apps">Fission apps</a> and can be cloned/forked from <a href="https://github.com/filecoin-project/filsnap">GitHub</a> if a user wishes to self-host or verify integrity using content addressing.</p> Getting Started <p>The Filsnap package has been audited, and the <a href="https://metamask.io/snaps/">MetaMask Snaps are now in open beta</a>.</p><p>The Fission team, lead by Hugo Dias, implemented the audited Filsnap as part of a contract with Protocol Labs.

 Project Polaris: Navigating Offline Payments with CBDC — A High-Level Design&nbsp;Guide <p>We are excited to introduce the “Project Polaris: Navigating Offline Payments with CBDC — A High-Level Design Guide,” the fourth installment in the groundbreaking Project Polaris series by the BIS Innovation Hub. This report is a culmination of collaboration, research, and expertise, and it offers a profound exploration into the intricate world of offline payments with Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). SWN Global has been an active participant in this endeavor, joining forces with prominent organizations like BitMint, Crunchfish, FIS Global, M10 Networks, Giesecke+Devrient, Google, IBM, and IDEMIA to contribute to this comprehensive guide.</p><p>Key Highlights:</p><p>Complexity of Offline Payments: Designing offline payments with CBDC is a complex challenge, marked by intricate trade-offs and unique requirements for each central bank. The report acknowledges that some challenges are not easily resolved, given the diversity of central banks’&nbsp;needs.</p><p>Deepening Knowledge: Building on the foundational insights provided by the earlier handbook, the guide’s primary goal is to deepen the understanding of central banks regarding the underlying technology of offline payments with&nbsp;CBDC.</p><p>Workshop Insights: The report draws on the knowledge and wisdom gathered through a series of workshops conducted between May and September 2023. These workshops, in collaboration with 12 solution vendors and 6 observing central banks, reinforced and expanded upon the conclusions of the earlier handbook.</p><p>Key Conclusions: The guide reinforces the importance of offline payments with CBDC for central banks and underlines the need to consider design choices that encompass the entire solution. It acknowledges the presence of trade-offs between various requirements and suggests that an iterative approach to design is essential.</p><p>Evolving Solutions: Recognizing that solutions for offline payments with CBDC are still in an evolutionary phase, the guide notes that very few are production-ready or operating at scale in live environments. However, it highlights the existence of several mature&nbsp;pilots.</p><p>Collaboration and Innovation: Central banks are positioned to be driving forces for collaboration and innovation in the CBDC ecosystem. The report encourages central banks to engage with solution vendors and other potential participants in the CBDC landscape.</p><p>Comprehensive Coverage: The guide provides in-depth coverage of the current solution and technology landscape, outlines the critical design choices that shape offline solutions, and offers practical examples for central banks to tailor their designs to their unique needs. It touches on essential aspects, including resilience, inclusion, privacy, risk management, device security, and&nbsp;limits.</p><p>The insights and knowledge contained within this guide extend beyond offline payments and can also be applied to address issues related to identity, payments with commercial bank money, wallets, and infrastructure for regulated stablecoins.</p><p>Our company is proud to have actively participated in the deep dive event that led to the creation of this report, alongside distinguished partners such as BitMint, Crunchfish, FIS Global, M10 Networks, Giesecke+Devrient, Google, IBM, and IDEMIA.

 Discover all about the darkest form of identity theft, and how to protect your company from the threat of ghosting fraudsters. 



 



<p>Have you ever been ghosted or a victim of ‘ghosting fraud’?&nbsp;</p>



<p>While ‘ghosting’ is widely known as the sudden and random disappearance of a potential suitor, the term ‘ghosting fraud’ refers to something far darker.&nbsp;Ghosting fraud describes the theft and fraudulent use of a deceased person’s personal information.</p>



<p>One of the most notorious cases of ghosting fraud happened in 2016 in Florida, US. Two fraudsters managed to hack into a computer system, and access the records of the deceased to collect names, addresses, birth dates, and social security numbers, which they used to commit tax fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By filing multiple fake tax returns, the two scammers received fraudulent refund checks worth millions. This was all at the expense of the IRS, which had no idea that these identities were fraudulent, or even that these people were deceased.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While it’s unknown how many identities the fraudsters stole, they were ordered to pay back over <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdfl/pr/two-broward-residents-sentenced-12-and-11-years-prison-stolen-identity-tax-fraud-scheme">$1.26 million</a>, and sentenced to 11 and 12 years respectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although it’s shocking, this isn’t the only story of its kind. In fact, as the cost of living rises, ghosting fraud is becoming increasingly common.</p>



 What is ghosting fraud? 



<p>Ghosting fraud is the term used to describe a form of identity theft, where perpetrators impersonate a deceased person for financial gain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fraudsters will use a deceased individual’s name, address, and other confidential information to open up new lines of credit, take out loans, or, as the example above, request tax refunds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ghosting fraud is made possible thanks to vulnerabilities and failures in internal controls, record keeping and monitoring systems, as well as lags in system updates. In the UK, for example, relatives have up to <a href="https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/death/practical-arrangements-after-a-death/registering-a-death/">twelve months</a> to register a death.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s worse though, is that in some regions, credit unions and lenders won’t know of a customer’s death unless they receive a dedicated phone call from a relative. Of course, this is not often a priority for grieving family members. Lenders have been known to keep lines of credit open – and charge interest – for years without an official death notification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, it’s not necessarily the individuals of the deceased that should be most concerned, but businesses. Unlike <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/romance-fraud/">romance scams</a>, ghosting fraud doesn’t hinge on social engineering, but rather knowledge of the customer.</p>



<p>More on that later.&nbsp;</p>



 What are the different types of ghosting fraud?&nbsp; 



<p>Within the realm of ghosting fraud, there are three common scams to be aware of:</p>



 Credit fraud. 



<p>Credit fraud in this context can work in two separate ways. The first involves someone close to the deceased, who has physical access to their credit accounts. Here, the perpetrator simply starts using the credit cards of the deceased without notifying the provider of their death.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Secondly, credit fraud can happen when external scammers get hold of the details of the deceased. By accessing information such as their name, date of birth and social security number, the fraudster has all the information they need to apply for new accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the US, approximately <a href="https://business.time.com/2012/04/24/grave-robbing-2-5-million-dead-people-get-their-identities-stolen-every-year/">800,000 cases of ghosting fraud</a> happen every year for the purposes of opening new lines of credit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Companies that should be most concerned about credit fraud are credit providers, such as credit card companies or lenders. Without specific identity checks in place or a tool to flag suspicious signals, these financial institutions stand to lose the most from ghosting fraudsters.&nbsp;</p>



 Tax fraud. 



<p>Ghosting fraud can also affect tax authorities on a global scale. Here, criminals get hold of deceased individuals’ details, and file false tax statements in order to generate refund checks.</p>



<p>Tax fraud with ‘ghost details’ primarily affects the tax authority in the country it is happening. This year, the IRS identified approximately <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/17/irs-flagged-more-than-1-million-tax-returns-for-identity-fraud-in-2023.html">12,617 cases of identity theft tax fraud</a> in the US, leading to refunds of over $6.3 billion. And unfortunately, it’s highly likely that this is only the tip of the iceberg, with a high proportion of cases still undiscovered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Workplace data breach. 



<p>It might not be your first thought when someone says ghosting fraud, but workplace data breaches are also high risk when an employee dies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One famous data breach at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/technology/twitter-hack-bill-gates-elon-musk.html">Twitter in 2020</a>, for example, led to over $800,000 in losses and a drop in the share price. It happened because fraudsters convinced employees that they were part of the security team, and needed to verify the identity of the workers by getting their passwords when the company moved to remote work. The fraudsters then began tweeting links to cryptocurrency scams from high-profile and celebrity accounts, generating hundreds of thousands in profit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the same vein, scammers can use the log-in details of deceased employees if their accounts have not been shut down by their employers.</p>



<p>Alongside the threat of huge financial consequences, falling victim to ghosting fraud might also result in reputational damage, and make it hard for businesses to attract new customers.</p>



<p>Large corporations can’t rely on death notifications from family members or on third party log-in software. Instead, continuous monitoring is key in preventing fraudulent access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What are the key fraud challenges for companies? 



<p>While the vast majority of ghosting fraudsters are seasoned scammers, others might be family members looking to exploit their relative’s death. This makes the fraud even harder to fight against.</p>



<p>A major challenge for some businesses is that sophisticated fraudsters can easily bypass outdated identification methods, such as only requiring details like date of birth and social security numbers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This should be a key concern for organizations, and they should prioritize updating their identity verification services to reflect the threat of ghosting fraud, among other types of scams, such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/money-laundering-threat-online-casinos/">money laundering</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 How to detect and prevent ghosting fraud. 



<p>While death registers may be still stuck in the stone ages, that does not mean your organization needs to be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Entrust the detection and prevention of ghosting fraud to a dedicated fraud prevention and identity verification platform like IDnow.</p>



<p>Our six-pronged approach to data checks involves:</p>



  A derogatory financial score<br>  Property data<br>  Vulnerability data<br>  Application data<br>  Geo-affordability&nbsp;<br>  And all-important mortality data: to ensure that the applicant is not deceased, and is therefore who they say they are  



<p>Alongside mortality data, IDnow conducts <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">Know Your Customer checks</a> for a comprehensive overview of who your customers are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ongoing monitoring, through <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/strong-customer-authentication">Strong Customer Authentication</a>, allows our clients to comply with regulatory requirements. Our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/">identity verification services</a> combine <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/biometric-checks-at-the-airport-ready-to-board/">biometric information</a> (such as face ID or a fingerprint) and possessions (such as a code sent to their mobile phone) alongside knowledge, for better validity in customer identity checks.&nbsp;</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 18th October to 30th&nbsp;October <p>Welcome to the latest Veriscope Regulatory Recap. In this issue, we’ll explore the US stance on cryptocurrency mixers, the UK’s new legislation on illicit crypto, Taiwan’s initial steps into crypto regulation, and Turkey’s progress on the crypto front. Let’s dive&nbsp;in!</p> Major Global Crypto Regulatory Developments Unveiled <p>The US: As regulatory scrutiny tightens, FinCEN is eyeing increased transparency measures for crypto “mixers.”</p><p>The UK: Meanwhile, the UK has given royal assent to a bill that arms law enforcement with the power to seize crypto linked to crime. Introduced last September, the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill addresses a spectrum of crimes and enables asset seizure without a formal conviction.</p><p>Taiwan: Amidst global regulatory shifts, Taiwan steps into the crypto regulatory arena with a bill presented to the Legislative Yuan. This draft legislation seeks to define operational standards and emphasizes industry affiliations. Notably, it flags potential divergences between crypto derivatives and traditional finance, hinting at tailored regulations down the&nbsp;line.</p><p>Turkey: Positioned between Europe and Asia, Turkey is charting its regulatory course. Their recent Presidential Annual Program hints at a structured crypto framework by 2024, encompassing clear legal definitions and tax guidelines, though details are still under&nbsp;wraps.</p><p>Now, with this global panorama in view, let’s delve deeper into a couple of these significant shifts and explore their broader implications for the crypto ecosystem.</p> UK Passes Law to Seize Illicit Crypto&nbsp;Assets <p>The UK’s new Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill addresses cryptocurrencies linked to illicit activities like money laundering, drug trafficking, terrorism, and cybercrimes.</p><p>One of the key provisions of the bill permits swift recovery of crime-associated crypto assets without conviction. Lawmakers expect this would enhance the capability of law enforcement agencies for quicker and more impactful asset seizures.</p><p>On the upside, this bolsters security and trust in the UK’s cryptocurrency landscape, aiming to shield consumers, appeal to institutional investors, and align with international norms. Conversely, these measures could risk overreach, infringing on individual rights, and potentially stifle innovation. There’s also the concern of unintentional asset seizures from innocent individuals, posing legal and reputational issues.</p> FinCEN Proposes New Regulation for Crypto&nbsp;Mixers <p>The US Department of the Treasury’s financial crimes unit is considering the designation of crypto mixers as a primary concern for money laundering, given their potential use by malicious actors like cybercriminals and terror&nbsp;groups.</p><p>If greenlit, financial firms would be mandated to report suspicious mixer-related transactions, possibly leading to further restrictions in their dealings with these mixers. This comes after US sanctions on mixers like Tornado Cash and Blender and increasing concerns over illegal crypto&nbsp;use.</p><a href="https://x.com/shyftnetwork/status/1715427363045982413?s=20">Image Source</a><p>The proposed rule, which will be open to public feedback for 90 days, is part of FinCEN’s efforts in the crypto market&nbsp;domain.</p><p>While this initiative aims to highlight potentially dubious transactions, it might inadvertently affect legitimate users who prioritize privacy. Additionally, the increasing scrutiny might elevate operational costs for financial entities and challenge the intrinsic privacy values of the crypto&nbsp;sphere.</p> Reminder: Shape DeFi’s Future with the Shyft Network&nbsp;Survey! <p>Your opinion matters in shaping the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape.

<p>On November 29, 2022, AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/announcing-aws-kms-external-key-store-xks/">announced</a> the eXternal Key Store (XKS) capability for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/">AWS Key Management Service (KMS)</a>. It allows customers who have a regulatory need to store and control their encryption keys on-premises or outside of the AWS cloud to do so through AWS KMS. As a result, customers can use their existing hardware security module (HSM) infrastructure to effectively store and manage their AWS KMS <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide">Customer Managed Keys</a> (CMKs) on-premises or at any location of their choice.</p>
<p>Customers are therefore able to easily encrypt data with externally managed keys with their applications and more than <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/features/#AWS_Service_Integration">100 AWS services</a>.</p>
<p>In a previous blog titled <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/12/ownership-control-and-possession-a-new-aws-feature-for-key-management-with-the-cloud/">Ownership, Control, and Possession – A New AWS Feature For Key Management with the Cloud,</a> we focused on AWS KMS XKS integration with the Entrust enterprise key and secrets management solution KeyControl. In this blog, we’ll provide more detail relating to the AWS KMS XKS integration directly with an Entrust nShield HSM.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When data is encrypted for a customer within AWS, a unique data encryption key is generated, which is then encrypted with a CMK following a scheme known as <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#enveloping">envelope encryption</a>. XKS enables this CMK to be protected and managed externally, such as within a tamper resistant and FIPS 140-2 Level 3 or FIPS 140-3 Level 31 certified HSM.</p>
<p>Instead of storing and managing the CMKs entirely within AWS KMS, with XKS they are additionally encrypted by an external key which resides and remains entirely outside the AWS cloud and under the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/keystore-external.html#xks-how-it-works">sole control of the customer organization</a>.</p>
<p>Customers are responsible for providing and managing the infrastructure necessary to securely hold and manage such external keys themselves, which does introduce an additional operational burden and some greater risks to availability and performance. However, this can enable cloud use cases for several regulated workloads where encryption keys are required to be directly held by specific organizations and/or in particular geographic jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Controlling access to these externally managed CMKs provides for a customer “break glass” capability so that they can easily control access and use of CMKs supplied to their applications and other AWS services. By disabling or removing access to the externally stored key, data within the cloud can be rendered inaccessible on a temporary or permanent basis.</p>
<p>Customers have two options for building infrastructure to integrate with AWS KMS XKS:</p>
 
 Customers can use an AWS KMS XKS proxy, which is provided as <a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-kms-xks-proxy">sample code online</a>. This option uses the Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS)#11 interface in order to support any compatible hardware security module. Entrust nShield HSMs integrate with PKCS#11 compatible applications and are already deployed within organizations and enterprises for keeping their cryptographic key material protected on-premises. 
 Several organizations (including Entrust) offer multi-cloud key management systems, that can interface with a number of cloud service providers (CSPs), including AWS, for importing and managing CMKs using a Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) approach, as well as enabling usage of CMKs through XKS with the Hold Your Own Key (HYOK) approach. These provide customers with a comprehensive lifecycle management capability and a single platform for consistent operations of multiple key types across an organization. Typically, they also use an HSM for protecting the keys within such system. 
 
<p>Using Entrust nShield HSMs in conjunction with an AWS KMS XKS proxy can be straightforwardly achieved using a suitable configuration file that references the PKCS#11 library, allowing the proxy code to work with any number of nShield Security World AES-256 keys. For increased availability, and to maintain the continued operation of applications and integrated AWS Services dependent on XKS managed CMKs, it is recommended to deploy the AWS KMS XKS proxy and nShield HSMs in multiple locations or geographies.</p>
<p>With either deployment type, internet bandwidth requirements will need to be measured, monitored, and accommodated to ensure that any network bottlenecks introduced using the AWS KMS XKS proxy or key management system do not impede or impact the operation of applications running on AWS.</p>
<p>Not all data classification categories will require external storage of keys, so AWS recommend only using this capability for scenarios where there is a regulatory or compliance need – for example, keep minimal data protected by XKS to meet requirements, but continue using AWS KMS CMKs for the rest of your data.&nbsp;It is important to remember that if an external key is permanently lost or deleted, any ciphertext encrypted under the associated KMS keys will be unrecoverable.</p>
<p>So, if you are already using AWS services and thinking about utilizing their KMS XKS capability or are planning to migrate to the cloud in the near future and are concerned about the impact of the control of your cryptographic keys, consider <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/hsm/products/nshield-hsms">Entrust nShield HSMs</a> in conjunction with AWS KMS XKS.</p>
 
<p>Note 1: nShield <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/modules-in-process/Modules-In-Process-List">5c</a> and 5s FIPS 140-3 certifications currently FIPS pending (In coordination)</p>

<p>Munich, October 30, 2023 – IDnow, a leading identity verification platform provider in Europe, in collaboration with the International Air Transport Association (<a href="https://www.iata.org/">IATA</a>) and other industry partners, supported the first integrated digital identity travel experience, streamlining the process from flight shopping to arrival. The demonstration took place on a journey from London Heathrow (LHR) to Rome Fiumicino (FCO) with British Airways.</p>



<p>“Working closely on this project with IATA and the other partners underlines our commitment to a future travel experience that is digital, efficient, and seamless. The integrated journey we demonstrated at the World Passenger Symposium in Chicago paves the way for simpler and more seamless travel experiences,” says Dr Heinrich Grave, Senior Vice President Digital Identity at IDnow.</p>



<p>“Thank you to IDnow for their collaboration in demonstrating the first fully integrated digital identity travel experience, from shopping for flights to arrival. Our goal has always been a future of travel that’s fully digital and secured with biometric identification. Though we’ve had the technology for individual steps, bringing them together has been a challenge. Today, with the support of our partners, we’ve shown it’s achievable. This is a significant stride towards simpler and smoother travel experiences in the future,” says Nick Careen, IATA’s Senior Vice President for Operations, Safety and Security.</p>



<p>Key highlights of the digital travel experience include:</p>



  Personalised Offers: Leveraging data, such as loyalty card details stored securely in digital wallets, to curate personalised offers for travellers.  Simplified Orders: Streamlined order generation that eliminates the need for traditional tickets, storing all essential journey details in a verifiable digital credential accessible via a QR code.  Effortless Travel Requirements Check: Pre-journey processes to confirm travel requirements, backed by IATA’s Timatic system.  “Ready to Fly” Simplifying and Securing Check-ins: Enhancing the check-in process by sharing necessary digital documents with the airline, ensuring passengers are ready for their journey.  Contactless Airport Experiences: The potential for a hands-free airport experience, facilitated through biometric gates, from security checks to boarding.  



<p>IDnow supported the project with its <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">IDnow Wallet</a>. The IDnow Wallet is used for storing and presenting digital travel credentials, such as boarding passes and Digital Travel Authorizations, such as digital visas. IDnow also provides the remote identity verification solution that is used when the passenger enrolls for digital credentials in the wallet solution.</p>



<p>The LHR-FCO journey serves as a <a href="https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/2023-releases/2023-10-25-02/">“Proof of Concept” incubated in the IATA Innovation Lab</a>. IDnow remains dedicated to such innovative collaborations that aim to push the boundaries of what is possible in the aviation industry.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Neuenschwander</a></p>Recently, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg demonstrated in captivating detail a working beta version of photorealistic—or rather, video realistic—avatars in the metaverse. Zuckerberg also claims that this technology will begin rolling out this year (2023) and will be at a consumer price point by the end of 2024. Even during the podcast, the conversation with host Lex Fridman turned almost immediately to the ramifications this technology will have on identity, security, and society. This report covers KuppingerCole Analysts’ viewpoints on how the coming metaverse will impact current distributed identity and sovereign identity systems and what new technologies are likely to emerge.

<p>Shared finance is defined by Forrester Research as: “Any situation in which a person acts as an observer of, partner in, or proxy for another person's finances" (Forrester, 2021). The clearest examples that fit this definition are standard joint checking accounts and shared credit cards, which are extremely common and offered by most if not all financial institutions to their customers. However, in reality, shared finance spans many use cases beyond a typical married couple’s joint finances. Examples include: parent-child finances, financial co-parenting between separated or divorced individuals who share a child, management of accounts for elderly relatives by proxy, roommates pooling funds to share common bills such as rent and utilities, and more. Many of these financial relationships are less clear-cut, grant different levels of access to different users, and their duration may vary from months to years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is value to be found for both customers and financial services organizations in each of these use cases, but this evolving approach to money management also presents a variety of challenges for financial institutions.</p>

<p>"We should hold a protest outside the Mayor's office."</p><p>So began a typical conversation at a political action meeting I attended in 2015. The discussion frequently went one of two ways. One option was disagreement — someone may raise a concern or objection like "Why should we focus on the Mayor's office when we should be trying to reach people in more populated areas?" or "We need to focus on fundraising right now, not action." Such disagreements could cascade into potentially endless debates, consuming our limited meeting time and rarely leading to consensus. Another, and in my opinion worse, option was lack of debate. A few might voice approval, and then someone would declare: "It looks like we have consensus." Over time, I grew wary of that phrase because it was almost always a lie. Rather than reflecting genuine commitment, universal approval, or even general non-opposition, it signified a group of people hesitant to face the potential discord of scenario #1. Consequently, only a few enthusiastic individuals would participate, later resenting those who abstained from a plan "the group" had supposedly endorsed.</p><p>This phenomenon is, in my experience, typical for most groups that lack explicit decision-making systems, and to some extent even those that do. I view coordination issues as central to every aspect of civil life, and its challenges as a major barrier toward prosperity. In the case of grassroots activism, I find it especially disheartening to see so many people willing to freely contribute their time toward helping others, but end up struggling with effective collaboration. The problem of how to make decisions is not new to humanity, and there are a plethora of prescriptions including various forms of despotism, democracy, and consensus. I mention the group above because its chaotic nature illustrates the organizing problem in its purest form, but I have participated in many groups with a range of structures, including traditional corporate hierarchies, Parliamentary Procedure, and Sociocracy, and in every case I have witnessed profound dissatisfaction and conflict over decision-making.</p><p>The core problem lies in balancing cohesion with scale. As more individuals participate in a decision, communication challenges escalate, potential conflicts multiply, and individuals feel their influence wane. This leads larger groups, typically, to either fail or centralize power in the hands of a smaller group of decision-makers. Even with the purest intentions, these decision-makers cannot truly harmonize vast, diverse opinions. Inevitably, they end up enforcing their chosen resolutions rather than fostering genuine consensus. Cohesion, then, arises from coercion, either overtly through force and incentives or subtly via social pressures.</p> Scaling Without Centralized Decision-Making <p>But there are some who believe it is possible to achieve group cohesion without central leadership, even at scale. They hold the dream of entire organizations, nations, and even the whole world working together and solving shared problems horizontally. Advances in internet accessibility have spurred experiments in "e-democracy," such as the citizen-generated legislation tool <a href="https://info.vtaiwan.tw/?ref=blog.holochain.org">vTaiwan</a>, Occupy Movement-inspired <a href="https://www.loomio.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Loomio</a>, and the <a href="https://pol.is/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Polis</a> polling system. Additionally, a growing academic discourse, notably <a href="https://www.ieee-jas.net/en/article/doi/10.1109/JAS.2022.105617?ref=blog.holochain.org">LSGDM</a> ("Large-Scale Group Decision Making") predominantly from Chinese universities, aims to improve collaboration among myriad stakeholders from businesses, state agencies and the public.</p><p>In 2017, I set out to make my own software to address these issues. I envisioned a user-friendly suite of digital tools that could transform any group of like-minded individuals into a cohesive organization without centralized decision-making. I gradually developed a three-part model based on research in game theory and LSGDM, my own experience, and a mediation process called <a href="https://convergentfacilitation.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Convergent Facilitation</a>. I also pulled ideas from scientific research on how birds, ants and even children manage to work together without designated leaders or concrete rules.</p><p>This package consisted of three interoperable tools:</p>  Mobilization Tool: Rooted in the principle of contingent agreement, this feature enables users to propose collective actions or events. With it, anyone can suggest a joint action or event, which other people can agree to on the contingency that every necessary role is filled. This allows group action to grow effortlessly from idea to reality without anyone having to worry about its viability. It can be used in a wide variety of contexts from hosting a party with friends to forming business agreements.  Deliberation Tool: Focused on consensus-building, this tool allows stakeholders to shift focus from outcomes to refining a set of criteria that has maximal support. Using this list, they can evaluate and refine proposals to meet those broadly supported criteria. Use cases have included forming covid policy for a school and deciding how to use a large monetary donation.  Strategy Building Tool: Designed for infinitely detailed and broad strategy mapping, this tool facilitates the construction of intertwined multi-step strategies. Participants can outline their goals as sequential phases within a grander scheme, and also identify shared objectives with others.  <p>All three pieces are designed to be used in conjunction. Deliberations and actions can be linked to goals, and actions can be linked to deliberations.&nbsp;</p><p>Once I had a basic version of each tool, I approached a handful of groups to test them, including activists, Nonprofits, and intentional communities. Several groups used them and offered feedback. I steadily improved and simplified the processes, and as I did so, I began to see their potential to achieve truly decentralized organization.</p> Why Holochain? <p>Despite several successes, a few challenges soon emerged. First, many of these groups wanted their information to be completely secure — that meant heavy encryption and private servers. Second, they had no money to pay for those servers. I did not intend to profit from these tools, but it became difficult to host new instances of my software for every group that was interested. I also realized that if my technology was ever to be used by large groups, that system was untenable.</p><p>That’s one reason I decided to move to Holochain. If I, or an organization I created, owned and controlled the software, it would exist only as long as I could support it. Investing in a structure to support group coordination requires trust, and it would help if that trust didn’t rely on the stability of one person or company. Furthermore, Holochain addressed another problem: with traditional architecture, I would have the power, and in some cases legal responsibility, to monitor and censor users. For a system to provide real liberatory power, it couldn’t be run this way. A platform designed for individuals to organize horizontally requires infrastructure that is also horizontal. With Holochain, the platform can be completely controlled and powered by its users. Moreover, as a designer and developer, I am free to focus my energy on improving the tools, without worrying about bureaucracy or scaling.</p><p>So far, I have developed two of the three tools for Holochain — "Who’s in?” to mobilize people for events or joint actions, and “Converge”, for deliberating and making collective decisions.&nbsp;</p><p>To download and try these apps, visit: <a href="https://dcan.app/?ref=blog.holochain.org">https://dcan.app/</a></p> Who's In?: A Mobilization Tool <p>With Who’s In?, anyone can add suggested actions which can be joined by anyone in your network. They can add necessary roles for an action, and other members can commit to participating if the action gains necessary support.</p><p>Watch the Who's In? demo.</p> Converge: A Deliberation Tool <p>With the Converge app, you can start a new deliberation that anyone else in your network can join. Anyone can add and evaluate criteria, as well as add and evaluate proposals against those criteria. Controversial criteria can be objected to and alternatives can be proposed and accepted.</p><p>Watch the Converge demo.</p> Strategy Building Tool <p>The strategy mapping tool will be released soon. It will allow users to list goals they might share with others, as well as sub-goals and sub-sub-goals, and so on. These goals may then be adopted by other users, creating a unified list of popular goals. This makes it easy to see where there is shared motivation, and find out who might be interested in collaborating on what.</p> Are you in? <p>For as long as humans have existed, they have been forced to reckon with the fact that the bigger their groups, the more powerful they can be, but also the more difficult it is to organize without entrusting that power to a few people. The problem has been tackled from every possible angle, but with the advent of peer-to-peer information technology like Holochain, there is an opportunity for brand new forms of organizing to emerge, allowing humans to coordinate organically as peers. If we can crack this problem, I’m hopeful that we can unleash vast amounts of untapped human potential — and if I’m lucky, I won’t have to attend those lengthy and unproductive activist meetings ever again.</p><p>For anyone interested in learning more, visit the <a href="https://dcan.app/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DCAN website</a> to download and explore Who's In? and Converge. You can also gain a more thorough understanding of the project by reading the <a href="https://dcan.app/whitepaper.pdf?ref=blog.holochain.org">DCAN whitepaper</a>.</p>

<p>No matter how a transaction is made – whether digitally, in-person, for one-time use or a recurring payment – the transaction is often linked to a customer’s payment card. As the issuer and the cardholder’s financial institution, you’re responsible for providing secure payment options while navigating the digital transformation of many traditional banking methods to meet the needs and wants of your customer base.</p>
<p>With Mastercard’s recently launched concept, <a href="https://b2b.mastercard.com/pay-by-account/">Pay by Account</a>, you can revolutionize the payment process for your customers. This latest digital-first feature, supported by the Entrust Digital Card Solution, allows customers to digitize their bank accounts into their mobile apps. You can now elevate the payment experience directly within your mobile banking application, allowing consumers to make secure payments from their bank accounts, Google Wallet, or Apple Pay at any Mastercard point-of-sale (POS) terminal and display a virtual card for online transactions. Consumers can either pay directly from the bank app in the bank’s proprietary wallet (enabled by Entrust with the NFC Issuer Wallet) or push the digitized bank account to wallets like Apple Pay or Google Pay. This enables effortless payments at any Mastercard e-commerce merchant without the necessity of card issuance. In addition, customers can use mobile payment options at any Mastercard POS and have the convenience of using a virtual card for online payments.</p>
<p>With the convenience of this additional digital payment solution, you can simplify the complexities of financial card issuance and the need to rely on a payment card as an intermediary. Pay by Account facilitates the payment process for banks and credit unions, offering the opportunity to facilitate real-time transactions. This is particularly advantageous and compelling for those financial institutions not engaged in card issuance or who are lacking compatibility with tokenization for digital card issuance. Pay by Account offers a game-changing alternative, facilitating quick virtual digital card issuance without disrupting existing card issuance infrastructure. It can also add value to the banking app, transforming it into a payment device across online and in-store purchases. Consumers benefit from a very safe and secure tokenized bank account payment experience, delivered within the banking app. Financial institutions add value to their app and keep customer experience at the core of their relationship with the consumer. With more innovations and opportunities comes more revenue opportunities for financial institutions.</p>
<p>Financial institutions can benefit from a simplified integration through an SDK, delivering the highest level of security. Empowering an end customer to choose their preferred form of payment and enabling direct payments from their bank account not only builds trust but also eliminates potential risks associated with third-party data breaches and fraud. The implementation and maintenance are also streamlined and efficient thanks to Entrust’s expert digital card team, which delivers comprehensive project support.</p>
<p>Take the next step to enhance your digital banking experience by learning more about <a href="https://go.entrust.com/pay-by-account-data-sheet">Pay by Account</a> today.</p>

   Investment fund managers and administrators have their work cut out for them: in addition to managing all of the back-room functions of running a fund, they also need to ensure their investors are being processed through effective and compliant AML &amp; KYC checks. KYC-Chain's proprietary Multi-Scope and Corporate Visualization tools are specially designed to expedite and optimize the process.

<p>We were delighted to be joined by John from Source Network for our latest edition of Fission Tech Talks! </p><p>​John spoke about the different components of Source Network, including <a href="https://source.network/defra-db">DefraDB</a>, a p2p database, how Source uses IPFS, and some ideas about interop with UCAN.</p> Decentralized Databases <p><a href="https://source.network/">Source Network</a> empowers developers to deploy user-centric decentralized databases. </p><p>John realized that there were problems with the way data is handled today:</p>  Fragmentation - Data is unstructured and scattered across apps, devices, and file management system silos, making it time-consuming and laborious to manage.  Imprisonment - Users are stuck behind walled gardens that don't allow data to move easily across services.  Vulnerability - When all our data is stored in one place, it becomes an attractive target for bad actors.   <p>John realized that a viable solution would require decentralized data that was:</p>  Interoperable - Break down the walled gardens and replace them with open data models.  Controllable - User-owned data is key, as users should be able to move their data property around just like they do their physical property.  Secured - Cryptographic protocols can help secure data, putting users at ease.  <p>With these three characteristics in mind, John created DefraDB or Decentralized Infrastructure Database. What makes DefraDB unique? </p><p><a href="https://source.network/defra-db">DefraDB</a> is:</p>  Deployable anywhere  Uses no SQL  Uses P2P protocols  Uses cryptographic state proofs  Employs CRDTs   Authorization <p>In the authorization world, there are two main paths - access control lists and object capabilities. In 2019, Google published <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub48190/">Zanzibar</a>, a paper explaining how they handle authorization across their many services. It uses access control lists but with relationship-based access control rather than role-based access control.</p><p>First, you write a tuple that includes subject, relation, and object. Then, you check if a permission exists and run an expand call that acts as a reverse lookup over a user set. It operates as a Consistent and Partition-Tolerant System.</p><p>The Zanzibar API is centralized, so Source Network created a decentralized implementation of Zanzibar called Zanzi. The Source Hub trust protocol powers it.</p><p>Now, let's turn to the other type of authorization - object capabilities. With object capabilities, revocation can be challenging when you have to get refreshed tokens after the original ones expire. Therefore, Source Network created Zazu, which is Zanzibar Authorization with UCANs</p><p>The Zanzibar service mints the token rather than the individual, eliminating the interactivity problem. Then it goes back to the traditional UCAN spec the rest of the way down the chain. </p><p>If you'd like to learn more about Source Network's DefraDB, Zanzi, or Zazu, please visit <a href="https://source.network/">Source Network</a>, join the <a href="https://discord.source.network/">Discord</a>, or explore the <a href="https://github.com/sourcenetwork/defradb">DefraDB</a> repo.</p>

				 <p>Darrell O’Donnell was recently invited by the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">Hyperledger Foundation</a> to shed light on the latest developments in the wallet space since the original Wallet Report in 2019. He addressed the <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/IWG/Identity+Special+Interest+Group">Identity Special Interest Group</a>, and we’re thrilled to spotlight his insightful presentation.</p>
<p>The Hyperledger Foundation is a member-driven, not-for-profit organization dedicated to fostering global collaboration for adopting and advancing enterprise-grade technologies.</p>
<p>In the live webinar, Darrell delved into key updates to the <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/state-of-digital-wallets/">Wallet Report</a>, focusing on the emerging trust layer, trust registries, and interoperability in digital ecosystems.</p>
<p>Didn’t get a chance to attend live? No worries. The complete presentation is available for replay on YouTube.</p>

<p>We’ve also made the presentation deck available for those keen on diving deep. This comprehensive slide deck visually explores the topics covered during the webinar.</p>

<p>Key Takeaways:</p>
 
 The Emerging Trust Layer: The internet lacks a Trust Layer. At the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP Foundation</a>, we’re addressing this gap by aligning governance with technology to ensure seamless integration. 
 Trust Registries: They are more than just crucial. They serve as the foundational anchor for digital trust ecosystems, and their importance is increasingly being recognized. 
 Interoperability &amp; Conformance: We have not achieved Interoperability. Achieving genuine interoperability demands a conformance suite that backs up the specification and works in synergy. 
 
<p>We’re grateful to the Hyperledger Foundation for providing a platform to share these insights and to everyone who attended the session.&nbsp;</p>

 Whether rightly or wrongly, crypto mixers have become synonymous with money laundering. What can crypto firms do to protect themselves, their customers, and the crypto community from the growing threat of fraud? 



 



<p>The term “<a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fm%2F0138mrz4&amp;date=today%205-y&amp;geo=GB">cryptocurrency tumbler</a>” (also known as crypto mixer) has seen a 5000% increase in Google searches over the past five years. If search queries are anything to go by, it’s easy to see why: there appears to be confusion over how they work, if they are truly private, and whether they’re even legal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interest in crypto mixers has also appeared to have spread from industry insiders to the wider crypto community, including those looking for ways to hide their blockchain transactions.</p>



<p>No longer a niche subsection of an obscure industry, crypto tumblers pose a legitimate concern for the crypto community, because they are now, rightly or wrongly, heavily associated with money laundering.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We investigate the dangers associated with crypto tumblers and how crypto firms can reduce the risks of money laundering, meet regulatory challenges, and prevent fraud.</p>



 What are the threats associated with crypto mixers? 



<p>Far from how they’re currently perceived, crypto tumblers were originally created to offer heightened privacy for legitimate blockchain transactions.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>They work by gathering coins from different users, tumbling them all together, and then spitting them out. The recipient receives the same amount of bitcoins they put in, but not the original coins they originally held. The benefit for users is that mixing obscures these transactions, providing anonymity on the blockchain. Naturally, this privacy tool is also exploited by money launderers.</p>Jason Tucker-Feltham, Global Head of Crypto &amp; Fintech at IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>There are two main types of crypto mixers:</p>



  Centralized mixers – rely on a third party to complete the mixing<br>  Decentralized mixers – rely on protocols like smart contracts&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>Without coin mixing, the transparent nature of the blockchain makes it hard for firms to make truly secure investments, or for high-profile individuals to keep their wealth private. However, with coin mixing, users can operate in a completely confidential nature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These features are also the main reasons why crypto mixers have become synonymous with money laundering. Several fraud cases and cyberattacks over the past few years have shown the part that tumbling plays, and the very real threat it poses to the integrity of a cryptocurrency exchange.</p>



 The 3 main problems with crypto mixers. 



<p>The most dangerous threats associated with crypto mixers include money laundering, regulatory risks and fraud.</p>



 Money laundering. 



<p>The largest risk associated with crypto mixers is money laundering, and it’s only growing bigger. In fact, data shows that between 2021 and 2022, crypto laundering <a href="https://www.moneylaundering.com/news/cryptocurrency-laundering-soared-last-year-research-shows/">grew by approximately 70%</a>. There are typically two ways that crypto mixers are used to launder money. The first is through “cleaning” coins gained from illegitimate sources, such as pharming or ransomware attacks. The second is by funding criminal activity with clean coins, as the mixer can obscure and anonymise the transaction end point.</p>



<p>The dangers to crypto firms are clear.</p>



<p>“Firms must be able to verify whether their users and coins have been involved in suspicious transactions or sanctioned mixers. Without this information, exchanges could unknowingly be funding criminal activity, such as online cyberattacks or real-world terrorist financing,” said Jason.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>ChipMixer, a type of crypto mixer that exchanged old coins for new coins, was responsible for laundering over <a href="https://hub.elliptic.co/analysis/chipmixer-shut-down-after-laundering-over-840-million-in-criminal-proceeds/">$850 million</a>, which could be directly linked to illicit activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;International authorities from Europe and the US were concerned over the mixer for flouting regulations and facilitating money laundering. The founder of the platform even wrote, “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybercriminals-crypto-platform-chipmixer-taken-down-says-europol-2023-03-15/">Money laundering’ is a crime made-up by governments that spy on their citizens</a>”. ChipMixer was officially seized and stopped trading in March 2023.</p>



 



 

 



 Regulatory risks. 



<p>One of the major problems of crypto mixers is the blurred lines in which the crypto community operates – exasperated by the relatively infant stage of crypto regulation compared to traditional financial services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While firms await rules outlined in <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">MiCA</a> and the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-crypto-regulatory-regime/">UK’s proposed crypto regulatory regime</a> to come into force (expected in 2024), crypto firms that wish to operate in the UK, for example, must register with the Financial Conduct Authority, and therefore comply with Anti-Money Laundering Directives that capture rules to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. Only firms with appropriate Know Your Customer (KYC) processes, source of funds checks, and proof of funds checks, can be registered to ensure no illicit money is coming through the system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Forward-thinking risk managers should ensure their organization meets compliance measures if it is serious about preventing money laundering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is particularly important for attracting high-value customers as exchanges that can demonstrate they <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/future-crypto-eu-revolution/">follow regulatory guidelines</a>, and are able to plug operational vulnerabilities, provide reassurance to third parties and customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Compliance with regulations not only protects firms from sanctions, but can also attract new customers if they feel satisfied that due diligence has been carried out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In August 2022, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916">sanctioned TornadoCash</a>, a popular coin mixer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The crime? Facilitating suspicious transactions, involving stolen funds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the real kicker is that some TornadoCash transactions could be traced and linked to groups in North Korea, a country with international sanctions including:&nbsp;</p>



  Freezing of financial assets<br>  Travel bans<br>  Trading restrictions  



<p>As such, users of this mixer put TornadoCash in direct breach of global regulations, and OFAC deemed it the responsibility of the service provider to maintain compliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although industry leaders weren’t in agreement (remember that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-17/coinbase-coin-backed-motion-to-lift-sanctions-on-tornado-cash-denied">Coinbase lawsuit</a>?) regulators have made it clear that persecuting the service providers, rather than the individuals, is preferential.&nbsp;Plus, due to the incredibly private nature of mixers, it’s virtually impossible to go after the users themselves. Still, someone must be held accountable.</p>



 Fraud. 



<p>The opaque nature of crypto tumblers facilitate a perfectly murky breeding ground for fraudsters to operate. And as the industry continues to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/world-coin-crypto-iris/">grow at breakneck speed</a>, fraudsters are evolving at a similar rate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crypto mixers lack the common identity verification tools that financial institutions are required to perform, including:&nbsp;</p>



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">Know Your Customer</a> checks<br>  Ultimate Beneficial Ownership checks<br>  Real-time authentication for transactions&nbsp;  



<p>In fact, many crypto mixers operate without any kind of user monitoring, which means even users who rely on the services for legitimate reasons could be subject to cyberattacks, as there’s no authentication for the user when they make a transaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Imagine a crypto mixer user receives a phishing email and clicks on a malicious link. It’s likely they will be redirected to a fake website and be asked to input their credentials. In a matter of seconds, the fraudster has successfully captured the user’s log-in information. From there, all it takes is for the fraudster to re-type the credentials they’ve just gathered into the real site, launder the user’s coins and disappear with the funds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although <a href="https://trustpair.com/white-paper/b2b-payment-fraud-us-2023/">60% of business leaders</a> consider fraud awareness training the best approach for minimizing fraud, it should be paired with other tools in order to create a robust shield.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/crypto-crime-crackdown/">Crypto fraud prevention</a> requires both initial customer identity verification, and ongoing transaction monitoring. The doubled-down effort approach not only ensures that the account holder is who they claim to be, but that if any bad actors get into the account during the meantime, they will be blocked from making transactions.</p>



 How to manage risks in crypto? 



<p>Risk assessments should be the first point of call for any business operating in a highly-regulated industry. To help combat the threat of money laundering, crypto firms can implement:</p>



 Wallet screening tools. 



<p>Wallet screening tools are an integral part of maintaining wallet hygiene. They allow exchanges to identify the owners of wallets, as well as the source and destination of funds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, where crypto mixers are involved, transactions can be obscured and it’s harder to trace the entire transaction history.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore, it’s important to ensure that any wallet screening tool can identify tainted coins, and that this data is used to inform on the risk factors of wallet owners. By leveraging enhanced wallet screening, exchanges can benefit from full transparency over customer wallets, and reduce their risk of enabling money laundering.</p>



 KYC and identity checks. 



<p>By implementing a robust <a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">KYC and identity verification process for your crypto firm</a>, you can rest assured that you know who your customers are, while complying with regulations like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-directive-amld/">AML</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">MiCA</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pvid-provider-criteria/">PVID</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some KYC and identity verification platforms, however, are simply not fit for purpose.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>The wrong KYC platform can really affect user experience and therefore conversion rates</p>Jason Tucker-Feltham, Global Head of Crypto &amp; Fintech at IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>“When crypto mixers are involved, digital verification becomes more difficult. This is why IDnow’s identity verification services combine video verification with external database checks, risk factor analysis and behavioral analysis. With global ID specialists on-hand for clarification, our clients benefit from AI models and real human verification,” added Jason.</p>



 Putting the KYC into crypto. 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC processes</a> are an integral part in ensuring crypto exchanges can protect themselves and their customers from fraud and money laundering, even amid an evolving <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/british-crypto-balancing-act/">crypto regulatory landscape</a>. Having these controls in place will protect investors from financial losses and add stability to a notoriously volatile market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow’s highly configurable<a href="https://www.idnow.io/platform/"> identity verification solutions</a> work across multiple regulations, industries and use cases, including <a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">crypto</a>. Whether automated or expert-assisted, our online identity-proofing methods have been optimized to meet the strictest security standards and regulatory requirements without compromising on customer conversion or consumer experience.</p>

<p>The recent <a href="https://identityday.se/">Identity Day</a> event brought together experts and thought leaders from across Sweden, to address the evolving challenges in identity management. John Jellema, VP of Product Management at Ubisecure, evoked important themes with his presentation on the complex nature of identity and the need for more robust identity management practices in the ever-changing landscape of work and technology. Watch John’s presentation or read the session highlights below.</p>
<p></p>
 Navigating Identity Challenges in Virtual Working Environments: 
<p>The session kicked off with a focus on the identity challenges posed by virtual working environments. John posed questions about how these challenges can be audited and how to enable trusted business-to-business interactions. He highlighted the importance of ensuring secure and auditable identity management in our increasingly digital world. John posed the question: “Who am I right now, what am I doing, and what am I representing?” He demonstrated how easily one could impersonate others with similar credentials, emphasising that verifying identity becomes a significant challenge, especially in a virtual environment.</p>
<p>This emphasised the limitations of identity verification – particularly poignant in a room full of identity management professionals. He attested that identity is of low value in such settings, while trust remains high. For example, attendees in the session could see his face and match it to the presenter’s name but had no concrete proof of his true identity. And stressed that this ease of trust does not exist in most online transactions or meetings.</p>
 Identity in the Nordics: 
<p>Delving into the strong identity systems in the Nordic region, John discussed the Finnish Trust Network as an example, and its high level of security. However, he warned that even in regions with robust identity management, fraud and theft are on the rise globally, highlighting that there is still a challenge in securely identifying and protecting transactions.</p>
 Challenges in Identity Management: 
<p>Next, John raised critical questions about the trustworthiness of third-party systems and emphasised the need for trust in identity management. Crucially, he underlined the importance of understanding who you’re dealing with in business transactions and the necessity of reliable identity verification to enable this. While this is possible in direct transactions, supply chains and normal business venture often have many sub and sub-sub contractors who are not directly known; raising the question of overall security in B2B environments.</p>
 The Future of Identity: 
<p>The presentation then touched on the future of identity management, noting the potential of animated or dynamic QR codes and the use of passkeys, and stressing the importance of adopting more secure methods. John predicted that even with animated QR codes and Passkeys, that personal adoption of these new methods was low (even in the audience), therefore focus on NIST compliant passwords (longer is better) coupled with easy-to-use MFA was still essential. The value of B2B Identity Management:</p>
<p>A key takeaway from the presentation is how B2B ID management needs to be as secure and robust as individual ID management.</p>
<p>Whilst strong individual IDs are relatively well-known, such as BankID or the upcoming EU Digital Identity Wallet, organisation IDs are either insufficient or underutilised. Therein lies huge opportunity. As John points out, B2B markets significantly outsize B2C markets. John runs through the reasons why the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) is the most appropriate choice to realise such opportunities, as a globally recognised, high assured organisational identity.</p>
<p>Off the back of reliable organisation identity,&nbsp; organisational and individual identities can be linked to enable truly trustworthy B2B interactions – as per Ubisecure’s vision for the future of digital identity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The future of digital identity:</p>
<p>The ability to combine highly assured organisational identities with strongly authenticated individual identities to show who you are, who you represent, and the rights you have to represent them.</p>
</blockquote>
 Identity Challenges in a Fluid Workplace: 
<p>With the shift towards virtual and remote work, the challenges of identifying individuals accurately in virtual meetings is becoming increasingly difficult. Especially with the increasing risk of impersonation through deepfake technology. This raises questions about verifying identity when relying solely on virtual interactions.</p>
<p>John’s presentation at Identity Day 2023 sheds some light on the evolving challenges in identity management, emphasising the need for secure, auditable identity practices in an ever-changing digital world. As technology continues to advance, organisations must address these challenges to maintain trust and security in their operations. The future of identity management will require innovative solutions and a collective effort to stay ahead of emerging threats.</p>

Verida and cheqd release mobile wallet credential solution for enterprises<p><a href="http://verida.network">Verida</a>, a leader in self-sovereign identity solutions, has formed a foundational partnership with <a href="http://cheqd.io">cheqd</a>, a leader in privacy-preserving payment and credential networks. This strategic alliance signifies a momentous leap forward in the world of Decentralized Identifier (DID) and Verifiable Credential management.</p> Driving Credential Adoption and&nbsp;Privacy <p>Verida and cheqd have collaborated to make Verifiable Credentials mainstream for critical enterprise use cases. Both organisations are working together to simplify the issuance, storage, and sharing of credentials through innovative technology solutions.</p><blockquote>“We have prioritised working with the cheqd team to integrate their technology into the Verida ecosystem,” says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriswere">Chris Were</a>, CEO of&nbsp;Verida.</blockquote><blockquote>“cheqd are world leaders in self-sovereign identity and credentials and have developed an innovative credential payment model that will help unlock mainstream adoption.”</blockquote><p>Verida has integrated the cheqd credential network into the <a href="http://verida.io">Verida Wallet</a>, allowing users to receive, store, and share their credentials. This integration has resulted in a comprehensive, end-to-end solution for issuing self-sovereign credentials via easy-to-use APIs. Credentials are generated by trusted organisations using cheqd’s Credentials as a Service product and are then sent to an end user where the credential is self-custodied in a user’s wallet. The user can then share the credential to be verified by third-party applications.</p><p>Verida’s commitment to privacy ensures that user credentials remain confidential, are stored in a regulatory compliant manner and are never exposed on a public blockchain. The data security is guaranteed by Verida’s <a href="http://verida.network">self-sovereign database network</a>, empowering users to manage and share their Verifiable Credentials securely using their private&nbsp;key.</p><blockquote>“The integration of Verida’s decentralised identity storage wallet with the cheqd network offers a compelling vision of ‘Not your keys, not your identity’. People’s digital selves should be in their control, and this includes being able to store their credentials outside of the control of Big Tech providers,” says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/banerjeeankur">Ankur Banerjee</a>, CTO and Co-Founder at&nbsp;cheqd.</blockquote><blockquote>“We’re proud of the collaboration and technical excellence of the Verida team in offering users an option that is truly in their control.”</blockquote><p>Verida and cheqd are actively engaged in pilot projects with enterprise customers, assisting them to set up ecosystems with verifiable credentials. This includes layering in cheqd’s approach to <a href="https://blog.cheqd.io/credential-payments-are-live-4bf4ea1ff7a8?source=collection_home---2------0-----------------------">Credential Payments</a>, unlocking new business models in traditional finance and other&nbsp;sectors.</p> Seamless Integration and Global&nbsp;Reach <p>This partnership combines the technology and expertise behind Verida and cheqd to create an end-to-end solution for issuing and using private credentials. cheqd provides the infrastructure to anchor <a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/identity/credential-service/dids/create-subject-did#creating-a-subject-did">DIDs</a> and <a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/identity/architecture/adr-list/adr-002-did-linked-resources">DID-Linked Resources</a> to the cheqd ledger, as well as to issue, verify, revoke, and monetize credentials.

<p>With cryptocurrencies entering the global financial scene, people have found themselves empowered with transactional privacy, something that was pretty much non-existent before.</p><p>Crypto mixers, in particular, have played a crucial role here, as they are specifically designed to obscure transaction trails and protect user identities.</p><p>While these mixers champion individual privacy, they’ve also attracted attention due to potential misuse, as evident from the handling of <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/crypto-mixer-criminal-volume-2022/#:~:text=On%20April%2019%2C%202022%2C%20the,the%20same%20time%20in%202021.">nearly 8% of all illicit crypto funds in 2022</a> through&nbsp;mixers.</p><p>However, it’s essential to understand that the core issue isn’t the technology itself but its potential misuse.</p><p>Amidst these concerns, the question arises: How do we champion the cause of individual privacy without giving a free pass to nefarious activities? It’s a delicate equilibrium, one that initiatives like privacy pools are striving to&nbsp;achieve.</p> What are Privacy&nbsp;Pools? <p>Privacy Pools, as conceptualized by Vitalik Buterin and four others, including Chainalysis chief scientist Jacob Illum, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4563364">in their research paper</a>, can be likened to secure digital lockboxes within the cryptocurrency universe.</p><p>Much like a lockbox that safeguards valuable items, Privacy Pools protect transactional details while going a step further by allowing users to demonstrate the legitimacy of their transactions without unveiling the specifics.</p><p>However, these pools aren’t just about maintaining anonymity. They incorporate a robust system that ensures compliance with regulations. This is achieved by categorizing transactions into ‘good’ and ‘bad’ sets, allowing the system to flag potentially illicit activities while preserving user&nbsp;privacy.</p> Good Set vs Bad&nbsp;Set <p>The ‘good’ set includes transactions that comply with legal and regulatory standards, ensuring they are legitimate. Conversely, the ‘bad’ set comprises deposits that might have ties to suspicious activities or illegal&nbsp;sources.</p><p>Now, here’s where it gets even more interesting. When users wish to withdraw their funds from the pool, they can provide proof. However, this proof doesn’t disclose their specific transaction details but verifies that their withdrawal is connected to the ‘good’ deposits.</p><p>If you’re wondering how this system operates, in Privacy Pools, users don’t directly reveal their specific transactions. Instead, they provide a hint by sharing a group of possible transactions, known as the association set, indicating that their specific transaction lies somewhere within&nbsp;it.</p><p>This way, users maintain their privacy by not showcasing their exact transactions but still supplying enough data to affirm the legitimacy of their activities.</p><p>Advanced cryptographic techniques ensure this method maintains both transactional privacy and compliance.</p><p>Moreover, third-party entities, known as Association Set Providers (ASPs), will play a pivotal role in this mechanism by curating these ‘good’ and ‘bad’ sets based on various criteria, maintaining transparency and trust in the&nbsp;system.</p><p>So, even when the user’s transaction remains obscured, a robust layer of checks and balances will ensure that everything remains straight and&nbsp;narrow.</p><p>This approach will serve as a bridge between the blockchain’s ethos of privacy and the world’s regulatory necessities, intertwining the two in a harmonious blend of technology and compliance.</p> Advantages and Disadvantages of Privacy&nbsp;Pools <p>The benefits of privacy pools are manifold, especially when considering how, by bolstering transactional privacy, they may pave the way for a wider acceptance of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Once implemented, users previously cautious of the transparent nature of blockchain transactions could have the option to transact with enhanced privacy, in line with certain regulatory standards. This integration of privacy and certain standards presents opportunities for both individual users and the broader ecosystem.</p><p>However, like any technology, privacy pools present challenges, too. For instance, the complexity of achieving widespread regulatory alignment is evident, with different countries having varied views on crypto regulations.</p><p>Additionally, if not monitored effectively, there is a potential for misuse. Just as with any privacy tool, it can be a double-edged sword: while it can protect legitimate users, it could also shield malicious actors if not adequately overseen.</p> The Logic Behind Privacy&nbsp;Pools <p>Privacy Pools operate on fundamental human motivations: the need for transactional discretion and the drive to steer clear from contentious ties.</p><p>When society clearly categorizes transactions as either clean (“good”) or potentially tainted (“bad”), users with reputable transactions naturally align with the “good” set. This ensures their privacy and keeps them away from any association with dubious activities.</p><p>Conversely, those with questionable transactions find little advantage in the system. Their actions can be linked to a set with suspicious undertones, making it easier to trace and identify.</p> A Balanced&nbsp;Approach <p>As the crypto realm grows, the primary challenge is ensuring user privacy while also acknowledging the technological and regulatory landscape. Privacy pools are central to this&nbsp;effort.</p><p>To unlock the full potential of privacy pools, continuous dialogue between the crypto community, regulators, and other key stakeholders is&nbsp;vital.</p><p>By working together, we can prioritize user privacy through privacy pools, all while addressing any potential regulatory concerns. This collective effort is key for the broader acceptance and success of these technologies in the financial world.</p><p>___________________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p>Identity management and authentication are evolving rapidly, especially as the era of traditional passwords is slowly becoming outdated. Sebastian Sandell presented at <a href="https://identityday.se/">Identity Day</a> 2023 in Sweden, with a focus on securely authenticating sub-contractor users and the changing landscape of authentication. Watch the video of Sebastian’s presentation or have a look at the presentation highlights in the blog below.</p>
<p></p>
 The Passwordless Revolution 
<p>The traditional method of password authentication is widely accepted to be inconvenient and insecure. Passwordless authentication methods are on the rise and are poised to replace cumbersome password-based systems. In fact, around 99% of modern devices already support these passwordless methods.</p>
 Navigating the Transition 
<p>While passwordless authentication offers a more secure and user-friendly approach, many organisations are still dependent on passwords for authentication. This raises an important question: how can we ensure the security of these accounts, in a transitioning landscape? The answer lies in establishing strong company policies.</p>
 The Role of Company Policies 
<p>Emphasising the critical role that company policies play in securing user accounts, Sebastian covers how these policies dictate password complexity, length, and update frequency. For example, the presence of lowercase and uppercase letters, special characters, and numbers may be mandatory. For added security, some companies may require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). The importance of checking passwords against breach databases is highlighted.</p>
 Enforcing Policies in a Business Environment 
<p>The complexity arises when these policies must be enforced in a business environment, where subcontractors and partners need access to an organisation’s systems. Sebastian provided a scenario illustrating this challenge involving three distinct user groups:</p>
 
 Internal Users: These are employees who have well-defined accounts in the organisation. They access systems using email and passwords, with the option to enable MFA for additional security. 
 Registered Federated Users: These are users from trusted partner organisations. They have some information in the system and can use their organisation’s identity providers (IdPs) for authentication. Their need for MFA depends on their organisation’s policies. 
 Unregistered Federated Users: These users are even further removed from the organisation’s systems and policies. This group includes subcontractors and third-tier connections about whom we have limited information available. 
 
 Customised Authentication for Unregistered Federated Users 
<p>Unregistered federated users present a unique challenge since they lack a detailed profile in the organisation’s system. This emphasises the need for tailored authentication methods for these users. For instance, they might use their Google credentials if they belong to a Google IdP. Depending on the limited data available, they could employ various One-Time Password (OTP) methods, including SMS OTP and SMTP OTP.</p>
 MFA’s Continued Relevance 
<p>Sebastian underlined that, even as passwordless authentication gains traction, there are scenarios where MFA remains essential. As users move further away from trusted internal users towards unregistered federated users, the risk of unauthorised access and security breaches increases. Therefore, MFA can add an extra layer of security to protect the most critical applications.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Sebastian’s presentation at Identity Day 2023 sheds light on the evolving landscape of authentication. As organisations transition to passwordless authentication, maintaining security for legacy systems still reliant on passwords is crucial. Company policies, emphasising strong password requirements and MFA, are essential for a smooth transition. The challenge of managing authentication in a business environment with subcontractors necessitates tailored solutions. Security remains paramount, and MFA continues to be relevant, especially for safeguarding critical applications. <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/contact/" title="Contact Ubisecure">Contact Ubisecure</a> to discuss securely authenticating your unregistered federated users.</p>

<p>How we prove our identity has undergone revolutionary changes in a world of information. At the center of this transformation is Biometric Authentication. In essence, biometric authentication verifies individuals based on their unique physical or behavioral attributes, such as fingerprints, facial patterns, or voice. Its value in bolstering security and simplifying user experiences cannot be understated.</p>
 Understanding Key Concepts 
<p>As we dive into Biometric Authentication, a foundational understanding of its core concepts is essential. It’s not just about recognizing unique physical or behavioral traits; it’s about the broader context in which these traits play a role in authenticating identities.</p>
<p>The distinction between related terms: Biometric authentication shouldn’t be confused with simple biometric data. While both involve unique human characteristics, the former is about verification, while the latter is merely information.</p>
<p>Foundational concepts: It centers on two phases – enrollment, where the user’s biometric data is first captured and stored, and verification, where the presented data is compared against the stored version to authenticate.</p>
 Technological Foundations 
<p>The efficacy of biometric authentication is deeply intertwined with the technological innovations supporting it. From rudimentary hand measurements to sophisticated AI-driven systems, the journey of biometrics is fascinating and transformative.</p>
<p>Key Technologies: Commonly employed biometrics include fingerprints, facial authentication, iris and retina scanning, voice recognition, and behavioral biometrics like keystroke dynamics.</p>

In essence, biometrics modernizes the authentication landscape and fosters a conducive environment for robust business growth.</p>
 High Accuracy 
<p>Biometric systems leverage unique physical traits to recognize individuals swiftly and reliably. This precise recognition has become integral for identity verification across sectors, notably government entities, banks, and financial institutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The inherent uniqueness of biometric characteristics, which are challenging to duplicate or steal, positions biometrics as a more secure alternative to traditional methods like passwords. As a result, this technology provides unparalleled accuracy in identifying diverse users, from employees to customers.</p>
 Convenience 
<p>The elements utilized in biometric verification, such as iris patterns, voice modulations, and even DNA, remain primarily consistent, minimizing the risks of damage or abrupt alterations. This ensures that biometric authentication is not only stable but also user-centric.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It offers a speedy, user-friendly process that’s tough to counterfeit and doesn’t burn a hole in the pocket. Moreover, given that biometrics tap into inherent features, there’s little to no learning curve for users, making the entire experience smooth and intuitive.</p>
<p>As with any technological advancement, biometric systems, while groundbreaking, come with their set of challenges and risks. It’s crucial to be aware of these to harness biometrics’ full potential.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Small</a></p><p>On October 25th, 2023, AWS <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/2023/10/amazon-web-services-to-launch-aws-european-sovereign-cloud">announced </a>their intention to launch AWS European Sovereign Cloud. This is an important announcement which reflects the impact of EU GDPR regulation and the EU recent <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2020/652073/EPRS_ATA(2020)652073_EN.pdf" title="Schrems II judgement">Schrems II judgement</a>.</p>
 What was Announced 
<p>AWS European Sovereign Cloud will be a new, independent cloud for Europe that is designed to help public sector organizations and those in highly regulated industries meet the regulatory data residency and operational requirements. This cloud service will be located and operated within Europe. It will be physically and logically separate from existing AWS Regions, but AWS claims, will provide the same security, availability, and performance of existing AWS Regions. The AWS European Sovereign Cloud will launch with its first AWS Region in Germany and will be available to all European customers. </p>
 The Impact of Globalisation 
<p>Globalisation has provided many benefits allowing nation states and organizations to obtain what they need, when they need it from wherever it is cheapest. This has reduced the costs for citizens and businesses alike but has created an increased dependency on ever more extended supply chains. The COVID epidemic and subsequent supply chain disruptions have called this approach into question. The notion of the sovereign cloud needs to be seen in this context.</p>
<p>Cloud sovereignty involves several areas, these include but are not limited to the protection of personal data. It also includes the protection of intellectual property, commercial secrets, as well as other forms of sensitive information. It concerns the influence that service users have over the legal frameworks that bind the service through a say in government. Also, their confidence in service continuity not only in the event of natural disasters but also of geopolitical conflicts.</p>
 The Sovereign Cloud 
<p>The idea behind the sovereign cloud is to ensure that the services provided are within the control of the jurisdiction where it is used. This can be achieved in several ways through legal, and technical measures as well as physical location. Within Europe there are already <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/mc80900/european-hosted-hybrid-iaas-cloud/">several cloud services</a> that are locally owned and delivered. However, these services find it hard to compete against the level of functionality provided by the global hyperscale cloud services and the economies of scale that they enjoy. Therefore, using purely local providers often involves increased costs and or reduced functionality.</p>
<p>Another approach is for state sponsored projects. However, these have a chequered history when it comes to innovation and, in any case, the richness of the existing hyperscale cloud services leaves an enormous gap to close. Therefore, quite sensibly, the European <a href="https://www.bmwk.de/Redaktion/DE/Dossier/gaia-x.html">GAIAX project</a> does not seek to replace the existing cloud services but rather to increase local control. Google, together with other hyperscale cloud providers, is a founding member of GAIAX.</p>
 Four Key areas of Sovereignty 
<p>There are four key areas of sovereignty and the announcement by AWS needs to be considered against all of these.</p>
<p> Data sovereignty – the customer should have control over the access to and the use of their data. This is what the technical measures from the EDPB (European Data Protection Board) are intended to enforce. Since many data processing regulations specify this, the customer should also have control over the physical location of their data and administrative access by cloud service administrators. With the exception of the location of administrators, data sovereignty is already supported by all the major IaaS providers although not all customers make full use of the controls provided.</p>
<p>Operational sovereignty – this is control over the jurisdiction where the administration of the service and its infrastructure is conducted. AWS have announced that the AWS European Sovereign Cloud infrastructure will be operated independently from existing AWS Regions. To assure independent operation of the AWS European Sovereign Cloud, only personnel who are EU residents, located in the EU, will have control of day-to-day operations, including access to data centers, technical support, and customer service. Access to customers’ data is further controlled through the AWS Nitro System which separates the control plane from the data plane and prevents operational access to customers’ data.</p>
<p>Technical Sovereignty – the customer can develop, deploy, move, and manage their workloads with a minimum of disruption. While there is significant openness in application development environments, the AWS cloud is built on a proprietary technical stack, and this makes it hard to move a workload to another cloud. It also makes it hard to manage the hybrid multi-cloud and on-premises IT environment that is now common in most organizations. There is a need for standard interfaces that customers can use to build, deploy, manage, and optimise their workloads independently of the cloud service used. This is still work in progress with VMware, OpenStack, Anthos, and RedHat OpenShift all offering some level of solution to some of the problems.</p>
<p>Sovereign Ownership – the infrastructure used to provide the cloud service is normally owned by the CSP. This means that even if it is located in a given geography its use could be withdrawn by the CSP in the event of geopolitical conflict. Even if it were to be seized by a government the knowledge and external infrastructure required would make it difficult to make it operational.</p>
 Opinion 
<p>The AWS announcement today is a major step that will enable public service and regulated organizations in the EU benefit from the capabilities provided by the AWS Cloud Services. It further illustrates the bargaining power that the EU can exert on service providers from outside of the region. However, it does not mitigate the potential for technical lock in or the geopolitical risks associated with services owned outside of the EU Jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/right-sized-onboarding-and-offboarding-free-for-the-first-100-signups/">we announced</a> that our onboarding tool YeshID Onboard is now in beta and that we’re providing it free to the first 100 organizations of 25-250 employees working in Google Workspace to sign up. We’ve onboarded more than 20 companies since we put that message out, and we’re thrilled with the success those teams are experiencing with Onboard. But we’ve also noticed there are some questions around why we would give YeshID Onboard away for free, and that’s what I want to talk about today.</p>
 Ship, learn, improve 
<p>YeshID is a startup. Alex and I founded the company, and now we’re a small team with experience from tech heavy hitters like Meta, Microsoft, OpenDNS/Cisco, and RSA. We’re what you call a seed stage startup: we’re in the initial phase of developing our product and are focused on turning an innovative idea into a viable business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seed startups are known for their potential to bring disruptive solutions to the market. They often challenge the status quo and aim to break into existing industries with new and creative approaches — and that’s just what we’re doing. We’re developing <a href="https://yeshid.com/">a tool that will disrupt the identity and access management world</a> for smaller companies, which right now spans too big (like Okta) or too minimal (like spreadsheets).&nbsp;</p>
<p>That means that we’re doing a lot of research, a lot of testing and iterating, and a lot of proving out concepts — and here’s the thing: we can’t do any of that without you. So, we’re giving our product away. Simple as that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will that always be the case? Hopefully not! We are starting a business after all, but rest assured that if you join on a free plan, your plan will stay free, even if we start charging new customers for it.&nbsp;</p>
 Join us 
<p>Onboarding and offboarding are so fundamental to companies of all kinds, yet solutions have either lagged behind business needs or leap-frogged over a whole market size. This feels like the perfect entry point for YeshID and for companies looking to take the next step in their identity and access management journey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Onboard is purpose-built for small businesses using Google Workspace. We help you knock out the operational tasks that need to get done today while laying a solid foundation for tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Save time onboarding and offboarding team members with consolidated user controls 
 Manage application requests and keep track of IT licenses and costs all in one place 
 Skip the login screen and move effortlessly between approved applications 
 
<p>Plus, after you sign up, you’ll also get access to an exclusive Slack community of small business hustlers and heroes just like you so we can share, support, and celebrate together. And you’ll be helping us learn even more about the small business needs that have been overlooked until now. <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">Head to our website</a> to learn more. </p>

<p>Over the past 18 months, SpruceID has been working with the State of California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to bring mobile driver's licenses to residents of California. Earlier this fall, the State of California expanded the initial pilot program to allow California residents <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/ca-dmv-wallet/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">to download a mobile driver’s license (mDL)</a> on their smartphone through the California DMV mobile app (compatible with iOS and Android devices).</p>Images of the California Mobile Driver's License (mDL) in the California DMV mobile app. Source: <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/ca-dmv-wallet/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">California DMV Website</a><p>The mobile driver’s license is powered by SpruceID’s SpruceKit components and Credible Platform product. SpruceKit is an open-source toolkit for decentralized identity that enables secure wallet construction, and Credible Platform provides entire credential life cycle management–from issuance and presentations, to updates and revocation. Both are modular solutions that are made to integrate into existing high-assurance environments with security and privacy at the core.</p><p>The <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/credible-introducing-mobile-drivers-licenses/">privacy-first mobile driver's license</a> can be used at participating TSA airport security checkpoints and select retail locations. In the future, the mobile driver’s license can help residents prove their identity online, operate motor vehicles, access health care, secure financial assistance, and verify their age–both in-person and online–while selectively disclosing only the necessary information.&nbsp;</p> Open Source <p>There are three main pillars important to us as we worked with the DMV to scope out a mobile driver's license solution. First, we fundamentally believe in the value of open-source technology as a public good to reduce build costs, prevent vendor lock-in, and provide transparency. Our core components are, therefore, open-source to create an accessible ecosystem for digital identity infrastructure, to demonstrate that open protocols are indeed open with usable production-grade libraries free of proprietary licensing, and to allow civil society to review the function of critical workflows. While SpruceID is indeed a private sector business, our mission to let users control their data across the web can only be realized through ecosystems built on privacy, security, and choice.</p><p>While the program is still in the pilot phase, we are actively collecting and implementing early user feedback. As the program matures, we will first release the base libraries as open-source software, to empower other States, jurisdictions, and the private sector to implement privacy-preserving digital credentials.</p> Interoperability <p>We are committed to interoperability and standards compliance by implementing the ISO standard for mobile driver's license applications (ISO/IEC 18013–5) and W3C Verifiable Credentials. This facilitates compatibility across agencies, across different states, and, in the future, online for various websites and digital services. It also creates an even playing field for technology providers so that digital identity infrastructure is not dominated by only a few large firms.</p><p>Today, a registered driver in California can use their DMV-issued mDL to prove their identity to the Transportation Security Agency (TSA) at select airport security checkpoints using ISO/IEC 18013-5. There are currently twenty-five airports across the United States that accept digital IDs at security checkpoints, including the California mobile driver’s license. </p>The TSA currently accepts mDLs issued by several states and wallet/app providers for TSA PreCheck lanes in participating airports. (Source: <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/news/press/releases/2023/08/30/transportation-security-administration-seeks-comments-proposed-0?ref=blog.spruceid.com">tsa.gov</a>, blue highlighting added by SpruceID)<p>In 2022, the TSA <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/transportation_security_administration_0.pdf?ref=blog.spruceid.com">announced a new budget</a> authorizing an R&amp;D initiative focused on integrating digital identity authentication capabilities at airport checkpoints. They specifically outlined the importance of digital identities, including the increase in the efficiency of security checkpoints for passengers. They also stressed the increase in privacy afforded to travelers by only sharing the required information (name, gender, date of birth, and photo) rather than the entire ID card (which also includes weight, height, home address, and other information).</p><p>In the future, a mobile driver’s license holder may use their smartphone-held ID to digitally prove their identity, which is currently challenging to complete in a high-trust manner with a physical ID card. We recently hosted (and participated in) the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/test-of-mdl-interoperability-organized-by-spruceid-aamva?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ISO 18013-7 Interoperability Event</a> along with the California DMV to test how mobile driver’s licenses can be used online with a variety of mDL verifiers. ISO/IEC 18013-7 is the draft standard for how a mobile driver’s license can be verified in an unattended presentation, such as online. </p> User Experience <p>Finally, we want to ensure increased privacy, security, and convenience for users. Smartphones are increasingly a part of our daily lives, and the convenience of having a mobile driver’s license on a smartphone must be accompanied by a high level of security.&nbsp;</p><p>From a user perspective, we knew it would be critical for Californians to feel their information and activity are safe and private while using a mobile driver’s license. Users of the application are offered more privacy in interactions than using their physical ID counterparts since it allows users to selectively disclose only the required information. For example, at a drinking establishment, you can prove that you are over 21, without exposing your full birth date, your weight, your home address, or other personal details.&nbsp;</p><p>The mobile driver’s license also prevents “issuer phone-home,” where issuers may be notified each time someone verifies a mobile driver’s license digitally. This is prevented by allowing offline verifications that do not permit the issuer to track the mDL holder and where they are presenting their mDL.</p><p>At SpruceID, we firmly believe in empowering citizens through user-controlled identity. In our Digital Identity Knowledge Base, we shared more about our ideology related to privacy and equity in a mobile driver's license solution, in alignment with the EFF, ACLU, and EPIC comments to the Department of Homeland Security’s request for comments. You can read more in our Knowledge Base <a href="https://learn.spruceid.com/the-considerations/existing-critiques?ref=blog.spruceid.com">here</a>.</p><p>Digital identity impacts all of us, and we're collaborating with the California DMV to refine and improve based on the initial feedback from the pilot program. We want to ensure that every user finds the system usable and accessible, so we value and appreciate your feedback.</p><p>Today, any licensed driver in California can download and set up a mobile driver's license through the California DMV Wallet app. For more information, visit: <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/ca-dmv-wallet/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/ca-dmv-wallet/</a>.</p><p>For updates on SpruceID’s latest developments, please sign up for our mailing list.</p>

  <p>We’re excited to share the public preview of delegating Azure role assignment management using conditions. This preview gives you the ability to enable others to assign Azure roles but add restrictions on the roles they can assign and who they can assign roles to. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the owner of an Azure subscription, you likely get requests from developers to grant them the ability to assign roles in your subscription. You could assign them the Owner or User Access Administrator role, but those roles grant permission to assign any Azure role (including Owner!), and that’s probably a lot more permission than necessary for that developer’s scenario. You could instead make role assignments for these developers on demand, but that makes you an unnecessary and impractical bottleneck in their workflow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another common case we hear about is a deployment pipeline that needs to make role assignments as part of the deployment process, for example to grant a virtual machine managed identity access to Azure Storage and other resources. You don’t want to assign the deployment pipeline the Owner or User Access Administrator role because again, it’s a lot more permission than is needed for the scenario.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We created this feature so you can grant permission to create role assignments, but only under specific conditions, such as for specific roles. You can do this in two ways:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Make a role assignment that is constrained using conditions.&nbsp; 
 Use a new built-in role that has built-in conditions.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s look at each scenario.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How to delegate role assignment management using conditions 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meet Dara, a developer who needs to enable an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) managed identity to pull images from an Azure Container Registry (ACR). Now, you can assign Dara the Role Based Access Administrator role and add conditions so she can only assign the AcrPull and AcrPush roles and only to service principals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Delegate Azure role assignment management using conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s look at how to do this step by step:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 1: When creating a new role assignment, on the Privileged administrator roles tab select the new Role Based Access Control Administrator role. You could also select any built-in or custom role that includes the Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: Select role</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 2: On the Members tab, select the user you want to delegate the role assignments task to.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3: Select members</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 3: On the Condition tab, click Add condition to add the condition to the role assignment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 4: Add condition to role assignment&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 4: On the Add role assignment condition page, specify how you want to constrain the role assignments this user can perform by selecting one of the templates. For example, if you only want to restrict the roles that a user can assign (ex. AcrPull and AcrPush) and the type of principals the user can assign roles to (ex. service principals), select the Constrain roles and principal types template.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 5: Select role template</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 5: On the Constrain roles and principal types pane, add the roles you want the user to be able to assign and select to what principal types the user can assign roles to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 6: Select role and principal type&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 6: Save the condition and complete the role assignment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 7: Review role assignment with conditions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How to delegate role assignment management using a new built-in role with built-in conditions 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now Dara wants to control who can sign into virtual machines using Microsoft Entra ID credentials. To do this, Dara needs to create role assignments for the Virtual Machine User Login or Virtual Machine Administrator Login roles. In the past, you had to grant Dara the Owner or User Access Administrator role so she could make these assignments. Now, you can grant Dara the new Virtual Machine Data Access Administrator role. Then, Dara will only be able to assign the roles needed to manage access to the virtual machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 8: Virtual Machine Data Access Administrator&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, you can assign Key Vault Data Access Administrator role to trusted users managing key vaults, enabling them to assign only Azure Key Vault-related roles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To assign the new built-in roles with built-in conditions, start a new role assignment, select the Job function roles tab, and select a role with built-in conditions, such as Virtual Machine Data Access Administrator. Then complete the flow to add a new role assignment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 9 Select Key Vault or Virtual Machine Data Access Administrator</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Roles with built-in conditions have Data Access Administrator as part of the role name. Also, you can check if a role definition contains a condition. In the Details column, click View, select the JSON tab, and then inspect the condition property. Over time we’ll add more roles with built-in conditions, for the most common scenarios, to make it easy to manage resources and manage access to those resources with simple role assignments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have several<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/delegate-role-assignments-examples"> examples</a> for you to get started and customize as needed. Delegating Azure role assignments with conditions is supported using the Azure portal, Azure Resource Manager REST API, PowerShell, and Azure CLI.

<p>We’re betting that your customers are growing increasingly concerned about safeguarding their <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a> in an increasingly connected digital world. With data breaches and other privacy infringements at an <a href="https://mysudo.com/2022/02/another-reason-to-use-mysudo-data-breaches-hit-record-high-in-2021/">all-time high</a>, it’s hard to escape the headlines screaming at consumers to be more proactive about their privacy. What’s more, <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">consumer polls</a> all indicate that a growing number of consumers actually want to be proactive about privacy and want brands to step up too.<br><br>Two valuable ways that your customers can guard against <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/11/the-growing-risks-to-business-and-their-customers-from-the-dark-web/">scammers</a> are to develop safe browsing habits and use a password manager. For example, you could give your customers this common advice:</p>



 Safe browsing: navigating the digital landscape securely 







<p>a) Keep your software up to date: Regularly updating your operating system, web browser, and security software is an easy way to make sure you have the latest patches and fixes, shielding you from known vulnerabilities.</p>



<p>b) Beware of phishing attempts: Phishing emails and websites are designed to deceive you into revealing sensitive information. Stay vigilant by double-checking email senders, avoiding suspicious links, and refraining from sharing personal data on unverified websites.</p>



<p>c) Use secure connections: Make sure the websites you visit use the HTTPS protocol, particularly when you’re submitting sensitive information such as passwords or payment details. HTTPS encrypts the data transmission, making it significantly more challenging for malicious actors to intercept.</p>



<p>d) Exercise caution with downloads: Only download files or software from trusted sources. Scan files for malware before opening them, since malicious downloads can compromise your data and privacy.</p>



 Password managers: your secure vault for stronger login credentials 







<p>a) Generate strong, unique passwords: Password managers help you create complex passwords that are difficult to crack. You can generate and store unique passwords for each account, eliminating the need to remember them all.</p>



<p>b) Encrypted password storage: Password managers store your login credentials in an encrypted format, so even if the data is compromised, it remains unreadable to unauthorized people.</p>



<p>c) Convenient autofill and synchronization: With a password manager, you can conveniently autofill login forms across devices, eliminating the need to type passwords manually. Synchronization capabilities allow you to access your passwords securely from multiple devices.</p>



<p>d) Two-factor authentication (2FA) integration: Many password managers support 2FA, providing an extra layer of security by requiring a second verification step, such as a fingerprint scan or a unique code sent to your mobile device.</p>



<p>Protecting your data privacy requires an active and conscious effort in today’s digital landscape. By embracing safe browsing practices and using a password manager, you take significant steps towards safeguarding your personal information from cyber threats and reclaiming your online privacy.</p>



<p>This is all great advice to give your customers and we highly recommend you do. But what if we told you that you could go the extra mile and easily package a safe browser and VPN into your product mix? You’d make privacy management easier for your customers and build brand loyalty and revenue streams for your bottom line.</p>

<p>For far too many organizations, Identity and Access Management (IAM) has become a study in locking the storm window while leaving the front door wide open. From MGM to Facebook to T-Mobile and beyond, 2023 has found a growing number of security teams forced to chase down data breaches, ransomware attacks, and phishing scams after network access has been granted. Without the architecture to support modern forms of identity verification, we can’t seem to prevent cybercriminals from exploiting compromised logins to infiltrate corporate systems. Here’s why this keeps happening—and how plugging the identity gap in your IAM architecture can stop the insanity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 IAM a Mess: Why Your MFA Can’t Keep the MOFOs Out 
<p>Hackproof IAM requires two things: Verifying the identity of a user at enrollment and confirming that it’s this same individual attempting to log into an account.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most IAM systems are decades old and lack identity verification. Putting a checkmark to rudimentary identity verification for new users and then issuing weak credentials via email or Post-it note? Good luck with that. Password- and basic multi-factor authentication (MFA)-based IAM can only really ensure the person accessing an account knows the password or OTP. While basic forms of biometric authentication can confirm the person accessing an account is the same person who initially enrolled to do so, it can’t verify that person is who they claim to be. This is especially true for device-based biometrics, hardware tokens, and passkeys that assume but do not verify identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short: That proverbial front door is left wide open to account takeover (ATO)—including growing numbers that lead to <a href="https://www.scmagazine.com/resource/ransomware-gangs-take-less-than-a-day-to-breach-microsoft-active-directory-heres-what-to-do">Active Directory (AD)</a> and <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/north-korea-s-kimsuky-doubles-down-on-remote-desktop-control">Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)</a> breaches. But it doesn’t have to be this way.&nbsp;</p>
 Modernizing IAM: Architecture is Everything 
<p>At 1Kosmos, we long ago recognized what’s needed is a way to verify and authenticate identity online the same way we confirm it in real life—with a valid credential that can’t be vouched for by mere password, OTP, or a static, spoofable biometric. So we set out to modernize IAM by combining strong identity verification and authentication within an architecture that gives IT unmatched identity assurance behind each device used to access systems—while delivering an account registration and authentication experience that is as convenient as its hack proof. This architecture is built on the following five core pillars to fully eliminate the failures of traditional IAMs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Machine-verified Identity</p>
<p>&nbsp;The 1Kosmos architecture employs automated, digitally-verified identity exceeding stringent KYC, KYE, and AML guidelines. Identity verification via government-issued credentials (driver’s license, state ID, passport, certifications, health records, etc.) enables organizations to standardize the onboarding of workers, customers, and citizens to prevent the use of synthetic and stolen identity information at account enrollment—and seamless authentication that’s impervious to account takeover at login.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Biometric-based Strong User Authentication</p>
<p>&nbsp;Verified biometrics secured cryptographically with public-private keys vastly outperform passwords in both security and convenience. That’s why we built the first (and only) architecture to support and exceed <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">FIDO2</a>, <a href="https://www.ibeta.com/">iBeta biometrics</a>–, <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST 800-63-3</a>, and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-identity-attributes-trust-framework-updated-version">UK DIATF</a> security standards. Passwords are replaced with a secure identity wallet and a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/datasheets/live-id/">liveness test</a> to confirm the person attempting to log in is, in fact, the authorized user and not a bot, deep fake, or imposter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decentralized Identity With Privacy by Design</p>
<p>Once biometrics are digitized and stored, they can be stolen. In 1Kosmos BlockID, unauthorized access to personally identifiable information (PII) is prevented through a blockchain-based digital “chain of custody” for identity-related data. Because 1Kosmos is anchored by a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blockchain/privacy-by-design-iso-standard/">Privacy by Design</a> framework, organizations can confidently accelerate user onboarding, protect digital accounts from ATO, combat transaction fraud, and more. Fraudulent access attempts are detected, logged, and blocked automatically. And it’s all done in full compliance with GDPR, CCPA, CPRA, and other privacy mandates.</p>
<p>A Private, Permissioned Distributed Ledger&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This immutable “chain of custody” provides tamper-evident identity verification and reusable verifiable credentials on demand. This enables the user’s digital identity wallet to securely store a wide range of information—personal details, legal and education credentials, financial accounts, digital health records, etc. With irrefutable proof of identity and an immutable audit log of all updates and access attempts, organizations can focus on building customer loyalty and capture market share from less tech-savvy rivals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reusable Verifiable Credentials</p>
<p>High assurance and cryptographically secure storage and sharing establish repeatable, high-trust re-verification across a wide array of use cases. This can range from establishing “inferred” identity based on an email address or device that’s adequate for the intended use, to cross-referencing biometrics with government-issued forms of ID or information from banking, telco, or corporate databases, to the very highest levels of Know Your Customer (KYC) and Know Your Business (KYB) mandates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 A Foundation for Future-Proof IAM 
<p>This is all just the beginning. In forthcoming posts in this series, we’ll take a closer look at each pillar and its role in enabling and supporting a consistent and secure onboarding and authentication experience into all apps, devices, systems, and environments—including existing privileged access management systems.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>In the current digital landscape, the line that differentiates identity management from robust security is fast blurring. Many traditional identity solutions, initially designed to assist small businesses in transitioning identities to the cloud, are now buckling under the challenges posed by advanced enterprise complexities. <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-improve-okta-security">Okta</a>, initially conceived to simplify cloud-based identity, serves as a case in point. Its ongoing struggles highlight the pivotal difference between companies constructed mainly for identity management and those forged for identity security from the ground up, like HYPR.</p>  
 Defining an Identity Security Company  
<p>An identity security company goes beyond managing credentials; it embodies the protection of every snippet of information, every user interaction, and every digital echo from mounting threats. Unlike traditional identity companies that prioritize convenience, an identity security company places security as its top priority. Moreover, the focal point isn't solely user authentication, but on safeguarding the entire span of digital actions.&nbsp;</p> 
 Foundational Identity Security Controls  
<p>To genuinely emphasize security in identity management it’s important to embed identity security controls into the very fabric of the organization. These include:</p> 
  
  Phishing-Resistant Authentication Everywhere: It’s paramount to implement authentication methods that are <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-phishing-resistant-mfa">resilient to phishing attacks</a>. Moreover, there should never be a fallback to weaker or more vulnerable authentication techniques.  
  Security Education Across the Entire Business: Ensure a continuous inflow of updates on emerging threats and the latest security best practices. This must apply to everyone across the company, not just people touching the product.&nbsp;  
  Make the Business Allergic to Shared Secrets: When a hacker gets a foothold in an environment, they look for shared secrets such as API keys, tokens, static credentials, and others to try to spread throughout the environment. Eliminate shared secrets wherever possible and when you do have to use them, put tight controls on who has access and how they can be used.&nbsp;  
  Routine Security Audits That Aren’t Routine: Don’t just go for the checklist approach to security audits and compliance. Understand the true intent behind the compliance, regulatory or security obligations so that you are addressing core security needs. This keeps you ahead of the curve and able to implement solutions that mesh with your business objectives.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  Make Security Your Company Culture:&nbsp; A security-first mindset starts at the top. Understand that your customers' security needs take priority and reflect this in the choices you make.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  
 Designing a Secure Architecture  
<p>A well-designed secure architecture lays the foundation for a strong and reliable identity security solution. Critical elements include:</p> 
  
  Comprehensive Vulnerability Management: Invest time, effort and money into testing your solution from various angles to eliminate blind spots. Partner with multiple third-parties who are experts in their part of the tech stack. For us at HYPR, that means working with specialized pen testing partners on Mobile, Endpoint, Back-End, and Cloud.  
  Adherence to the Least Privilege Principle: Granting access only to essential resources ensures data integrity.  
  Uninterrupted Monitoring: A 24/7 vigil on all operations is vital to preemptively detect and counteract any potential threats.  
  
 Why Security Cannot Be an Afterthought  
<p>For companies in the identity domain, security must not be just a supplementary feature — it's their bedrock. Even a minor breach can erode trust and have <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/lessons-from-the-mgm-attack">lasting financial implications</a>. As the nature of cyber threats intensifies, a persistent and unwavering focus on security transitions from being an option to an imperative. By prioritizing security from the beginning, identity companies like HYPR ensure robust protection at all points of the digital journey.</p> 
 Guidance for Buyers: Making Informed Choices in Identity Products  
<p>When it comes to choosing an identity product, it's essential to make informed choices. Look for companies with a demonstrated track record in prioritizing security. By taking the time to gather information and ask the right questions, buyers can ensure they make the best choice for their identity security needs.</p> 
  
  Delve Deeper Than Features: The underlying principles, commitments, and practices of a company are often more telling than a mere feature list.  
  Ask for a Threat Model: Your Identity partners should be able to walk you through a comprehensive threat model of their business. If your security and technical folks aren’t happy with it, there’s a major issue.&nbsp;  
  Demand Transparency: Reputable companies will be forthright about their security protocols and will not shy away from sharing audit outcomes.  
  Verify Compliance Credentials: It's vital to ensure the solution aligns with global benchmarks like GDPR, CCPA, and the like. Be sure to check out HYPR’s <a href="https://www.hypr.com/trust-center/security-compliance">Compliance and Certifications</a>.  
  Seek Genuine Feedback: Interactions with current clients offer a transparent window into the product’s real-world performance.  
  
<p>To wrap up, as our digital footprints grow and identities become more intertwined with our real-world selves, the distinction between simply managing and truly securing these identities becomes paramount. HYPR, with its foundational emphasis on security, ensures that the complexities of identity management are met with unwavering security measures. While no one can be perfectly secure,&nbsp; our security first approach gives even the largest and most complex businesses in the world the confidence to work with HYPR.</p>

				 <p>By Helen Garneau</p>
<p>Whether private or public sector, B2B or B2C, our customers are excited by the power&nbsp; and value of verifiable credential technology. It’s a game-changing way to share and verify data and build seamless processes that deliver a multitude of benefits. From passwordless access to seamless account verification, mobile driver’s licenses to digital travel credentials, device monitoring to data sharing networks, verifiable credentials are driving digital transformation through the ability to trust the source and integrity of any kind of data, deter fraud, and deliver the kind of data protection demanded by regulators.</p>
<p>Healthcare companies are using verifiable credentials to develop more accurate and simple ways for patients to share health records between providers. Financial service companies are using verifiable credentials to power real-time account access verification. And governments are using verifiable credentials to deliver better access to business and public services for millions of people around the world.</p>
<p>None of this requires starting afresh or committing to months or years of complex implementation. Verifiable credential technology can be layered on top of what you already have in a matter of weeks or a few months (making it fast and cost effective to implement and use. It’s also easy and cost effective to scale up to whatever scale you need to achieve.</p>
<p>Benefits of verifiable credentials&nbsp;</p>
<p>In simple terms, verifiable credentials are powered by cryptographic trust and digital signatures. You can prove the source of any data presented from a verifiable credential and that the data hasn’t been tampered with. It’s a brilliant, simple, and (energy) efficient use of distributed ledger technology and new protocols and standards.</p>
<p>In practical terms, this means you don’t need to directly integrate different data sources or rely on third parties to manage identity verification. Data issued by a bank can be instantly verified by a retailer with the absolute assurance that it came from the named bank and hasn’t been altered. Instantly actionable data allows you to create new ways of doing business or radically simplify any kind of business interaction or service where high-value information has to be shared and verified (think KYC or mortgage applications or drone flight paths).</p>
<p>The ability to authenticate anyone (and they you) in a secure digital interaction deters fraud and phishing and makes the continuous verification needed for zero-trust security implementations a breeze.</p>
<p>So how do you get started? Indicio Proven™ is our complete product for building what we call a Trusted Digital Ecosystem. It’s based on our award-winning solutions for global enterprises and has everything you need to issue, hold, present, and share verifiable credentials — including a simple way to manage governance!</p>
<p>Instead of developer teams spending months installing new IAM systems, here’s how easy it is to go from an idea to implementation in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>Deployment in 3 easy steps</p>
<p>Whether you are a large enterprise with expansive resources or a small team with just a few developers, Indicio Proven™ is designed to be easy to adopt and integrate into your existing systems.</p>
<p>1. Install the Proven™ Issuer software agent on your&nbsp; server and connect it to the data source or service of their choice via standard APIs.</p>
<p>2. Use the&nbsp; Proven™ Issuer agent software to send&nbsp; an invitation URL (often in a QR code) to the person or organization you want to send a verifiable credential to (a “holder”). The verifiable credential contains the holder’s&nbsp; data, in an encrypted format, which is stored in a secure digital wallet app under the holder’s control, usually on their mobile device.</p>
<p>3. The holder can now present the data in their credential to anyone who has the Indicio Proven™ Verifier agent software, which can also be used on a mobile device. The Verifier application can also be connected via APIs to other services or systems to transmit the verified data.</p>
<p>Indicio helps a broad range of companies and organizations — <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/sita-and-indicio-announce-a-co-innovation-agreement-to-accelerate-the-development-of-digital-identities/">including SITA</a> —to&nbsp; build verifiable credential solutions using the latest open standards and open-source protocols.</p>

  <p>Hi friends,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today we’re excited to announce the public preview of Microsoft Graph Activity Logs. Have you wondered what applications are doing with the access you've granted them? Have you discovered a compromised user and hoped to find out what operations they have performed? If so, you can now gain full visibility into all HTTP requests accessing your tenant’s resources through the Microsoft Graph API.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Note: We're enabling&nbsp;the feature starting today. Public preview will be available in all public cloud regions within two weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>You’re currently able to collect SignIn logs to analyze authentication activity and Audit logs to see changes to important resources. With Microsoft Graph Activity Logs, you can now investigate the complete picture of activity in your tenant – from token request in SignIn logs, to API request activity (reads, writes, and deletes) in Microsoft Graph Activity Logs, to ultimate resource changes in Audit logs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Microsoft Graph Activity Logs include information about the request and client application. Some common use cases include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Identifying the activities that a compromised user account conducted in your tenant. 
 Building detections and behavioral analysis to identify suspicious or anomalous use of Microsoft Graph APIs – such as an application enumerating all users; or making probing requests with many 403 errors.  
 Investigating unexpected or unnecessarily privileged assignments of application permissions. 
 Identifying problematic or unexpected behaviors for client applications – such as extreme call volumes that exhaust rate-limits for the tenant. 
 
<p><br>To illustrate working with these logs, we can look at some basic LogAnalytics queries:<br><br>Summarize applications and principals that have made requests to change or delete groups in the past day:<br><br></p>




<p>MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs </p>
<p>| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(1d)</p>
<p>| where RequestUri contains '/group'</p>
<p>| where RequestMethod != "GET"</p>
<p>| summarize UriCount=dcount(RequestUri) by AppId, UserId, ServicePrincipalId, ResponseStatusCode</p>




<p>&nbsp;<br>To see recent requests that failed due to authorization:<br><br></p>




<p>MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs </p>
<p>| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(1h)</p>
<p>| where ResponseStatusCode == 401 or ResponseStatusCode == 403</p>
<p>| project AppId, UserId, ServicePrincipalId, ResponseStatusCode, RequestUri, RequestMethod</p>
<p>| limit 1000</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Get top 20 app instances by request count:<br><br></p>




<p>MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs </p>
<p>| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(1d)</p>
<p>| summarize RequestCount=count() by AppId, IpAddress, UserAgent</p>
<p>| sort by RequestCount</p>
<p>| limit 20</p>

<p>It seems you can’t go anywhere today without <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-ai">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> creeping into the conversation. Billed by some as being as, or potentially more disruptive than the internet, AI and machine learning (ML) are laying the foundation for the next digital age, whether we’re ready or not.</p>
<p>Bankers are taking note. According to a survey from <a href="https://impact.economist.com/perspectives/financial-services/forging-new-frontiers-advanced-technologies-will-revolutionise-banking">The Economist Intelligence Unit</a>, 77% of bankers believe that the ability to unlock the value of AI will be the difference between winning and losing banks. And there are many obvious use cases for bankers to up their game with AI including:</p>
 
 Account inquiries – employing chatbots to provide updates on account balances, transaction history, and other account-related information 
 Credit score monitoring – AI-enabled assistance for customers to check their credit ratings and advice on how to improve them 
 Fraud prevention – training AI models to detect fraudulent patterns and behaviors 
 Customer service – deploying chatbots to provide real-time customer care by answering common questions and addressing simple issues 
 Investment guidance – real-time, personalized investment advice leveraging AI to provide targeted assistance based on consumers’ specific preferences and risk tolerance 
 
<p>But it’s not all sunshine and unicorns as they say. AI is also being adopted by cybercriminals of all shapes and sizes at an alarming rate, straining traditional cybersecurity paradigms. AI’s automation prowess is a double threat – increasing the scale of attacks, while also lowering the required skill level and resources to be able to execute attacks. And banks are seeing the impact firsthand. U.S. banks reported a <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/fraud-prevention/2023/banks-and-payment-firms-tap-ai-to-combat-fraud-amid-surge-in-sophisticated-financial-crime/">43% increase in fraud attacks</a> year over year, with the average cost of fraud for large financial institutions jumping by 65%.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.electronicpaymentsinternational.com/comment/colum-lyons-expert-comment-the-rise-of-ai-deepfakes-and-how-to-take-back-control/">Deepfakes</a> and <a href="https://www.scmagazine.com/perspective/three-questions-to-ask-about-synthetic-identities">synthetic identities</a> represent two of the most nefarious challenges to banks and credit unions who are seeking to prevent fraudulent account openings and takeovers while also complying with eKYC (electronic Know Your Customer) regulations. An added challenge is to apply an extra layer of security AND improve the customer experience. For account opening this starts with AI-enabled document validation and biometric identity verification using the customer’s mobile phone. This ensures the document is a valid form and instance of the credential, and that the person presenting the identity credential is the owner of that credential. Once verified, the customer provides a digital signature to accept the terms and conditions and presto! – a digital payment credential is issued securely, all in a matter of minutes!</p>
<p>Once the account is opened, AI and ML also play a critical role in helping the financial institution model and detect fraud, plus enhanced <a href="https://www.entrust.com/-/media/documentation/datasheets/iam-adaptive-authentication-ds.pdf">risk-based authentication</a> with behavioral biometrics helps identify fraudulent patterns and unauthorized users early.</p>

The individual can then access, add, and curate their data, and they can manage how their data is shared with other organizations.”</blockquote><p>Yes. That’s right.

<p>You come into a gathering, and everyone is talking about verifiable credentials. What’s the first thing that comes to mind? You’ll most likely think of certifications, degrees, or anything that belongs to you that can be used to attest that you are who you say you&nbsp;are.</p><p>In the physical world, a credential can be a physical asset one can carry around in their wallet to prove their identity. Credentials can be verified by examining them or by making a call to the issuers of such credentials. For&nbsp;example</p>  A birth certificate issued by a hospital proves when and where you were born and who your parents&nbsp;are  A passport can be issued by the government of a country to prove that you’re a citizen of that&nbsp;country  A certificate issued by the university proves that you have an educational degree  <p>All of these are physical examples of credentials with a human subject, but how does this play out in the digital&nbsp;world?</p><p>In the first article in this series, we looked at decentralized identity and why it matters. In this piece, we’ll be delving deeper into verifiable credentials and how they work. First, let’s take a look at some of the problems VCs are trying to&nbsp;solve.</p>  Identity fraud: Verifiable credentials provide a secure and tamper-proof way of sharing personal information, reducing the risk of identity&nbsp;fraud.  Information leakage: Sharing of user data is often done in bulk, leading to leakage of more information than necessary and loss of privacy. Through selective disclosure, verifiable credentials can be used to limit the amount of personal information that is shared while still enabling organizations to verify the information they&nbsp;need.  Data silos: Centralized systems often require individuals to share sensitive information with every organization that needs it, leading to the creation of large honeypots of user data with many organizations, increasing the risk of data breaches.  Walled gardens: Issuers of credentials can impose barriers to verification if they are involved in the verification process. Verifiable credentials are self-certifying and don’t require the involvement of the issuer when being verified.   How VCs&nbsp;work <p>There are three entities you’ll come across quite often while studying verifiable credentials:</p>  The issuer  The holder  The verifier  <p>The entity that issues the credential is known as the issuer; the holder is the subject of the credential; and the verifier is the organization that determines if the credential satisfies the requirements for a VC. Let’s take a look at each of these entities in&nbsp;detail:</p> The Issuer <p>An issuer in a verifiable credentials ecosystem is an entity that creates and issues digital credentials to holders. These issuers can be academic institutions, banks, the government, or corporate bodies.</p><p>For example, a university might be an issuer of a digital diploma to a student named John. The university would be responsible for creating the digital diploma, which would include information such as the student’s name, degree earned, and graduation date.</p><p>The university would then issue the digital diploma to the student, who would be the credential holder. The issuer must prove that they are authorized and competent to issue digital credentials by providing a form of identification and proof of identity, which can be done by providing a digital certificate or signature.</p> The Holder <p>A holder is an individual or entity that holds or possesses a digital credential, such as a diploma, a driver’s license, or a professional certification. The holder can present the credential to a verifier, such as an employer or a government agency, to prove their identity or qualifications.</p><p>John, from our previous example, is a recent graduate from a university. The university is the issuer of John’s diploma. John is the holder of his diploma, meaning he possesses it in a digital&nbsp;format.</p><p>The holder can also compile the data sent by one or more issuers and create a verifiable presentation.</p> The Verifier <p>A verifier is an entity that checks the authenticity of a credential issued to a holder by an issuer. It also checks for other things, like validity and competency.</p><p>In this example, when John applies for a job, the employer, who is the verifier, will ask John to present his diploma to prove that he has completed his degree. The employer uses a set of verifiable credentials protocols to check the authenticity of the credentials. This includes verifying the issuer’s signature, checking that the credential has not been tampered with, and confirming that the information in the credential matches the information that the employer has on file for&nbsp;John.</p><p>Once the employer has verified the credential, they can trust that the information in the credential is accurate and that it was issued by a trusted issuer, which allows the employer to make informed decisions about John’s qualifications for the&nbsp;job.</p> Let’s graphically look at the workflow for verifiable credentials: <p>The issuer signs an identity and sends it to the holder. The holder creates a verifiable presentation and sends it to the verifier. The verifier checks to know if the data is competent, viable, and authentic. Another possible workflow is that the verifier requests data from the holder, who reaches out to the issuer to send the&nbsp;data.</p><p>In the Verifiable Credentials ecosystem, the issuer and holder are required to use decentralized identifiers or DIDs. A decentralized identifier (DID) is a technique to identify something or oneself online without depending on a centralized entity, such as a large corporation or the government. Imagine it as the digital equivalent of your passport or license that you may use to verify your identity&nbsp;online.</p> Deconstructing a Verifiable Credential <p>A subject is typically a person, but it could also be a thing, such as hardware device type, expiration, and issuer, which are properties of the credential proof used to verify the integrity of a credential. A proof is typically expressed as a digital signature, made with the private key of the&nbsp;issuer.</p> Main problems currently experienced in the VC&nbsp;world. <p>According to Cheqd’s deep-dive survey on technical trends in decentralized identity, the top 5 blockers to the adoption of decentralized identity by enterprises</p><p>The fundamental element of SSI is receiving a set of claims and verifiable credentials in your identity wallet and then presenting them to a third&nbsp;party.</p><p>The mechanism that delivers one verifiable credential to a holder’s wallet must be able to connect with a totally separate piece of software that is receiving a verifiable credential or presentation on the end of the verifier in order for SSI to become an interoperable ecosystem.</p><p>Different systems for issuing and verifying verifiable credentials should be compatible, making it easy for credentials to be recognized and accepted across different platforms and organizations.</p><p>However, the various systems currently do not allow for credential interoperability.</p><p>Verifiable credentials are also not as user-friendly as they should be and are difficult for individuals and organizations to understand and use, as they require a certain level of technical knowledge and may involve multiple different software and hardware components.</p><p>The Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), the W3C Credentials Community Group, and the Verifiable Organizations Network (VON) are working to promote the development of open standards for self-sovereign identity (SSI) and verifiable credentials. They aim to make SSI systems more user-friendly and to promote interoperability between different SSI&nbsp;systems.</p><p>While these organizations are working to solve these problems, they still persist. The complexity of verifiable credentials and the infrastructure required to support them still make them difficult for individuals and organizations to understand and use. Additionally, interoperability issues between different systems for issuing and verifying verifiable credentials remain a problem, as do the privacy and security issues that verifiable credentials can&nbsp;pose.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/veramo/how-verifiable-credentials-work-2648733abd59">How Verifiable Credentials Work</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/veramo">Veramo</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Marius Goeddert</a></p><p>In a recent interview with the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/86c67471-52ae-40ff-b99b-b0c13b52c524">Financial Times</a>, EON chief executive Leon Birnbaum expressed frustration with Germany’s cyber protection of critical infrastructures.If a successful serious cyberattack were to occur, he believes his company, which operates Germany’s largest gas and electricity distribution network, would be “on its own”. Operating power grids in nine European countries including Sweden, Hungary and the Czech Republic, EON is “constantly” under attack by cybercriminals, some of which are suspected state-backed actors.</p>
<p>Unlike most cybercriminals, the aim of state-backed actors is increasingly not about making money but using data encryption malware attacks to create fear for political purposes. This is what Alexander Klimburg, Senior Fellow at the Hague Center for Strategic Studies calls “ransomwar”. In his opinion, WannaCry and NotPetya were the first major ransomwar attacks launched by governments.</p>
<p>At cyberevolution, Alexander will give a keynote about “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5660">Surviving between the Cyber Frontlines</a>” in which he will address information and cyber warfare and what organizations can do to protect themselves. Take a glimpse into is keynote in today’s cyberfile and learn which good habits need to be instilled through training to minimize the chances of being hit. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Our world is evolving faster than ever. Technology has woven itself into our daily lives, bringing unprecedented convenience and posing new challenges. As we step into the 20th Annual Cybersecurity Awareness Month, we are at a crossroads: a world where much of the way we interact and conduct business and commerce is digital-first, and one where data, privacy, and identity are under rising threats.</p>
<p>Our ability to add trust and security into this digital-first world is the key to unlocking its many benefits to business, government, and our everyday lives.</p>
<p>A Digital World in Flux</p>
<p>This is where Cybersecurity Awareness Month takes center stage. Founded in 2004, this annual initiative has become a global call to action, illuminating the path toward a safer digital future. It’s a collaborative endeavor, uniting businesses, governments, educational institutions, and individuals in a shared mission to educate and empower.</p>
<p>This year, Cybersecurity Awareness Month introduces a new theme, “Secure Our World,” focusing on four pivotal best practices:</p>
 
 Password Manager Advocacy: Debunking myths surrounding password managers and emphasizing their benefits. 
 Multi-factor Authentication (MFA): Encouraging the adoption of multi-factor authentication for enhanced security. 
 Phishing Awareness: Equipping individuals to recognize and thwart phishing attempts, a prominent tactic of cybercriminals. 
 Update Hygiene: Promoting the importance of regular software updates and automated updates. 
 
<p>These best practices are just the start, of course, and critical for individuals seeking to improve their own security posture. We provide many of these services to customers, including <a href="https://www.entrust.com/-/media/documentation/datasheets/zero-trust-foundations-sb.pdf">multi-factor authentication and phishing-resistant identities</a>.</p>
<p>Commitment to Cybersecurity That Enables a Digital World</p>
<p>At Entrust, securing the digital world isn’t just a mission; it’s wound into the very fibers of our DNA. We take this mission seriously because our customers take this mission seriously. We know that when we provide solutions that protect data, enable strong identities, and secure payments, we are enabling everyday moments that require a high degree of trust. They are astonishingly easy for end-users yet highly complex to implement.</p>
<p>As digital life accelerates, we‘re helping our customers solve bigger challenges, like Zero Trust frameworks and multi-cloud network security. We are enabling seamless and secure travel, and readying enterprises for post-quantum encryption. We’re also supporting banks and governments to secure and enable digital-first journeys for account opening and government services.</p>
<p>As we celebrate Cybersecurity Awareness Month, Entrust stands shoulder to shoulder with the global community, embracing the challenge of securing an ever-evolving digital world. While our experts contribute their insights and guidance, security and business leaders need to protect their organizations and enable their growth and scale.</p>
<p>A Collaborative Undertaking</p>
<p>Cybersecurity Awareness Month is co-managed by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the National Cybersecurity Alliance, a united effort to create a safer, more resilient cyberspace. It has garnered recognition from federal, state, and local governments, along with industry and academic leaders. This is truly a team sport.

<p>In a recent survey conducted by Entrust across 10+ countries, banks, payment companies, and credit unions overwhelmingly reported that flat card technology has accelerated and shifted into overdrive. What may have been originally considered as an “unimpressive” change to the look of traditional embossing, flat cards have evolved into a financial issuance mainstay with astonishing designs and an elegant chic finish. Here we will explore the magnitude of this shift, input drivers, outputs, and future indicators.</p>
<p>Flat Card Adopters</p>
<p>Most interestingly, the survey highlights an astonishing 77% of surveyed financial institutions are actively issuing flat cards today. North America and Europe lead the way as they are typically the first global adopters of innovative technology with large banking headquarters on both continents.</p>
<p>Assuming similar technology adoption rates in this industry, we can expect a proportional upward trend and transition to flat card in the coming years. Even though embossed cards maintain some geographic and niche market presence – for example in Africa and the Middle East – the paradigm shift to flat technology has been further strengthened by significant gains in options for customization and efficiency.</p>
<p>Flat Card Technology Adoption Drivers</p>
<p>Equally compelling, when asked about the reason organizations choose to move to flat card, 73% of survey respondents identified two key components: enhanced branding opportunities and the modernization of traditional designs. Additionally, 60% cited either reduced cost and/or increased efficiency as the secondary driver, followed by maintaining a competitive advantage, staying relevant in the marketplace, and consumer demand.</p>
<p>When evaluating the factors influencing their decision to adopt flat card technology, respondents were almost evenly split between competitors driving the technology and marketing-driven requests in their go-to-market strategy, with competitors holding a slight edge in this regard. More specifically:</p>
 
 Among project management respondents, 36% attributed adoption to the need to stay competitive, while 26% attributed it to marketing directives. 
 Among those in payment roles, 43% indicated that adoption resulted from marketing department requests, with 30% attributing it to competitive pressure. 
 
<p>An alternative interpretation of the data reveals that internal requests, originating from marketing and operations, drove slightly over half of the adoptions, accounting for 51%, surpassing the influence of external factors such as competition (36%) and customer requests (9%). It is worth mentioning that adoption rates in this context are comparative within the nature of the survey itself and migration to innovative technologies typically includes elevated levels of consumer demand early in the product roadmap process.</p>
<p>Flat Card Technology Features</p>
<p>As financial institutions and fintechs migrate to flat card, the value proposition continues to become clearer. Customers demand fresh designs, a customizable platform, and the ability to connect with loyalty programs or niche movements like eco-friendly formats. Flat cards are delivering. Period.</p>
<p>When asked about the customizable features and benefits offered by flat cards, respondents cited the following as the most frequently utilized within their issuance arsenal:</p>
 
 Personalization on the card’s back, allowing the entire card front for financial institutions to highlight their brand 
 Vertical card orientation 
 Metallic personalization 
 Enhanced personal account number (PAN) features 
 
<p>Flat Card Technology Outputs</p>
<p>Simply, flat card drives business. Upon adoption of flat cards, 77% of respondents saw an increase in transaction volumes, including 61% of those who experienced a 1%-25% increase, and 15% realizing greater than 25% growth by volume. This is the most compelling evidence for any issuer considering the value proposition of switching to flat cards, making it nearly impossible not to draw significant conclusions about ROI and the decision to switch without delay.</p>
<p>The secondary responses in this same category paint a beautiful picture – flat cards save money. 64% saw machine efficiencies and additional cost savings, while another 40% cited third-party issuance efficiencies.</p>
<p>For anyone needing a reason to immediately evaluate the impact of flat cards on their business and, in turn, customer satisfaction, this is where the undeniable evidence is crystal clear. Banks that have adopted flat card are experiencing higher transaction volumes and lower costs. The icing on the cake? 92% highlight their enhanced capacity for personalized customization. Can it get any better than this?</p>
<p>Flat Card Future Predictors</p>
<p>Can we predict the future of flat card? Not quite. However, our survey respondents are certainly leading us down a favorable path. For those financial institutions who are not currently issuing flat cards, 56% plan to in the next two years, while 35% are exploring options to consider this newer technology.</p>
<p>A final thought on future predictors: 61% of those who have not adopted flat card have invested recently in new issuance systems. Although we do not know exactly what type of equipment or systems, this highlights the simple fact that options exist and machine lifecycles are long. We also know that certain geographies or regions continue to demonstrate some demand for traditional embossed cards – they play a significant role in perceived value and probably will continue to do so for the near future.</p>
<p>Entrust continues to support the flat card movement, bridging the gap between personalization equipment, secure customer interactions, and the latest technology and innovations in high-volume central and instant financial issuance for this technology. Our portfolio of solutions including Entrust Durable Graphics, Drop on Demand, Artista Desktop, Artista VHD, and Sigma DS4 Light Curing Module continue to offer product and platform flexibility built around flat card opportunities.</p>

Afterwards, they can easily connect them within the Ocean Protocol ecosystem using either the <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Market</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-cli">ocean.cli</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.js">ocean.js</a> or <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py">ocean.py</a>.</p> Seamless file uploads with Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p><a href="https://uploader.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Uploader</a> streamlines the data upload process for users, facilitating direct transfers to decentralized storage platforms such as <a href="https://www.arweave.org/">Arweave</a>. Traditionally, uploading to Arweave requires the AR token; however, Ocean Uploader leverages <a href="https://irys.xyz/">Irys</a> to enable users to pay for storage in MATIC, instead of AR tokens. The uploader efficiently manages all required conversions behind the scenes, leveraging the robust capabilities of the Ocean Protocol&nbsp;stack.</p><p>Furthermore, Uploader offers a range of powerful features tailored to meet the needs of decentralized storage management:</p>  User Content Uploads: Users can seamlessly upload their content through the user-friendly frontend interface.  Payment Handling: Uploader integrates with payment systems to manage the financial aspects of storage services.  Decentralized Storage: Content is pushed to decentralized storage networks like Arweave for enhanced security and redundancy.  API Documentation: Comprehensive API documentation on each repo to allow users to understand and interact with the system effortlessly.  <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/uploader.js">Uploader.js</a>: a TypeScript library designed to simplify interaction with the Uploader API. This library provides a user-friendly and intuitive interface for calling API endpoints within the Ocean Uploader&nbsp;system.  <p>Ocean Uploader is built on multiple layers. At the core, there is <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/uploader_backend">the backend layer</a>, which exposes both public and private APIs for interactions with the frontend and microservices. Additionally, there’s the microservice layer, serving each decentralized storage (currently Arweave) and future&nbsp;options.</p><p>Moving up the layers, there is the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/uploader.js">open-source library</a> that provides a user-friendly and intuitive interface for making API calls within the Ocean Uploader system. Building on this, we’ve also created a <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/uploader-ui-lib">UI component</a> that can be seamlessly integrated into your dApp, offering a range of functionalities right out of the&nbsp;box.</p><p>And, to complete this puzzle, there’s the <a href="https://uploader.oceanprotocol.com/">UI</a> deployed by Ocean that you can readily&nbsp;use.</p> Connecting Data Storage with Data Monetization <p>Ocean Uploader is an evolutionary leap for all users of decentralized storage solutions as it connects data storage directly with data monetization solutions provided by Ocean Protocol. By streamlining the data storage, Ocean Uploader encourages greater adoption of decentralized storage options, as well as new business models built on top — eventually benefiting both data providers and data consumers.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a> has pioneered the fusion of privacy-preserving technology with decentralized application development. The Ocean Protocol toolkit has empowered numerous developers and innovators to reimagine data’s potential, ensuring that it’s both a tool for progress and a valuable asset for its contributors.</p> About Arweave <p><a href="https://www.arweave.org/">Arweave</a> is a permanent and decentralized web inside an open ledger. Just like Bitcoin, but for data. Permanent storage has many applications: from the preservation of humanity’s most important data, to the hosting of truly decentralized and provably neutral web&nbsp;apps.</p><p>The Arweave protocol is stable, mature and widely&nbsp;adopted.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-ocean-uploader-seamless-file-uploads-70d563bc8167">Introducing Ocean Uploader: Seamless File Uploads</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p></p> Principal VIRA Features <p>Enhanced Privacy:&nbsp;<br>VIRA was created with the user's privacy in mind. It enables individuals to exercise control over their digital identity, ensuring that personal information is protected and shared only when and with whom the user deems appropriate.</p><p><br>Blockchain-Agnostic Technology:<br>VIRA's blockchain-agnostic approach is one of its most significant advantages. This technology is compatible with a variety of blockchain networks, ensuring that users are not restricted to a single platform. This adaptability is essential in a time when multiple blockchains and networks coexist, each with their own distinct advantages.</p><p><br>Interoperability:<br>Tangle Labs has constructed VIRA using open standards to maximize interoperability. This means that VIRA can be easily integrated into diverse digital ecosystems, allowing for seamless interactions across different platforms, industries, and services.</p><p><br>Self-sovereign Identity:<br>Using self-sovereign identity technology, VIRA enables individuals to own, control, and manage their identity without the need for intermediaries. This feature not only increases privacy, but also decreases the likelihood of identity theft and data breaches.</p><p><br>Decentralization:<br>With decentralization as its foundation, VIRA eliminates the need for centralized authorities to manage and verify identity. Rather, it employs blockchain technology to enable decentralized identity management, granting users absolute control over their personal data.</p><p><br><br></p> Impact of VIRA on Digital Identity <p>VIRA emerges as an important milestone in the realm of self-sovereign identity and decentralized identity management as digital identity continues to play a crucial role in our daily lives. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Empowering Users:<br>VIRA gives users the ability to manage their identities as they see fit. It returns control to the individual, allowing them to decide what and with whom they share information. This shift towards user-centric identity management is crucial for the protection of personal information and privacy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Flexibility and Interoperability: <br>VIRA's blockchain-agnostic approach guarantees that it is not dependent on a particular network or technology. This adaptability is essential in the rapidly evolving digital world, where new blockchain platforms and technologies emerge on a regular basis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Security and Trust: <br>Self-sovereign identity and decentralized identity management are essential for enhancing digital security and trust. VIRA mitigates the risks associated with data breaches and identity theft by decreasing reliance on centralized authorities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Universal Applicability:<br>VIRA's open standards and interoperability make it applicable to a vast array of industries, such as finance, healthcare, e-commerce, and more. This adaptability enables users to utilize their verifiable identity wallet in a variety of situations, thereby enhancing their online security and convenience.<br><br><br><br></p> What the Future Holds&nbsp; <p>The Beta release of VIRA positions Tangle Labs at the forefront of the upcoming eIDAS 2.0 and European Digital Identity Wallet space. Built to conform to these global standards and EU frameworks, VIRA will be able to support the upcoming regulatory updates that are expected in 2025. The EU mandate on cross-border interoperability for identity and verifiable credentials and documents will become <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX%3A52021PC0281#:~:text=IDENTIFICATION%20MEANS%E2%80%99%3B-,(16),-the%20following%20Articles">a compulsory technology for businesses operating in education, transport, energy and water utilities, banking and finances, social services, healthcare, digital technologies and telecommunications, and more.</a></p>

  <p>With VIRA already supporting these technologies and updates being closely followed, Tangle Labs are positioned to become a leading provider in the space as the regulations come into effect. Tangle Labs' presence in Berlin, Germany also provides VIRA with a solid foundation in the epicenter of Europe's technology and innovation. This global perspective, coupled with VIRA's features, makes it a valuable asset for individuals seeking to secure their digital identities across the globe.<br></p> And, last but not least… <p>VIRA by Tangle Labs is more than just an app; it is a significant step toward redefining how we manage and secure our digital identities. Individuals, businesses, and institutions are recognizing the need for enhanced privacy, control, and security as the digital landscape continues to evolve. VIRA addresses these concerns through its user-centric design, blockchain agnosticism, and dedication to self-sovereign and decentralized identity technology practices.</p><p>Tangle Labs has positioned itself as a key player in the digital identity space with the introduction of VIRA, a solution that empowers individuals, improves security, and fosters trust in a world that is increasingly digital. VIRA represents a beacon of hope for those seeking to regain control of their online identities as the digital identity landscape continues to evolve.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.tanglelabs.vira&amp;pli=1">Download VIRA beta for Android</a></p><p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/in/app/vira-wallet/id6466040524">Download VIRA beta for iOS</a></p><p><a href="https://demo.tanglelabs.io">Try out the demo</a></p><p></p><p>New to the 0.2.0-BETA</p>  <p>Updated UX/UI</p>  <p>Credential &amp; Connection tagging and search</p>  <p>Backup and restore functionality</p>  <p>Connections history </p>  <p>Auto-Lock functionality</p>  <p>Upgraded User Account &amp; Profiles</p>  <p>Multi-Lingual Support (if you want to help with translations, let us know)</p>  <p>Optimised QR interactions - near instant scan</p>  <p>Optimised codebase - just a 7MB Install!!!</p>  <p>Full support for iPad &amp; Android Tablet</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>Did you know that in the United States, 38% of students enter a university with transfers from other universities? This highlights how crucial credit mobility is. However, there exists significant friction in credit mobility today, as I’m sure some readers have experienced in their own lives. Credit mobility is a challenge in itself within the United States, so we can imagine the challenges when considering students transferring from different countries.</p>
<p>What’s notable about the <a href="https://tech.asu.edu/initiatives/trusted-learner-network">Trusted Learner Network (TLN)</a> is that they’ve brought together key stakeholders from higher education institutions. These institutions recognize the business case for issuing user-controlled, portable, interoperable digital credentials, such as diplomas, to facilitate credit mobility and reduce associated costs and friction. They also understand the importance of making learner data more accessible and dynamic, as opposed to the current static nature of such data.</p>
<p>To give you a feel for the discussion, here are a couple of quote from the episode that I thought to be interested and very related one to another.</p>
<p>The first,</p>
<blockquote><p>So I feel like a diploma is extremely valuable, right? It represents the sort of culmination or termination of a set program of study towards a specific subject that is designed to empower the learner with like a both broad and deep understanding of what it is that they study it. It continues to be valuable and also the strongest trust signal that we have going for us in communicating that value. When we take a step back, though, we recognize that that diploma or degree is composed of a series of other credentials that might have individual that likely do have a very high individual value. So the average undergraduate student, when they graduate, they’re going to have taken about 40 courses or about 120 credits, and each of those 40 courses represents the achievement of a set of knowledge, skills, capabilities, and we can dig down perhaps even further to that to embrace things like skills and competencies.</p></blockquote>
<p>And second,</p>
<blockquote><p>Does the diploma still have meaning? In the vision and the implementation that we’re working on, it actually is way more meaningful because it says so much more in a way that can actually be, you know, understood both&nbsp;by machines and people than, you know, what just a printed out diploma framed on my wall used to be able to communicate. </p></blockquote>
<p>By collaborating with a broader ecosystem, which includes learners and institutions beyond just higher education, such as employers, the Trusted Learner Network seeks to harness advancements in digital trust, enabling technologies, and ecosystem governance frameworks to transform the learner economy. The potential value unlocked by streamlining credit mobility and enhancing the significance of credentials like diplomas is immense. This leads us to consider other types of learner credentials that individuals might accumulate throughout their learning journey. Personally, I’ve gathered numerous ‘credentials’ post-University. How can we digitize these and present them to the rightful owner alongside more traditional credentials like diplomas?</p>
<p>Listen to this episode to learn more, and hopefully it will spark some great thoughts for you on the possible.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>—</p>
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Kate, Andrew and myself in this podcast include:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Impact of freely available online information on higher education – How has the trend of easily accessible online information, such as courses and certificates, influenced the strategies of universities and higher education institutions? 
 Value of diplomas and other credentials in the modern age – With the rise of various credentials and certificates, is the traditional university diploma still as valuable? What other credentials might a learner want to accumulate? 
 Modernizing systems of records and the role of issuers – How are systems of records being modernized to make credentials more mobile and trusted? Who are the potential issuers beyond traditional universities? 
 Value of personal references and incentives for issuers – Is there value in making it easier for individuals, like professors, to provide references or credentials? How do incentives differ for various types of issuers? 
 Importance of governance in the context of digital credentials – With the growing focus on governance over technology, how is the authenticity and trustworthiness of digital credentials being ensured? 
 User experience (UX) and wallet infrastructure for digital credentials – How is the user experience being optimized for digital credential wallets? Where will learner credentials be stored, and how will they be accessed? 
 Role of verifiers in the TLN digital credential ecosystem – How are verifiers being integrated into the network, and how does their role tie into the prioritization of use cases? How will the adoption of digital credentials be spurred among verifiers?

 We sit down with our Vice President of Global Gaming to discuss the upcoming changes to the UK’s gambling sector, the need for continued industry collaboration, and how to safeguard against the undeniable growth of the unlicensed market. 



 



<p>On the surface, there appears to be little in common between the tiny Caribbean island of Curaçao, and the densely populated island of the United Kingdom, but both will be important case studies in the evolution of the online gambling market, according to Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk, Vice President of Global Gaming at IDnow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the established <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-gambling-white-paper/">UK gambling market is undergoing a series of changes to its regulatory framework</a> to reflect the digital age, Curacao, a market known for its low barrier to entry and <a href="https://igamingbusiness.com/legal-compliance/regulation/curacao-to-overhaul-regime-with-new-regulator-higher-bar-to-entry/">little to no scrutiny from operators</a>, is also reforming its licensing regime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Important endeavors that Roger believes need to be undertaken carefully or run the risk of an exodus of licensed operators and increase in the use of the illegal market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This conundrum is shared across many international jurisdictions, including the Netherlands, Sweden, Ontario, and very soon, France,” explains Roger. “An open and fair environment is no guarantee of success. If we look at Norway, for example, many of the world’s most experienced and trusted operators have pulled out, leaving players with the binary choice of using a monopolized industry, or unlicensed operators.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although a delicate task to complete, offering a regulated gambling environment is key to the sustainable growth of a jurisdiction’s gambling market, and the pivotal third pillar in propping up a safe, secure and protected player environment. A burden of responsibility that any regulator must share with the operator and player.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In my opinion, it is first and foremost the operator’s responsibility to provide a safe and responsible gambling experience, because this is good for the operator’s business model. However, this must be facilitated by a reliable regulatory environment that is proactive in its fight against fraud and the illegal market. So, the regulator needs to be an ally to those licensed operators. This is how the player will become better protected.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this interview, Roger shares his insights on the likely impact of the now <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/arguments-against-affordability-checks-gambling/">mandatory financial risk checks in the UK</a>, the real reason UK operators are subjected to such high and regular fines, why most operators are looking at <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC</a> completely wrong, and much more.</p>



 The United Kingdom Gambling Commission (UKGC) has started its first round of consultations. Do you agree with UKGC’s four areas of priority? Do you think there are other more pressing areas that it should have started with?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>It was 2018 when the UKGC started to discuss issues around affordability, but back then it was under the umbrella topic of customer interactions, and markers of harm were not the center of focus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Financial risk and financial vulnerability is the right topic to prioritize and the most important consultation to undertake, because affordability is the comfort zone for the player and the operator’s business. A gambling platform should be running its business with a business plan that is in line with its risk appetite, and ability to invest and be exposed to financial impact. In online casinos, there can be big losses and big payouts, so it’s important to balance the comfort zone of the operator with the comfort zone of the player.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately, affordability is the customer playing and spending money in a way that is going to be sustainable in the long term for the business and the customer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding the control of marketing and advertising consultation, however, I don’t think it’s detailed enough in terms of what they are trying to achieve. For example, what ‘good’ actually looks like has not been defined. It’s still quite vague, particularly in terms of the coordination and cooperation between the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/license-conditions-codes-of-practice-lccp/">Licence Conditions and Codes of Practice (LCCP) </a>from the UKGC, Competition and Markets Authority regulations, Advertising Standards Authority, and The UK Code of Broadcast Advertising requirements. As there are many contradictions between the various rules, I think the first consultation should be around organizing and encouraging those different regulatory bodies to have one set of objectives, ambitions, and rules.&nbsp;</p>



 What effect do you foresee the now mandatory financial risk checks to have on the UK gambling market?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>If the mandatory financial risk checks really end up being as ‘frictionless’ as the UKGC promises, then this is an opportunity to improve the relationship between the player and the operator, because the financial risk check will allow the operator to better know his customer and better tailor their offering; the pace and velocity of the game, and amounts that are going to be offered, either through marketing or the games themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’m unaware of any operator that asks players what kind of games they prefer, or whether they’re playing for the thrill or something else. Usually, they will assess this based on the choice of games made by the players.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, used correctly, affordability markers of harm and behavioral analysis will enable the operator to increase and improve the granularity of the relationship, or even initiate that relationship between the operator and the players. The other effect is that if it is not as frictionless as is promised, for example, credit checks are not granted to licensed operators, then the immediate effect is going to be a tremendous increase in the illegal market – what is called the black markets – and operators not licensed in the UK and not abiding by the UKGC and LCCP rules are simply going to offer their services illegally to players in the UK.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read more about IDnow’s financial risk check, the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/reimagining-affordability-financial-risk-check/">industry’s most comprehensive, holistic affordability check</a>.</p>



 Responsible gambling has been a recurring theme for many years and features quite heavily in the UK gambling white paper. What does responsible gambling mean to you, and where should the burden of responsibility lie with regards to providing a safe and responsible gambling experience: with the regulator, the operator, or both?&nbsp; 



<p>If we look at the history of responsible gambling, the burden to play responsibly has always been on the player.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The original approach was that if the player engages in problem gambling, it is because he decided to not use the tools as provided by the operator. The operator only had the responsibility to inform the players of the tools that were available to limit his activity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then the industry started to evolve toward safer gambling, meaning the operator accepted its responsibility to create a proactively safe environment, where they conduct behavioral analysis to identify the variations and deviations of player behavior in activity, and proactively interact with players. This led the UKGC to devise its three-pillar strategy of Identify, Act, and Evaluate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So there has been a shift from blaming players for problem gambling to accepting that not all players are necessarily aware of the amount of activity that they are engaging in, or the variations of activity they’ve displayed, and that the operator plays a very important part toward empowering player control through transparency, information sharing, interaction and action, alongside the actions of the player, of course.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, this shift really reflects this balancing of the two comfort zones: Who is my player? What is he capable of in terms of the games we are offering? It might be a very rich person that has an extremely high-risk appetite and high affordability, but does that mean he is impervious to harm? Not necessarily. You’ll have some players that have a very low level of affordability, but occasionally they’ll want that thrill. Should we prevent them from having that thrill just because they are not rich? Those are the questions around responsible gambling, affordability and the adequation between the comfort zones. And this is where KYC becomes the compass and blueprint for an operator’s business model: to understand their players, asses the appetite of their players, where you can create fair and transparent promotions that reflect the comfort zone between the operator and player.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 With most gambling and gaming now taking place online, how important will technology, and in particular KYC and onboarding platforms, be in ensuring a safe and secure gaming experience?&nbsp; 



<p>Operators and regulators need to move away from viewing KYC as a process, or “tick box” exercise, and instead focus on the original purpose of KYC as a founding principle of running a sustainable business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The problem, however, is that many operators are either not currently capable or are not effectively using the data they have access to build a single image of who the player is.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you ask any operator if they had a single view and a single understanding of who their customer is, very few have a reliable, accurate, single view across their whole estate. So having this information on an industry level is pointless until operators themselves can aggregate this information, which will enable them to switch from the mindset that KYC is a process, to KYC is a business driver.</p>

 In information released since the publication of both the government and UKGC’s plans, Gambling Commission CEO, Andrew Rhodes, has said that the UKGC’s plans set out changes to ensure the UK is the safest and fairest place to gamble in the world. How feasible do you think this will be in a country that received a record-breaking £44.6 million fine in 2022; a 76% increase on 2021? Why do you think UK operators consistently receive such hefty fines?&nbsp; 



<p>There may be a link between the first and second question. If the UK is handing out so many fines, it could indicate that the UK is not a place where licensed operators are operating in a safe and fair way and are therefore heavily penalized for that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Knowing many operators in the UK, however, I do not think this is the reason they receive such hefty fines, so there’s a question around what the fines say about the UK’s regulated landscape.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What I do know, and what we have seen recently, is many operators withdrawing from licensed activity in the UK, which will ultimately leave just the bigger operators offering services. Will it be fair in terms of pricing and the services that players will receive? I’m far from convinced.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second impact of the large and consistent fines is going to be operators applying for UK licenses with no intention of operating in the UK. Their market and customer base, whether in Asia, in Latin America, or Africa will be attracted by the prestige of the UK license. So, I think the UK gambling market will end up as an oligopoly, or filled with brands that have no intention of operating in the UK.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The illegal market will take great pleasure in catering to customers seeking a frictionless gaming experience, and I think this is extremely worrying.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The UKGC should have regular discussions with the gambling industry to ensure the UK remains an attractive place for operators and investors. If most small and midsize investors in gambling companies are fleeing the UK, this is extremely worrying.</p>



 From established gambling markets like the UK to the tiny Caribbean Island of Curaçao, regulatory authorities are balancing offering competitive and flexible approaches to licensing and taxation with a safe and secure environment that discourages fraud and illegal gambling. What effect do you think Curacao’s stricter requirements have on the online gambling industry, and what lessons can be learned?&nbsp; 



<p>If we look at the specific case of Curaçao and the redesign of their regulations and implementation of stricter requirements, this will lead to increased blame of players in problem gambling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of its news licensing structure, Curaçao will request operators to offer better complaints management, meaning they will be responsible for effectively handling complaints by offering more ways for the player to express their discontent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, under the guise of stricter requirements and stricter responsibility, Curaçao regulations are not actually going to empower the player much more by requiring stronger action from operators, but this is a way to grant more direct responsibility for the operators, which today they do not have, so this is certainly progress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the player will remain hostage to the goodwill of the operators. I think these stricter requirements have been put in place to adapt to a world where local regulators from each country are more aware of the capabilities of operators in providing a safe playing environment, and how to fulfil their role as offering better interactions with customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is something we see in the Netherlands, Sweden, and Ontario because they know that players need to be protected, and they know that players are best protected when the whole environment Is cooperating, when the regulator provides a reliable framework, and when the operator is interacting in a way that balances the comfort zone of the player with the comfort zone of the business. In this way, the player is protected via regulations, in terms of requirements of fairness, of marketing, transparency, help that they can receive and obligations from the operators.</p>

<p>Dear community,</p><p>After successfully implementing the Bokbunja Hard Fork in the Metadium testnet on September 26th, the Metadium Development Team spent weeks monitoring and confirming its stability and will move forward with its implementation in Metadium’s mainnet. The Bokbunja Hard Fork will be carried out by releasing version&nbsp;m0.10.0.</p> Details   Schedule: scheduled for October 31, 2023, 12:00 PM KST (2023–10–310 3:00:00&nbsp;+UTC)  Fixed mainnet block number for this transition: #73225410   Key commits <p>-The Bokbunja hard fork will be implemented at block #73225410 on the Metadium&nbsp;Mainnet.</p>  Introducing a fee delegation function and related RPC API allows users to delegate transaction fees to another&nbsp;account.  The verification nodes use the miner’s public key registered in the governance contract to verify the block miner’s signature.  To decentralize mining, the miner selection strategy has been changed to use etcd lockable&nbsp;tokens.  <p>-New features added to&nbsp;Gmet.</p>  Implementing Verifiable Random Function (VRF) verification functionalities through pre-compiled contracts offers a more secure and transparent method of generating random numbers on the blockchain.  Added ‘eth_getReceiptsByHash’ JSON-RPC API. Returns all the transaction receipts for the given block&nbsp;hash.  Added to Gmet CLI flags to allow changing the value of ‘triesInMemory’  Changed to create blocks by sorting transactions in descending order of gas&nbsp;price  Increased the default value of ‘TxLookupLimit’ flag from 2350000 to&nbsp;31536000  Ethereum Ploitari release(v1.10.17) was&nbsp;applied  Ethereum Sharblu release(v1.10.18) was&nbsp;applied  The Block interval is fixed to 2&nbsp;seconds.  Network members can make more types of decisions through improved governance contracts.  <p>-Other bugfix and&nbsp;upgrades</p>  Improved gmet.sh&nbsp;script  Improved performance using go&nbsp;routines  Upgraded etcd library version&nbsp;(v3.5.2)  Changed websocket default&nbsp;port  Changed the OS version used for ‘docker-build’ to Ubuntu&nbsp;20.04  Upgraded golangci-lint library version&nbsp;(v1.49)  Changed the ‘Fee’ data type of `ExecutionResult,` which receives EVM execution results, to BigInt to prevent overflow.  To avoid overflow integers, some variables have been changed to&nbsp;BigInt.  Fixed issue related to ‘make&nbsp;test’  Fixed issue with coinbase&nbsp;setup  <p>-The file ‘metadium-0.10.0-linux-rocksdb.tar.gz’ in the Gmet Github release note is optimized for Ubuntu 20.04&nbsp;version.</p><p>-IPC file is named ‘geth’ through m0.10.0 version upgrade.

  <p>Cloud computing delivers the benefits of accelerated development without the hardware costs. But the dynamic nature of cloud services and the proprietary security features offered by different cloud service providers make it challenging for customers to manage the risks and to be sure they are meeting security and compliance obligations. Most organizations need some&nbsp;form of guardrails and ways to respond to suspicious behavior.</p>
<p>Join cloud security experts from KuppingerCole Analysts and Uptycs as they discuss the challenges of the shared responsibility model for cloud security and compliance, examine the range of ways available for dealing with the problem, and consider the benefits of cloud security posture management (CSPM) and cloud-native application protection platform.</p>
<p>Mike Small, Senior Analyst at KuppingerCole will describe the major risks in the way organizations use cloud services. He will also explain why cloud services need dynamic rather than static controls, list the tools that aim to manage these risks, and outline what to expect from a CSPM solution.</p>
<p>Andre Rall, Director of Cloud Security at Uptycs will describe the benefits of integrating security insights, of standardizing controls and policies, of taking charge of third-party code and resources, and of removing silos by using a single platform, data model, and user interface.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/cloud-security-cspm"></a>

<p>Financial institutions want secure and frictionless onboarding and authentication processes and they’re finally seeing it from <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/09/the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-mobile-wallet-sdk/">decentralized identity</a> (DI) and verifiable credentials (VCs) technology.</p>



<p>While VCs have been a promise of identification and authentication technologies for decades, decentralization being the fabric through which VCs are established and communicated now makes the whole proposition more viable for FIs.</p>



<p>The decentralized nature of DI eliminates the need for a centralized authority to manage and control the identity certification process underlying current onboarding and authentication systems that are complex and costly for FIs, frustrating for consumers, and open to abuse.</p>



<p>In the DI ecosystem, issuing organizations conveniently and securely issue fraud-proof credentials, and verifying organizations can instantly check the authenticity and validity of those credentials to grant access to services. The customer accepts, stores, and selectively shares their credentials with unprecedented privacy, security and trust.</p>



<p>Early adopters in the financial services industry are using VCs as customer-controlled, open, standardized, portable, and cryptographically protected digital credentials to enable:</p>



 
 Continuous strong authentication of banking customers, whether they are accessing via web, telephone, or mobile 



 More streamlined banking functions, such as real-time loan approval because the applicant carries credentials such as KYC, credit history, employment history in their identity wallet. 
 



<p>The result is drastically reduced KYC and AML costs, vastly enhanced retail and corporate customer experience, and streamlined regulatory compliance.</p>



<p>Read <a>Verifiable </a><a>Credentials</a><a> – the Killer Feature of Decentralized Identity</a></p>



<p></p>



 7 more use cases for VCs in banking 



<p>In addition to an FI issuing its own customers with a VC to prove they’re a customer and speed up onboarding and authentication (which some FIs are already achieving in <a href="https://www.evernym.com/blog/decentralized-identity-for-banks/">seconds</a> with the technology), DI pioneer <a href="https://www.evernym.com/blog/decentralized-identity-for-banks/">Evernym</a> (now Avast) lists 7 other potential use cases:</p>



 
 Enable the customer to use their credential across internal silos of the institution to reduce data lakes and allow them to provide the single view of their information. 



 Maintain a persistent, secure, and unique connection with each customer for all types of sensitive data communications (e.g. sending loan documents). 



 Leverage the credential exchange protocol to prove minimal customer data collection and maintain a verified data trail for regulatory compliance. 



 Leverage the interoperability of VCs to make the FI’s credential useful for consumers anywhere in the world (the “top of wallet” competitive advantage). 



 Leverage the open standards of DI to issue customers with an identity wallet for storing and managing their VCs, or build a wallet into an existing banking app. 



 Support customers’ need to back up and recover their VCs in a “digital safety deposit box” concept. 



 Act as “<a href="https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/Sovrin-Glossary-V2.pdf">guardian</a>” of a customer’s credentials in a similar manner to guarding paper documents or effects in real life. 
 



 <br>Build your VCs solution quickly with Sudo Platform 



<p>Anonyome Labs’ <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a> offers the key building blocks for a VCs solution with four licensable products and more in development:</p>



 
 White Label Mobile DI Wallet: A standalone mobile application for iOS and Android, a user can use the mobile DI wallet for DI interactions and storage: creating and storing cryptographic keys, and creating connections for receiving, holding and presenting verifiable credentials. It interacts with verifiable credential issuers and verifiers. 



 Mobile DI Wallet SDK: For customers that want to add the DI wallet functionality to their own mobile application, this native mobile SDK provides the capability for storage, creating cryptographic keys, and establishing connections and for receiving, holding and presenting VCs. 



 Verifiable Credentials Service/SDK: This service provides the ability to establish connections with DI wallets and to issue VCs. It also provides the ability to request and verify presentation proofs from DI wallets. 



 Relay Service/SDK: This service introduces an always-on capability for a mobile DI Wallet. Implemented as a cloud service, the Relay Service provides mediator capability for incoming/outgoing verifiable credential and other messages, so that sending and receiving is not limited to when the client implementations of the mobile DI wallet and SDK are online. 
 



<p><br>As an API-first developer platform, <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;includes everything necessary to quickly bring new products to market or augment existing products with value-add privacy and identity protection capabilities. It includes:</p>



 
 Developer-focused documentation 



 APIs 



 SDK source code via GitHub 



 Sample applications for test-to-deploy of various capabilities 



 Brandable white-label apps for quick go-to-market deployments. 
 



<p>You can see in these images how a credit union has used the Sudo Platform sample app and SDK to build a VCs solution within its banking app:</p>



In 4 steps, go from installation of your mobile application to having an encrypted connection with your potential new member. With this channel established you can commence your KYC process.



<p></p>



With an authenticated end-to-end connection established members can complete their KYC proofing with a verified credential issued at completion that can be used for future proofing exercises needs either in branch or online.



<p><br><br>In this example, a customer wants a car loan and the car dealership verifies their account quickly and securely, avoiding additional applications and legacy forms:</p>







<p>In addition to DI solutions, <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;has modular, turnkey solutions for:</p>



 
 Safe and private browsing

<p>Identity Governance is a beacon for organizations aiming to maintain regulatory compliance, safeguard operations and boost efficiency. Let’s demystify this term: Identity Governance, tailored for organizations, refers to the systematic management of digital identities, ensuring that users have the correct access rights to resources. The impact on business security and operations is profound, offering protection against potential breaches and enhancing operational workflows.</p>
 Why Do Organizations Need Identity Governance Today? 
<p>With expanding business ventures, collaborations, and a diversified workforce, organizations are navigating an increasingly complex digital ecosystem. This complexity demands a structured approach to managing sensitive data and systems that control user access.</p>
<p>Regulatory bodies worldwide emphasize the importance of data protection, with compliance standards like <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) </a>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarbanes%E2%80%93Oxley_Act">SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act)</a> making it mandatory for businesses to protect user data. Being compliant not only safeguards user credentials and shields companies from potential penalties but also elevates their reputation.</p>
<p>Cost efficiency and operational excellence are tightly knit with effective identity governance. Organizations that master this see reduced IT costs, witness streamlined operations and operating costs, and save time and resources.</p>
 Why is Regulatory Compliance Important? 
<p>Regulatory compliance ensures companies adhere to relevant laws, policies, and regulations often designed to protect consumer rights and sensitive data. It’s not just about avoiding penalties or legal consequences; it’s also about establishing trust with your customers.</p>
<p>When an organization is compliant, it demonstrates a commitment to maintaining a high standard of operations and building confidence among stakeholders and customers. Moreover, compliance often brings about best practices that can benefit the company in the long run, from enhancing data security to ensuring organizational integrity.</p>
 Key Components of Identity Governance Suited for Organizations 
<p>While “Identity Governance” might seem vast and intricate, its effectiveness refers to core components tailored for organizations. These components serve as the pillars that uphold a robust identity governance structure.</p>
 
 Identity Lifecycle Management: Tailored to businesses’ hierarchical and functional structures, it ensures that user accounts, access, and privileges are aligned with their roles and updated as these roles change. 
 Role-based Access Control (RBAC): Rooted deeply in the essence of an organization, RBAC ensures that access to digital resources aligns with job roles. It simplifies the process of privileged access by categorizing authorized users based on their responsibilities. 
 Access Review: Regular business audits by security teams should focus on digital identities and access controls. Periodic access reviews ensure that only the necessary personnel have access to particular resources, minimizing potential security risks. 
 Policy and Risk Management: Organizations are no strangers to risks. However, with a structured approach and risk management, potential threats are identified, evaluated, and mitigated before they escalate. 
 
<p>Understanding the integral components of Identity Governance makes it equally vital to discern its advantages. When implemented correctly, these components fuse to deliver profound benefits for any organization.</p>
 How Is IGA Different from IAM? 
<p>Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) and Identity and Access Management (IAM) are terms often used interchangeably, but crucial differences exist. While IAM focuses on ensuring that the right individuals have access to the appropriate resources at the correct times and for the right reasons, IGA goes further.</p>
<p>IGA deals with the provisioning, managing access, and de-provisioning of identities. It provides a structured framework for policies and processes related to user identity lifecycle management and management, ensuring compliance with business objectives and regulations. In essence, IAM is a subset of IGA, with IGA providing the overarching governance framework.</p>
 Direct Benefits to Organizations Implementing Identity Governance 
<p>As the famous saying in the business world: “What gets measured gets managed.” And when you measure the tangible benefits reaped from implementing identity governance, the picture becomes abundantly clear. Organizations not only safeguard themselves but also position themselves strategically for growth. Implementing Identity Governance isn’t just about ticking off a checklist; it’s about accruing tangible benefits:</p>
 
 Regulatory Compliance: Adhering to standards like GDPR becomes a smoother journey with structured identity governance, which is especially crucial for organizations operating in regions like the EU. 
 Enhanced Data Security: The numbers don’t lie. Organizations that invest in identity governance are less likely to face data breaches, ensuring that sensitive information remains confidential. 
 Streamlined Onboarding and Offboarding: Gone are the days when IT teams spent hours setting up profiles for new hires or removing access for those who’ve left. Identity governance can cut down these times significantly. 
 Facilitated Audits: Compliance checks and internal audits become less hassle, thanks to clear documentation and structured access protocols. 
 
<p>While the merits of Identity Governance are undeniable, the path to its flawless execution can be paved with challenges. However, with a systematic approach, organizations can traverse this path seamlessly. Let’s delve into a systematic step-by-step guide for instituting a successful identity governance model.</p>
 Step-by-Step Implementation Guide for Organizations 
<p>Embarking on implementing Identity Governance in an organization’s security posture is akin to building a fortress brick by brick. Each step is crucial, and each phase must be tackled with precision. While the goal is a secure and efficient operational environment, the route necessitates meticulous planning.</p>
 
 Assessing Organizational Needs and Existing Infrastructure: Begin with an internal review. Identify gaps in the current system and ascertain the necessary tools and resources. 
 Setting Up a Cross-Departmental Implementation Team: Identity governance isn’t just an IT issue. Engage representatives from HR, operations, and other relevant departments. 
 Defining Access Roles in Alignment with Job Descriptions: Collaborate with HR to ensure that digital access mirrors job roles, ensuring every employee has the necessary tools and nothing more. 
 Integrating Identity Governance with Existing IT Infrastructure: Seamless integration is key. Ensure that the identity governance solutions align well with current systems, offering smooth transitions and operations. 
 Monitoring and Iterative Improvement: The job still needs to be completed post-implementation. Regularly review and refine the processes to adapt to organizational growth and change. 
 
<p>Every endeavor, no matter how meticulously planned, is full of hurdles. Identity Governance, with all its nuances, comes with its potential challenges. Recognizing these early and being equipped with solutions can make the journey smoother and more rewarding.</p>
 Best Practices Tailored for Organizations 
 
 Engaging Leadership and Stakeholders Early: A top-down approach to implementing identity governance and administration ensures that the importance of identity administration and governance is recognized at all levels. 
 Regular Training and Awareness Sessions for Employees: A system is only as strong as its weakest link. Equip employees with the knowledge to use and appreciate the identity governance structures. 
 Periodic Review of Access Roles and Permissions: Revisit and revise. As organizations evolve, so do roles and requirements. 
 Establishing a Feedback Loop for Continuous Improvement: Encourage feedback. It highlights potential gaps and fosters a culture of collective responsibility. 
 
 Common Misconceptions about Identity Governance 
<p>As we delve deeper into the digital realm, Identity Governance has emerged as a cornerstone for ensuring security and efficiency within organizations. Yet, like many emerging disciplines, it’s shrouded in a mix of misunderstandings and half-truths. It’s essential to address these misconceptions to harness their potential truly.</p>
 
 Access Requests are Fundamental to Identity Verification: Contrary to the belief that access requests are mere formalities, they are pivotal in ensuring that only verified identities gain access to specific resources, thereby safeguarding against unauthorized access and potential breaches. 
 Identity Authentication Surpasses Password Management: While password management is vital, the emphasis should be on advanced identity authentication mechanisms that ensure secure and appropriate access, such as multi-factor authentication and biometric verification, which provide a more robust security posture. 
 All Access Control is Equal: It’s essential to understand that various access control mechanisms, such as role-based access control, access certifications, and access lifecycle management, serve distinct purposes and are crucial in managing different aspects of identity authentication and authorization. 
 Entitlement Management is Just ‘Jargon’: Far from being mere jargon, entitlement management is crucial in defining and controlling the rights and privileges of authenticated identities, ensuring that users have the appropriate access levels in accordance with their roles and responsibilities. 
 IGA Solutions are a ‘One Size Fits All’: It is a misconception that all identity governance and administration (IGA) solutions are universally applicable. Selecting and customizing IGA solutions that align with an organization’s specific needs and identity authentication requirements is imperative for effective identity management. 
 Managing User Accounts is an IT-only Responsibility: Managing user accounts and identities should not be siloed within IT departments. Effective identity governance and authentication management require collaborative efforts across various departments, ensuring that identity verifications, access controls, and user privileges are consistently aligned with organizational roles and policies. 
 
<p>Having highlighted the overarching significance of Identity Governance, it’s time to address some widespread myths. Believing these misconceptions could set organizations off course. By clearing the fog around them, we can ensure a more informed and practical approach to managing digital identities.</p>
 Potential Challenges for Organizations and Solutions 
<p>Every transformative initiative confronts its fair share of roadblocks, and Identity Governance is no exception. However, being forewarned is forearmed. By anticipating potential setbacks, organizations can develop strategies to overcome them, ensuring a smoother path to successful implementation.</p>
 
 Navigating the Complexity of Role Definitions: While initially challenging, collaborating with department heads on-premises can simplify role management and definitions. 
 Ensuring User Compliance Without Sacrificing Efficiency: Invest in user-friendly access management solutions to verify user and access privileges and provide ample training to ensure employees are comfortable with the new systems. 
 Adapting to Evolving Regulations: Stay informed. Review global compliance requirements and standards regularly and adjust policies and manual processes accordingly. 
 Addressing Resistance and Ensuring Organizational Buy-In: Highlight the benefits and provide channels for addressing concerns.<br>
Successfully implementing and navigating the challenges of Identity Governance is still ongoing. The digital sphere is continuously evolving, and to stay ahead of the curve, organizations need to remain informed and adapt accordingly. Let’s explore how to stay updated in this ever-changing world of Identity Governance. 
 
 Is Identity Governance Necessary Regardless of Regulatory Compliance Obligations? 
<p>While every company is subject to some form of regulatory compliance, the level of scrutiny and the specific standards applicable can vary significantly depending on the industry, region, and other factors. Regardless of the perceived level of regulatory obligation, the inherent risks within the digital landscape and the advantages of streamlined operations underscore the importance of identity governance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adopting a robust identity governance framework serves to proactively mitigate internal and external threats, simplify IT operations, enhance audit readiness, and ensure that employees have precise access to the resources necessary for their roles, thereby reducing the potential for human error. As companies evolve and expand, having a structured identity governance framework in place facilitates smoother transitions and integrations, maintaining a strong security posture in an ever-changing regulatory environment.&nbsp;</p>
 How to Stay Updated: The Evolving World of Identity Governance 
<p>The pace of technological advancement today is unparalleled. A static approach to Identity Governance can leave organizations vulnerable in such a dynamic environment. Staying updated is not just about keeping threats at bay but also about harnessing new opportunities and innovations.</p>
 
 Staying Abreast of Regulatory Changes: Subscribe to updates from regulatory bodies and consider periodic consultations with legal teams. 
 Leveraging Industry Forums and Communities: Discuss, attend seminars, and participate in webinars. 
 Continuous Training and Skill Upgradation for Teams: Consider annual or biannual training sessions to ensure the identity security team remains at the forefront of identity governance best practices. 
 
<p>With the strategies to remain updated and proactive, organizations can truly reap the lasting benefits of Identity Governance. As we conclude our exploration, it’s evident that Identity Governance is not just a fleeting trend but a foundational pillar for an organization.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Earlier this month, HYPR announced our unified Identity Assurance solution, developed to secure the entire modern identity lifecycle. HYPR Identity Assurance brings together the strongest passwordless authentication, comprehensive risk assessment and enhanced identity verification to continuously detect, prevent, and eliminate identity-related risks. That’s a lot of words to describe a simple concept — organizations can now ensure that an individual is who they claim to be at all times.</p> 
 Identity Assurance In the Spotlight  
<p>What does this mean in practice? We had the opportunity to demonstrate at this week’s FIDO Authenticate conference. As one of the pioneers of FIDO authentication and a long time Alliance board member, the annual Authenticate conference was a natural venue to publicly show the power of Identity Assurance.</p> 
 Modern Passkey-Based Authentication  
<p>Given the setting, most folks there were well-acquainted with our leading FIDO <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-authenticate-passwordless-mfa">passwordless multi-factor authentication</a> solution HYPR Authenticate, the backbone of our Identity Assurance platform. Industry experts, security pundits and regulatory agencies all agree that phishing-resistant authentication is no longer optional and must underlie any comprehensive identity security strategy. HYPR Authenticate provides regulatory compliant, <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/enterprise-passkeys">device-bound passkeys</a> and also works with synced passkeys.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The HYPR Identity Assurance Platform</p> 
 Real-time Risk Assessment and Adaptive Authentication  
<p>Newer on the block, <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-adapt">HYPR Adapt</a> analyzes risk signals and telemetry from numerous sources, including user behavior, mobile, endpoint and browser signals, as well as changes in the overall threat landscape, and automatically takes action to prevent a breach. This includes enforcing step-up authentication or re-verification, as well as sharing risk data with SIEM, SOAR and other enterprise systems for additional protective actions.</p> 
 The Big Reveal: Enhanced Identity Verification  
<p>The undoubted star of the show, however, was our revolutionary new identity verification system, HYPR Affirm. Purpose-built to meet the unique needs of workforce employee identity verification, HYPR Affirm addresses the major identity security issues, such as help desk fraud, that have dominated <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/lessons-from-the-mgm-attack">recent cybersecurity headlines</a>. HYPR Affirm leverages AI-powered chat, video, face recognition, liveness detection and other cutting-edge technologies to create a seamless and secure method of confirming employee identities without ever using a password. It goes beyond traditional point-in-time verification by utilizing AI-driven analysis to proactively and automatically prompt reverification at critical moments defined by high-impact events or times of elevated risk from new threat vectors or detection of suspicious behavior.</p> 
 More Than the Sum of Its Parts  
<p>While each HYPR solution provides critical capabilities to build a robust identity security strategy, the real magic lies in how they work together. The integrated Identity Assurance platform closes persistent identity security gaps and automates previously manual processes. It does away with disconnected, point-in-time approaches and provides dynamic and continuous identity and authentication security. It’s the industry’s only offering where risky behavior can trigger step-up authentication not only to authentication but also to enforcing automatic identity reverification.</p> 
 Why Identity Assurance, Why Now?  
<p>In this era of everywhere, always-on connectivity and generative-AI attacks, identity trust is an imperative. Yet organizations often rely on a patchwork of siloed identity systems, outdated authentication methods, manual and disjointed identity verification techniques and incomplete, reactive identity risk response.</p> 
<p>The fallout from these fragmented and insecure practices is all too evident. Deepfake imposters are driving a new style of fraud and identity-based cyber attacks are paralyzing businesses for weeks if not longer. Recent <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/report-state-of-passwordless">HYPR research</a> shows that authentication-attributed breaches alone cost organizations an average of $2.95M per year. The issue goes beyond breaches however, affecting employee and customer satisfaction, productivity and a business’s ability to scale and evolve.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>HYPR Identity Assurance takes a proactive approach that addresses all stages of the user journey or identity lifecycle, starting at day zero. It unites disparate identity and security systems, integrating with and scaling across them. With HYPR, organizations ensure identities can be trusted at all times, while eliminating friction points and improving user experience.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>HYPR Identity Assurance delivers the lowest friction user experience with strongest authentication, automated identity verification and behavior-based risk assessment</p> 
 A New Look to Match Our Expanded Purpose  
<p>Those of you that pay attention to such things may have noticed that HYPR unveiled a new logo along with our Identity Assurance solution. HYPR has moved from “The Passwordless Company” to “The Identity Assurance Company” and we wanted our brand to reflect this strategic shift. We feel our new bold yet approachable logo embodies strength, trust and confidence with a modern sensibility. As such, it aptly represents our comprehensive, unified and dynamic approach to identity security.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here’s a few thoughts I recorded earlier on our expanded Identity Assurance mission:</p>

<p>It appears that Australia has killed off “digital identity”. Australia’s <a href="https://www.digitalidentity.gov.au/have-your-say/2023-digital-id-bill-and-rules-submissions">proposed Digital ID legislation</a> is actually not about digital identity — it’s about proving you have been identified.</p>
<p>What’s the big deal? <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/the-goal-is-identification-not-an-identity/">Identity and identification are different things</a>. Identification is about establishing enough facts about someone in a specific context that you can deal with them; identity is bigger, more amorphous, and <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/on-sovereignty/">usually more personal</a>.</p>
<p>So I am delighted that the term “digital identity” is no longer used in the draft <a href="https://www.digitalidentity.gov.au/sites/default/files/2023-09/Exposure%20draft%20of%20the%20Digital%20ID%20Bill%202023_0.pdf">Digital ID Bill 2023</a> (PDF) or explanatory materials. This is a significant shift in framing, and it will <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/lets-forget-about-identity/">simplify what has been a very tricky problem space</a>.</p>
<p>We can reform identification without disrupting identity. We can make identification <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/what-if-we-could-make-data-useless-to-thieves/">resilient against fraud</a> in the wake of data breaches, without introducing any novel new “digital identity”. The concept of digital ID is closer to mundane functional identifiers and does not affect the cherished sense of personal identity we have in the analog world.</p>
<p>The Digital ID Bill heralds a uniform approach in Australia to digital and data governance across open banking, open data, and digital ID.</p>
<p>We are seeing a transition from plaintext identification to device-assisted identification. Instead of presenting weak plaintext copies of ID numbers or whole ID documents, the proposed Australian Government Digital ID System (AGDIS) will enable individuals to use digital ID as a proxy for their existing verified analog IDs.</p>
<p>The previous government’s legislation was going to be called “Trusted Digital Identity”. The new draft bill drops that flowery wording. But we wonder where this leaves the existing <a href="https://www.digitalidentity.gov.au/tdif">Trusted Digital Identity Framework</a> (TDIF)?</p>
<p>TDIF was based on a centralised identity exchange architecture. This is fine for the government single sign-on systems, myGov and myGovID, but this architecture is <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/collected-submissions-on-au-digital-identity-system/">a poor fit for decentralised verifiable credentials</a>.</p>
<p>Now the AGDIS anticipates a raft of Digital ID Data Standards to be developed, providing an opportunity to rethink the centralised exchange. The new Digital ID Regulator can also reconsider the state of the art in authentication and authorisation technologies.</p>
<p>We look forward to the Australian digital ID system making good use of verifiable credentials, phishing resistant mobile technology, and data signing.</p>

  <p>Hello friends,  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have received feedback from you—our customers—about the need to have user level language localization. We understand that users would like to receive notifications that have their text adapted to their local language, customs, and standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have added logic to check multiple places for language information to make the best possible choice for what language we should send an email in, and these changes are now generally available for Privileged Identity Management, Access Reviews and Entitlement Management. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new approach is:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Diagram showing how the logic works</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 
 The system checks the Entra user settings:&nbsp;
 
 An Entra ID user updates their language settings via myprofile.microsoft.com or via myaccount.microsoft.com. If they don't have the permissions to update, an admin updates their preferred language.&nbsp; 
 The system will then check if the Entra ID user object has a preferred language set to determine the locale to be used.&nbsp; 
 
 
 If there are no user settings, we will check whether the user has a mailbox and has a set preferred language on that mailbox. If both checks are true, the system uses the preferred language set in their mailbox settings. This will only work for users with a mailbox.&nbsp; 
 If none of the above are set, the system will fall back to the tenant's preferred language concatenated with the tenant's country letter code (fr-FR or en-US).&nbsp;
 
 If a tenant has a preferred language set and no country code, the system will use the tenant's preferred language to find the closest available locale to the one passed, from the localized templates. if fr-CA is missing, the fallback locale is fr-FR. &nbsp; 
 
 
 If they don’t have all the above, the system will default to en-us.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Figure 3: Screenshot of email in Spanish



<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, when a new guest requests an access package in MyAccess, their preferred language will be stamped based on the MyAccess browser language at request time. This will enable new guests to receive email communication in a language they understand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this is currently only available for the features mentioned above, we will be announcing more features are enrolling to have this logic in the upcoming quarter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Door brondata in te zetten realiseerden de adviseurs een tijdsbesparing van 30% tijdens de oriëntatiefase."&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Bij hypotheekadvies worden vaak veel privé documenten gebruikt van een klant. Voor De Hypotheker is het van essentieel belang dat de data van klanten goed beveiligd is, én dat de klantdata actueel is. Het originele proces bevat vaak veel papierwerk. </p> 
<p>Om marktleider te blijven en hun klanten goed te kunnen bedienen wilde ze hun proces optimaliseren: de service verbeteren, versnellen en digitaliseren. Vanuit Ockto mochten we De Hypotheker assisteren in deze digitale transformatie. Pieter Dijckmeester (Manager Proposities) en Erik Coehorst &amp; Niki de Boer (beiden Propositiemanager Digital Customer Journey) vertellen over de uitdagingen die ze hadden, waarom ze voor Ockto kozen én wat de samenwerking ze tot nu toe heeft opgeleverd. &nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>I can imagine that some of the readers might look at the title and wonder: what do these three terms even have in common? Well, I must confess that the last one I’ve made up (or should I say “invented”?) recently – and I will explain it later. But the former two are, in fact, connected in more than one way.</p>
<p>Although Generative AI has been with us for quite some time in various forms (remember deepfakes, for example?), Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), the new-generation large language models, have literally taken the world by storm. After people saw what ChatGPT can do, they immediately decided they wanted these capabilities in every application, for every industry, and on every occasion. Unfortunately, after a period of initial uncontrolled hype, it became clear that most organizations simply cannot afford to let their employees post sensitive information, like intellectual property, financial records, or customer data into every online chatbot – you don’t need to be a compliance expert to understand the consequences.</p>
<p>So, while governments are working on future legislation to regulate AI usage in general, organizations are scrambling to define security and compliance policies to prevent uncontrolled leakage of their business data into generative AI systems. But how to reconcile the two completely opposite trends and make GenAI usage safe and controlled? Well, there are multiple potential approaches…</p>
<p>The most obvious one is “building your own ChatGPT” – creating, training, and operating a new isolated instance of a large language model (LLM) with all its training and operational data strongly protected. However, only large enterprises with enough skills and budgets can afford such an endeavor. Also, training a general-purpose AI model requires years of hard work and enormous amounts of data from a multitude of sources. Some of those sources, having experienced ChatGPT’s effect on their future job security, are no longer interested in collaborating with AI researchers…</p>
<p>An alternative, more savvy approach is fine-tuning an existing AI model – instead of starting from scratch, you only need to adapt a pre-trained model to a specific domain with your own, much smaller set of data. This is a much more resource-efficient way to get your own LLM, but it still requires a lot of work and skills and is much less flexible in terms of supported use cases. Of course, an even more efficient approach is to use a much leaner specialized model instead of a general-purpose one: for example, a model only trained to perform a specific subset of generative tasks.</p>
<p>What does it all have to do with databases though, and why is everyone suddenly talking about vectors? Well, it turns out that there is an innovative technique for adapting existing LLMs to your specific tasks or even your private, highly sensitive information called Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Instead of teaching (sorry, fine-tuning) a model with your custom data and essentially forcing it to memorize it entirely, you just augment each request with a set of additional information that can help its reasoning. It could be a set of documents containing fresh information about recent events or simply some organization’s sensitive data.</p>
<p>RAG not only provides responses much better tailored to the user’s prompts and thus dramatically improves the efficiency of the conversation, but also ensures that the augmenting content remains private and is not shared with other parties. And here comes the twist: to implement RAG you need to be able to quickly produce a set of documents relevant for a certain prompt and to accomplish that, you need a vector database!</p>
<p>Vectors themselves are simply sequences of numbers. While we’re more used to two- or three-dimensional vectors that encode points in space, vectors used for AI applications are usually much longer – with hundreds or thousands of dimensions. Various machine learning algorithms use vectors to store mathematical representations of their inputs. Documents, images, audio files, or any other things processed by an AI model can be stored as vectors called embeddings and by calculating a distance between vectors it is possible to determine similarity between their original objects.</p>
<p>If your model is working with text documents, for example, its embeddings can be used to find the most semantically similar documents just by sorting them by distance. And this is precisely what we need to quickly determine which relevant documents to feed to an LLM when we are crafting a RAG request! And thus, vector databases – solutions that can store data in vector format and perform efficient indexing and searching on it – became a critical part of every AI strategy almost overnight…</p>
<p>Recently I attended <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloudworld/">Oracle CloudWorld</a>, the company’s flagship yearly event where it makes its most important announcements and presents the latest innovations in its products. Do I need to tell you what was the hottest topic this year? From Larry Ellison proclaiming Generative AI the most important technology ever to announcing a strategic partnership with Cohere, an enterprise AI platform vendor, to promising to integrate AI assistants into every business application – “GenAI” dominated the entire event.</p>
<p>More importantly, however, were the announcements that not just Oracle Database but MySQL Heatwave are getting native support for vectors. Of course, it is possible to use a separate specialized database for performing vector operations, but keeping all kinds of data in the same database enables not just faster performance with fewer transformations needed but ensures that sensitive data never leaves your secure perimeter.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/ocw-integrated-vector-database-augments-generative-ai-2023-09-19/">AI Vector Search</a>, it is now possible to combine multiple data models including vectors in a single SQL query without any additional effort for developers. MySQL Heatwave’s <a href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/ocw-mysql-heatwave-vector-store-generative-ai-2023-09-20/">Vector Store</a> goes even further by providing a complete Generative AI and machine learning stack with embeddings created, stored, and processed directly within the database.&nbsp; On top of this foundation, Oracle provides high-level developer features like generating SQL statements or even entire applications with the APEX platform using natural language prompts. But more importantly for our topic at hand, you can now have an entire stack for implementing RAG-powered business applications, while ensuring that your sensitive data is always protected with multiple layers of database security controls.</p>
<p>OK, and finally, we can talk a bit about AI agility. Again, I just basically made this term up to illustrate the problem developers of AI-powered applications are already facing, even if not many realize it yet. You might be familiar with the notion of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023/blog/quantum-computing-horizons-in-cybersecurity">cryptographic agility</a>, which concerns an organization’s ability to quickly replace outdated cryptographic primitives throughout its entire IT infrastructure, should a particular encryption or hashing method be deemed not strong enough, for example, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023/blog/quantum-computing-horizons-in-cybersecurity">against quantum algorithms</a>. This should be possible without significant downtime, application refactoring, or other business continuity issues.</p>
<p>Working with AI models and with vector data poses the same challenge. Embeddings produced by a certain ML model are completely proprietary and not compatible with any other model. When an organization wants, say, to upgrade its e-commerce recommendation engine with a more modern and sophisticated model that can produce better recommendations, it has to consider the effort of updating this vector data for its entire catalog, potentially across multiple data stores, cloud services, and third-party integrations. Exchanging data with suppliers will be challenging as well, since they can be using other even more incompatible embedding solutions.</p>
<p>Is there a simple way to address this problem? Perhaps by implementing industry-specific standards? Or by introducing additional layers of abstraction into data and application architectures? To be honest, I have no idea! But perhaps other experts have, and you have an opportunity to meet them at our upcoming <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023">cyberevolution conference</a>, which takes place in less than a month in Frankfurt, Germany.</p>

  <p>On October 3, we published a blog entitled <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/harness-power-your-identity-data">Harness the Power of Your Identity Data</a>. In that post, we outlined the role that identity and access management (IAM) plays in delivering the kind of digital experiences that are key to meeting customer acquisition, engagement, and retention targets.</p>

<p>We also covered the challenge of creating the right experience with the right security to various identities with differing needs — business partners, suppliers, employees, contractors, devices, and diverse populations of customers — often engaging with separate brands or lines of business under the same corporate umbrella. And we introduced the secret to providing tailored experiences to these identities by tapping into your identity data.</p>

<p>In this post, we'll outline two specific steps you can take to reach your business goals using your identity data. There is a third step, which we will detail in the next post in this series.</p>

 Step 1: Connect and centrally manage your identity data sources 

<p>So much of the identity data needed to fuel your business growth already exists. It's out there, and you might even know where to find most of it. But the trick is to be able to pull together just the right pieces from a variety of what we call authoritative sources, at just the right time. That's why the first step to harnessing the power of your identity data is to connect to your data sources in a way that gives you a single view of all identity data. In the ForgeRock Identity Cloud, we call this Lifecycle Management, or LCM.</p>

<p>LCM gives you the power to connect to all different kinds of siloed data. This data usually resides in identity directory servers and an array of databases associated with specific applications throughout your organization. Once connected, you can create a composite, single view of your customers and all of your other managed identities. This single view can give you new insights into the same customers with different account names across brands or lines of business — and give you a new level of situational awareness that can provide critical inputs to enhance security.</p>

<p>In addition to connecting to all of your data sources, LCM empowers you to centrally manage all of your identities, which gives you the ability to pull identity data in from multiple sources and combine the data in any way you need. Then, you can provision and manage the ongoing lifecycle of your identity information with the source systems and any other downstream systems or applications.</p>

 Step 2: Enable a business-centric model 

<p>Now that you're centrally managing all of your identity data, you can start to mold it into the shape of your business. This is where things get really exciting, because you can organize your identity data around your business use cases, not the other way around.</p>

<p>With ForgeRock's relationship model, you can design how your identities are organized. Instead of trying to force-fit disparate identity data into a single, rigid hierarchy, you can now create different identity objects that are purpose-built for each identity type.</p>

<p>Think of the different types of identity attributes you'd need to manage for your employees vs. your customers vs. a set of IoT devices.</p>

<p>Like tabs in a spreadsheet, or tables in a database, you can arrange your identities in a way that makes sense for you. Let's continue with the spreadsheet analogy for a moment. Why do you create different tabs? Why not just put everything into a single sheet? Probably because it makes more sense to manage some related data in the columns of Tab A, and others in Tabs B, C, and so on. Think of each new tab as a way to distinctly manage different identity types more efficiently. And there's just one more piece of this spreadsheet analogy to bring this point home: the pivot table! But first, let's set the context by looking at an access management scenario.</p>

<p>Let's say you're a large retail enterprise with multiple brands, and at least one brand is from a recent acquisition. As the user begins the login process, your access manager makes a request to your identity manager. Based on the context, your identity manager looks at the relationships between the user and the associated brand, and returns a set of data parameters that empower you to give that user a tailored experience in accordance with the guidelines of that specific brand. Wow. That was great. But what made it possible lies in our pivot table analogy, so let's get back to it.</p>

<p>Why do you create a pivot table in a spreadsheet? Because you need a view that combines data from different tabs to serve a specific purpose. This is what happened with our brand login experience. The access manager made a request to the identity manager. And the identity manager was able to use the relationship between the user's main identity "tab" and the related brand "tab" to return the data points that the access management system needed to orchestrate a specific brand experience for that user.</p>

<p>Here's another example: maybe one of your business partners or suppliers has access to one of your systems. You require that partners use MFA as part of the authentication, but your partners cannot require their employees to use a personal mobile device as an MFA second factor, therefore they have opted to receive one-time passcodes in their email as the second factor. When your partner's user initiates a login to your system, your identity manager follows the relationship from that user's identity record to their affiliated organization (a different tab in the spreadsheet) and provides that data to the access manager, which selects a login journey that sends and validated a one-time passcode after the password has been correctly entered.</p>

<p>These are just two examples of may. Once you've enabled your business-centric identity model, you can ensure each customer of each brand, or each partner, or contractor, and so on, gets the tailored experience and security required.</p>

				  Before purchasing a decentralized identity solution you will need to decide if you want to buy a platform or component-based system. But what is the difference, what are the benefits of each approach, and what will provide the best way forward for your organization?&nbsp;  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the descriptions alone, you may have an inkling of what sets these two ways of purchasing solutions apart. But to make sure we’re all on the same page, here’s what we mean when we describe a system as a platform or component-based:</p>
<p>A platform solution is wholly created, packaged, and hosted by someone else. They have decided which features are important and are offering you a full solution.</p>
<p>A component-based solution can be put together either by you or a third party and is made up of several different pieces, potentially from several different sources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to decentralized identity solutions, both of these approaches have benefits and drawbacks depending on your goal.</p>
<p>Platform solutions</p>
<p>The biggest benefit of a platform-based approach is that the software is ready to go: It requires little or no work on your team’s part in order to get started. A good example is email. Most organizations do not have to build their own messaging systems because email exists and is already widespread and interoperable. Other benefits of a platform include letting someone else host the data and run the software, thereby reducing the amount you need to be responsible for.</p>
<p>The main drawback of platform solutions is lack of control and flexibility. Going back to the email example, if there is a feature you would like to add, your team is unlikely to be able to edit the features available through Gmail. Another thing to keep in mind is that as someone else is running the software, you may have recurring payments to keep the software running. Also something to consider is that the data you collect will be stored by the platform. If you are an organization with security concerns — such as a government — this option may not be for you.</p>
<p>TLDR; platform solutions offer a more plug and play and less customizable experience that is maintained and owned by a third party. They can be an excellent option for smaller organizations that don’t want to create and maintain their own solutions.</p>
<p>Component-based solutions</p>
<p>The biggest benefit of a component-based solution is flexibility. These solutions let you build exactly what you need, and also allow you to switch out pieces as your needs change or newer features become available. A good example is a car. You fully own your car, you can customize it to your wants and needs, and if something stops working you are responsible for repairing it. In addition to fully owning a component-based solution, you also operate the software yourself, and control where your data goes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main drawback to component-based systems is that it requires expertise and time to implement, all of which increases with each additional feature. Going back to our car analogy, there is a reason that many people opt to go to mechanics rather than fix their cars themselves — they want the mechanic’s years of experience. Other things to keep in mind with this kind of system is that you will need to host it somewhere and maintain it, which can require more computers or cloud server cost and more internal team skill.</p>
<p>TLDR; component-based solutions offer a highly customizable system that may take some time to put together, but is owned and operated by your organization. This is an excellent option for larger organizations that have specific features they need or regulations to follow when it comes to their data.</p>
<p>Indicio’s approach</p>
<p>Indicio offers component-based solutions to our customers. We believe that this is the best way to build decentralized ecosystems because it provides flexibility. As the technology advances, the ability to rapidly adopt newer components and features can be critical to success. — You do not want to be left waiting for your platform to integrate these features into its software.</p>
<p>Our number one goal at Indicio is customer success. Which means that while we sell components, we rarely ever end the interaction there. Our engineers have extensive experience in developing and implementing solutions and can help your team put the components you want&nbsp; together in the way that you need — should you need that kind of help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of you may be wondering, “Isn’t Indicio <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Proven</a> a complete platform?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is similar, but only in the sense that it provides all the components needed to build a complete ecosystem for issuing, holding, presenting, and verifying credentials, including hosting if needed. However, it’s not a platform because you fully own it, you control the data, and you run the software. Indicio never collects or even sees your data. To revisit our car analogy one last time, our team is happy to act as the manufacturer and put it together, or the mechanic and provide IT support, but at the end of the day it is your car.</p>

             October 2023   
	 
		 
			 A Journey Through the Evolution of Blockchain for FIs 
 
<p>October is a memorable month for us as we commemorate Tokeny’s 6th anniversary in 2023.</p>
<p>Reflecting on our journey, the transformative strides in blockchain and its emerging prominence in the financial sector stand out.</p>
<p>🚀 The Early Days (2017-2020):&nbsp;The Need for a Suitable Blockchain</p>
<p>In the fledgling stages of our journey and the evolution of security tokens, many early adopters in the financial system believed that the best solution was to craft their own blockchains. This mindset stemmed from a desire for control instead of utilizing a public blockchain. Given the uncertainty about ensuring compliance on permissionless networks, many chose to develop their own blockchains, adopt private ones, or work within siloed ecosystems.</p>
<p>As time progressed, public networks significantly improved in speed, cost, interoperability, as well as compliance enforcement via smart contracts. The realization grew that the answer wasn’t necessarily about creating a new blockchain. Instead, it became evident that the future would hinge on bridging the sense of compliance on a public ledger.</p>
<p>🔥 The Buzz Period (2020-2022):&nbsp;The Age of Wallet Solutions</p>
<p>The next phase in this evolution was characterized by a realization that blockchain could be a suitable infrastructure for global finance, but then came the next hurdle in solving the custodianship problem. As a reminder, securities are bound by numerous regulatory guidelines for various asset servicers. Implementing these on-chain necessitates creative solutions that comply with the law.</p>
<p>This period witnessed a growing understanding that cryptocurrencies and security tokens don’t function identically. With regulations becoming stronger for custodial wallets, a pressing demand for non-custodial wallets became evident. This shift was indeed a welcome one, aligning with the core essence of blockchain, where end-users should inherently control their assets, manage their accounts, and identities. Moreover, protocols like ERC6343 guarantee the possible recovery of tokens via smart contracts.</p>
<p>🌆 The Scaling Phase (2023-∞):&nbsp;Tokenization in Action</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, after years of exploration and discovery, the time has come to fully harness the power of this technology. Business is now reclaiming the reins from tech departments with a new mantra –&nbsp;“We need tokenization capabilities.”&nbsp;Financial Institutions (FIs) are increasingly eager to design new blockchain-based services for their clientele for a variety of use-cases including but not limited to: treasury management, collateral management, cap table management, alternative liquidity options, and many more.</p>
<p>As time to market becomes increasingly important, to ensure unity and to accelerate adoption we encourage the use of open-source standards like ERC3643, so everyone can interact on the same nomenclature and functioning principles. From investors to issuers, to custodians, to exchanges, to asset servicers, leveraging the same framework is massively beneficial.</p>
<p>In alignment with this vision, Tokeny and 35+ distinguished members across industries have established the non-profit ERC3643 association. Our primary aim is to globalize this standard and expedite its adoption.</p>
<p>We cordially invite FIs aiming to pioneer this transformation to join our collective efforts.</p>
<p>Cheers to Tokeny’s upcoming years and the continued positive trajectory of blockchain!</p>
<p>We appreciate your time, here’s to the next 6 years! 🥂</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 3rd October to 17th&nbsp;October <p>Welcome to the latest Veriscope Regulatory Recap. In this edition, we shed light on the G20’s move around crypto guidelines and how India is reacting to it, touch upon California’s new rules for crypto businesses, and see how Cyprus is aligning with Europe when it comes to crypto regulations. So, let’s dive right&nbsp;in.</p> Digital Asset Developments Dominate Global Regulatory Landscape <p>Global: The recent assembly in Marrakesh, Morocco, saw G20 nations embracing the “IMF-FSB Synthesis Paper: Policies for Crypto-Assets” as a foundational roadmap for crypto oversight.</p>(<a href="https://x.com/shyftnetwork/status/1711765709909291041?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>The paper underscores increased data sharing and collaboration among G20&nbsp;nations.</p><p>Following this guideline, India, a significant member and current president of the G20, is adjusting its stance on crypto, as indicated by the Secretary Of Economic&nbsp;Affairs.</p><p>The paper outlines guidelines on crypto oversight, with a focus on cross-border collaboration and risk management frameworks. Within these frameworks, an emphasized component is alignment with the Financial Action Task Force’s standards, specifically aiming to curtail the misuse of crypto assets for illicit activities.</p><p>In parallel, the International Monetary Fund’s recent working paper sets forth a risk assessment matrix for countries. This tool aims to spotlight potential sector vulnerabilities, streamlining the understanding of emerging macro-financial risks associated with digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Cyprus: Shifting the lens to Europe, Cyprus, celebrated for its crypto-friendly posture, is contemplating a tighter grip on the&nbsp;sector.</p><p>The nation is eyeing stringent penalties for non-compliant crypto service providers and aligning its measures with globally recognized AML/CFT standards.</p>(<a href="https://x.com/shyftnetwork/status/1712183498465837533?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>These moves echo the broader European intent, as the EU is set to unveil the comprehensive “Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA) Regulation” in 2024, fortifying consumer safeguards in the evolving web3 environment.</p><p>The United States: On American soil, California emerges as the latest state to formulate a regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency industry.</p><p>The recently signed Digital Financial Assets Law mandates licensing protocols and stringent record-keeping standards, laying the groundwork for transparent crypto operations in the&nbsp;state.</p><p>In the backdrop of these regulatory dynamics, the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is contemplating the extension of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to the realm of digital currencies.</p><p>This move, reportedly, intends to offer an additional layer of protection against potential mishaps like unauthorized transfers or cyber&nbsp;threats.</p><p>Now, let’s look into two of these major developments in detail and analyze their impact on the broader crypto ecosystem in&nbsp;detail.</p> California’s New Crypto Framework: Implications and&nbsp;Impact <p>California has officially delved into crypto regulation by enacting the Digital Financial Assets Law. This decision follows Governor Gavin Newsom’s approval of Assembly Bill&nbsp;39.</p><p>Modeled after New York’s BitLicense, California’s law mandates cryptocurrency entities to acquire a license from the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI).</p><p>This is reportedly to align with the state’s regulatory expectations. Additionally, maintaining accurate financial records and being available for regulatory audits are also part of the compliance requisites.</p><p>Although the law seeks to shape the crypto landscape, prioritizing user privacy and interest and enhancing consumer protection, potentially minimizing fraud, its real-world implications remain to be&nbsp;seen.</p><p>Will it enhance transparency and reliability or could it stifle innovation, leading to an exodus of crypto businesses from the state? The slated 2025 commencement provides time to observe and, if necessary, recalibrate the approach.</p> G20’s Green Light to Crypto Guide: A Two-Edged Sword? <p>The G20’s recent recognition of the “IMF-FSB Synthesis Paper” could reshape the crypto landscape as we know it&nbsp;today.</p><p>The directive, leaning towards comprehensive oversight rather than prohibition, suggests cross-border regulatory synergy and robust risk frameworks.</p><p>Its call for increased data transparency and adherence to FATF’s anti-money laundering benchmarks places a spotlight on preserving the integrity of digital asset transactions.</p><p>On the brighter side, a globally coordinated regulatory stance might boost investor confidence and enhance crypto’s legitimacy in traditional financial spheres. It could bridge the knowledge gap for countries still grappling with crypto’s dynamism, fostering a more harmonized global approach.</p><p>Yet, there’s potential friction. Overzealous data requisition might challenge privacy norms, and stringent compliance could weigh down startups, possibly curbing innovation.</p><p>As 2025 nears, when the first review is due, the crypto realm will keenly watch how this roadmap steers the balance between governance and&nbsp;growth.</p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>A Distributed Ledger stands at the forefront of modern database technology, a shared database spread across many sites, countries, or institutions. This innovative approach to data management records transactions while ensuring every participant within its network has access to a shared, uniform version of this information. As industries evolve and the need for transparent yet secure transaction methods surges, the relevance and significance of this technology amplify.</p>
 Historical Context 
<p>Origins and evolution of ledgers in accounting and finance: The concept of ledgers is not new. Historically, they’ve served as repositories for financial information, recording and keeping track of transactions in a physical, centralized manner. This method, while foundational, had limitations regarding accessibility, transparency, and real-time updates.</p>
<p>The shift to digital ledgers: The digital age revolutionized data management. Digital ledgers introduced speed and immediate access. However, they also confronted us with challenges concerning security, transparency, potential data manipulation, and reliance on central intermediaries.</p>
<p>The emergence of blockchain and DLT: Recognizing the pitfalls of digital ledgers, the concept of blockchain was birthed, later leading to the broader realm of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). This decentralized approach promised to address previous challenges, adding layers of security, transparency, and peer verification without relying on a central authority.</p>
 What is Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)? 
<p>Detailed definition: DLT is a decentralized system that facilitates recording transactions across many computers. It differs from traditional databases because it lacks centralization, ensuring consistent data across its network without relying on a singular control point.</p>
<p>Difference from traditional ledgers: While traditional ledgers hinge on a single entity (like banks or regulatory authorities) for validation, DLT operates using consensus algorithms. These algorithms ensure that all network participants agree on the recorded data’s validity, thus removing intermediaries and providing a democratized system.</p>
<p>Key components and features: Key features making DLT particularly attractive include decentralized control, data immutability, cryptographic data security, and consensus-driven validation mechanisms.</p>
 Types of Distributed Ledgers 
<p>Blockchain vs. other types: Though often used synonymously with DLT, blockchain is a subset. It sequentially links data, with blocks chained chronologically. However, other DLT structures, such as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), diverge from this chained data model.</p>
<p>Public vs. Private Ledgers: The difference lies in accessibility. Public ledgers, like the one used by Bitcoin, are accessible to all, allowing anyone to participate. Conversely, private ledgers limit participation and are often used within a single organization.</p>
<p>Consortium Ledgers: This is a middle ground between public and private, controlled by a pre-selected group of nodes or participants, usually multiple organizations collaborating for common objectives.</p>
 Benefits of Using Distributed Ledger 
<p>Enhanced security and immutability: DLT employs sophisticated cryptographic techniques. With its decentralized nature, altering recorded data becomes arduous, ensuring data integrity.</p>
<p>Transparency and traceability: Every transaction is visible to participants, guaranteeing unparalleled transparency, which aids in trust-building and ensures a clear audit trail for every entry.</p>
<p>Reduction in transaction costs and intermediaries: The consensus-driven model of DLT removes the need for intermediaries, reducing costs and potential bottlenecks and creating a more streamlined transaction process.</p>
<p>Increased efficiency and speed: Without intermediaries and with real-time ledger updates, transaction times are drastically reduced, enhancing efficiency.</p>
 Real-World Applications 
 
 Identity Verification: Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) fortifies identity verification processes against theft and fraud. By decentralizing personal information and employing robust cryptographic techniques, DLT enhances security, reduces vulnerabilities, and puts individuals in greater control of their data, thereby diminishing the risks of unauthorized access and manipulation. 
 Supply Chain: With a need for authentic, traceable product histories, DLT provides a solution, ensuring real-time tracking and verification of goods at every stage, from origin to end-user. 
 Smart Contracts: These self-executing contracts embed the terms of the agreement within lines of code, making them automatic, transparent, and irreversible 
 Voting Systems and Governance: DLT can overhaul traditional voting systems, introducing enhanced transparency while reducing fraud potential and increasing citizen trust. 
 
 Challenges and Limitations 
 
 Scalability Concerns: As transactions accumulate, the size of the ledger grows. Processing and validating these transactions can become slower over time. 
 Integration with Existing Systems: Organizations with established infrastructures may find transitioning to a DLT-based system daunting, given integration complexities and potential resistance to change. 
 Regulatory and Governance Issues: DLT’s decentralized nature might clash with centralized regulatory frameworks, making universal adoption challenging. 
 Potential Risks and Vulnerabilities: Though secure, as a relatively young technology, undiscovered vulnerabilities could be present, which might be exploited by malicious actors. 
 
 The Future of Distributed Ledgers 
 
 Integration with IoT and AI: As devices become more innovative and connected, merging DLT with IoT and AI can create interconnected systems where transactions are secure and intelligent.

<p>The critical infrastructure is commonly defined as the systems and networks that provide basic services necessary to preserve a standard of living. In today’s interconnected high-technology world, protecting the critical infrastructure has gained growing attention. Increasing threats and a changing geopolitical environment are giving us reasons to reconsider how we define and protect these vital systems. In this blog post we look at how the scope of what is critical infrastructure is being transformed, and how expanded coverage is changing what organizations must do to protect their growing assets and capabilities. We’ll examine how interconnectivity and increasing dependence on digital technologies has resulted in this expanded definition, and how new regulations in the European Union (EU) are affecting the way public and private entities must protect their operations.</p>
<p>A look back</p>
<p>Critical infrastructure traditionally included essential services such as electricity, water and sewer, roads, and the banking system that sustains the economy. As digital technologies have made their way into so many facets of our daily lives, so too has our dependence on these technologies for their continued reliable operation. It’s surprising that the critical infrastructure in the context of national security was not formally defined in many countries until the 1990s in preparation for the year 2000 (Y2K) event that was expected to wreak havoc across systems of the time. Fast forward to 2023 and increasing threats and a changing geopolitical environment have given us good reasons to reassess how we define and how we protect critical infrastructure to mitigate risks and ensure its uninterrupted operation.</p>
<p>Today’s environment</p>
<p>Expanding the scope of what is considered critical infrastructure, the list of services now goes well beyond electricity, water and sewer, roads, and banking. Services today extend to a wide spectrum of financial services, industrial technologies, communications, healthcare, and education. With digital technologies such as cloud-based data storage and processing now forming part of many vital services, the need to ensure their security and resiliency has become paramount. According to the 2023 IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report, 82% of breaches involved data stored in public or private cloud environments. On average these breaches amount to USD 4.45 million cost per incident. With critical infrastructures being primary targets, the cost of breaches across the sector exceeds USD 5 million and has been growing year on year.</p>
<p>Geopolitical events and increasing malware attacks on utilities and public services are also causing concern at national security levels. The use of new technologies in warfare is raising alarms for the urgent need to strengthen the reliability and robustness of the expanded set of services that now comprise the critical infrastructure.</p>
<p>The need for resilience</p>
<p>To address these threats, new and updated regulations in the EU will come into effect in the next few years. The new Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) and the updated Network and Information Systems (NIS2) component of the Directive on Measures for a High Common Level of Cybersecurity across the Union establish procedures for identifying and designating critical infrastructures, and a common approach for assessing the need to improve their protection. As EU-wide initiatives, DORA and NIS2 are aimed to become part of each member state’s domestic legislation process and law.</p>
<p>The focus of DORA is to enhance the operational resilience of the financial sector within member states. Its primary objective is to ensure that financial institutions and the infrastructure they use and depend on can withstand and recover from cybersecurity incidents and disruptions. Covering a wide range of aspects including cybersecurity, IT systems, outsourcing, and incident reporting, DORA emphasizes robust oversight of third-party service providers.</p>
<p>NIS2 expands earlier EU-wide cybersecurity legislation aiming to strengthen the protection of critical infrastructure areas. The regulation establishes response teams to coordinate incidents across member states. Most notably, NIS2 expands the scope of critical infrastructure, effectively bringing more organizations under the regulatory umbrella. Among industries now covered under the expanded definition, mobile network operators now play a vital role in the critical infrastructure. Focused on fifth-generation (5G) networks that are being deployed to modernize telecommunications for the next decade, mobile network operators are required to only use components from trusted sources.</p>
<p>Both DORA and NIS2 call for the establishment and maintenance of a skilled cybersecurity workforce that can continuously identify and assess system weaknesses and implement solutions to mitigate risks. The regulations also set auditing requirements and severe fines for non-compliance that can amount up to 2% of a company’s worldwide sales. The combination of DORA’s focus on the financial sector and NIS2’s broader coverage will ensure that critical sectors collaborate and learn from each other’s best practices, enhancing overall resilience against cyber threats.</p>
<p>The way forward</p>
<p>While DORA and NIS2 are crucial steps toward a safer and more resilient digital landscape in the EU, compliance with these regulations can pose challenges for organizations. DORA and NIS2 promulgate the use of innovative technology including state-of-the-art encryption and key management to protect sensitive and private data end-to-end. Compliance with these directives is not just a legal obligation but also a vital step toward building a safer and more prosperous digital ecosystem.</p>
<p>With the right security strategy and solutions, organizations can enhance their security posture and facilitate the process to ensure compliance. End-to-end data protection requires effective management of the keys and secrets that encrypt and control access to critical data assets. Entrust offers a complete suite of innovative cryptographic solutions that provide a unique centralized/decentralized security approach to facilitate regulatory compliance.

 The anonymity of online casinos makes them a fertile ground for money laundering, and a significant threat to the stability and integrity of the global gambling industry. But there are things that operators can do to protect their business and customers. 



 



<p>There was a reason why Marty Byrde from Ozark chose casinos as the perfect front for his money laundering activities. Criminals can convert dirty money into physical or digital chips relatively easily with little to no checks, gamble for a short time, and then cash out, with fresh, laundered money. The same is true for online casinos. In fact, the anonymity afforded by online casinos rivals that of even the darkest, dingiest, most back door brick and mortar casino.</p>



<p>The global revenue of the online casino market is projected to reach <a href="https://es.statista.com/outlook/dmo/eservices/online-gambling/online-casinos/worldwide">$32.69 billion by the end of this year</a>, with an estimated 124 million active users by 2027. No longer considered a niche offshoot, online casinos are a sector in their own right, and welcome increasing numbers of players every single day. However, where there are online users, there are weaknesses in online platforms that criminals can exploit.</p>



 Global relationship between casinos and money laundering. 



<p>The impact of money laundering on the gambling industry can be felt around the world, offline and online. In July 2023, Australian-headquartered Crown Resorts found itself at the center of a major legal battle. In a landmark decision, the Federal Court ordered Crown Resorts to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/30/crown-to-pay-450m-penalty-after-failing-to-comply-with-anti-money-laundering-laws">pay a staggering $450 million</a> (the country’s third largest corporate fine ever) for breaches to money laundering laws.</p>



<p>During the trial, Crown Resorts openly acknowledged that its casinos had failed to implement adequate systems for monitoring “high-risk” gamblers and the operations of junket tours. The investigation uncovered a total of 546 violations of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act, spanning 2016 and 2022.</p>



<p>Despite having a population of just over half a million, money laundering in Malta’s iGaming industry is also a significant issue. The island country is home to over<a href="https://igamingnext.com/news/mga-2021-in-numbers/"> 500 iGaming operators</a>, employs more than 10,000 people and generates over $1.5 billion in revenue each year. As a major industry and significant contributor to the economy, it is important that Malta is able to offer a gambling environment that is safe and secure.</p>



<p>In 2022, the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) <a href="https://www.mga.org.mt/the-mga-publishes-its-2022-annual-report-and-financial-statements/">carried out</a> 28 compliance audits, 228 desktop reviews, and additional AML/CFT compliance examinations, which resulted in the cancellation of licenses and the imposition of <a href="https://www.mga.org.mt/the-mga-publishes-its-2022-annual-report-and-financial-statements/">administrative penalties totaling €179,150.</a> The MGA also took remediation measures against 25 license holders, amounting to over €738,000. The Fit &amp; Proper Committee found six individuals and companies to have fallen short of its probity standards due to various factors, including the potential risks associated with money laundering.</p>



<p>Operators failing to comply with AML practices can face serious legal and financial consequences. AML failures include not properly assessing the risk factors associated with players, not having appropriate policies in place, failing to comply with regulatory guidance, and not implementing policies effectively.</p>



<p>In 2022, the <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/news/article/petfre-gibraltar-ltd-trading-as-betfred-and-oddsking-fined-gbp2-9m">UKGC imposed a £2.87 million fine on operator Petfre Ltd.</a> for failing to comply with AML and social responsibility regulations. At the time, Leanne Oxley, Director of Enforcement and Intelligence at the UKGC, stated that other licensees should take note of the case and assess it to improve their compliance measures.</p>



 One click away: Why money launderers target online casinos. 



<p>There are numerous reasons why money launderers will target online casinos, and online gambling platforms, in general, including:</p>



 Anonymity and privacy. 



<p>Online casinos offer unrivalled anonymity and privacy for customers, which unfortunately makes for very attractive conditions for money laundering and other types of fraud. Since online casinos do not require in-person interaction, criminals can create fake identities or steal others’, making it extremely challenging for authorities to trace the source of funds.&nbsp;</p>



 High transaction volumes. 



<p>As many online gambling platforms process thousands of transactions every day, this makes it harder for payment providers and operators to monitor for fraud, and for law enforcement agencies to detect suspicious activities. Criminals will also often use multiple accounts to transfer money between different platforms, making the tracking of funds even more challenging.</p>



 International reach.&nbsp; 



<p>As gambling platforms often operate in multiple jurisdictions, money launderers often transfer money across different countries to further obfuscate funds and avoid detection.</p>



 Cryptocurrency in online casinos. 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/how-criminals-leverage-crypto-money-laundering/">Crypto money launderers</a> on online gambling platforms use a combination of anonymous and identifiable accounts to deposit funds, which are then withdrawn or transferred to other players.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As cryptocurrencies are decentralized, this offers a further level of anonymity, making it even more challenging to trace transaction source and destination, particularly on platforms with subpar KYC and AML measures.</p>



 What methods do criminals use to launder money in online casinos? 



<p>As online gambling platforms provide so many opportunities to launder money, fraudsters have various options to obscure the origin of dirty money and channel it through their gambling platforms of choice. For example, criminals may look to use <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/identity-theft/">stolen identities</a> to open accounts and carry out money laundering schemes, and use stolen credit cards for deposits and withdrawals.</p>



<p>Another common method for money laundering in online casinos involves the fraudster depositing money into their account through either prepaid cards, cheques, credit and debit cards, or cryptocurrencies. The money deposited to the gambling account is then withdrawn and ultimately achieves legal status. With this method, the player does not tend to use the funds for actual betting.</p>



<p>If a particularly large amount of money needs to be made clean, the fraudster is likely to be concerned about amy red flags they might set off. Structuring, smurfing, or layering involves fragmenting large sums of illegally sourced funds into smaller transactions to escape detection. Money launderers do this by depositing small amounts at a time, thus eluding possible detection from regulatory authorities.</p>



<p>Another scenario involves the player using deposited funds to bet. The player will place their funds in games, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/collusion-in-betting/">collude</a> with other players, and place coordinated bets. Although this method involves losing some money, fraudsters are willing to make such an investment to launder money. Chip dumping, a technique in which a player intentionally loses chips to another player at an online poker table, is one of the greatest examples of collusion in online gambling. The individual receives chips and then cashes out, effectively laundering money.</p>



<p>The third most common way to launder money through online casinos involves using the gambling account as a makeshift bank account to make illegal transactions. Both parties (buyer and seller) would utilize a gambling account to transfer funds through P2P (player-to-player) transfers. The seller can then cash out illicit funds stored on their gambling account to their payment account. If asked about the source of funds, sellers often claim the money is generated from gambling profits.</p>



<p>Those who use gambling platforms for the purpose of money laundering often use multiple accounts to transact money between different platforms. Gnoming refers to the act of using multiple accounts to help one player win. The other accounts are created to deliberately lose in head-to-head games like poker.</p>



<p>The final method involves using a gambling account to store and conceal illicit funds from authorities. This approach differs from previous methods as funds are not withdrawn but concealed and retrieved from the gambling account using the same (anonymous) banking method.</p>

 Red flags: How to detect money laundering in online casinos. 



<p>Below are the most common money laundering-related red flags operators should watch out for:</p>



  Unusual betting patterns with players placing large bets on low-risk games or frequently changing betting patterns.<br>  Frequent large transactions.<br>  Rapid deposit and withdrawal cycles with criminals depositing large sums to their accounts and withdrawing them quickly.<br>  Multiple accounts and IP addresses for conducting transactions.  



 How are regulatory bodies addressing money laundering in online casinos? 



<p>Regulatory bodies worldwide have taken several initiatives to address money laundering in online casinos. These include the requirement to adhere to strict measures as part of AML and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/terrorist-financing/">terrorist financing</a> regulations.</p>



<p>For instance, the UK has one of the most regulated gambling industries in the world. The UK Gambling Commission, which is currently running a series of consultations to bring the gambling environment into the digital age, has recently made customer onboarding and verification processes much stricter. Without complete verification, operators can neither let customers deposit funds nor give them <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/print/changes-to-the-licence-conditions-and-codes-of-practice-on-age-and-identity#:~:text=summarised%20as%20follows%3A-,Age%20verification,-We%20will%20require">access</a> to bonuses, free bets, or even free-to-play games.</p>



<p>Most regulatory bodies also require online casinos to conduct <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/customer-due-diligence/">Customer Due Diligence</a> checks, also known as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a> requirements. This process involves gathering and verifying basic information about the customer via a reliable source. Discover more about the dangers of online casinos, and the importance of KYC in ensuring a safe and secure gambling experience in our blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/importance-of-kyc-in-online-casinos">‘The importance of KYC in online casinos.’</a></p>



 How can online casinos prevent money laundering? 



<p>Online casinos must embrace the benefits of technology to combat money laundering. Technology can help detect money laundering by analyzing large amounts of data and identifying suspicious transactions and gambling patterns. This is done by utilizing automated systems that flag transactions that meet specific criteria, e.g., large or unusual transactions.</p>



<p>Below are some ways operators can prevent money laundering with the help of technological advances:</p>



 Machine learning and AI solutions. 



<p>AI-enabled identity verification solutions can identify player identities and behavior patterns indicative of money laundering. Such systems learn from past transactions to identify unusual patterns. These solutions are also able to verify huge amounts of information by comparing customer data with identity documents, biometric data, or external databases.</p>



 Blockchain technology. 



<p>Blockchain technology can be utilized to create a transparent and immutable ledger of transactions. All transactions on the blockchain create a permanent trail of unalterable records. Consequently, authorities can more conveniently trace the source of money.</p>



 Reporting suspicious activities. 



<p>Operators must report any suspicious activities or transactions to the relevant authorities. This includes any unusual transaction that does not meet specific financial thresholds or other standards set by local regulations. Here, automated systems that flag suspicious transactions can be used.</p>



 Risk assessments. 



<p>Risk assessments include closely examining transaction patterns, geographic locations, and user profiles to ascertain the likelihood and potential risk of money laundering activities. After risks are detected, operators can take the appropriate measures to mitigate them, e.g., the implementation of advanced due diligence protocols on high-risk users. Adopting an effective risk-based <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/204350/amlctf_supervision_report_201011.pdf">approach</a> by identifying high-risk users and transactions can also lighten the overall burden of regulation on operators.</p>



 Transaction monitoring. 



<p>Lastly, operators can use technology to monitor transactions via SoF (Source of Funds) and SoW (Source of Wealth) checks. This helps ensure transactions are legitimate and funds are not the proceeds of criminal activity.</p>



 How does money laundering impact online casino users? 



<p>The impact of online casinos falling victim to money laundering can be disastrous. Firstly, there is the obvious reputational damage, as existing and future customers will ask questions about the legitimacy and security of the platform, resulting in a loss of player trust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players who do stay on the platform and are concerned about money laundering will potentially change their deposit habits. Another likely impact could be players no longer trusting KYC processes for fear their information may be misused.</p>



<p>Operators can allay player fears by remaining proactive and vigilant in their efforts to prevent money laundering, which could involve implementing more advanced anti-fraud technologies and joining forces with regulatory bodies to ensure compliance with relevant laws.</p>

 No topic has been more polarizing to the gambling industry than the proposed financial risk checks. Now that the UKGC’s consultation on the checks has been conducted, we explore the arguments against affordability checks. 



 



<p>Financial risk checks, formerly known as affordability checks in the UK, were essentially designed to protect players from gambling online with money they cannot afford to lose.&nbsp;Operators conduct them to ensure they are not encouraging problem gambling, and that their products and services are being used responsibly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similar in concept to the ability-to-pay checks conducted by financial service providers of credit cards and loans, financial risk checks run in the background, ultimately satisfying the operator that the gambler has sufficient funds to continue placing bets safely. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The release of the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-gambling-white-paper/">UK Gambling White Paper</a> in April 2023, which aimed to bring the regulatory environment into the digital age, caused uproar among gambling operators and players alike. Its proposal on affordability checks, in particular, led to collective apprehension that they would be intrusive and impact the enjoyment of gamblers who were not experiencing gambling-related issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The UK Gambling Commission (UKGC), which is currently running a series of consultations on proposed changes, has identified three key risks it wishes to address via financial risk checks: binge gambling, financially vulnerable customers, and sustained significant losses over time (from gambling). To assuage operator and player fear, the UKGC has stated that “frictionless” player protection checks will only ever be conducted, starting with background checks at a £125 net loss per month or £500 within a year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read more about the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ukgc-plans-uk-gambling-sector/">UKGC’s plans to execute the UK government’s gambling strategy here</a>.</p>



 Privacy concerns and data protection objections. 



<p>The topic of responsible gambling and safer gambling has been on the UKGC’s agenda since as far back as 2018, when it launched a proposal for operators to establish limits on online consumer expenditures until affordability checks were carried out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In November 2020, a month before the government announced it would be carrying out a gambling review, the UKGC launched a consultation that included a call for evidence on the thresholds for affordability checks. During that period, a net monthly loss of £100 was proposed as the lowest possible threshold to prompt an affordability check, after which a gambler would be required to prove they had sufficient funds and could afford to continue gambling on the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The consultation caused alarm throughout various gambling sectors, especially the racing administration. The fear is that thousands of gamblers would be uncomfortable divulging such private information and choose to bet via black-market routes or give up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The debate surrounding affordability checks highlighted the tension between safeguarding vulnerable gamblers and preserving individual freedom and privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Towards the end of 2022, reports suggested that the government favored “non-intrustive” procedures similar to a credit check in financial services, although the matter was likely to be subject to further consultation.</p>



 Ready, set, stop: Impact of affordability checks. 



<p>The proposal of affordability checks was and is still by far the most controversial of gambling reforms under discussion. Critics argue that affordability checks come with notable drawbacks. For instance, the <a href="https://www.racingpost.com/news/gambling-review/bha-warns-mps-affordability-checks-could-be-financially-devastating-for-british-racing-ajWoc9B6UgCZ/">British Horseracing Authority warned</a> Members of Parliament that introducing affordability checks at low levels of spending may prove financially devastating for the British horse racing industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Establishing appropriate spending limits has long been considered a challenging aspect when it comes to conducting affordability checks. Many factors need to be considered, including customer income, expenses, and overall financial situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In early 2021, Several high-profile names working within the <a href="https://www.racingpost.com/news/features/series/a-sword-of-damocles-but-how-did-affordability-checks-become-such-a-big-issue-a8n1Q3Q3DO9Q/">racing industry</a> sent letters to Members of Parliament, underscoring that racecourse revenues had suffered a £250 million loss due to the pandemic. Their argument was that if affordability checks as low as £100 were established, it would result in a potential further impact of £60 million per year on profits from lost levy, as well as media rights payments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other evaluations proposed that the potential damage would be as high as £100 million per year, with roughly 60% of gamblers likely to reject such requests for information.</p>



 Most recent criticisms of financial risk checks. 



<p>Although the UK gambling white paper appears more balanced than many in the industry feared, there are criticisms from the industry based on allegations of intrusiveness and paternalism.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The invasion of privacy is staggering,” opined Regulus Partners regulatory analyst Dan Waugh in 2020 regarding the concept of financial risks and would just lead to individuals looking for ways to avoid the level of intrusion needed to enforce the rules.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With financial risk checks, the UK’s government proposes “frictionless” and “unintrusive” checks when a player passes a net loss of £125 per month or £500 in a year. As per the proposal, such affordability checks would become more detailed yet “still frictionless” at more substantial loss levels, i.e., £1000 in a day or £2000 within 90 days. Such levels would be halved for gamblers under 25.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As per the UKGC’s consultations on four initial topics (financial risk checks; remote game design; in-person age verification; customer control over marketing), numerous operators have completed compliance assessments on how the proposed standards on affordability and financial risk checks has been met.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.gamblinginsider.com/news/20668/olbg-survey-65-of-bettors-would-refuse-to-face-affordability-checks-if-asked">survey</a> conducted by YouGov on behalf of the Online Betting Guide, 65% of players showed a lack of willingness to comply with affordability checks. Another <a href="https://bettingandgamingcouncil.com/news/ey-report-22">study</a> led by the EY for the Betting and Gaming Council towards the end of 2022 showed that nearly 70% of people who gamble would resist allowing regulated companies to conduct affordability checks to determine whether they could afford to bet.</p>



 An industry “simply unprepared.” 



<p>A 2020 blog from <a href="https://www.wiggin.co.uk/insight/the-affordability-consultation-a-fundamental-shift-in-gambling-regulation/">Wiggin</a>, a law firm based in London, also noted how unprepared the industry and consumers were to adapt to the requirements of financial risk checks. The main crux of the issue for the Wiggin team was proportionality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A question posed in the blog was: “How far does the Commission expect operators and regular customers, which constitute the vast majority of British gamblers, to change their behavior to mitigate the risk that only a small yet vulnerable proportion of customers face?”</p>



 What consequences do critics most fear? 



<p>According to Waugh, the likely outcome of extending “official oversight,” via financial risk checks, would be “threefold.”&nbsp;</p>



  Rather than use one operator, players would just allocate funds throughout multiple accounts, until the UKGC’s aspirations toward a <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/news/article/an-update-on-the-single-customer-view-industry-challenge">single customer view</a> are fully realized<br>  Gamblers may use proxy accounts owned by family and friends<br>  Players may resort to offshore gambling or black-market gambling platforms&nbsp;  



<p>As mentioned earlier, the final outcome would be players to simply reduce expenditures or stopping gambling altogether.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://bettingandgamingcouncil.com/news/ey-report-22">study</a> led by EY for the Betting and Gaming Council highlighted the decline of online gross gambling yield since mid-2021, owing to several possible factors, including the introduction of affordability checks.</p>



 6 financial risk check indicators, 1 frictionless check. 



<p>IDnow combines a robust, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/affordability-financial-risk-checks/">holistic affordability check</a> with multi-dimensional ID verification and fraud prevention, facilitating seamless gambling experiences anytime, anywhere, all from one platform, all in real-time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We offer the industry’s most comprehensive affordability check (read more: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/reimagining-affordability-financial-risk-check/">Why 6 financial risk check indicators are better than 2.’</a>) to enable seamless gameplay by offering a fully automated journey and enhanced speed and accuracy at the affordability checkpoint. Checks can be added at any point in the journey. For example, while the more cautious operators may wish to implement the full suite of checks at the point of onboarding, some may wish to implement them at the point of withdrawal or deposit or once thresholds are met. Checks from our suite of financial risk indicators can also be done at different points – e.g. Geo, mortality and property at account sign up and application, and vulnerability and derogatory checks once the whitepaper limits have been reached for example.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow values the importance of non-intrusive affordability checks as they indicate that operators take player protection, privacy, and responsible gambling seriously.</p>

<p>To evolve from an economy of extraction to an economy of care we need to evolve from Communication Design to Conversation Design. While Communication Design builds one-directional relationships between corporations and consumers, Conversational Design builds frameworks and pathways for communities.</p><p>I have not talked about it much, but today is a good day to tell you that I joined a not-for-profit organization at the beginning of 2023 and it is challenging my way of thinking about&nbsp;design.</p><p>The job title they gave me is Visual Conversation Design Lead at Dark Matter Laboratories. DML is an international not-for-profit collaborating with communities to reshape and rebuild their institutions, instruments, and infrastructures.</p><p>I have felt the urge to use my design skills and knowledge to improve the world we live in, on and from, for many years, but did not know how. I was frustrated about seeing human systems destroying us and our planet and not being able to do anything about it. Designing a poster and posting it to social media felt useless. I mean, I get it and I don’t criticize designers doing so. It is what comes to the designer’s mind first. Paraphrasing the saying “When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.”: When all you have is the creative cloud, everything looks like a poster on Instagram.</p><p>We do not have no power as designers, we just use our skills for the wrong things, in the wrong context, and for the wrong purposes. When we design a post on social media we try to teach individuals that have no power either and probably are in our network, because they already think like&nbsp;us.</p><p>This year I realized that we DO have power as designers. We have the power to say NO to certain clients, tools, and trends and we have the power to say YES to work with innovative experts and decision-makers in leverage positions that need our help. We can’t do it alone. We need to join communities of practice.</p><p>From Communication Design to Conversation Design</p><p>To evolve from an economy of extraction to an economy of care we need to change complex systems with multipolar problems. This is only possible if we form trans-disciplinary, trans-institutional, and trans-everything networks. To bridge these gaps we need to evolve from Communication Design to Conversation Design. While Communication Design builds one-directional relationships between corporations and consumers, Conversational Design builds frameworks and pathways for communities.</p><p>Communication Design has been strongly influenced by the system it has been used for. In most cases, the attempted kind of communication has been one-directional with the sole purpose of convincing a person to become a customer. As the Visual Conversation Design Lead, I am trying to unlearn the strategies of consumer building and learn the strategies of community building.</p><p>In the following 10 points, I tried to outline the key qualities Conversational Design should&nbsp;have:</p> Simplicity <p>While we need to understand the world in its complexity, we need to strive for simplicity in design. The simplest solution is the solution that wastes the littlest time, energy, and material. Simplicity in Conversational Design does not mean reducing the complexity of information. It means creating flows of knowledge, allowing to join the conversation from different points of view and levels of understanding.</p> Readability <p>We make our texts as comprehensible as possible, in terminology, structure, and typography. We have clearly identifiable hierarchies to allow fast navigation. Longer texts are always left-aligned, not too small, not too big, not too narrow, not too wide, and sufficiently darker than their background. All of the settings are responsively adapted to their&nbsp;display.</p> Transparency <p>We always credit and reference. Our work is the materialization of flows. It emerges through relationships. Making these relationships visible allows our ideas to be questioned and evolve. While staying readable through simple hierarchies, like titles, sub-titles, introductions, and subheadings, we offer opportunities to deepen the knowledge through side-, foot- or endnotes. Transparency also means avoiding layers of concealment that distance us from the matter, like decorative visual or verbal language.</p> Uncertainty <p>Without considering the possibility of being wrong or ignorant, and the wish to listen and learn, there can’t be conversation. Conversational Design has to express a certain degree of uncertainty. Techniques to make the design look unquestionable should be&nbsp;avoided.</p> Friction <p>Frictionless design is the enemy of constructive conversation. The frictionless design confirms one’s beliefs, even if wrong. We need to welcome different perspectives and positions if we want to evolve. Design should create and not hide friction to stimulate conversation.</p> Respect <p>Communication Design seduces consumers. Conversational Design treats its partners as equals. Design should not dumb down, but be challenging. Design can be a chance to evolve visual literacy and stimulate compound learning.</p> Emergent <p>Leave space for the design to evolve and emerge. Think about the constants and variables of your system. What are the variables and how can they be used to show the emergence and evolution of the design? In a world of constant change, everything planned is likely to break. A flexible system able to adapt is more likely to&nbsp;survive.</p> Contextuality <p>If it is our aim to enter into conversation with humans we need to become aware of the conditions under which they are confronted with us. To communicate adequately we need to adapt in size, form, and tone according to the context in which the conversation should take place. Contextual design is about using the right tools for the right people in the right&nbsp;context.</p> Eloquence <p>Visual eloquence means moving away from simplistic visual messages like logos and embracing the diversity and complexity of visual languages. Everything that makes us visible is an identification element. From the people of our organization to the output we create. Whatever is seen most, matters most to the Visual Identity.</p> Kindness <p>Above all rules, we follow the principle of humanity, which states that when interpreting our conversational partner we consider his or her perspective as true to their reality, although it may appear untrue from our perspective. In Conversation Design, we need to be hard on the matter, but soft on the people, to reach a common understanding of a shared&nbsp;faith.</p><p>This blog is authored by Martin Lorenz, Visual Conversation Design Lead at Dark Matter&nbsp;Labs.</p><p>References:</p><p>The ten points mentioned above are influenced by experiences and talks I had with my colleagues at Dark Matter Laboratories, like Indy Johar, Arianna Smaron, Gurden Batra, Leon Seefeld, Jayne Engle, Ivana Stancic, JP King, and many more, which aren’t documented and can’t be referenced here, but there are a couple of readable references that helped me with my thinking and I would like to collect them&nbsp;here.</p><p>This is an ongoing thought process and I would appreciate every hint from you to more relevant sources regarding the creation, application, and implementation of Conversational Design in communities.</p><p>I do not fully agree with all of what is written here, but these sources were definitely relevant to form an&nbsp;opinion:</p><p><a href="https://designobserver.com/feature/against-branding-part-1--design-and-conflict/39433">https://designobserver.com/feature/against-branding-part-1–design-and-conflict/39433</a></p><p><a href="http://www.untold-stories.net/?p=CAPS_LOCK">http://www.untold-stories.net/?p=CAPS_LOCK</a></p><p><a href="https://www.eyemagazine.com/feature/article/first-things-first-manifesto-2000">https://www.eyemagazine.com/feature/article/first-things-first-manifesto-2000</a></p> <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/from-communication-design-to-conversation-design-b943f8ea0872">From Communication Design to Conversation Design</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>I closed <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/video-trust-in-the-post-identity-world-identiverse-closing-keynote/">my Identiverse 2022 speech</a> with a discomfiting call to action: “If zero trust is a thing, then so is Zero Identity”. This speech from Identiverse 2023 in June extends that concept.</p>
<p>What do I mean? Let’s go as far as we can without identity. Let’s see if we can design systems without putting identity first. We’ve become obsessed with identity. We seem to begin the design process for each new system with identity. When a transaction is risky, we habitually pile on more identification, leading to too much identity data leaking, and too many opportunities for identity abuse.</p>
<p>It is sheer madness that <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/what-if-we-could-make-data-useless-to-thieves/">so much crime is enabled by simply assuming another person’s identity</a>.</p>
<p>To turn around this race-to-the-bottom, let’s try something different. Let’s try to secure peoples’ transactions with less reliance on their identity.</p>
<p>“Zero Trust” has achieved quasi standard status in cybersecurity but let’s remember it does not literally mean there is no trust. Rather, Zero Trust is an appeal for more discipline in security design. Much-vaunted trustless systems make their security promises with less reliance on people and process.</p>
<p>Similarly, “Zero Identity” is my call to do more with less identification.</p>

Here’s the latest from our development efforts.  SpruceIDSpruce    </a><p>At SpruceID, we’re letting users control their identity and data across the web. Here’s the latest from our development efforts:</p> SpruceKit <p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/introducing-sprucekit/">SpruceKit</a> is a collection of libraries that power your application to accept digital credentials from users on their terms, originate trusted information for users, and interact with user data vaults. SpruceKit consists of the following open-source libraries:</p>  SSX  Sign-in with Ethereum  DIDKit  TreeLDR  SpruceKit also provides access to Kepler and Rebase   SSX <p>SSX (Self-Sovereign Anything) is the easiest way to integrate Sign-In with Ethereum, enable DAO logins, resolve ENS names, and more. It is the go-to library for developers in Web3 to get started with decentralized identity.</p>  Research around WebAuthn around creating a consistent signing identity using WebAuthn, creating and signing capability objects using WebAuthn, and using WebAuthn signers with EIP-4337.   Kepler <p></p><p>Kepler is a decentralized storage network organized around data overlays called Orbits. Kepler allows users to securely share their digital credentials, private files, and sensitive media to blockchain accounts, all using your Web3 wallet.</p>  Kepler is currently being updated to adopt the latest versions of the UCAN spec (v0.10) and the CACAO spec (v3) (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler/pull/155?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#155</a>). This will keep Kepler up to date with the latest work in cryptographic object capabilities, and help to streamline code while improving performance and safety.  <p></p> DIDKit/SSI <p>DIDKit provides Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifier functionality across different platforms. DIDKit's core libraries are written in Rust due to Rust's expressive type system, memory safety, simple dependency web, and suitability across different platforms including embedded systems, but the comprehensive DIDKit SDK includes many libraries and interfaces for using it almost everywhere.</p>  ssi-ucan is being updated to support the latest iteration of the UCAN spec: version 0.10 (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/510?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#510</a>). This will enable SSI users to take advantage of cryptographic object capabilities for delegating, invoking, and revoking permissions.  Last month, we upgraded our cryptographic libraries to address a vulnerability with ed25519 keys (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/532?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ssi#532</a>).  A major refactor of ssi continues to be underway. This refactor will help us to better handle Linked Data and generally improve our implementation of the various Verifiable Credentials and Decentralised IDs specifications (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/508?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#508</a>). The general API redesign is over, and we are now rewriting all ssi tests and making sure the new implementation does not introduce regressions.   TreeLDR <p>TreeLDR is a schema definition language that aims to describe both the structure and semantics of the defined schema in a comprehensible way. It lies at the intersection between <a href="https://www.w3.org/RDF/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">RDF</a> and structure-oriented schema definition frameworks such as <a href="https://json-schema.org/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">JSON Schema</a>.</p>  Working on a formal specification of TreeLDR’s layout ontology. RDF is the intermediate representation used by the TreeLDR compiler. Having a formal specification of TreeLDR's layouts in RDF will allow us to:  derive a formal definition of the TreeLDR language itself, based on this ontology, leading to the stabilization of TreeLDR;  enable developers to write extensions for TreeLDR through RDF.     Rebase&nbsp;   Support for ReCaps (and Delegated Attestation flows, as a result) is now available. This opens the door to allowing Kepler and Rebase to share a delegation and only requires one signing operation before the user can create and store credentials without re-signing.  A new, more flexible WASM compilation build chain that enables easy importation of the WASM library into the browser, Node, and other WASM-targeting Rust libraries.  Automated testing of all the flows that were missing tests (e-mail, NFT, POAP, Attestation, and Delegated Attestation).  Full support of did:key for ed25519 keys as both issuer and subject. Key additions broaden what applications can be built on top of it and open the door for user-defined credentials which are required for content authenticity projects.   <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.

<p>Say goodbye to the network perimeter you know and love. Its days are numbered, and an expansive attack surface is taking its place.</p>
<p>You see, long gone are the days when classic network security policies could safely protect your sensitive data. With a swarm of new users, personal devices, cloud applications, and machine identities floating around your environment, the time has come to take implicit trust out of the equation.</p>
<p>Of course, we’re talking about adopting a <a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/learn/zero-trust">Zero Trust</a> strategy. But, before you can do that, your organization will have to revisit its approach to identity governance.</p>
<p>Why? Think about it: Post-perimeter cybersecurity is all about knowing who and what has access to your corporate assets. More importantly, it’s about how they’re using them.</p>
<p>That’s where Identity and Access Management (IAM) comes into play. In this blog, we’ll discuss why IAM is key to implementing Zero Trust and what your organization can do to lay a solid foundation.</p>
 The importance of identity to Zero Trust security 
<p>There’s been a significant change in the way most organizations architect their IT infrastructure over the past several years. Given recent advancements in cloud computing, many enterprises have chosen to transition away from legacy, on-premise systems in favor of agile cloud deployments.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/the-cloud-in-2021-adoption-continues/">over 90% of organizations</a> now operate in the cloud. Gartner estimates that global cloud spending will continue to soar, totaling <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-04-19-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-public-cloud-end-user-spending-to-reach-nearly-600-billion-in-2023#:~:text=Worldwide%20end%2Duser%20spending%20on,latest%20forecast%20from%20Gartner%2C%20Inc.">over $720 billion</a> in 2024. It begs the question: How did we get here?</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic is unquestionably a driving force. When offices closed their doors, a sudden and massive demand for remote access paved the way for rapid digital transformation — and with that, cloud computing. However, because more users, applications, devices, and other assets are connected to the network, the attack surface has grown exponentially.</p>
<p>Worse yet, these connections exist far beyond the bounds of the traditional network perimeter, leaving them vulnerable to unauthorized access and exploitation. Now that castle-and-moat cybersecurity is insufficient, identity is the only factor standing between hackers and your sensitive data.</p>
<p>Fortunately, that’s where a Zero Trust architecture comes into play.</p>
 The Zero Trust framework 
<p>The <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/08/zero-trust-maturity-model/">Zero Trust maturity model</a> accounts for the fact that the cybersecurity landscape has fundamentally shifted. In turn, it advocates for an identity-driven security framework, which allows a properly authenticated and verified user, device, or other entity to access network resources from any location.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that cloud services and remote access have effectively nullified the classic perimeter. After all, how do you build a fence around a house if the size of the property is constantly changing? The short answer is you forget about the fence and focus on the people coming and going from the property. In a nutshell, that’s what the Zero Trust strategy is all about.</p>
<p>Adopting an identity-driven approach is best supported in tandem with the three core Zero Trust principles:</p>
 
 Least privileged access: The term “<a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/least_privilege">least privilege access</a>” refers to a policy in which entities are granted the minimum level of authorization needed to perform a given function. For instance, employees may only have user access to network resources essential to doing their job. This is key to limiting the attack surface and containing cyber threats. 
 Assume breach: The Zero Trust model eliminates implicit trust and considers all connections as potential threats. Moreover, it advocates safeguarding against the inevitability of a data breach by taking steps to minimize damage. For example, your security team may segment the network, thereby preventing lateral movement. 
 Explicit verification: Strict identity governance is paramount. A solid Zero Trust architecture will continuously monitor activity even after network access is granted, mandating repeated authentication whenever an entity requests access to an additional resource. 
 
<p>One of the most efficient ways of supporting these principles is to introduce a comprehensive Identity and Access Management (IAM) system.</p>
 What is Identity and Access Management? 
<p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/identity-and-access-management-iam">is defined as</a> a “security and business discipline that includes multiple technologies and business processes to help the right people or machines to access the right assets at the right time for the right reasons, while keeping unauthorized access and fraud at bay.”</p>
<p>In simpler terms, IAM policies, tools, and technologies are how your organization can provide secure access to its users, third-party partners, and other entities.</p>
 Traditional IAM 
<p>Traditional IAM strategies stem from the classic network security model, which assumes all entities within a certain perimeter are trustworthy and secure (i.e., implicit trust). However, this approach is easily exploited by hackers, insider threats, phishing scams, malware, and more.</p>
<p>Plus, it’s incapable of meeting the scalability and complexity requirements of today’s dynamic IT landscape, which includes cloud services, mobile devices, remote workers, third-party vendors, etc. It lacks visibility over this expanding surface, allowing anomalous behavior to go undetected.</p>
 Zero Trust IAM 
<p>Zero Trust IAM deploys a more robust and advanced security framework. By applying Zero Trust principles to identity governance and access rights, organizations can implement and enforce access control policies on a much more granular level.</p>
<p>Instead of basing authentication decisions purely on location, a Zero Trust IAM system verifies every request using multiple attributes. These include (but aren’t limited to):</p>
 
 User identity 
 Context 
 Device reputation 
 Location 
 User activity or entity behavior 
 Resource sensitivity 
 
<p>Zero Trust identity management has numerous advantages. Taking this approach can help you:</p>
 
 Improve business continuity and resilience by reducing the attack surface 
 Streamline login, access, and authentication procedures 
 Enhance visibility and analytics over user behavior, which supports early threat detection 
 Minimize impact on the user experience, thus maximizing productivity 
 Reduce costs by automating, orchestrating, and consolidating IAM functions, thereby eliminating the need for redundant solutions 
 Simplify compliance for heavily regulated industries 
 Enable secure access for your <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/09/a-zero-trust-framework-for-the-new-hybrid-workforce/">hybrid workforce</a> 
 
 Implementing Zero Trust IAM: Challenges and solutions 
<p>Many organizations begin their Zero Trust journey with a mixed bag of on- and off-premise technologies, cloud applications, and unmanaged devices. Often, they’re not integrated through an enterprise identity service that catalogs all assets and connections.</p>
<p>Consequently, IT teams are forced to manage disparate identities across a vast number of systems and applications. At an individual level, that means each user has numerous — and oftentimes weak — login credentials. Without visibility over these fragmented identities, organizations are vulnerable to internal and external threats.</p>
 The road to Zero Trust maturity 
<p><a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/07/how-to-implement-zero-trust-a-comprehensive-guide/">Adopting Zero Trust</a> is no easy feat. It may take several years to fully implement and will certainly require all hands on deck. But, given the cybersecurity landscape, few organizations can afford to put it off any further.</p>
<p>The time to lay the foundation for your Zero Trust architecture is now. Luckily, there are several steps you can take to ease the process and get the ball rolling in the right direction:</p>
 
 The first step in addressing this challenge and advancing the Zero Trust journey is to reign in these many assets, users, and data sources. Organizations must systematically identify and classify all of their resources, assigning each one a risk rating depending on how critical it is to operations and how damaging it would be if leaked in the open. 
 Next, after assets are categorized, the enterprise can establish comprehensive security and access control policies. 
 You can fortify security and introduce layered defenses by consolidating identities under a unified IAM solution. With a comprehensive portfolio of advanced capabilities, IT teams can centralize all processes within a single source of truth for all users. This makes it easier to establish and enforce granular policies across on-premise and cloud environments. 
 With a unified solution in place, enterprises may then begin continuously monitoring user behavior, session patterns, and system-wide activity to rapidly detect anomalies and potential threats. 
 
 Essential IAM capabilities 
<p>You might be wondering what a comprehensive <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/identity-and-access-management">IAM portfolio</a> actually looks like. In truth, any IAM system worth its weight in gold will support Zero Trust security with a few must-have components.</p>
 Phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA) 
<p>Account takeovers are a growing threat to corporate credentials. In fact, a recent report suggests there’s been a <a href="https://cybernews.com/security/criminals-solved-bot-defense-leading-to-an-uptick-in-stolen-accounts/">230% jump</a> in such attacks year over year. Many organizations have implemented MFA to mitigate this risk, but hackers have learned to bypass traditional strategies with ease.</p>
<p>That’s why phishing-resistant MFA is crucial to your identity management strategy. FIDO2 keys, passkeys, and other mechanisms are helping security teams overcome this challenge and authenticate their users with ease.</p>
<p>Essential MFA solutions include:</p>
 
 Single sign-on (SSO): Users can access all applications after only one authentication rather than repeating the process for every unique cloud or on-premise system. SSO protects against password fatigue and reuse while also streamlining provisioning, onboarding, and offboarding. 
 Passwordless security: As mentioned, people tend to recycle passwords for multiple accounts. Worse yet, weak passwords are easily cracked. You can mitigate this risk by leveraging passwordless MFA — a process that instead relies on high-assurance cryptographic tools like FIDO2 or digital passkeys. 
 Certificate-based authentication (CBA): CBA offers a passwordless user experience by allowing you to provision a digital certificate to the user. You can also issue certificates to the user’s device, ensuring that both entities are verified and authorized to access network resources. 
 Certificate lifecycle management (CLM): CLM is a must-have addition to any certificate-based authentication process. It offers a full line of sight into your certificate estate, centralizing control for all environments. Issue, renew, and revoke certificates from one pane of glass. 
 Risk-based adaptive authentication (RBA): RBA provides configurable policies that empower you to factor contextual data into the authentication decision. It only escalates the process when required, ensuring you maintain a seamless user experience. If a request is deemed suspicious, you can issue another challenge to authenticate via other mechanisms.

It concludes on Oct 19. 150K OCEAN is budgeted for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF59   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Challenge DF. Predict future ETH price; rewards are a function of prediction accuracy.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Active DF&nbsp;: Challenge DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has details.<br>– Challenge DF substream. To earn: make ETH predictions for specific times; the next section gives an overview of how. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth/blob/main/challenges/challenge-df.md"> Challenge DF README</a> has detailed instructions.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF59 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN rewards total. That OCEAN is allocated as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Volume DF. All except what Challenge DF gets = 70,000 OCEAN<br>– Challenge DF. 5,000&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Challenge DF rewards parameters:</p>  Submission deadline: Wednesday at 23:59 UTC when the DF round finishes.  Prediction at times: Thursday at 00:05 UTC, 00:10,&nbsp;…, 1:00 (12 predictions total)  The contestant with lowest error gets 2,500 OCEAN reward. 2nd-lowest gets 1,500 OCEAN. 3rd-lowest gets 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN.  Further parameters are in “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-challenge-data-farming-378bba28fc97">Introducing Challenge DF</a>” blog post, and the Challenge DF README (linked from&nbsp;post).  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: additional substreams, tuning substreams, and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>Bluesky is currently in beta. Why should I join?</p>
<p>In September, Bluesky reached 1M users, and less than a month later, we reached 1.5M users. The size of our user base is rapidly growing, and our users include people who follow political news, sports, entertainment, and more. Join us in our early days as we grow from 1M to 10M users!</p>
<p>How do I get verified as a journalist?</p>
<p>On Bluesky, journalists and news organizations can self-verify by setting their website directly as their username. For example, some newspapers’ handles that already exist on Bluesky include @nytimes.com, @washingtonpost.com, and @npr.org.</p>
<p>As a result, each organization now manages verifications for their own journalists too. For example, a newsroom can verify an affiliated journalist through a subdomain like @name.newsroom.com.</p>
<p>Freelance journalists and writers that aren't affiliated with a specific organization can set their username to be their website.</p>
<p>Read more about domain verification in our guide <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/4-28-2023-domain-handle-tutorial">here</a>.</p>
<p>Do you have advice for establishing a presence on Bluesky?</p>
<p>Post and engage often! We have a very active user base, and creating posts and replies is the best way to show up on other people’s feeds.</p>
<p>You can also create and subscribe to custom feeds.</p>
<p>What are custom feeds and how can journalists use them?</p>
<p>Custom feeds are a feature on Bluesky that allow you to pick the algorithm that powers your social media experience. Imagine you want your timeline to only be posts from your mutuals, or only posts that have cat photos, or only posts related to sports — you can simply pick your chosen feed from an open marketplace of feeds developed by our team and third-party developers.</p>
<p>For users, the ability to customize their feed gives them back control over how they spend their attention. For developers, an open marketplace of feeds provides the freedom to experiment and publish algorithms that anyone can use.</p>
<p>This means that Bluesky does not control a single algorithmic timeline for all users. Instead, users have created feeds of their own, including feeds specifically for news.</p>
<p>We encourage journalists to experiment with custom feeds too. For example, a local journalist in Portland could create a feed specifically for Portland. Similarly, a finance journalism organization could create a feed specifically for financial news.</p>
<p>How can I get an invite?</p>
<p>Fill out our waitlist for journalists <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/e/1FAIpQLSeOzi1Ty2Xs74E71G_2gHdiCk16yi4kJPQ9VIa-VYx2cmFaiA/viewform">here</a> with your work email address.</p>
<p>If you're a freelance journalist or use a personal email for work, please use the above form as well. We just ask that you provide an author link in the form.</p>
<p>I’m part of a news organization and I’d like to distribute invites to my team. How can I do that?</p>
<p>If you’re an audience editor, you can send us a note at <a href="mailto:press+teaminvites@blueskyweb.xyz">press+teaminvites@blueskyweb.xyz</a> with your Bluesky username and your requested number of invites.</p>
<p>Due to the volume of requests that we receive, if you’re seeking a single or a small number of invites, please use the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/e/1FAIpQLSeOzi1Ty2Xs74E71G_2gHdiCk16yi4kJPQ9VIa-VYx2cmFaiA/viewform">waitlist form</a>.</p>
<p>Do you have any tools for scheduled posting or cross-posting?</p>
<p>We don’t currently have any official tools, but since Bluesky is an open social network, third-party developers can create their own. Here is a <a href="https://atproto.com/community/projects#bridges">list</a> of some of the existing third-party projects.</p>

<p>Although it can seem overwhelming — especially for those of us at small companies where identity and access management is just one of the many hats we wear — employee onboarding in Google Workspace can be a breeze, even if you’re not a tech guru. The key is knowing where to start.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll walk you through the step-by-step process of setting up new employee accounts, configuring email, and granting access to essential apps within Google Workspace. We’ll also cover common challenges and provide tips for simplifying the process, including how to <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">leverage tools like YeshID to make things even smoother</a>.</p>
 Step 1: Set Up a New Employee Account 
<p>The first step in onboarding a new employee is to set up a new employee account in Google Workspace. It’s worth noting here that we are assuming you have Google Super Admin access, which is a prerequisite for completing the tasks below.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It’s a good idea to do this a couple of days before the employee’s start date to ensure that other applications can be provisioned smoothly. Here are some things to keep in mind:</p>
 
 Email address: By creating a Google Workspace account, you’re giving the employee an identity within your company, which is centered around their email address. 
 Password management: You’ll need to create a password for them, which you should send them and save so they can access their account on the first day. 
 Security: To enhance security, force the new employee to change their password upon the first login and strongly consider <a href="https://youtu.be/uVStgdfyJx0">enabling two-factor authentication (2FA)</a>. This will grant them access to Google systems like Calendar, Mail, and more. 
 
 Step 2: Grant Access to Google Groups and Organizations 
<p>Next, ensure that the new employee has access to the right email groups and is placed in the appropriate organizational units, or orgs, within Google Workspace. While this process may be manual, you can often use the profile of another user with a similar role as a reference to determine which groups and orgs to assign.</p>
<p></p>
 Step 3: Provide Access to Birthright Apps 
<p>Birthright apps are the applications that every employee should have access to, such as Slack, documentation systems (e.g., Notion or Confluence), and HR applications. To grant access to these apps:</p>
 
 Go into each application and provide access to the new email address you created for the employee. 
 Sometimes, you may need to coordinate with other departments to ensure access is granted appropriately. 
 
 Step 4: Track Access and Compliance 
<p>Whether you handle app provisioning yourself or someone else does it, it’s crucial to keep track of the apps you’ve granted access to for three key reasons:</p>
 
 Offboarding: When an employee leaves the company, you can easily revoke their access to applications.&nbsp; 
 Cost control: Tracking app access helps you manage licenses efficiently, saving your company money. 
 Compliance: Compliance requirements often demand proof of access, so having a record is essential. 
 
<p>Many companies without a full HR or IT department might track this information in a spreadsheet or company wiki that needs to be manually updated and kept private. It’s a lot to manage, but by implementing these best practices today, you set yourself up for success tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>
 Simplify Onboarding with YeshID 
<p>There are options that don’t involve doing all of this manually: GAM, Bettercloud, Okta, and Ping are a few. The problem though is that for most small businesses, these products are overkill. They are expensive and time-consuming to implement — especially when what you really need is just to get people to work using solid best practices, not advanced technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>YeshID Onboard provides an option for smaller companies that have embarked on their identity and access management journeys but aren’t in a place yet where they need a very technical (or expensive) solution. We provide a quick and easy way to streamline onboarding today while setting up the foundational best practices we outlined in this guide. Benefits include:</p>
 
 Schedule onboarding: YeshID allows you to schedule onboarding tasks. An email is automatically sent to the user on their start date, and their account is provisioned immediately to kickstart the application license process. 
 Create templates for departments: Create templates for different departments to automate the assignment of groups and orgs, reducing manual work. 
 Implement passwordless security: Enhance security by utilizing YeshID’s passwordless authentication method. 
 Manage application provisioning: Manage the application provisioning process through YeshID’s task management system. Assign administrators for each application, and they’ll receive notifications for when to provision access. 
 Compliance management: YeshID serves as a central source of truth for access management, making it easy to demonstrate compliance when needed. 
 
<p>Streamlining employee onboarding in Google Workspace doesn’t have to be a daunting task. With the right approach and tools like YeshID Onboard, you can efficiently manage the process and ensure that new employees have the access they need from day one.</p>

  <p>October 10, 2023 Update: By request of our customers, we're now sharing a sample PowerShell script that we've been using at Microsoft to replace Azure AD naming in documentation or content. Get the <a title="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/how-to-rename-azure-ad" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/how-to-rename-azure-ad">Azure AD rename code sample on Microsoft Learn</a> and edit it according to your needs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The rename of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to Microsoft Entra ID is now rolling across content and product experiences from Microsoft, as per the implementation timeline outlined in the <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/azure-ad-is-becoming-microsoft-entra-id/ba-p/2520436">Azure AD rename announcement on July 11th</a>. We expect the majority of text updates to be completed by mid-November of this year, and updates for on-premises software to be completed in 2024. Partners, analysts, and influencers have also started using the Microsoft Entra ID name in place of Azure AD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with the new product name and the icon appearing in Microsoft Azure, Azure Marketplace, Microsoft 365, and Microsoft Security admin centers, you’ll also see the service plan (SKU) display names update to Microsoft Entra ID Free, Microsoft Entra ID P1, and Microsoft Entra ID P2 on October 1, 2023.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As previously announced, this is just a new name, with no impact on deployments or daily work, and no changes to capabilities, licensing, terms of service, or support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m grateful for the feedback that we’ve received from many of you – our customers and partners throughout this transition. If you are considering an update to your own documentation or experiences to reflect the Microsoft Entra naming, we now have created resources to assist you. I’ll also clarify more details about the rename based on questions from this community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Resources for updating the Azure AD name in your content 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that the name change is rolling out widely, your organization may be interested in updating the Azure AD name accurately in documentation or content. We’re now sharing our internal best practices, tools, and tips in the docs article <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/how-to-rename-azure-ad">“How to rename Azure AD” on Microsoft Learn</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This "how-to” playbook is designed to help you change the name as needed across your organization’s content. It includes best practices for finding and updating Azure AD text strings and graphic icons. Another important reference is <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/new-name">"New name for Azure Active Directory" on Microsoft Learn</a>, which includes a style guide, a comprehensive glossary of updated product and feature naming, the short list of exceptions to the rename, downloads of the new product icons, and a timeline for key milestones for Microsoft implementation of the name change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope it helps you scope and plan your updates in accordance with your own processes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, let’s address some questions from the community:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Yes, admins can use the Azure portal to manage Microsoft Entra ID 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll continue to support the ability to manage Microsoft Entra ID in the Azure portal for customers who prefer Azure portal or only need a subset of Microsoft Entra capabilities, similar to identity experiences available in the Microsoft 365 admin center. The navigation changes in the Azure portal are minimal, and we’ll continue the messages that Microsoft Entra ID is formerly known as Azure AD for an extended time to ensure discoverability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We encourage all customers to explore the comprehensive <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Entra admin center</a> but will maintain the ability to manage relevant identity experiences within the existing portals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Yes, on-premises identities are still supported with Microsoft Entra ID 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll continue to support and enhance <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/identity-and-access">Windows Server Active Directory</a> for on-premises identity and access management and the connection to Azure and other clouds, as many organizations continue to rely on this solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The name for Active Directory remains unchanged. Based on extensive feedback we've received about Microsoft Entra ID as the new name for Azure Active Directory, for many customers, the rename will help to better differentiate between the on-premises (Active Directory) and multicloud identity (Microsoft Entra ID) solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 No, identity developer and devops experiences aren't being renamed 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make the transition seamless, all existing login URLs, APIs, PowerShell cmdlets, and Microsoft Authentication Libraries (MSAL) stay the same, as do developer experiences and tooling. See details at: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/new-name#whats-changing-for-identity-developer-and-devops-experience">What's changing for identity developer and devops experience? - Microsoft Entra | Microsoft Learn</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many technical components either have low visibility to customers (for example, sign-in URLs), or usually aren't branded, like APIs. For example, here’s how the API for Microsoft Entra Conditional Access (formerly Azure AD Conditional Access) shows up in Microsoft Graph:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>{&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; "conditions": {"@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.conditionalAccessConditionSet"},&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; "createdDateTime": "String (timestamp)",&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; "displayName": "String",&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; "grantControls": {"@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.conditionalAccessGrantControls"},&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; "id": "String (identifier)",&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; "modifiedDateTime": "String (timestamp)",&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; "sessionControls": {"@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.conditionalAccessSessionControls"},&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; "state": "string"&nbsp;</p>
<p>}&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/conditionalaccesspolicy?view=graph-rest-1.0">conditionalAccessPolicy resource type - Microsoft Graph v1.0 | Microsoft Learn</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 No, Azure AD PowerShell cmdlets are not being renamed. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, we offer two PowerShell modules for administering identity tasks: the Azure AD PowerShell module, which is planned for deprecation in March 2024, and the Microsoft Graph PowerShell module.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Azure AD PowerShell for Graph module, “AzureAD” is in the name of almost all <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/azuread/?view=azureadps-2.0">Azure AD cmdlets</a>. These won’t be changing, and you can continue to use these same cmdlets now that the official product name is Microsoft Entra ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June, my colleague Kristopher Bash from the Microsoft Graph team published an <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/important-azure-ad-graph-retirement-and-powershell-module/ba-p/3848270">update on the Azure AD Graph retirement and Azure AD PowerShell module deprecation</a>. Both are on multi-year retirement cycles to allow for customer migration to Microsoft Graph technologies, and Kristopher’s article clarifies the timing and customer resources, plus our commitment to work with you during the migration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The deprecation date for Azure AD PowerShell is planned for March 30, 2024. It will continue to work after that date, but support will be limited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We encourage you to start trying Microsoft Graph PowerShell as the recommended module for interacting with Microsoft Entra ID in the future. Based on your feedback, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/active-directory/migration-faq?view=azureadps-2.0#what-is-microsoft-doing-about-the-gaps-in-functionality-between-azure-ad-and-microsoft-graph-powershell-modules">we’re continuing to add functionality for managing Microsoft Entra ID with Microsoft Graph PowerShell</a> to ensure a seamless transition when you decide to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/microsoftgraph/migration-steps?view=graph-powershell-1.0">migrate</a> from Azure AD PowerShell to Microsoft Graph PowerShell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Yes, Microsoft continues to support Azure AD B2C 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As announced previously, the name Azure AD B2C is not changing, nor is our commitment to the service and our customers. The service level agreement for Azure AD B2C remains unchanged, and we’ll continue investments to ensure security, availability, and reliability in both <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/overview">Azure AD B2C</a>, as well as our next-generation solution for external identities, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/customers/overview-customers-ciam">Microsoft Entra External ID</a>, now in public preview. You can learn more about getting started with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/customers/quickstart-trial-setup">External ID</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/overview">Azure AD B2C</a> in our documentation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Focusing on secure access for everyone, everywhere 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The renaming of Azure AD represents a shift in how the identity and access management landscape has changed over time. You’ve gone from managing identities behind a firewall to fully enabling a complex fabric of trusted interactions so people can securely collaborate and be productive, while being increasingly under threat from attackers. Traditional identity and access management services aren’t enough anymore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe the Microsoft Entra ID name more accurately represents the multicloud and multiplatform functionality of the product, alleviates any confusion with the on-premises identity solution Active Directory, and creates a path to deliver a simpler way to protect every identity and secure every access point as we expand the Microsoft Entra identity and network access portfolio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An example of where the family name of Microsoft Entra helps clarify functionality is Microsoft Entra <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview">Conditional Access</a> (formerly Azure AD Conditional Access). Conditional Access policies can now be consistently enforced and shared across identity and new security service edge (SSE) products:&nbsp; <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-internet-access">Microsoft Entra Internet Access</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-private-access">Microsoft Entra Private Access</a>. With <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/global-secure-access/concept-universal-conditional-access">controls expanding to network traffic</a> — not just cloud applications — and policies based on traffic profiles — not just applications or actions — this cross-product feature now uses the unified identity and network access name: Microsoft Entra.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll continue to innovate and expand our portfolio as digital environments expand, and access points become more diverse, so our customers can protect any access point with a holistic solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, all you need to remember is that the most comprehensive approach for securing access is <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-entra-pricing">Microsoft Entra</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>“Organisation identity is a parallel and just as valuable identity type as individual identity.”</p></blockquote>
<p>At IDM Europe 2023 in October Simon Wood, Ubisecure CEO, presented the facet of identity management that’s often overlooked – Organisational Identity. In this session overview, we delve into the importance of organisation identity, its impact, and how it’s poised to transform the digital landscape. Alternatively, watch the full 15-minute presentation in the video below.</p>
<p></p>
 The Significance of Organisational Identity 
<p>Individual identity has thus far taken the forefront in discussions about digital security. However, organisation identity is an equally valuable aspect of the broader identity landscape. To grasp this concept, it’s crucial to understand what organisational identity encompasses.</p>
 Defining Organisational Identity 
<p>Organisations come in various forms and structures, from social groups and families to contractual entities and legal corporations. Just as there are assurance levels associated with individual identities, the same holds true for organisation identities, ranging from low to high assurance levels. This is where the distinction between low assurance organisation identities, such as social groups, and high assurance ones, like legal entities, becomes evident.</p>
<p></p>
 Case Studies: The Good, The Bad, The Ugly 
<p>The significance of organisation identity is illustrated through a series of case studies.</p>
 The Good: 
<p>In an example from Ubisecure’s <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/delegated-id-success-story-finnish-government.pdf" title="Finnish government case study">Finnish government case study</a>, the combination of individual and organisational identities resulted in remarkable cost savings. By allowing organisation identities to be represented by highly assured individuals, the Tax Office achieved cost savings of 99%. This real-world case shows how organisation identity can lead to substantial financial benefits.</p>
 The Bad: 
<p>The vulnerability of organisation identity became apparent when Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter (or X as it’s known this week) led to the removal of verified organisation accounts. Fake accounts naturally emerged. Due to a tweet from a fake Eli Lilly account claiming false information, Eli Lilly saw a &gt;4% drop in the stock price.</p>
 The Ugly: 
<p>The 2008 financial crisis was partly driven by the complex world of collateralised debt obligations (CDOs). The interconnection of organisations within this financial web led to a catastrophic market collapse when triggered, serving as a stark reminder of the importance of transparent and accountable organisation identity in complex financial ecosystems.</p>
 Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) – A Key to Organisation Identity? 
<p>The Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) plays a central role in organisation identity. Created in response to the 2008 financial crisis by the Financial Stability Board, the LEI identifies legal entities and their ownership structures. As a globally recognised, highly assured organisation identity, the G20 and World Trade Organisation (WTO) support the LEI as a solution to the complexities of modern financial markets.</p>
 The Road to Widespread LEI Adoption 
<p>The adoption of the LEI is steadily growing, with a target of 20 million LEIs by 2027 set by the G20. This critical mass will promote its use across various industries and use cases. Several driving forces are pushing for the broader adoption of organisation identities, including the WTO’s focus on cross-border digital payments, changing regulations for electronic trade documents, and the integration of LEIs into financial transactions.</p>
 The Future of Digital Identity: Context Matters 
<p>Ubisecure’s vision for the future of digital identity management involves connecting highly assured organisation identities with strongly authenticated individual identities. This synergy allows us to understand who an individual is, whom they represent, and the rights and responsibilities associated with different contexts. The context in which identity operates is paramount, as it determines what an individual or organisation can do within a specific setting.</p>
<p>This session sheds light on the growing trend towards effective organisation identity and the critical role it plays in financial markets, security, and digital transactions. As we look to the future of digital identity management, the synergy between individual and organisation identities becomes increasingly vital.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Joerg Resch</a></p><p>There are rare individuals who carve out spaces of brilliance wherever they tread. Vittorio Bertocci was one of those souls; a luminary whose impact resonated not only in the corridors of professional seminars but in the hearts of those fortunate to know him personally. Today, we mourn the loss of Vittorio, who, after a fierce battle with cancer, left a void that words alone cannot fill.</p>
<p>The European Identity &amp; Cloud Conference (EIC) was one of the many platforms where Vittorio shone brightly. With every keynote he delivered, his fervor for the Digital ID realm was palpable. He was not just a speaker who would deliver a rehearsed lecture. No, Vittorio was an artist, painting vivid tapestries of innovation, possibilities, and a future filled with secure digital identities.</p>
<p>Our whole team at KuppingerCole was privy to his genius, but more importantly, to his spirit. Every collaboration was a fusion of knowledge, passion, and a genuine desire to make a difference. That's who Vittorio was—a catalyst for change, a beacon for progress.</p>
<p>On a personal note, my friendship with Vittorio was one of those blessings. His laughter was infectious, his counsel invaluable, and his presence reassuring. In a world that often felt like an echo chamber of repetitive ideas, Vittorio’s voice was distinct—an Italian melody of originality and deep insight. Our conversations, be it on the latest trends in digital identity or simply recounting anecdotes from his home in Genova, were treasures.</p>
<p>But what truly made Vittorio stand out was his ability to connect on a human level. He wasn't just a technical maestro. He was compassionate, understanding, and had this uncanny knack to make anyone feel seen and heard. In the midst of conferences bustling with professionals, it was not uncommon to see Vittorio in deep conversation with a newcomer, instilling confidence and sharing wisdom.</p>
<p>The sorrow we feel is deep, not just as friends who will miss those enlightening chats over coffee but as a member of the Digital ID community. We've lost a guiding star. Vittorio's innovations weren't just about the next best product or solution; they were about creating a world where our digital selves were protected, honored, and seamlessly integrated into our real lives. His visions for the future were grand, yet grounded in an intimate understanding of the present.</p>
<p>Cancer may have taken Vittorio from us, but his legacy remains indelible. Every keynote, every workshop, every casual chat at the conference coffee stand is a testament to the man who believed in a digitally secure future and poured his soul into making it a reality.</p>
<p>It's often said that the brightest stars burn half as long, and perhaps that's true. Vittorio's light shone intensely, illuminating paths, sparking ideas, and warming hearts. In his absence, it's up to us to ensure that the trails he blazed are not left in darkness. Let's honor him by being torchbearers of his vision, and by embodying the same passion, dedication, and warmth that Vittorio exuded every day.</p>
<p>For now, as we grapple with this profound loss, let's remember Vittorio for the force of nature he was. Let's recount stories that made us laugh, lessons that spurred us forward, and moments when his sheer presence made everything seem right.</p>
<p>To Vittorio - the maestro, the mentor, the friend. Your journey may have ended, but your symphony plays on in the hearts and minds of everyone you touched.</p>
<p>Rest in peace, dear friend. You are deeply missed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Let`s keep on celebrating the enduring impact of Vittorio Bertocci's work. Therefore, we are making all of Vittorio’s talks at the European Identity and Cloud Conference publicly available. Watch them, they are worth every single minute.</p>

<p>How do you create a community around a protocol?</p><p>That was the challenge Daniel Norman, developer advocate for <a href="https://ipfs.tech/">IPFS</a>, faced. Daniel was not new to the field. Before working for Protocol Labs, he was a developer advocate at Prisma and a Web3 engineer at Aragon. Prior to entering the P2P and distributed systems space, Daniel worked in SaSS and, therefore, was aware of the questions and challenges Web2 developers would face transitioning into Web3. </p><p>He needed to provide resources to developers so they could be successful. These resources had to be engaging and scalable, where developers could learn key concepts and achieve something. Maybe they spin up an app or install IPFS on their computer - whatever it is, they must walk away with a sense of accomplishment.</p> Building a Demo App <p>With this in mind, Daniel created a <a href="https://github.com/libp2p/universal-connectivity">demo chat app</a> that utilized <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a>. Libp2p provides the foundational networking infrastructure and protocols that enable IPFS nodes to communicate, discover each other, and form a decentralized and resilient network for sharing and distributing content. A chat demo is the perfect project for explaining how IPFS works when sending information to other nodes in the network.</p><p>The demo was beginner-friendly and implemented the most <a href="https://connectivity.libp2p.io/">novel transport protocols</a> at the time compared to other example apps. Libp2p is used in many ecosystems beyond IPFS, including Ethereum, Filecoin, Cosmos, and Polkadot, so developers who might have been familiar with another ecosystem were able to transition nicely into IPFS through this exercise. As a result, the demo was a successful tool for both Web2 and Web3 devs alike. </p> Awesome IPFS <p>Today's IPFS ecosystem is vast, with hundreds of projects building on the protocol. And like any good ecosystem, it needs cultivating. Daniel views himself as a gardener in the IPFS ecosystem - there to keep it healthy and thriving. He does this through demos, as previously mentioned, and through shooting videos, hosting events, building relationships, and developing written resources. </p><p>One of those written resources is <a href="https://awesome.ipfs.tech/?utm_content=265643364&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;hss_channel=tw-3030006159">Awesome IPFS</a>. Awesome IPFS is a community-generated collection of projects, tools, implementations, services, platforms, and more, all built on the IPFS protocol. Daniel is one of the key maintainers (another is Fission's CEO and Founder, Boris Mann!) and helps ensure that the repo is up-to-date. </p>   Challenges in Cultivating a Community <p>While these resources are great for introducing developers to IPFS, they take time and energy to maintain. For example, inactive projects must be removed from the list and dependencies monitored so that the IPFS Awesome resource remains useful. </p><p>There need to be fair guidelines for platforming and showcasing projects so that both existing and new projects get fair and equal access to marketing opportunities. </p><p>Working with multiple companies, organizations, and people is also key, as diversity only strengthens the ecosystem. It's important that everyone feels heard and empowered to contribute.</p> Key Takeaways <p>If you're interested in building a community around your tech product, here are some key tips that Daniel has learned over the years:</p>  Be honest and transparent. Don't over-promise or mislead interested parties.  Avoid too much technical jargon. People don't have the time or energy to sort through all of that when first being introduced to your project.  Don't create a closed community. Ensure everyone feels welcome and make contributing and asking questions easy and enjoyable.  Clearly communicate, especially in your writing. Most people are not native English speakers, so keep your writing concise and accessible.  <p>Learn more about IPFS by joining the <a href="https://discord.gg/ipfs">IPFS Discord</a> community. Heading to Istanbul for LabWeek23 or Devconnect? Don't miss <a href="https://istanbul2023.ipfsconnect.org/">IPFS Connect</a>, an all-day event filled with lightning talks, presentations, workshops, and more led by experienced builders.</p><p>And don't forget to follow <a href="https://twitter.com/daniel2color">Daniel</a> for exciting resources and news from the IPFS ecosystem.</p>

<p>MGM Resorts recently found itself in the midst of a major cybersecurity incident that not only crippled its operations but also exposed sensitive customer data. The sophisticated attack orchestrated by a group known as Scattered Spider employed social engineering to the IT department to reset credentials. The attackers then gained access to the SSO, raised their identity credentials to super user level and then systematically got into other systems.</p> 
<p>The cyberattack cost MGM over $100 million according to its <a href="http://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/789570/000119312523251667/d461062d8k.htm">FORM 8-K filing</a> with the SEC.</p> 
<p>While the attack chain involved multiple steps, exploiting several points of failure, the initial attack vector was low tech and all too common. We look at what happened and how organizations can protect themselves from these increasingly prevalent attacks.</p> 
 Anatomy of the Attack: Unraveling Scattered Spider's Web  
<p>On September 11, MGM Resorts announced a "cybersecurity issue" affecting its systems, prompting a shutdown to protect data integrity. Reports surfaced that essential services, from hotel room access to slot machines, were offline, leading to resort staff shifting to manual processes.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It wasn't until October 5 that the true extent of the breach came to light. Personally identifiable&nbsp; information (PII), had been compromised. This same information was encrypted and a ransomware demand was made.</p> 
<p>Scattered Spider, the group claiming responsibility (the same group involved in breaching Clorox), demonstrated a proficiency in social engineering, specializing in voice phishing, or "vishing" — exploiting human vulnerability through convincing phone calls. The hackers allegedly gained access to MGM's systems by impersonating an employee. Utilizing publicly available information found on LinkedIn and other social platforms, they targeted the IT help desk, manipulating their way into obtaining credentials. The attackers utilized ransomware-as-a-service to encrypt MGM's data.</p> 
<p></p> 
 Key Lessons  
<p>This incident underscores the vulnerability of even well-established organizations to social engineering and identity-related attacks. Most IT services desks/help desks are short-staffed, and dealing with large volumes of calls, many of which are related to password or MFA issues. In the case of MGM Resorts, the attackers exploited human nature and publicly available information to trick IT service desk personnel and gain the credentials necessary to simply login as a legitimate employee. From there they were able to breach multiple systems and gain command and control of the entire organization.</p> 
 Identity Assurance for the Entire Identity Lifecycle  
<p>Human nature will always be the weakest point in any system — the 2023 Verizon DBIR found the human element to be a factor in 74% of all breaches. The MGM attack underscores the need for a comprehensive <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-identity-assurance">Identity Assurance</a> approach that secures the modern user lifecycle and addresses the Achilles heel of current authentication and identity verification processes. Organizations need to ensure they can trust that somebody is who they claim to be at all times — when that call to the service desk comes through, the staff responding must be absolutely certain that the person they are speaking to is the legitimate holder of that identity. If, for example, they request access through a new device or credential reset, there must be a secure, efficient way to do so.</p> 
<p>A complete Identity Assurance approach unites strong passkey-based authentication, continuous risk monitoring and intelligent identity verification into a comprehensive solution.&nbsp;</p> 
 Passwordless Authentication  
<p>Deploying passwordless, phishing resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds a crucial layer of security. Eliminating traditional passwords and adopting <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/passwordless-security-guide">passwordless authentication methods</a>, such as biometrics, security tokens, or mobile-based authentication, could have thwarted the MGM attackers. Passwords are often the weakest link, and removing them from the equation reduces the risk of unauthorized access.</p> 
 Continuous Risk Monitoring  
<p>Threat vectors and risk levels change constantly. Risk signals and telemetry from a broad variety of sources must be continuously monitored and used to trigger appropriate authentication and verification actions. These should include various device and browser signals, user behavior anomalies and information from the broader security ecosystem.</p> 
 Identity Verification  
<p>Simply put, identity verification helps ensure that someone is who they say they are at all times. It can eliminate many of the social engineering tactics currently being used. It should meet the unique needs of the population in question whether workforce or consumer. This requires a multi-verification approach that includes but is not limited to AI, chat, video, face recognition and other cutting-edge technologies to create a seamless and secure method of confirming the individuals’ identities — and re-verifying them at critical moments in time. This would eliminate the vishing attack vector which is based on implied and unreliable trust without a specific and comprehensive verification methodology.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here’s an example of intelligent identity verification in action:</p> 
 
  
   
   
   
  
  
 Protecting Against Helpdesk Social Engineering and Other Identity Attacks  
<p>The MGM Resorts cyber incident serves as a stark reminder that no organization is immune to cyber threats, regardless of its size or industry. As cybercriminals continue to evolve their tactics, it is imperative for businesses to stay ahead by implementing advanced security measures. Identity verification and passwordless authentication can stand as formidable defense against social engineering and other identity-related attacks, providing a robust protection for organizations, their systems, and their data. <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform">HYPR Identity Assurance</a> protects the entire lifecycle and includes HYPR Affirm, the only <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-affirm-identity-verification">identity verification solution</a> designed specifically for the workforce. Affirm uses a multitude of signals including phone verification, document verification, a video chat, and face recognition to make help desk social engineering unviable for hackers.

				  Verifiable credentials allow you to cryptographically verify who issued information, and they allow you to know if that information has been tampered with. But what does this mean in a practical sense?  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Recently our team was asked a question that we encounter, in different forms, all the time: “Well, what can we do with verifiable credentials?” Or, “Why would we want them?” The answer is so broad that we, typically, narrow it down by industry and offer some examples that make sense for that particular customer.</p>
<p>But really the answer is quite simple:</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials allow you to cryptographically verify who issued data, and they allow you to know if that data has been changed or tampered with.</p>
<p>In practical terms this means that, assuming the data has not been changed, you can trust the data as much as you trust the source. Once you have data that you know has not been altered, from a source you trust, the possibilities are close to endless, and our team had some fun contributing a — by no means exhaustive — list of examples of how you can use this technology across industries.</p>
 In the Public Sector 
<p>Replace your passwords with credentials<br>Unlike passwords, credentials cannot be lost, stolen, or copied, and don’t require your employees to remember them.</p>
<p>Access management<br>Both physical and digital access management can be done through credentials for enhanced security — and unlike access cards, credentials cannot be lost, stolen, or copied.</p>
<p>Manage social and welfare programs<br>By issuing each citizen a credential you can reduce fraud in aid / benefits applications.</p>
<p>Employment authorization<br>Ensure that applicants are eligible to work.</p>
<p>Manage travel<br>Verifiable credentials can replace passports and offer a faster, more secure way to cross borders.</p>
<p>Replace driver’s licenses<br>These licenses would be impossible to fake and offer a fast way to provide only the identity information necessary when needed.</p>
<p>Replace important personal documents<br>Marriage licenses, death certificates, social security information could all be digitized and more secure than a paper document that can be lost or damaged.</p>
<p>Proof of residency<br>By using credentials you could automate parts of the residency process and quickly verify status.</p>
<p>First responder credentials<br>Quickly ensure only authorized personnel are allowed access to emergency areas.</p>
<p>Replacement permits<br>Digitizing permits would speed up the process for checking that they are up to date and could notify holders when they are about to expire and need to be renewed.</p>
<p>Professional licenses<br>Know for certain that your doctor or lawyer is licensed, and allow the end customer to verify their credentials for themselves.</p>
<p>Certifications<br>Keep your certifications up to date and easily share them, as opposed to keeping them safe in a box somewhere.</p>
<p>Manage age restricted substances<br>By sharing identification through a credential you can be more confident that only people that are old enough are buying restricted products.</p>
 Healthcare 
<p>Access management<br>Better track who has access to what areas / controlled substances.</p>
<p>Patient health data<br>Remove the need for contacting a third party for medical history, have patients hold it themselves securely on a credential or be able to provide consent for other providers to access it.</p>
<p>Store insurance information<br>No more paper cards that can be lost or forgotten; instead, hold quickly transferable information in a credential.</p>
<p>Reduce liability<br>No more storing private patient information at the hospital, making it a target for bad actors. All personal identifying data should be stored with the patient, removing the need for storing or deleting data in a regulatory compliant way.</p>
<p>Enhance security<br>Verifiable credentials will let you know if their information has been copied, meaning even if they are obtained by bad actors they cannot use them without the system knowing and denying access.</p>
<p>Data sharing<br>The patient can choose to securely share only the data they deem necessary with the healthcare provider.</p>
 Travel and hospitality 
<p>Use a Digital Travel Credential<br>Scan and transform your passport into a verifiable credential (with liveness and biometric assurance) for check in and border crossing.</p>
<p>Manage check-in<br>Customers can pre fill out any information needed for their stay, recurring only a quick scan at the front desk to check in at a hotel or potentially just issuing digital room keys without a check in.</p>
<p>Digital room keys<br>Securely issue and revoke room keys directly to customers, reducing time spent at the front desk.</p>
<p>Store tickets on a credential<br>You can manage your airport experience through a credential, storing boarding pass info, passport info, and visa details in a way that is easily shareable.</p>
<p>Manage loyalty programs<br>Verified loyalty program holders can be offered special deals, quick and easy lounge access and more.</p>
<p>Reduce fraud<br>Credentials will immediately alert you if any information presented is fraudulent.</p>
<p>Reduce liability<br>Remove the need to store any customer information locally, which also removes the need to delete it in a regulatory compliant way.</p>
<p>Reduce the stress of travel<br>When traveling is easy and everything a traveler needs is accessible through one place on their phone they are more likely to do it more.</p>
<p>Reduce lines<br>A quick scan keeps the line moving much faster than a person checking every ID and document.</p>
 Financial services 
<p>Reduce fraud<br>Use verifiable credentials for frictionless, mutual authentication before any data is shared. A bank is able to cryptographically authenticate that it is interacting with a real account holder, and the account holder is able to authenticate that he or she is interacting with their bank.</p>
<p>Reuse KYC information<br>Credentials can be configured to store the information required for more complex financial transactions and a KYC credential is a way for a bank or its partners to reuse and share this information. If a third party trusts the original bank’s KYC process, they can trust the veracity of the KYC credential.</p>
<p>Provide more secure customer access<br>The customer can securely access their account without a username or password.</p>
<p>Use as a credit card<br>Credit card information can be put into a verifiable credential; virtual CC numbers can be used; temporary cards for one-time use can be issued as a credential.</p>
<p>Reduce the time necessary for larger transactions<br>Credentials remove the need to contact third parties to verify funds.</p>
<p>Data sharing<br>Know that any data shared with or between your team can be trusted.</p>
<p>Reduce liability<br>The customer can choose to disclose only the information necessary for a transaction, removing the need to securely store or delete customer information.</p>
 Retail 
<p>Track the origins of products<br>A verifiable credential can track a product back to who created it and let you know if something is a knock-off.</p>
<p>Provide better customer retention programs<br>Customer credentials allow you to better know who is shopping with you or visiting your store.</p>
<p>Employee management<br>Easily set which employees can access certain areas, manage payroll, or time clocks.</p>
<p>Mitigate chargeback fraud<br>Require pre-authorization of payments through verifiable credentials</p>
<p>Reduce liability<br>No need to store customer personal data in a regulatory compliant way, they will store it locally on their credential.</p>
 Education 
<p>Student awards and certificates<br>Quickly issue and securely store any awards a student receives from the school.</p>
<p>Student access management<br>Easily issue or revoke access to buildings or digital assets.</p>
<p>Diplomas<br>Issue verifiable certificates of completion that can be quickly shared with prospective employers, removing the need to contact the school.</p>
<p>School issued permits<br>Quickly issue and check parking permits, bike permits, and residential permits etc.</p>
<p>Reduce liability<br>Unlike passwords or keys these credentials can’t be misplaced, stolen, or copied, so you can be more confident that only students have access to school areas.</p>
<p>Reduce student stress<br>You can store all the classes a student has completed on a credential, streamlining the process for knowing which classes they are eligible to take next.</p>
<p>Faster data sharing<br>All the data a student accumulates through the education process can be stored on one credential, removing the need to look back through paper records.</p>
<p>As you can see this list very quickly stretches on — and we only briefly covered 6 industries! To oversimplify, if you would like to be able to immediately act on your data, reduce the liability of storing customer information, and have more confidence in your security, it may be time to look into verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>If you’re on the fence, or have questions about the technology our team would be happy to talk you through some options applicable to your organization. <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">Get in touch here.</a></p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>What is generative AI? This week Russ Cohn, from IDVerse has joined us to discuss generative AI and deepfakes and the threat this imposes on businesses and consumers for their digital identities. Stay tuned to find out more.</p>
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thank you for joining a new episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. Artificial Intelligence, in particular, Generative Artificial Intelligence is a topic that has been, I believe on most of our radars in the last 12 months, particularly. And there are amazing things going on. But also, we know that the bad guys are also using those tools. And one of those is related to deepfakes that are being used to cheat the identity verification system having existing until now.</p>
<p>So, to see how we are going to solve those problems in identity verification, these newer problems, we have a special guest today who is Russ Cohn. He is the go-to market for IDVerse, a company which provides online identification technology for businesses in the digital economy.</p>
<p>Russ has spent more than 20 years scaling businesses of all sizes by delivering successful growth strategies across the UK, EMEA, and US markets, within fast-paced and high-growth online media, fraud, identity, SaaS, e-commerce, and data-driven technology solutions. His strong tech knowledge is coupled with deep operational and commercial experience building things with SaaS, advertising and marketing technology driven revenue models.</p>
<p>Hello, Russ.</p>
<p>Russ Cohn: Hello, Oscar. How are you?</p>
<p>Oscar: Very good. Happy to have you here.</p>
<p>Russ: Thank you. Very glad to be here.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic. It’s great to have you here. And we’ll talk about the deepfakes and how the newest practices in identity verification are solving these problems. So, let’s start, let’s talk about digital identity, Russ.</p>
<p>So first of all, I would like to hear a bit more about yourself, your story. Tell us about yourself and your journey to the world of identity.</p>
<p>Russ: Absolutely. I am fairly new to identity. I’ve only really started in the industry probably just over three years ago. I was the first international employee of OCR Labs, which is we recently rebranded to IDVerse, but I joined about three years ago. We’ve since then built the international team to over half the company, and we continue to grow in EMEA and the US.</p>
<p>As a background, I’m a marketer, a commercial leader, investor. I’ve spent probably over 20 years in technology-driven companies of all sizes. And I was lucky enough to join Google very early on, and there were 20 people in the UK, and 600 people around the world. And I grew up with them a little bit, and I left there with 65,000 people. So, I’ve got a fairly good experience at scanning companies and have invested and advised companies since then.</p>
<p>I’m now, as I said at IDVerse. And I’m focused on the go-to market. So, helping them globally, to take our products and execute them in the best possible areas and help our customers with the most cutting-edge technology to drive identity verification, make it effortless. Obviously, through the use of our sophisticated technologies and techniques, including Generative AI.</p>
<p>I’m excited about the opportunity for identity verification, as the need for verified trusted identities has grown exponentially, globally, really, since the pandemic. And with digital growing at such a phenomenal rate as well, we’re now living in a mobile-first world, and we need the right kind of identity verification to support that growth.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed. So, let’s go to some basics. For someone who has heard about that term, Generative AI and still is not so clear what it is, particularly. Could you tell us what is that? What is Generative AI?</p>
<p>Russ: Yeah, sure, I think, you know, everybody is talking about ChatGPT and Bard and it’s brought these techniques, the AI techniques to the public, and we can’t get enough of them. But everyone is using ChatGPT and Bard, etc to learn more, do their jobs better, find new facts. It’s pretty addictive and very, very useful but still at the at the fairly early stage.</p>
<p>So Generative AI, short for Generative Artificial Intelligence refers to a class of artificial intelligence systems and techniques that focus on generating new content or data rather than simply recognising patterns or making decisions based on existing data. Now these systems are designed to create original content that resembles human created data such as images, music, texts, videos, and more.</p>
<p>I use Spotify extensively. I’m sure most people do. And I’ve got an AI system on there now a couple months ago that’s going through my music catalogue in my background and choosing the right music based on my tastes. Generative AI models are generally trained on large datasets, and they learn to understand the underlying patterns and structures within the data.</p>
<p>So once trained, they can produce new examples that are similar to the data they were exposed to during their training. These models are capable of generating content that didn’t exist in the original dataset, making them a very powerful tool for creative tasks in content creation. Now at IDVerse, we’ve been doing Generative AI for a long time, probably since the start, seven or eight years ago.</p>
<p>And we use a technique, a very familiar technique called Generative Adversarial Networks or GANs, I’m sure a lot of your audience will be familiar with. Now GANs, just to go back to basics, consists of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator. These are trained together in a competitive manner. The generator creates the synthetic data, and the discriminative task is to differentiate between the real and the generated data.</p>
<p>So, the competition between the two networks leads to the generation of increasingly realistic content, which we see everywhere in videos, photos, documents, et cetera. Now, we’ve trained millions of synthetic and real documents and millions and millions of synthetic faces using these techniques. For us, just to be clear, we only use ethically sourced or fair source data for face biometric, particularly in the training. This refers to the facial recognition datasets collected and used in a manner that upholds strict ethical standards and respects individual’s privacy, consent and fairness.</p>
<p>Such data is obtained transparently with informed consent, minimal intrusion and efforts to mitigate bias. So, these measures ensure the responsible and equitable use of biometric technology. In the context of facial identity verification, training data refers to the specialised datasets of facial images used to train the machine learning algorithm, or deep neural networks that are responsible for recognising and verifying individual’s identities based on their facial features.</p>
<p>So that’s quite a mouthful. Hopefully, that gives you some context. But this is how we look at Generative AI in identity verification.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, thank you for that introduction. Of course, in one of the products of this type of Generative AI, in related tools are deepfakes that we are seeing more often, sometimes we saw that only for, like, say celebrities or famous people. But now, they can be used to attack me or to attack you, actually anybody right?</p>
<p>So, tell us how the use of deepfakes is a threat, a real threat for both consumers and businesses?</p>
<p>Russ: Yeah, absolutely. I think they are a massive threat as the rise of Gen AI, and you touched on it, &nbsp;fraudsters use the same if not better techniques than we do, or many companies do. And they are very, very good at surging ahead of these technologies and finding ways to create very realistic synthetic identities to both impersonate real people, as well as to create brand new identities of people who actually don’t even exist in real life.</p>
<p>And so, while that’s exciting as we talk about Web3 and avatars and these opportunities and possibilities, I think both consumers and businesses will continue to fall victim to many of the risks out there, unless measures are taken to prevent this.</p>
<p>Now, I just want to highlight a couple of examples of these like disinformation and fake news, right? So, creating videos of public figures, you can grab off Facebook or YouTube, and replicate those and make them do things that they never did. That can be exploited to spread false information.</p>
<p>This can incite conflicts and it can really manipulate public opinion. For us, we see and obviously, we’re very close to and care a lot about frauds and scams, so businesses and consumers of course, can – in the UK particularly we have a huge fraud problem. And we see a lot of deepfake base scams that can impersonate company executives, trusted individuals, they can deceive employees or the customers who can make them reveal sensitive information for financial transactions.</p>
<p>We’ve seen some of that just recently with MGM in the US in this recent breach. We don’t know it exactly, but we do know, I think somebody, an employee was actually targeted. This can cause you know I think like reputation damage of people, you know, politicians, businesses and people, fake videos and audio can be created. To endorse a product or not support it and that can create problems. And of course, the things we care about a lot of, identity theft, right?</p>
<p>And deepfakes can be used to impersonate individuals leading to identity theft. This may result in unauthorised access to personal data or systems. And of course, manipulation in financial markets, personal bank accounts, breaches of banks. So, this can cause big issues like privacy concerns, security threats and erosion of trust, through the wide use of this, and internal security problems for businesses, and privacy for people when they violated, and their identities are stolen.</p>
<p>So, it’s very, very important that we understand these threats and start to mitigate and create ways of helping to support and stop these practices.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, you already explained some cases in which these criminals are already targeting the identification system that has been existing in the last years. If we focus on these services that are today and have been protecting us or helping us in identifying people in the last years. So, what are these – the biggest pain points or the weaknesses that they are being attacked by these criminals?</p>
<p>Russ: Yeah, look, I mean, there’s a lot of weakness in existing systems, which can come across in the fact that vendors don’t disclose, for example, that they don’t use their own technology, and they can’t always deliver on their promises. So, I think a lack of global document coverage, old style techniques like templating exclusion, like racial bias, gender and age in these poorly designed systems can cause huge problems. And systems that don’t have the ability to understand where these attacks are coming from with these synthetic IDs.</p>
<p>We create all of our own tech in-house. So, we don’t use external vendors to drive our fully automated solutions. So, we feel pretty confident. But they are, as you mentioned, these legacy systems that we’ve relied on, that aren’t necessarily up to speed. We’ve seen, from a pain point of view, is badly trained human spotters in remote locations, for example. So, some people in the industry and vendors use those, this can cause slow response times, and they can’t keep up with the standards and the technology that’s being used to identify fraudulent documents.</p>
<p>And also, the biometrics of people that are not real. So, it’s very difficult for them to keep up. And then, we’ve seen an issue around a lot of bias or differentials in the natural bias that’s in previous ID systems designed by, traditionally older white male engineers. And that’s a problem because these biases are built into these systems. And the humans who are evaluating physical documents, depending on where and how and what can inflict their own biases on age, gender, and race as well.</p>
<p>Now, this can slow down experiences for customers, as they take a lot longer. And of course, they aren’t as accurate, you know, humans can’t scale. And so, technology can do a lot of that heavy lifting, and can solve a lot of that. And you can still have humans for critical tasks, but it’s important that you use technology to identify these gaps.</p>
<p>In fact, we ran a study a few months ago with an external testing company called BixeLabs of 1500 subjects, male, female and transgender, across eight regions in the world for our facial biometrics. And we came back with zero bias on either race or gender on the facial biometrics. So, it’s pretty important that businesses start to use, and people start to get comfortable with one of the strongest, probably the strongest biometric there is for lots of actions that we do take in our everyday lives, whether it’s on a personal or work basis.</p>
<p>And I think that the other things that are challenging for us in the identity space is we see a lot of unethically sourced based biometrics, right? And that can refer to the acquisition usage or distribution of these, that can violate privacy, I mentioned earlier consent or ethics.</p>
<p>And these practices really can result in privacy infringements, discrimination, social harm and legal issues. And some examples of that are data scraping and profiling, lack of informed consent, data breaches, of course, we’ve seen that recently and frequently, deepfakes as we talked about and manipulation of people, government surveillance, employment discrimination. These are big issues.</p>
<p>And I think the lack of unified government standards around these things is also difficult. And it’s important that people use the latest technologies like computer vision and Generative AI to start, to be able to scale and address some of these issues and keep users and businesses safe going forward. But those are definitely some of the issues that we’ve seen accumulate over the last few years.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, yeah, I can see there are quite a few. And how these more recent generation of identity verification system that are working together with Generative AI. So, if you can tell us a bit of the how, how they are different to the previous products, and how they are tackling these problems?</p>
<p>Russ: Yeah, as I expressed in some of the technologies that we use, I mean, training data for Gen AI, for example, if you think of it, if I can frame it in like nutritional labels like food, right? So, you’re feeding a machine, essentially. And so that training data should come with some sort of nutritional label, and to know what the macro nutrients will affect performance. So, you know, it’s important that when using Gen AI, you understand that the nutritional makeup of their training data, supply chain transparency, where do you get their data from, for example.</p>
<p>But it’s important, these techniques are able to detect the proliferation of these fake documents. I think digital identity is becoming more and more, of course, prolific and governments are starting to bring onboard connectivity into these digital identity databases that are able to verify customers in a much more robust way than potentially documents were.</p>
<p>So, I think we’ll see that constant trend of digitisation of technology, mobile-first, wallets, and of course, documentation that will become digital will make life a little bit easier. But, in order to protect themselves, consumers and businesses really need to think about what they can do to stop and be vigilant, right?</p>
<p>So, I think consumers need to educate themselves. They need to use things like password protection and protect their devices and be aware of things like phishing tactics in social media and email. So, we can do as much as we can for businesses, but I think businesses need to invest in these systems because they are stronger, the security measures are stronger, and will help protect them and their customers ultimately.</p>
<p>I think the differences that we see, we believe facial biometrics is a very, very strong and has been proven externally through, you know, NIST iBeta certification, for example, we have a 99.998 certification of liveness biometrics, I mentioned the inclusion and lack of racial bias. If you want to capture and work with people of all races, all genders, all colours across the world, it’s important to use systems that are inclusive, otherwise, you’ll end up discriminating and losing customers.</p>
<p>So, it is important to make these investments into these systems to help protect your business and help protect the consumers behind that. But ultimately, consumers have to also be educated themselves. They have to think about what they’re doing and be aware of things that are out of the ordinary or suspicious, unsolicited requests, for example. And then lastly, I think, you know, government needs to engage in some sort of public dialogue as well to help consumers about understanding what they’re doing in these initiatives.</p>
<p>And government needs to work with business as well to inform the public about things like biometric technology, ethical implications, and why they should be using these. But ultimately, there should be some ethical guidelines and review boards to be able to support the usage of this new technology that’s coming at us at such a pace. It’s really strong, really powerful and really useful.</p>
<p>But there have to be some guardrails around that, and I think it’s going to take a collective effort from consumers, businesses and government to get us there.</p>
<p>Oscar: You mentioned, for instance, a liveness detection that is one of the ways that this identity verification tools are checking that the person is a real person moving in front of the camera. In terms of the end user, so when the end user is in front of this identity verification system that are based on Generative AI, so let’s say user experience is similar, is so how transparent or is different?</p>
<p>Russ: Yeah, I think, look, with facial recognition, for example, and the techniques we use in identifying people when they’re going through the process of verifying themselves or for account access or re-authentication, no personal data is stored. So, the use of those biometrics is the ability to give people a robust way to prove themselves and their proof of life, if you will, when doing a particular action.</p>
<p>And I think what’s been missing in the past is people have accepted a document which could or could not belong to that person to be the valid form of identity. The reason why identity documents around the world had been the standard is there was always a picture of your face on that document.</p>
<p>So, you had a passport or driver’s license, you could see it was you in a sense. So, with liveness, people are protected the same way as using phones to open up access to your phone and to those systems. But these systems are tested and there is no personal data. People should feel very comfortable that the data that they’re using to generate that action is protected and their own in terms of doing that.</p>
<p>We’re just using technology to be able to verify that that person is live and present, and is not a deepfake, was not a synthetic ID. Because what we see a lot is these presentation attacks when people are using video footage that are grabbed from external sources, for example, to try and fake systems or try and trick systems that they are actually live and present.</p>
<p>But we are able to detect these digital footprints and be able to detect using multiple sources of multiple techniques on the mobile phone that we build software for that that person is live and present and is presenting the document that they say they are in order to verify themselves.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thank you, for explaining better how it worked for users. So, it’s simple for users. It’s not more complicated.</p>
<p>Russ: Simple and seamless and quick as well. It’s not more complicated. It’s less complicated, in fact, right? So, when you presented with it – there has to be a trust of course in the environment that you’re doing, and then providing your face to do that.</p>
<p>But ultimately, it’s safer and quicker, and ultimately more secure than any sort of biometric that they might have used previously.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it’s true. You mentioned also faster sometimes I think, being in front of these systems and yeah you are, waiting a little bit in front of the camera, right until it processes.</p>
<p>Russ: Yeah, look, it depends on the speed and the connectivity in the region you’re in, and it might be the phone and your mobile network, for example. But we account for all of that in the software that we design in helping people to process that. So, we shoot like a live stream video, and we take the best shots out of about 100, 120 frames that we shoot out of that video. It’s a very quick two or three second capture, and we’re able to compare the best quality face to the document that’s presented in this process.</p>
<p>Now, we can account for age, facial degradation, loss of hair, glasses, et cetera because we are looking at the underlying structure of someone’s face when doing that. So, we’re 3D mapping essentially that person’s face, and are able to then tell against the original document that’s presented if that person is the same person.</p>
<p>And that you can’t do, it’s very hard to do with humans, for example. And that’s why technology can do a lot of this lifting very, very quickly. We can do it in seconds and verify the person against very old very age documents or changes to their facial structures. And so, we’re very excited about how these techniques can verify people to the grade that I mentioned before.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, it sounds like there’s a lot of innovation hearing what you’re talking, you are describing. So, what we say looking at the future, so what is the future of Generative AI in identity verification?</p>
<p>Russ: We were excited about Gen AI’s ability to create these huge datasets of synthetic personas, because it’s going to help prevent fraudsters trying to use this synthetically created people and documents that they create to trick and penetrate low grade systems.</p>
<p>And the more people we can support, the more businesses we can get our technology into, the more we can stop this the synthetic IDs and penetration attacks that are happening. And we’ve seen the velocity of these increase as we see better and better tools and faster processing time to be able to do this.</p>
<p>So, the ability to cover the identities of the world’s population through technology and creating inclusivity for all ethnicities, all genders, means that people can be granted access regardless of where they live, what device they’re using, what colour they are, what gender they are.</p>
<p>So, we’re very excited about how Gen AI can train and help people. And again, this is all ethically sourced data, right? So, we didn’t go and grab it elsewhere. It’s very hard to get in front of tens of millions of faces of variations of age and, again, colour, ethnicity, gender, et cetera.</p>
<p>So, Gen AI really helps us to do that, I think detection tools. So, developing and using advanced technology like Gen AI to detect this deepfake content can be crucial to mitigate the potential harmful effects that might come from that. Authentication mechanisms. So, implementing strong authentication, like facial can help, again, verify the identity of individuals and reduce that risk of impersonation.</p>
<p>So, trust has to be ensured that it’s in place there. And of course, eliminating frauds and scams, so businesses and consumers fall victim to deepfake base scams and others every day.&nbsp; For instance, a scammer can impersonate a company executive, as I said, and deceive employees into revealing sensitive information or maybe making financial transactions.</p>
<p>So, we want to stop fraud at the door. We want to stop fraud internally, externally. And we want to help protect businesses and their customers, whether their business or consumers from the rising threat of what’s coming on synthetic identities and the scale of using Generative AI at the fraudster level.</p>
<p>Oscar: Sounds good. Final question, for all business leaders that are listening to us right now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Russ: Yeah, look, there are a lot to choose from. I think the one action from my opinion, maybe is – you’ve got to think like we’re living in a mobile-first world, right? And Gen AI solutions, as we’ve talked about are surging.</p>
<p>So, the action I would take is take the time to speak to your fellow executives and to the teams and to the people inside your business and understand how identity is currently viewed in your approach to your people, your processes, your security, your products and your customers. Where I sit and where we sit, is we are seeing the velocity increase of identity usage across the world.</p>
<p>Governments are enforcing and implementing more and more identity standards in order to control obviously, governmental services. And so, it’s important that people think about identity for their own businesses. It’s going to become critical to protect them and their customers. They need to think about everything from employee onboarding, how well you know your employee and your customers.</p>
<p>And of course, ultimately, what we’re all achieving, or trying to achieve in digital is improving user experiences, anything from onboarding to account management, to customer services interaction. So, it’s everything that your customer, your employee might touch within your business, potentially has something to do with identity. And the better you know the people in your business and your customers, I think, the better positioned you’re going to be to be able to not only stop these threats but take advantage of beating your competition by staying ahead and knowing your customer much better.</p>
<p>Oscar: All right, thank you very much, Russ, for all this very interesting conversation about how Generative AI is going to help us for the identity verification now and in the future.</p>
<p>So, for the ones listening to us who would like to know more about you or get in touch with you, what are the best ways for that?</p>
<p>Russ: Yes, thank you again, for the time letting me talk about something we, you know, and I’m very passionate about and obviously we’re very passionate about fraud and particularly technology.</p>
<p>If they want to get a hold of me, I’m on LinkedIn, you know, Russ Cohn, C-O-H-N. IDVerse.com has a repository of amazing content and information and thought leadership around a lot of these areas, so please take your time to look across the site. And if you want to get in touch with us, there’s lots of ways to do that on the site.</p>
<p>So, look forward to seeing and speaking with anybody who’s interested in learning more about IDVerse and about – chatting about fraud and identity.</p>
<p>Oscar: Perfect. Again, thank you very much, Russ. And all the best.</p>
<p>Russ: Thank you, Oscar. Appreciate the time.</p>

  <p>A Zero Trust breach prevention strategy based on user risk is critical for organizations in today's digital landscape. However, managing user risks in hybrid environments has posed several challenges. Today, we’re making it easier to manage user risk in hybrid environments in Microsoft Entra ID Protection (formerly Azure AD Identity Protection) – on-premises password change can now automatically remediate user risk! This feature is now in public preview.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we recommend mastering password changes in Entra ID to take advantage of Password Protection, hybrid customers who do password changes on-premises found it challenging to enable user risk policies. Users would get blocked when becoming risky and could not self-remediate by resetting passwords on-premises because the password change wasn’t visible to Entra ID, and so couldn’t dismiss the risk. This has resulted in a build-up of users marked at risk who may or may not have changed their passwords on-prem, making it challenging for some customers to take advantage of Entra ID Protection signals, and to leverage risk-based policies to protect their hybrid tenants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To bridge this gap, we’re introducing the new setting called "Allow on-premises password change to reset user risk" in Entra ID Protection. Customers that have Password Hash Synchronization enabled on their tenants can now enable this setting. When enabled, users’ risks will be automatically remediated when their passwords are changed on-premises, and customers can confidently deploy user risk policy to effectively protect their hybrid users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This enhancement empowers our customers with two main advantages:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Efficient Remediation: With this capability, risky hybrid users can efficiently self-remediate without manual interventions from administrators, reducing the administrative burden. When a password is changed on-premises, user risk will be automatically remediated within Entra ID Protection, bringing the user to a safe state. 
 Proactive Security: Organizations can now proactively deploy user risk policies that require password changes to confidently protect their hybrid users and environments. This proactive approach strengthens your organization's security posture, simplifies security management with access control policies while ensuring that user risks are promptly addressed, even in complex hybrid environments. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enable the “Allow on-premises password change to reset user risk” setting today in <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/IdentityProtectionMenuBlade/~/OverviewNew">Identity Protection - Microsoft Entra admin center</a> and visit <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-remediate-unblock">Remediate risks and unblock users in Azure AD Identity Protection</a> to learn more.</p>

<p>We are committed to continually improving our services to provide the best security solutions. Thank you for trusting Entra ID Protection.</p>

<p>A new method for controlling and confirming digital identities is emerging: distributed digital identity (DDI). By removing the need for a single authoritative source, DDI empowers users to take charge of their digital identities and reduces their dependence on centralized structures.</p>
 The Evolution of Identity Verification 
<p>In the tapestry of human history, identity verification methods have constantly evolved, with each era bringing forth innovations to validate one’s credentials. From clay tablets to holographic passports, the quest for foolproof identification is an age-old journey.</p>
<p>Historically, physical documents, such as birth certificates, driver’s licenses, and passports, were the gold standards for verifying identity. These paper-based systems, although practical, were cumbersome, often leading to administrative bottlenecks and inefficiencies.</p>
<p>With technological advancements, the shift was evident. Digital platforms started introducing usernames, passwords, and biometric verifications. This transition streamlined many processes, enabling real-time verifications and instant service access.</p>
<p>Centralized identity systems, while efficient, are susceptible to various vulnerabilities. They create a concentrated data storehouse, becoming a prime target for cyber-attacks. Moreover, these systems often grapple with privacy and data misuse concerns, leading to a growing user mistrust.</p>
<p>As we journeyed from paper-based identifications to more digital counterparts, we encountered both leaps in efficiency and new challenges. Let’s explore the metamorphosis of these systems and the nuances of the digital identity realm.</p>
 Understanding Distributed Systems 
<p>The traditional centralized structures are giving way to more collaborative and decentralized mechanisms. Enter the realm of distributed systems, a paradigm shift revolutionizing the tech landscape.</p>
<p>Distributed systems encompass networked computers, each functioning autonomously. These individual entities communicate and coordinate actions via message-passing mechanisms without relying on a central authority.</p>
<p>On the upside, distributed systems offer inherent fault tolerance, resilience, and decentralization, making them robust against system-wide failures. On the flip side, their decentralized nature can lead to complexities in data reconciliation, and latency might occasionally be an issue due to multiple verification points.</p>
<p>Distributed systems offer a fresh lens through which we can view and process data. With this backdrop, the concept of distributed digital identity starts to take shape, offering a new approach to online identification.</p>
 The Concept of Distributed Digital Identity 
<p>Amid the complex web of digital interactions, there’s a pressing need to ensure the authenticity of identity and its protection. Distributed Digital Identity (DDI) emerges as the answer, combining the strengths of various technological principles.</p>
 How it Works: A Technical Overview: 
<p>Encryption: The bedrock of DDI, encryption ensures that data remains confidential, tamper-proof, and accessible only by the intended recipients. Robust cryptographic methods convert information into codes, decipherable only with the correct keys.</p>
<p>Decentralized Ledgers (Blockchain): As the backbone, blockchains are transparent, immutable data records. Every entry is time-stamped and linked, ensuring data integrity and preventing unauthorized alterations.</p>
<p>Peer-to-peer Networks: This structure eradicates the middleman. By enabling direct interactions between parties, it enhances efficiency, reduces costs, and heightens security.</p>
<p>To truly grasp the impact of DDI, one must delve into its core components and how they interweave to create a fortified and user-centric identity system.</p>
<p>Behind the facade of any complex system lie intricate gears and mechanisms. DDI is no different. With its unique jargon and foundational elements, it becomes essential to demystify its terms for a comprehensive understanding.</p>
 
 DID (Decentralized Identifier): This is the digital equivalent of a unique fingerprint in the DDI landscape. Every DID is distinct, assuring pinpoint identity recognition. 
 Verifiable Credentials: These are the digital attestations provided by issuers about a holder. Think of them as digital testimonials attesting to the authenticity of the presented data. 
 Issuer, Holder, and Verifier: A triad that forms the DDI ecosystem, Issuers grant digital credentials; holders, typically users, store and present these credentials, and verifiers authenticate them. 
 
<p>With knowledge about the cornerstone terms of DDI, it becomes imperative to explore the tangible benefits this system offers users and organizations alike.</p>
 Benefits of Distributed Digital Identity 
<p>Pursuing any new technology is driven by the promise of betterment – in efficiency, security, or user experience. This promise manifests in many ways with DDI, benefiting end-users and businesses.</p>
