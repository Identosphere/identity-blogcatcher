<p>The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/central-processing-unit">central processing unit (CPU)</a> is the computer’s brain, assigning and processing tasks and managing essential operational functions.</p>



<p>Computers have been so seamlessly integrated with modern life that sometimes we’re not even aware of how many CPUs are in use around the world. It’s a staggering amount—so many CPUs that a conclusive figure can only be approximated.</p>



 How many CPUs are now in use? 



<p>It’s been estimated that there may be as many as 200 billion CPU cores (or more) now running. As an example of what such a monumental number means from a different perspective, chip manufacturer <a href="https://newsroom.arm.com/news/arm-partners-are-shipping-more-than-900-arm-based-chips-per-second-based-on-latest-results">Ar</a>m claimed to have shipped 7.3 billion chips within a single quarter of 2020, or roughly 900 CPUs for each second of that entire quarter. (There are approximately 7.8 million seconds in 3 months.)</p>



<p>That leads to a stunning comparison. Projections by the US Census Bureau list the 2024 global population at around 8 billion people. If those 200 billion CPUs currently in existence were all distributed equitably by persons—and none were devoted to business, government or scientific applications—there would be exactly 25 CPUs serving as the brain of the computer for each human brain on the planet.</p>



<p>This prompts a key question: With so many CPUs in operation, how are they all being used?</p>



 Seven top CPU use cases 



<p>With CPUs, we’re talking about a very small processor chip, and yet there’s very little that this very little thing cannot do. A brief survey shows which industries depend the most heavily on CPUs:</p>



 Consumer electronics 



<p>Many of the world’s most profitable companies—such as Apple—make devices for the consumer electronics industry. The rampant demand for personal computing platforms (like smartphones, laptops and gaming consoles) has driven a massive and ongoing expansion of CPU use. Beyond that, household devices blessed with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/internet-of-things">Internet of Things (IoT)</a> technology means that CPUs are now being incorporated into refrigerators, thermostats, security systems and more.</p>



 Data analytics 



<p>The goal of data analytics is to take raw data and refine it into an understandable narrative that addresses business goals. The first part of that process is assembling and cleaning the data. CPUs are instrumental to these activities, serving as the primary computer processing units. In addition, the high clock speeds achieved by CPUs make them perfectly suited to handle the type of rapid-fire scanning and retrieval of information that data analytics requires.</p>



 Defense and space 



<p>The CPU is the true backbone of modern defense systems. Any country that desires to be a global power must have modern computers as part of its security arsenal. Likewise, humankind’s achievements in space exploration could never have occurred without the CPU to handle the awesome computational challenges of calculating the distance and routes of space flights. Space poses a unique challenge for computers, which must be radiation-hardened to withstand powerful solar rays.</p>



 Financial services 



<p>Like data analytics, fintech companies depend on CPUs to enable the fast and efficient processing of huge amounts of financial-based information. By running advanced analyses on such data and then applying a range of different scenarios to that data, risk management systems that CPUs enable can help financial institutions reduce losses. CPUs also assist that effort in another key way—by helping flag oddities and detecting cases of fraud.</p>



 Healthcare 



<p>Nearly every type of industry benefits because of the fast speeds CPUs achieve, but none as importantly as healthcare, where lives literally hang in the balance and timing is a critical concern. Beyond the ability to quickly shuttle vital patient information between providers, CPUs can be used to help automate the ordering and tracking of prescriptions and other supplies. Computers can also both create pre-surgical 3D models of organs and help pathologists study illnesses.</p>



 Manufacturing 



<p>The use of semiconductors has radically changed manufacturing, synching the input of materials and improving quality control. Manufacturing is also being revolutionized by computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), where CPU-driven computer systems help run industrial production operations. CAM uses direct or indirect connections that exist between the CPU and production operations to schedule, control and manage manufacturing activity.</p>



 Telecom 



<p>The telecom industry offers its own bread-and-butter products—communication technology devices—but also assists other industries in important ways. Those use cases include enabling digital transactions (for the financial services industry) and assisting healthcare by supporting robotic surgeries with precision capabilities and data updates. In addition, CPUs are essential to operating autonomous vehicles, which rely on telecom signals for navigational guidance.</p>



 Key parts of the CPU 



<p>Modern CPUs typically contain the following components:</p>



 
 Arithmetic/logic unit (ALU): Executes arithmetic and logical operations, including math equations and logic-based comparisons. 



 Buses: Manages proper data transfer and data flow between components within a computer system. 



 Control unit: Uses intensive circuitry that controls the computer system by issuing a system of electrical pulses and instructs the system to execute high-level computer instructions. 



 Instruction registers and pointer: Shows location of next instruction set to be executed by the CPU. 



 Memory unit: Manages memory usage and data flow between RAM and the CPU. The main memory unit supervises the handling of the cache memory. 



 Registers: Provides built-in permanent memory for constant, repeated data needs that must be administered regularly, without exception. 
 



 Important CPU concepts 



<p>To be fully conversant in CPU terminology, it’s helpful to understand the following concepts:</p>



<p>Cache: Storage areas whose location allows users to quickly access data that’s been in recent use. Cache memory stores data in areas that are built into a CPU’s processor chip to reach data retrieval speeds even faster than random access memory (RAM).</p>



<p>Clock speed: The rate of activity per computer clock cycle. The internal clock built into computers regulates the speed and frequency of computer operations. The clock manages the CPU’s circuitry through the transmittal of electrical pulses. The delivery rate of pulses is called “clock speed.”</p>



<p>Core: The processor within the processor. Cores are processing units that read and execute various program instructions. Processors are classified according to how many cores are embedded into them; single-core, dual-core and quad-core processors are some of the examples. (The term “Intel Core” is used commercially to market Intel’s product line of multi-core CPUs.)</p>



<p><a>Threads:</a> The shortest sequences of programmable instructions that an operating system’s scheduler can manage and send to a CPU for processing. Through multithreading, the use of multiple threads running simultaneously, various computer processes can be run concurrently, supporting multitasking. (“Hyper-threading” is Intel’s proprietary term for its form of multithreading.)</p>



 Top CPU manufacturers and products 



<p>The two major companies battling for control of this ultra-lucrative marketplace are Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD):</p>



 Intel 



<p>Markets processors and microprocessors through four product lines: Intel® Core® (high-end premium line), Intel® Xeon® (office and business use), Intel® Pentium® (personal computers and laptops), and Intel®Celeron® (low-end, low-cost personal computing use).</p>



<p>Obviously, different chips are best suited to certain applications. The Intel® Core i5-13400F is a good desktop processor that features 10 cores. But when it comes to a processing-intensive application like video editing, many users opt for the Intel® Core i7 14700KF 20-Core, 28-thread CPU.</p>



 Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) 



<p>Sells two types of processors and microprocessors: CPUs and APUs (which stands for accelerated processing units). APUs are CPUs that are equipped with proprietary Radeon® graphics. AMD® makes high-speed, high-performance Ryzen® processors for the video-game market. The AMD® Ryzen® 7 5800X3D, for example, features a 3D V-Cache technology that helps it push game graphics to new heights.</p>



<p>Athlon® processors used to be considered AMD’s high-end line, but AMD now uses it as a basic computing alternative.</p>



 Arm 



<p>Arm® doesn’t manufacture equipment, but instead leases out its valued processor designs and/or other proprietary technologies to other companies who do make equipment.</p>



<p>For general-purpose computing, such as running an operating system like Windows and using multimedia programs, most AMD Ryzen® or Intel® Core® processors can handle the workloads involved.</p>



 Ongoing CPU trends 



<p>Several tangential issues will continue to influence CPU development and the use cases for which they are utilized in coming years:</p>



<p>Increased use of GPUs: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/gpu">Graphics processing units (GPUs)</a> are an electronic circuit first developed for use in smartphone and video game consoles. Their use is about driving processing speeds, so in addition to accelerating graphics cards, GPUs are being used in processing-intensive pursuits like cryptocurrency mining and the training of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/neural-networks">neural networks</a>.</p>



<p>The drive to miniaturize: The history of computer hardware has been a quest to make computer processors smaller. Early computers required vast floor space and vacuum tubes. Then, CPUs became smaller and more efficient with the introduction of transistors. Later, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/history/computer-science#:">computer scientists</a> created a CPU called the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/microprocessors">microprocessor</a> that could be held within a small integrated circuit chip. The drive to make processors smaller will continue unabated as long as there are consumers and businesses who want more processing power and faster speed.</p>



<p>Peripheral proliferation: Peripheral devices help optimize and increase the functionality of computing. Peripherals can be attached to the outside of a computer and include devices like keyboards, mice, scanners and printers. Expect to see more peripherals created in response to ongoing customer demand.</p>



<p>Sustainability issues: Moving forward, matters of power consumption will become increasingly important. Companies will become more focused on energy-efficient solutions as energy costs rise. When CPU use increases on a grand scale—like in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/hyperscale">hyperscale data centers</a>, with thousands of linked computers working around the clock, the energy used is often measured in gigahertz (GHz)—which is comparable to the entire energy consumption of villages or small towns.</p>



 Forecasting future CPU growth 



<p>In its <a href="https://www.yolegroup.com/product/report/status-of-the-processor-industry-2023/">2022–2028 processor revenue forecast</a>, analyst group Yole Intelligence calculated that the total processor market in 2022 was worth $154 billion. That total figure included the following processor segments and their respective worths:</p>



 
 Central processing units (CPUs): USD 65 billion 



 Application processing units (APUs): USD 61 billion 



 Graphics processing units (GPUs): USD 22 billion 



 SoC FPGA: USD 2.6 billion (SoC FPGA stands for “system-on-chip <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/field-programmable-gate-arrays">field programmable gate array</a>,” which are semiconductor-based devices that incorporate programmable logic into processor cores.) 



 AI ASICs: USD 1.5 billion (AI ASICs stands for “application-specific integrated circuits,” specifically those related to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>.) 



 Data processing units (DPUs): USD 0.6 billion 
 



<p>In its 2028 projections, you can see how Yole’s experts expect certain segments to grow, namely AI and DPUs. Yole anticipates an 8% total yearly growth, leading to an expected 2028 total value of USD 242 billion, based on these figures:</p>



 
 CPUs: USD 97 billion 



 APUs: USD 65 billion 



 GPUs: USD 55 billion 



 AI ASICs: USD 11 billion 



 DPUs: USD 8.1 billion 



 SoC FPGAs: USD 5.2 billion 
 



<p>In addition to substantial market growth in AI ASICs and DPUs, Yole Intelligence’s forecast shows nearly identical growth for CPUs and GPUs during the same period, with growth predictions of USD 32 billion and USD 33 billion respectively. These projections also demonstrate the ongoing centrality of CPUs, since this category leads all others now and will continue to do so in the future, according to Yole Intelligence.</p>



 Take the next step 



<p>With over 200 billion CPUs in current operation, it’s reasonable to conclude that CPUs are here to stay—very probably a permanent part of the human condition moving forward. But it’s also a safe bet that the CPU will continue to be further developed and refined, to keep maxing out its utility for high-performance systems and the new, graphics-rich computer programs they run.</p>



<p>That’s why it’s smart to invest wisely when purchasing the associated equipment needed to execute computing objectives. It’s important to have hardware that can keep pace with modern CPUs. IBM servers offer flexibility in addition to strength, so you can get the processing power you need now, along with room to grow in the future.</p>

  <p>We’re excited to announce that guidance for SAP Identity Management (IDM) customers planning to migrate their identity management scenarios to Microsoft Entra is now available. In a&nbsp;<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/microsoft-and-sap-collaborate-to-modernize-identity-for-sap/ba-p/4056600">previous post</a>, we discussed SAP ending maintenance for their identity management solution (SAP IDM) by 2030.&nbsp;We've since begun jointly developing documentation to help customers plan a seamless migration to the recommended alternative—Microsoft Entra ID.&nbsp;For many customers, it may be possible to get started immediately, leveraging the subscriptions that they already own with Microsoft 365 suites. Microsoft 365 enterprise suite licenses include Entra ID P1 features that will be the focus of this first round of guidance.&nbsp;In this post, we’ll also outline additional benefits of Microsoft Entra ID and list some key partners who can help you get started.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Continuing collaboration for enterprise security&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft and SAP have a long history of collaborating to keep our customers’ organizations productive and secure—an effort especially important now as more companies have adopted hybrid work arrangements, making it possible to work from office and from home. For example, last year we announced how Microsoft Sentinel is helping organizations bring&nbsp;<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sentinel-blog/revolutionize-your-sap-security-with-microsoft-sentinel-s-soar/ba-p/3823857">SOAR threat monitoring capabilities to their SAP environments</a>. We continue to deepen our relationship, and now we’re extending support for SAP customers’ digital transformation and cloud adoption goals with a seamless and secure identity management solution in Microsoft Entra ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, we’re introducing the first set of&nbsp;<a href="https://aka.ms/MigrateFromSAPIDM">guidance to migrate from SAP IDM to Entra ID</a>. SAP customers who are using SAP IDM for cloud and on-premises applications like SuccessFactors, SAP Cloud Identity Services, or Windows Server Active Directory can begin to use Microsoft Entra features such as Conditional Access to enforce Zero Trust access policies, and automatic provisioning that ensures users have the accounts they need for their job role. For SAP IDM customers who want more guidance on advanced IAM integrations, such as with Micosoft Entra ID Governance or external IDs, for example, we’re developing additional in-depth guidance on each of those areas that will be published later this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Microsoft and SAP will continue to enhance Microsoft Entra ID and deliver deeper integrations with SAP Cloud Identity Services and SAP Cloud Identity Access Governance.&nbsp; As new scenarios become available, we’ll provide ongoing updates to this&nbsp;guidance, incorporating customer and partner feedback.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Modern identity management is a strategic investment 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Progressive organizations are switching to cloud-based identity solutions. Older systems, designed for on-site environments, fail to satisfy the demands of the modern cloud-first, mobile, decentralized workforce. Additionally, they can be expensive, complicated, and susceptible to security risks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We know that multifactor authentication (MFA) and single sign-on methods&nbsp;<a href="https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RW166lD?culture=en-us&amp;country=us">can reduce password breaches by 99.9%</a>, but the benefits of a cloud-based solution in Microsoft Entra ID extend beyond just a stronger security posture. Optimized operational efficiency allows identity teams to do more impactful work and an improved user experience makes the entire organization less frustrated. By moving to Microsoft Entra ID, the benefits of your strategic investment continue:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Support for SAP and non-SAP apps and systems—both on-premises and cloud&nbsp; 
 Rich set of APIs, SDKs,&nbsp;and connectors for customization&nbsp; 
 Minimized vendor footprint&nbsp; 
 Reduced costs and complexity&nbsp; 
 Help meeting identity-related requirements for GDPR, HIPAA, and ISO 27001&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; 
 
<p>Modernizing identity management is key to boosting organizational security and shielding users and assets from the most common security threats. It’s more than just a cybersecurity measure; it also enhances user experience and operational efficiency. Generative AI, Zero Trust security, decentralized identity, and the flexibility to tailor access policies to exactly match your unique needs and demands offer compelling opportunities to better protect&nbsp;your apps and resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Partner network ready to help 
<p>&nbsp;<br>We’ve also been working with a set of key partners to help organizations begin their migrations, including some with long-term experience in Microsoft/SAP environments. </p>

<p>Recent healthcare cyberattacks have highlighted the critical need for robust cybersecurity measures in the healthcare industry. In February 2024, Change Healthcare, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, was hit by a ransomware attack when hackers exploited a server that was missing a fundamental security measure: multi-factor authentication (MFA). The incident not only paralyzed healthcare services but also led to the payment of a $22 million ransom and is expected to cost the company over $1.6 billion in recovery efforts. Moreover, according to Axios, health care providers are losing up to $1 billion a day from cyberattack.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As healthcare providers and payers continue to digitize their operations and patient records, they also continue to be the prime target for cybercriminals. According to the 2023 ForgeRock Breach Report2 of all industries healthcare is the number one targeted industry by cybercriminals. The stakes are high: a breach not only compromises member and patient data but also disrupts essential healthcare services. To mitigate these risks, healthcare organizations must adopt comprehensive security measures, with multi-factor authentication (MFA) across the organization being paramount.</p>

<p>The VMware® acquisition by Broadcom has changed VMware’s product and partner strategies. In November 2023, Broadcom finalized its <a href="https://investors.broadcom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/broadcom-completes-acquisition-vmware">acquisition</a> (link resides outside ibm.com) of VMware for USD 69 billion, with an aim to enhance its multicloud strategy. Further to the acquisition, Broadcom decided to discontinue (link resides outside ibm.com) its AWS authorization to resell VMware Cloud on AWS as of 30 April 2024. As a result, AWS will no longer be able to offer new subscriptions or additional services. This might lead to VMware’s network of clients and partners having to prepare for major adjustments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This blog discusses the impact of VMware-Broadcom acquisition, paths beyond VMware, viable options for AWS clients to move VMware to AWS Cloud and the advantages, critical actions, success stories and the next steps.&nbsp;</p>



 Paths beyond VMware&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 
 The impact of acquisition: A 2023 <a href="https://www.forrester.com/blogs/predictions-2024-technology-infrastructure/">Forrester study</a> (link resides outside ibm.com) predicts that 20% of VMware clients will move away from VMware stack due concerns around price increases, limited customer support and a mandatory requirement for subscription to software bundles —all of which are a result of the acquisition. Forrester® further states that clients are looking at alternative options such as virtualization, cloud management, end-user computing and other viable approaches.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



 
 The growing need for cloud cost optimization: Cost optimization is essential when exiting VMware because it helps manage and reduce the initial and ongoing expenses associated with migration, ensures efficient use of resources in the new environment, and maximizes the return on investment. By leveraging tools like IBM Turbonomic® for real-time resource management and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/apptio">Apptio®</a> (an IBM company) for cloud cost optimization and financial transparency, organizations can achieve a smooth, cost-effective transition from VMware while positioning themselves for future growth and innovation.&nbsp; 
 



 Considering VMware alternatives&nbsp; 



<p>As technology evolves and business needs change, it is essential for businesses to ensure that their infrastructure aligns with strategic goals, such as optimizing costs, improving performance or embracing a cloud-first approach. Clients are likely to start evaluating alternatives for VMware, both from cost and functionality perspective for their current IT landscape.&nbsp;</p>



 
 Understanding VMware migration: VMware migration is a strategic effort focused on moving traditional VMware workloads to cloud-native settings. AWS offers an extensive alternative platform for VMware providing a comprehensive suite of cloud services, global infrastructure and robust security features. This approach overcomes the challenges associated with on-premises infrastructure, including hardware reliance, scalability limitations and elevated operational expenses. By transferring VMware workloads to AWS, organizations can take advantage of cloud capabilities such as scalability, pay-as-you-go pricing models and a broad array of AWS services. IBM offers alternative solution options with optimal scalability, from scale-up to scale-out, enabling VMware transition and helping move to AWS.&nbsp;<br> 



 Exploring data center (DC) exit: Transitioning from VMware to a modern cloud or hybrid environment can significantly expedite clients’ data center consolidation and exit. This migration not only reduces operational costs and complexities associated with maintaining physical data centers but also enhances security, compliance and innovation capabilities. IBM Consulting® offers data center migration (also known as DC exit), a comprehensive solution designed to assist organizations in efficiently and strategically transitioning from their existing data center infrastructure to AWS Cloud. IBM brings the power of generative AI,&nbsp;supported by IBM–AWS joint investments to provide accelerated and automated migration at scale.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



 Migrating from VMware to AWS: Best case scenarios&nbsp; 



<p>In case the client’s VMware license is expiring in the next 6 months, within a year or down the line, businesses can explore various scenarios:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Migration-first approach for VMware to Amazon EC2 migration: Clients can directly migrate existing VMware workloads to AWS instances. This involves rehosting applications on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/migrate-vmware-virtual-machines-to-amazon-ec2-with-the-aws-application-migration-service-replication-agent/">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2</a>) (link resides outside ibm.com) instances, which may require some reconfiguration of the applications to optimize them for the cloud environment. Post migration, businesses can look to modernize their applications to take full advantage of AWS native services such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for database management, AWS Lambda for serverless computing and Amazon S3 for scalable storage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 



 Container-first approach: IBM offers a comprehensive end-to-end stack of products and services designed to meet the complex needs of modern enterprises. It encompasses a broad range of technologies and services, from cloud infrastructure and AI to cybersecurity and data management. Central to this offering are <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/how-red-hat-openshift-on-aws-rosa-accelerates-enterprise-modernization-initiatives-on-cloud-delivering-business-application-innovation/">Red Hat® OpenShift® Service on AWS (ROSA)</a> <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/virtualization">and OpenShift Virtualization</a>. These technologies exemplify IBM’s commitment to providing flexible, scalable and integrated solutions that drive business innovation and efficiency. Mitigate potential vendor lock-in, such as with VMware, by containerizing workloads across the AWS Cloud using services like ROSA, Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/AWS_Fargate.html">Amazon ECS on AWS Fargate </a>(link resides outside ibm.com). Red Hat OpenShift virtualization allows businesses to run and manage both containerized and virtual machine (VM) workloads on a single platform.&nbsp;<br> 



 Software as a service (SaaS) approach: Applications running on VMware can be moved to AWS as a SaaS solution. SaaS provides a flexible, cost-effective and efficient way to deliver software applications to users. By leveraging AWS Cloud infrastructure, the SaaS approach eliminates the need for extensive on-premises resources and maintenance, allowing businesses to focus on their core competencies while ensuring they have access to the latest technological advancements.&nbsp;<br> 



 Managed services approach: As an AWS certified managed service provider (MSP), IBM can help move VMware workloads to a managed services model. Managed services for AWS is designed to simplify and automate cloud management. Our services help enterprises adopt and operate within the AWS Cloud with best practices, security and compliance at the forefront. By leveraging managed services, organizations can focus on their core business activities while IBM handles the heavy lifting of cloud infrastructure management.&nbsp; 
 



 Accelerating VMware exit with IBM Migration Factory&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Leveraging years of collaboration and experience, IBM brings a deep understanding of AWS technologies, enabling seamless integration and optimized implementations for enterprises.

<p>In business and beyond, communication is king. Successful service level agreements (SLAs) operate on this principle, laying the foundation for successful provider-customer relationships.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/service-level-agreement">service level agreement (SLA)</a> is a key component of technology vendor contracts that describes the terms of service between a service provider and a customer. SLAs describe the level of performance to be expected, how performance will be measured and repercussions if levels are not met. SLAs make sure that all stakeholders understand the service agreement and help forge a more seamless working relationship.</p>



 Types of SLAs 



<p>There are three main types of SLAs:</p>



 Customer-level SLAs 



<p>Customer-level SLAs define the terms of service between a service provider and a customer. A customer can be external, such as a business purchasing cloud storage from a vendor, or internal, as is the case with an SLA between business and IT teams regarding the development of a product.</p>



 Service-level SLAs 



<p>Service providers who offer the same service to multiple customers often use service-level SLAs. Service-level SLAs do not change based on the customer, instead outlining a general level of service provided to all customers.</p>



 Multilevel SLAs 



<p>When a service provider offers a multitiered pricing plan for the same product, they often offer multilevel SLAs to clearly communicate the service offered each level. Multilevel SLAs are also used when creating agreements between more than two more parties.</p>



 SLA components 



<p>SLAs include an overview of the parties involved, services to be provided, stakeholder role breakdowns, performance monitoring and reporting requirements. Other SLA components include security protocols, redressing agreements, review procedures, termination clauses and more. Crucially, they define how performance will be measured.</p>



<p>SLAs should precisely define the key metrics—service-level agreement metrics—that will be used to measure service performance. These metrics are often related to organizational <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=SLOs+ibm&amp;sca_esv=4b73ca8f0ec787dd&amp;rlz=1C5GCEM_enUS1046US1046&amp;ei=AYhPZrqeB-Cpxc8Pn9WQuAY&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj6oozosKSGAxXgVPEDHZ8qBGcQ4dUDCBE&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=SLOs+ibm&amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiCFNMT3MgaWJtMgoQABiwAxjWBBhHMgoQABiwAxjWBBhHMgoQABiwAxjWBBhHMgoQABiwAxjWBBhHMgoQABiwAxjWBBhHMgoQABiwAxjWBBhHMgoQABiwAxjWBBhHMgoQABiwAxjWBBhHMg0QABiABBiwAxhDGIoFMg0QABiABBiwAxhDGIoFMg0QABiABBiwAxhDGIoFMg0QABiABBiwAxhDGIoFMg4QABiwAxjkAhjWBNgBATIOEAAYsAMY5AIY1gTYAQEyDhAAGLADGOQCGNYE2AEBMhMQLhiABBiwAxhDGMgDGIoF2AECMhMQLhiABBiwAxhDGMgDGIoF2AECMhMQLhiABBiwAxhDGMgDGIoF2AECSL8IUJMBWNAGcAF4AZABAJgBAKABAKoBALgBA8gBAPgBAZgCAaACB5gDAIgGAZAGEroGBggBEAEYCboGBggCEAEYCJIHATGgBwA&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp">service level objectives (SLOs</a>). While SLAs define the agreement between organization and customer, SLOs set internal performance targets. Fulfilling SLAs requires monitoring important metrics related to business operations and service provider performance. The key is monitoring the right metrics.</p>



 What is a KPI in an SLA? 



<p>Metrics are specific measures of an aspect of service performance, such as availability or <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/latency">latency</a>. Key performance indicators (KPIs) are linked to business goals and are used to judge a team’s progress toward those goals. KPIs don’t exist without business targets; they are “indicators” of progress toward a stated goal.</p>



<p>Let’s use annual sales growth as an example, with an organizational goal of 30% growth year-over-year. KPIs such as subscription renewals to date or leads generated provide a real-time snapshot of business progress toward the annual sales growth goal.</p>



<p>Metrics such as application availability and latency help provide context. For example, if the organization is losing customers and not on track to meet the annual goal, an examination of metrics related to customer satisfaction (that is, application availability and latency) might provide some answers as to why customers are leaving.</p>



 What SLA metrics to monitor 



<p>SLAs contain different terms depending on the vendor, type of service provided, client requirements, compliance standards and more and metrics vary by industry and use case. However, certain SLA performance metrics such as availability, mean time to recovery, response time, error rates and security and compliance measurements are commonly used across services and industries. These metrics set a baseline for operations and the quality of services provided.</p>



<p>Clearly defining which metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) will be used to measure performance and how this information will be communicated helps <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/it-service-management">IT service management (ITSM)</a> teams identify what data to collect and monitor. With the right data, teams can better maintain SLAs and make sure that customers know exactly what to expect.<br><br>Ideally, ITSM teams provide input when SLAs are drafted, in addition to monitoring the metrics related to their fulfillment. Involving ITSM teams early in the process helps make sure that business teams don’t make agreements with customers that are not attainable by IT teams.</p>



<p>SLA metrics that are important for IT and ITSM leaders to monitor include:</p>



 1. Availability 



<p>Service disruptions, or downtime, are costly, can damage enterprise credibility and can lead to compliance issues. The SLA between an organization and a customer dictates the expected level of service availability or uptime and is an indicator of system functionality.</p>



<p>Availability is often measured in “nines on the way to 100%”: 90%, 99%, 99.9% and so on. Many cloud and SaaS providers aim for an industry standard of “five 9s” or 99.999% uptime.</p>



<p>For certain businesses, even an hour of downtime can mean significant losses. If an e-commerce website experiences an outage during a high traffic time such as Black Friday, or during a large sale, it can damage the company’s reputation and annual revenue. Service disruptions also negatively impact the customer experience. Services that are not consistently available often lead users to search for alternatives. Business needs vary, but the need to provide users with quick and efficient products and services is universal.</p>



<p>Generally, maximum uptime is preferred. However, providers in some industries might find it more cost effective to offer a slightly lower availability rate if it still meets client needs.</p>



 2. Mean time to recovery 



<p>Mean time to recovery measures the average amount of time that it takes to recover a product during an outage or failure. No system or service is immune from an occasional issue or failure, but enterprises that can quickly recover are more likely to maintain business profitability, meet customer needs and uphold SLAs.</p>



 3. Response time and resolution time 



<p>SLAs often state the amount of time in which a service provider must respond after an issue is flagged or logged. When an issue is logged or a service request is made, the response time indicates how long it takes for a provider to respond to and address the issue. Resolution time refers to how long it takes for the issue to be resolved. Minimizing these times is key to maintaining service performance.<br><br>Organizations should seek to address issues before they become system-wide failures and cause security or compliance issues. Software solutions that offer full-stack observability into business functions can play an important role in maintaining optimized systems and service performance. Many of these platforms use <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/automation">automation</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a> (ML) tools to automate the process of remediation or identify issues before they arise.</p>



<p>For example, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">AI</a>-powered intrusion detection systems (IDS) constantly monitor <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/networking">network</a> traffic for malicious activity, violations of security protocols or anomalous data. These systems deploy machine learning algorithms to monitor large data sets and use them to identify anomalous data. Anomalies and intrusions trigger alerts that notify IT teams. Without AI and machine learning, manually monitoring these large data sets would not be possible. &nbsp;</p>



 4. Error rates 



<p>Error rates measure service failures and the number of times service performance dips below defined standards. Depending on your enterprise, error rates can relate to any number of issues connected to business functions.</p>



<p>For example, in manufacturing, error rates correlate to the number of defects or quality issues on a specific product line, or the total number of errors found during a set time interval. These error rates, or defect rates, help organizations identify the root cause of an error and whether it’s related to the materials used or a broader issue.<br><br>There is a subset of customer-based metrics that monitor customer service interactions, which also relate to error rates.</p>



 
 First call resolution rate: In the realm of customer service, issues related to help desk interactions can factor into error rates. The success of customer services interactions can be difficult to gauge. Not every customer fills out a survey or files a complaint if an issue is not resolved—some will just look for another service. One metric that can help measure customer service interactions is the first call resolution rate. This rate reflects whether a user’s issue was resolved during the first interaction with a help desk, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/chatbots">chatbot</a> or representative. Every escalation of a customer service query beyond the initial contact means spending on extra resources. It can also impact the customer experience. 



 Abandonment rate: This rate reflects the frequency in which a customer abandons their inquiry before finding a resolution. Abandonment rate can also add to the overall error rate and helps measure the efficacy of a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/service-desk">service desk</a>, chatbot or human workforce. 
 



 5. Security and compliance 



<p>Large volumes of data and the use of on-premises servers, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-computing">cloud</a> servers and a growing number of applications creates a greater risk of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-breach">data breaches</a> and security threats. If not monitored appropriately, security breaches and vulnerabilities can expose service providers to legal and financial repercussions.</p>



<p>For example, the healthcare industry has specific requirements around how to store, transfer and dispose of a patient’s medical data. Failure to meet these compliance standards can result in fines and indemnification for losses incurred by customers.</p>



<p>While there are countless industry-specific metrics defined by the different services provided, many of them fall under larger umbrella categories. To be successful, it is important for business teams and IT service management teams to work together to improve service delivery and meet customer expectations.</p>



 Benefits of monitoring SLA metrics 



<p>Monitoring SLA metrics is the most efficient way for enterprises to gauge whether IT services are meeting customer expectations and to pinpoint areas for improvement. By monitoring metrics and KPIs in real time, IT teams can identify system weaknesses and optimize service delivery.<br><br>The main benefits of monitoring SLA metrics include:</p>



 Greater observability 



<p>A clear end-to-end understanding of business operations helps ITSM teams find ways to improve performance. Greater <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/observability">observability</a> enables organizations to gain insights into the operation of systems and workflows, identify errors, balance <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/workload">workloads</a> more efficiently and improve performance standards.</p>



 Optimized performance 



<p>By monitoring the right metrics and using the insights gleaned from them, organizations can provide better services and applications, exceed customer expectations and drive business growth.</p>



 Increased customer satisfaction 



<p>Similarly, monitoring SLA metrics and KPIs is one of the best ways to make sure services are meeting customer needs. In a crowded business field, customer satisfaction is a key factor in driving customer retention and building a positive &nbsp;reputation.</p>



 Greater transparency 



<p>By clearly outlining the terms of service, SLAs help eliminate confusion and protect all parties. Well-crafted SLAs make it clear what all stakeholders can expect, offer a well-defined timeline of when services will be provided and which stakeholders are responsible for specific actions. When done right, SLAs help set the tone for a smooth partnership.</p>

<p>In a hybrid world that blends on-premises and cloud-based resources, securing access to sensitive data and systems is no longer achieved by defending a perimeter, but through authentication. While authentication technologies have evolved over the past decades from their humble password origins, preventing unauthorized access still hinges on choosing and implementing the right identity-based controls.<br>
This involves navigating a landscape where knowledge-based, possession-based, biometric, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) methods offer a variety of advantages and limitations. Let’s consider each of the options available to organizations and how to select the right mix of controls to improve their security posture.</p>
 Knowledge-Based Authentication 
<p>Knowledge-based authentication (KBA), which encompasses passwords and PINs, is the most traditional form of authentication. Its widespread adoption and user familiarity make it a convenient starting point for many security protocols. However, its susceptibility to social engineering, phishing attacks, and the perennial issue of weak password creation by users necessitate a cautious approach. For environments where ease of use is paramount and risk levels are comparatively low, KBA can serve as a component of a more comprehensive security strategy, particularly when augmented with additional authentication factors.<br>
Knowledge-based authentication (KBA) is best suited for environments with comparatively low risk levels, where ease of use is paramount and the accessed information is not highly sensitive or critical. It can serve as a supplementary authentication factor in conjunction with other methods, such as biometric or device-based authentication. Examples include accessing non-critical information, utilizing KBA alongside other authentication methods as a first factor, and implementing it in public Wi-Fi hotspots for streamlined user access without compromising security.</p>
 Possession-Based Authentication 
<p>Possession-based authentication methods require users to have a physical object, such as a security token or a mobile device, to gain access. This approach adds a tangible layer of security, making it harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access without physical possession of the required object. It’s particularly effective in scenarios where additional security is needed without significantly complicating the user experience, such as in financial transactions or access to high-security areas. However, the risk of loss or theft and the potential cost implications of deploying hardware devices must be considered.<br>
Possession-based authentication methods offer heightened security measures for a range of scenarios, including financial transactions, remote work access, secure online transactions, and compliance-driven environments like legal and government agencies. In online banking, users require physical possession of a security token or mobile device to access their accounts securely. Similarly, in remote work settings, this method ensures that only authorized employees with designated devices can connect to corporate networks and sensitive data, mitigating risks associated with unauthorized access. Additionally, in e-commerce platforms and online payment systems, possession-based authentication enhances transaction security, reducing the risk of fraud and protecting sensitive financial information. Furthermore, compliance-driven industries can benefit from this approach to meet regulatory obligations and safeguard confidential information.</p>
 Biometrics 
<p>Biometric authentication offers a high-security level by utilizing unique user characteristics like fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans. This method is highly resistant to traditional hacking attempts and provides a seamless user experience. It is well-suited for environments where security cannot be compromised, such as in government or healthcare settings. Nevertheless, concerns around privacy, the potential for spoofing, and the need for compatible hardware investments can pose challenges. Organizations must weigh these factors against the critical need for secure and user-friendly authentication mechanisms.<br>
Biometric authentication, which leverages unique user characteristics like fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans, is ideal for various high-security environments. It is best suited for secure access to sensitive data and fortifying high-risk online systems. Despite its advantages, organizations must consider privacy concerns, potential spoofing, and compatible hardware investments when deploying biometric authentication systems.</p>
 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) 
<p>MFA combines two or more authentication methods listed above to create a layered security approach, significantly enhancing protection against various threats. By integrating knowledge, possession, and biometric factors, MFA creates a dynamic defense mechanism that is much harder for attackers to bypass. This method is ideal for protecting sensitive data and critical systems, offering a balanced solution that addresses the vulnerabilities inherent in single-method authentication systems. While MFA introduces complexity and potential user resistance, its ability to significantly reduce security risks makes it a vital component of modern cybersecurity strategies.<br>
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a versatile security method that finds applications across industries, serving to protect sensitive data and critical systems. More commonly, MFA is required to ensure secure access to corporate systems from outside the office, and in e-commerce platforms to safeguard customer accounts and high-risk customer and citizen transactions. Overall, MFA provides a defense mechanism against various threats, combining multiple authentication factors to significantly enhance security and mitigate risks inherent in single-method authentication systems.</p>
 Passwordless 
<p>Passwordless authentication represents a significant leap forward in cybersecurity, eliminating the vulnerabilities associated with traditional knowledge-based methods. The majority of authentication methods included in the above still require a user name AND password as a first step in authenticating users. But, by leveraging biometrics, mobile devices, or security keys, passwordless systems offer a user-friendly and highly secure alternative that reduces the risk of phishing, password theft, and unauthorized access. This method is particularly advantageous in creating a seamless user experience without compromising security, and ideal for environments aiming to minimize friction while maintaining high security standards. Organizations looking to bolster access security while enhancing user satisfaction should consider integrating passwordless authentication into their strategic security framework, offering an optimal balance between ease of use and robust protection.<br>
Organizations across diverse sectors, particularly those looking for a better, more secure user experience, should carefully consider integrating passwordless authentication into their security frameworks. By leveraging biometrics, mobile devices, or security keys, passwordless systems offer a robust and user-friendly alternative to traditional password-based methods, effectively mitigating the risks associated with phishing, password theft, and unauthorized access. This approach not only enhances security posture but also fosters a seamless and efficient user experience, aligning with the modern landscape of digital operations where stringent security measures and user satisfaction are paramount.</p>
 Choosing the Right Strategy 
<p>The choice of authentication method should be driven by an organization’s specific needs, considering factors such as the sensitivity of the data, user experience requirements, and regulatory compliance mandates. Here are four key considerations for selecting the appropriate authentication method:</p>
 
 Risk Assessment: Evaluate the level of security risk associated with the data or systems being protected. Higher risk scenarios may warrant more stringent authentication methods, such as biometric or MFA. 
 User Experience: Consider the impact on the user. While security is paramount, overly cumbersome authentication processes can lead to poor compliance and user frustration. 
 Cost and Infrastructure: Assess the financial and infrastructure implications of deploying new authentication technologies. While advanced methods like biometric authentication offer enhanced security, they also come with higher implementation costs. 
 Compliance Requirements: Ensure that the chosen authentication method aligns with industry regulations and standards, which may dictate specific security measures. 
 
<p>Defending against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats requires understanding the unique advantages and limitations of available authentication methods, and selecting the controls that are best aligned with organizational needs and user expectations. Using the methods described above can help define an authentication strategy that ensures security measures remain robust, responsive, and user-friendly.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/saas">Software as a service</a> (SaaS) applications have become a boon for enterprises looking to maximize network agility while minimizing costs. They offer app developers on-demand scalability and faster time-to-benefit for new features and software updates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SaaS takes advantage of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-computing">cloud computing</a> infrastructure and economies of scale to provide clients a more streamlined approach to adopting, using and paying for software.</p>



<p>However, SaaS architectures can easily overwhelm DevOps teams with data aggregation, sorting and analysis tasks. Given the <a href="https://ascendixtech.com/number-saas-companies-statistics/">volume of SaaS apps on the market</a> (more than 30,000 SaaS developers were operating in 2023) and the <a href="https://www.cloudzero.com/blog/saas-statistics/#:~:text=More%20than%20half%20(53%25),use%20a%20staggering%20473%20apps.">volume of data a single app can generate</a> (with each enterprise businesses using roughly 470 SaaS apps), SaaS leaves businesses with loads of structured and unstructured data to parse.</p>



<p>That’s why today’s application analytics platforms rely on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a> (ML) technology to sift through big data, provide valuable business insights and deliver superior data observability.</p>



 What is application analytics? 



<p>Broadly speaking, application analytics refers to the process of collecting application data and performing real-time analysis of SaaS, mobile, desktop and web application performance and usage data.</p>



<p>App analytics include:</p>



 
 App usage analytics, which show app usage patterns (such as daily and monthly active users, most- and least-used features and geographical distribution of downloads). 
 



 
 App performance analytics, which show how apps are performing across the network (with metrics such as response times and failure rates) and identify the cause and location of app, server or network problems. 
 



 
 App cost and revenue analytics, which track app revenue—such as annual recurring revenue and customer lifetime value (the total profit a business can expect to make from a single customer for the duration the business relationship)—and expenditures such as customer acquisition cost (the costs associated with acquiring a new customer). 
 



<p>Using sophisticated data visualization tools, many of which are powered by AI, app analytics services empower businesses to better understand <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/it-operations">IT operations</a>, helping teams make smarter decisions, faster.</p>



 AI in SaaS analytics 



<p>Most industries have had to reckon with AI proliferation and AI-driven business practices to some extent.</p>



<p>Roughly 42% of enterprise-scale organizations (more than 1,000 employees) have used AI for business purposes, with nearly 60% of enterprises already using AI to <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2024-01-10-Data-Suggests-Growth-in-Enterprise-Adoption-of-AI-is-Due-to-Widespread-Deployment-by-Early-Adopters">accelerate tech investment</a>. And by 2026, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-10-11-gartner-says-more-than-80-percent-of-enterprises-will-have-used-generative-ai-apis-or-deployed-generative-ai-enabled-applications-by-2026">more than 80% of companies</a> will have deployed <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai"></a>AI) <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/api">)</a>AI-enabled apps in their IT environments (up from only 5% in 2023).</p>



<p>SaaS app development and management is no different.</p>



<p>SaaS offers businesses cloud-native app capabilities, but AI and ML turn the data generated by SaaS apps into actionable insights. Modern SaaS analytics solutions can seamlessly integrate with AI models to predict user behavior and automate data sorting and analysis; and ML algorithms enable SaaS apps to learn and improve over time.</p>



<p>Using comprehensive, AI-driven SaaS analytics, businesses can make data-driven decisions about feature enhancements, UI/UX improvements and marketing strategies to maximize user engagement and meet—or exceed—business goals.&nbsp;</p>



 SaaS app analytics use cases 



<p>While effective for some organizations, traditional SaaS data analysis methods (such as relying solely on human data analysts to aggregate data points) sometimes fall short in handling the massive quantities of data SaaS apps produce. They may also struggle to fully leverage the predictive capabilities of app analytics.</p>



<p>The introduction of AI and ML technologies, however, can provide more nuanced observability and more effective decision automation. AI- and ML-generated SaaS analytics enhance:</p>



 1. Data insights and reporting 



 
 
  



<p>Application analytics help businesses monitor key performance indicators (KPIs)—such as error rates, response time, resource utilization, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/customer-retention">user retention</a> and dependency rates, among other key metrics—to identify performance issues and bottlenecks and create a smoother user experience. AI and ML algorithms enhance these features by processing unique app data more efficiently.</p>



<p>AI technologies can also reveal and visualize data patterns to help with feature development.</p>



<p>If, for instance, a development team wants to understand which app features most significantly impact retention, it might use AI-driven <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing">natural language processing</a> (NLP) to analyze unstructured data. NLP protocols will auto-categorize user-generated content (such as customer reviews and support tickets), summarize the data and offer insights into the features that keep customers returning to the app. AI can even use NLP to suggest new tests, algorithms, lines of code or entirely new app functions to increase retention.</p>



<p>With AI and ML algorithms, SaaS developers also get granular <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/observability">observability</a> into app analytics. AI-powered analytics programs can create real-time, fully customizable dashboards that provide up-to-the-minute insights into KPIs. And most machine learning tools will automatically generate summaries of complex data, making it easier for executives and other decision-makers to understand reports without needing to review the raw data themselves.</p>



 2. Predictive analytics. 



<p><a></a><a></a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/predictive-analytics">Predictive analytics</a> forecast future events based on historical data; AI and ML models—such as <a></a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/linear-regression">regression analysis</a>, <a></a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/neural-networks">neural networks</a> and <a></a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/decision-trees">decision trees</a>—enhance the accuracy of these predictions. An e-commerce app, for example, can predict which products will be popular during the holidays by analyzing historical purchase data from previous holiday seasons.</p>



<p>Most SaaS analytics tools—including Google Analytics, Microsoft Azure and IBM® Instana®—offer predictive analytics features that enable developers to anticipate both market and user behavior trends &nbsp;and shift their business strategy accordingly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Predictive analytics are equally valuable for user insights.</p>



<p>AI and ML features enable SaaS analytics software to run complex analyses of user interactions within the app (click patterns, navigation paths, feature usage and session duration, among other metrics), which ultimately helps teams anticipate user behavior.</p>



<p>For instance, if a company wants to implement churn prediction protocols to identify at-risk users, they can use AI functions to analyze activity reduction and negative feedback patterns, two user engagement metrics that often precede churn. After the program identifies at-risk users, machine learning algorithms can suggest personalized interventions to re-engage them (a subscription service might offer discounted or exclusive content to users showing signs of disengagement).</p>



<p>Diving deeper into user behavior data also helps businesses proactively identify app usability issues. And during unexpected disruptions (such as those caused by a natural disaster), AI and SaaS analytics provide real-time data visibility that keeps businesses running—or even improving—in challenging times.&nbsp;</p>



 3. Personalization and user experience optimization. 



<p>Machine learning technologies are often integral to providing a personalized customer experience in SaaS applications.</p>



<p>Using customer preferences (preferred themes, layouts and functions), historical trends and user interaction data, ML models in SaaS can dynamically tailor the content that users see based on real-time data. In other words, AI-powered SaaS apps can automatically implement adaptive interface design to keep users engaged with personalized recommendations and content experiences.</p>



<p>News apps, for instance, can highlight articles similar to the ones a user has previously read and liked. An online learning platform can recommend courses or onboarding steps based on a user’s learning history and preferences. And notification systems can send targeted messages to each user at the time they’re likeliest to engage, making the overall experience more relevant and enjoyable.</p>



<p>At the application level, AI can analyze user journey data to understand the typical navigation paths users take through the app and streamline navigation for the entire user base.</p>



 4. Conversion rate optimization and marketing. 



<p>AI analytics tools offer businesses the opportunity to optimize conversion rates, whether through form submissions, purchases, sign-ups or subscriptions.</p>



<p>AI-based analytics programs can automate funnel analyses (which identify where in the conversion funnel users drop off), A/B tests (where developers test multiple design elements, features or conversion paths to see which performs better) and call-to-action button optimization to increase conversions.</p>



<p>Data insights from AI and ML also help improve product marketing and increase overall app profitability, both vital components to maintaining SaaS applications.</p>



<p>Companies can use AI to automate tedious marketing tasks (such as lead generation and ad targeting), maximizing both advertising ROI and conversation rates. And with ML features, developers can track user activity to more accurately segment and sell products to the user base (with conversion incentives, for instance).&nbsp;</p>



 5. Pricing optimization. 



<p>Managing IT infrastructure can be an expensive undertaking, especially for an enterprise running a large network of cloud-native applications. AI and ML features help <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-cost-management">minimize cloud expenditures (and cloud waste)</a> by automating SaaS process responsibilities and streamlining workflows.</p>



<p>Using AI-generated predictive analytics and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/cloud-spend-management/">real-time financial observability tools</a>, teams can anticipate resource usage fluctuations and allocate network resources accordingly. SaaS analytics also enable decision-makers to identify underutilized or problematic assets, preventing over- and under-spending and freeing up capital for app innovations and improvements.</p>

				  Add additional features to existing credential systems while preserving their original functionality with Indicio Proven.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>The emerging age of digital credentials will transform how we interact digitally, prove identity, and share data. The benefits will be reduced fraud and friction, increased data privacy and security, and the ability to create seamless processes based on data that can be instantly verified and acted on.</p>
<p>There are different kinds of credentials for different needs: some offer only basic authorization; others can manage the kind of data sharing and verification that are essential for business. The key is to be able to interoperate between the two, where a credential with limited features can be given a wrapper that preserves its original function while providing the advanced features of other credential types.</p>
<p>Enter Indicio Proven’s newest feature: a credential bridge. It’s a simple way to bridge the gap between limited and more advanced credential features and allow participation in multiple credential ecosystems.</p>
<p>For example, the Microsoft Entra Verified Identity Platform has basic features but is widely available. It only supports one credential type (JSON Web Token VC), and one DID method (DID: web); it doesn’t support OpenID4VCI (essential to interoperate with European Union’s preferred digital identity protocol), has limited digital wallet support (Microsoft Authenticator), limited governance capability, and doesn’t contain the privacy-preserving features of other verifiable credential types.</p>
<p>These features may not matter to some users, but, increasingly, we see enterprise and public sector organizations around the world opting for more expansive features to meet business, customer, and citizen needs. Why shut yourself out of these ecosystems?</p>
<p>Using Indicio Proven as your credential bridge, you don’t have to limit your options because it’s not a case of one or the other. Now, you can wrap an Entra identity in different credential formats, preserve the underlying capacity to verify it as an Entra identity, and take advantage of Indicio’s:</p>
 
 Support for additional DID methods 
 Selective disclosure, zero-knowledge proofs, and predicate proofs to share data in privacy-preserving ways. 
 Support for additional OIDC specs for interoperability with the EU. 
 Support for additional communication protocols such as DIDComm, which opens up the capacity of direct, secure communication between DID holders. 
 Enable use of peer DIDs for subjects, which improves security 
 Convert to additional credential types such AnonCreds, SD-JWT, BBS+, mDoc/mDL. 
 
<p>The point is — don’t get locked into a single path when the technology is advancing rapidly. It is highly unlikely that there will ever be a single credential format or protocol that does everything. So why not be able to use them all?</p>

<p>An explosion in new financial services experiences, powered by fintech apps for consumers and small businesses, has propelled the rise of open banking technology in the U.S. and around the world. Every player in the consumer finance arena must now rethink what is possible when consumers and small businesses have full control of their financial lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> (CFPB) is embracing this moment of innovation with the long-awaited Dodd-Frank section 1033 open banking rule, which will accelerate the adoption of open banking technologies and protect consumer interests as we move further into the digital future. This proposed rule is set to be finalized in the 2nd half of 2024. With decades of leadership in data responsibility, Mastercard’s principles align with the tenets of CFPB rulemaking and our role is to protect this data.</p>



<p>Mastercard has created this primer to demystify the provisions of CFPB section 1033 and explain how banks, fintechs and other holders of consumer financial data will be affected by the proposed rule. Read on to discover what CFPB rulemaking means for you — and how Mastercard equips customers to thrive in this new landscape.&nbsp;</p>

 <a>Where can I learn more?</a><br><br> 
 



 What is the CFPB?&nbsp; 



<p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is an independent agency of the United States federal government, established in the wake of the 2007-2008 financial crisis to protect consumers’ interests in financial markets and promote long-term stability in the broader economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The CFPB was created under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, better known as Dodd-Frank, to provide a single point of accountability for protecting consumers from unfair, deceptive or abusive financial practices and to taking action against companies that break the law.&nbsp;<br></p>



 What does the Dodd-Frank Act Section 1033 say about consumers’ rights to access financial data?&nbsp; 



<p>Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act establishes a consumers’ right to access financial data associated with the financial products and services they use, such as credit cards, deposits and savings accounts.&nbsp; This data includes account details, transactions, balances, and more (see “<a>What types of data are covered by the CFPB open banking rule?</a>” below), and subject to rules put forward by the CFPB.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>



 What is the CFPB’s role in section 1033 rulemaking?&nbsp; 



<p>Section 1033 gives the CFPB authority to issue rules governing personal financial data rights.&nbsp; The CFPB has been working toward implementing this rulemaking since 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some key milestones include:&nbsp;</p>



 
 publishing a set of consumer protection principles (2017)&nbsp; 



 holding a symposium on consumer access to financial records (2020)&nbsp; 



 releasing detailed documentation of rulemaking proposals and alternatives under consideration (2022)&nbsp; 



 convening a Small Business Review Panel and issuing a report of its findings (2023)&nbsp; 
 



<p>In October 2023, the bureau released its proposed rule and opened a period of public comment through December 29, 2023. Since then, the CFPB has been working to finalize the written regulations. Once it takes effect, the proposed rule will serve as implementation of Dodd-Frank section 1033.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>



 What parties are impacted by the CFPB section 1033?&nbsp; 



 
 Data providers – Financial institutions and&nbsp;some payment facilitators&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Third party data recipients – Fintechs and financial institutions acting on consumers’ behalf as data recipients and data aggregators acting on their behalf.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Qualified industry standard-setting bodies – CFPB-recognized issuers of fair, open, and inclusive industry standards.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 
 



 How does the proposed rulemaking impact personal financial data rights?&nbsp; 



<p>Broadly speaking, the CFPB open banking rule is a framework of regulations and industry standards that provides consumers with ownership and rights to control their financial data; enhanced consumer protections; and consistency in how data can be accessed and used.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The CFPB proposal will require financial institutions and some payment facilitators to make financial data available to consumers and authorized third-party data recipients.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The proposed rule also outlines:&nbsp;</p>



 
 obligations and limitations for how companies must collect, use and store consumer data.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 requires banks to share data in a standardized format via safe and secure application programming interfaces (APIs)&nbsp; 



 seeks to empower consumers with their finanancial data&nbsp; 



 enable better access to financial products&nbsp; 



 and jump start competition between banks of all sizes, fintechs and other digital players&nbsp;<br> 
 



 What types of data are covered by the CFPB open banking rule?&nbsp; 



 
 Transaction information, including amounts, dates, payees, historical data, and fees.&nbsp; 



 Account balances&nbsp; 



 Account and routing numbers, both tokenized and non-tokenized&nbsp; 



 Terms and conditions, including fee schedules, rates, rewards terms and overdraft coverage&nbsp; 



 Information on upcoming bills, such as minimum payment amounts 



 Basic account verification information, including names, mailing addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers.&nbsp;<br> 
 



 When does the open banking regulation take effect?&nbsp; 



<p>While the CFPB hasn’t given an exact date, it has indicated that it will finalize the proposed rule towards the end of 2024, with a tiered compliance timeline to follow, which makes it even more important that financial service providers are prepared for the change.&nbsp;</p>



 
 First, the CFPB must finalize the rulemaking.&nbsp;
 
 While the bureau hasn’t given an exact date, CFPB section 1033 is expected to be finalized in the second half of 2024, most likely in the fall.&nbsp; 
 
 



 Third Parties must comply within 60 days.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 For consumer-authorized third parties, the CFPB proposed rule becomes effective 60 days from the date of the final rulemaking.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 
 The proposed timeline for complying with the CFPB rule varies based on the size of the financial institution. Banks and other institutions that hold deposits will have between six months and four years to comply, based on their assets. Non-deposit institutions will have six or 12 months, depending on annual revenue. The CFPB has detailed this tiered approach as follows:&nbsp;

 <br>How can Mastercard help?&nbsp; 



<p>At Mastercard, we believe that consumers own their financial data; they should be in control of how and by whom it is used and should benefit from its use. Mastercard’s role is to protect this data and help data providers do the same. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The CFPB proposed rule calls for secure permissioned data-sharing across developer interfaces, or APIs. Navigating this compliance is going to be complex as financial institutions must decide to build APIs on their legacy infrastructure or outsource. As well as other areas including but not limited to consent management, info security, and third-party risk management.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Bug bounty programs are sometimes viewed with a negative connotation for a variety of reasons. This post aims to overcome implementation obstacles by debunking those misconceptions, and providing recommendations for organizations as they embark on the bug bounty journey.</p> 
 What Is a Bug Bounty Program?  
<p>First a quick definition. A bug bounty program is a security scheme offered by many websites, organizations, and software developers where individuals are paid to find security vulnerabilities. These programs incentivize independent security researchers and ethical hackers to discover and report potential flaws, making the technology more secure and reducing breach risk. So why don’t more companies have them?&nbsp;</p> 
 Common Objections to Bug Bounty Programs  
<p>I’ve been involved in a few companies where bug bounty programs were generally perceived negatively. Colleagues gave a number of reasons for not implementing a bug bounty program. These included:</p> 
  
  Too expensive  
  Takes several months before seeing results  
  It’s hard to manage and is extremely time-consuming  
  Researchers can be hostile  
  Quality of findings can be inadequate  
  
<p>However, I’ve been fully managing a bug bounty program for more than two years now and I can attest that these concerns are essentially baseless.&nbsp;</p> 
 Financial Concerns  
<p>The financial concern is misplaced since it’s significantly cheaper to find a critical vulnerability by doing a routine penetration test, or through a controlled bug bounty program, than if one of your customers discovers that vulnerability and demands a fix as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The consequences of customers and prospects finding security issues in an application can range from reduced confidence in your product, to actually losing an opportunity because the prospect considers the application insecure. This is far more expensive than the average bug bounty program. Not to mention the financial consequences of an actual security breach caused by a vulnerability.</p> 
 Results Timeline&nbsp;  
<p>Results can be obtained almost instantly. The researchers are usually highly motivated and working across multiple different time zones. Moreover, unlike penetration testing programs, which usually take place at specific points in time, bug bounty researchers test continuously. This allows you to constantly have an up-to-date understanding of your risk.</p> 
 Management and Scope  
<p>Bug bounty partner/platforms aid significantly when it comes to program management.</p> 
<p>Organizations hesitant to implement a bug bounty program can start by setting a private program that provides access to only a limited number of researchers. This gives organizations more control over the program and limits the number of reports they receive. A private program helps address concerns both about an overwhelming influx of reports and the cost of bug bounty rewards.</p> 
<p>Organizations can include production assets in the scope of their programs by disallowing certain types of testing. Common exclusions include denial of service attacks, social engineering, self-inflicting vulnerabilities, etc.</p> 
 Submissions Management  
<p>This is a more extensive topic that we will be covering in a future post, along with guidance on managing inadequate findings and researchers.</p> 
 Suggestions To Get Started  
 Preparing the Test Environment  
<p>For smaller organizations, it is usually easier to run a bug bounty program when the company only has one main core product or a limited number of offers. For larger companies that have hundreds of applications and thousands of endpoints, providing full access for testers can become a challenge.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Ideally, a new test environment that researchers can freely use to run all the needed tests will be provided. If this is not possible, most companies already have a testing environment without any real data, which can be used for providing access to researchers.</p> 
 Including Production Assets  
<p>It is recommended to include all production assets in scope for a bug bounty program, otherwise companies will likely miss vulnerabilities that are only applicable to production applications and configurations. This doesn’t necessarily mean encouraging load testing in production, rather, if somebody finds an issue in production, it must be rewarded.</p> 
<p>For example, wouldn't you like to know if a person with limited resources and an open source web scanner were able to bring down an entire production environment? That’s certainly something I’d like to fix if it happened.</p> 
<p>HYPR has made significant performance improvements by analyzing the scan patterns that researchers performed in production assets. Furthermore, even if these assets are not included under the scope, there’s usually nothing stopping actors on the internet from scanning assets that require authentication.</p> 
 Final Recommendations  
  
  Use an existing platform: Implementing a bug bounty program can be challenging and there are many recommended bug bounty platforms that can help your organization get started in no time, and they handle all the communications, accounts, payouts (especially international payments), etc.&nbsp;  
  Start with a private program: A private program will limit the amount of researchers and initial time invested.  
  Implement guardrails: If there are some assets/domains/vulnerabilities that shouldn’t be included, these can be marked as out of scope.  
  Define payouts: Bounties are a great way to motivate researchers to participate in a program. Consider increasing the bounties whenever possible — use other bug bounty participating companies in your space for guidance.  
  Include all assets in scope: Production-like environments can be added instead of production if there are concerns.

<p>Healthcare technology is rapidly evolving and digital healthcare is now the norm. In order to deliver healthcare online, payer and provider organizations need the ability to securely and seamlessly share member and patient data across their various digital healthcare systems. Interoperability and modern identity and access management (IAM) are what make this happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2016, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology’s (ONC) 21st Century Cures Act Final Rule was enacted. A significant component of the ONC’s Cures Act is its focus on interoperability. Electronic Medical Record (EMR)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Complying with the Cures Act for interoperability requires the use of two standards:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <p>&nbsp;SMART Health IT’s Substitutable Medical Applications Reusable Technologies (SMART) standard</p>
 
 <p>HL7’s Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard,&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Together, these two standards are what’s known as SMART on FHIR.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the ONC’s Rule and SMART on FHIR the stage is set for a more connected, efficient, and patient-centric healthcare system where clinical data can be more readily shared and accessed by healthcare providers, payers, consumers, and app developers alike.​</p>

This approach, a departure from traditional IT security models, assumes no inherent trust in users, devices, or networks, regardless of their location or origin. It emphasizes continuous verification and authentication, fundamentally changing the way access and credentials are managed. <br> <br> In this context, the role of signature schemes in credential issuance is critical. Traditional methods that rely on a single issuing instance are incompatible with the Zero Trust philosophy. To align with this approach, threshold signature schemes become indispensable. These schemes distribute the responsibility of credential issuance across multiple parties (or isolated systems within a domain), thereby eliminating single points of failure in the process. <br> <br> The prominent BBS+ signature scheme stands out in this distributed approach. On the one hand, it offers compatibility with various zero-knowledge proof schemes, and on the other hand, it allows credential holders to selectively disclose certain attributes, thereby strengthening both privacy and security in line with zero-trust principles. However, when adapting schemes like BBS+ to a threshold setting, a key challenge arises: the issuance process becomes highly interactive, requiring continuous communication between all issuers during signing. This interaction creates bottlenecks for systems that need to issue large numbers of credentials and introduces potential security risks by providing additional attack vectors. <br> <br> To overcome these challenges, recent advances in the form of so-called "Pseudorandom Correlation Generators" offer an interesting approach. By facilitating a pre-processing phase, this new cryptographic primitive enables non-interactive credential issuance by schemes such as BBS+, eliminating the need for per-credential issuer communication. This development dramatically reduces communication overhead while ensuring complete isolation between issuing instances. <br> <br> This talk will provide a high-level overview of these advances and their implications for credential issuance in zero-trust environments, highlighting how they can potentially improve the security and efficiency of digital identity management systems.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/threshold-signature-schemes-eic24"></a>

  <p>Contemporary institutions and record keeping systems using paper co-arose. Institutions created systems to track interactions with people over time, creating a form of institutional memory by using a range of paper-based technologies such as file record keeping and index card systems. Over the last 60 years, digital identity systems have emerged and continue to improve, thus accelerating the capacity of organizations to form institutional memories. Now we have the emergence of AI and machine learning that will advance this further - making super institutional memory. <br> <br> This session explores a reframe of seeing digital identity systems as institutional memory and considers re-framing the question as how good we want institutional memory to be when building identity systems. This could be a resolution to the race between companies, partially driven by surveillance capitalism, to collect data and regulatory bodies imposing laws and regulations on data collection in the name of “privacy”, some of which have not adjusted for new technology. These two drives are inherently in tension with each other. <br> <br> Asking "how good should institutional memory be'' transcends these two different drives and shifts the challenge of data collection out of a "corporate alone" decision or responsibility. It also invites a broader conversation with the public who interact with institutions and policy makers that regulate them. The answers to this question may be different for different types of institutions, but they can create new norms that bring different sides together to figure out how things should work and understand trade-offs and limits in new technologies such as decentralized identity.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/identity-systems-as-institutional-memory-eic24"></a>

<p>As all the requests within the network need to be authenticated, its robustness directly correlates with the overall integrity and continuity of digital and therefore-business operations.</p>
<p>Not only the availability but also low latency is key in global distributed ecosystems.</p>
<p>As experience has shown, one hyperscaler can’t guarantee this high demand in availability on its own.</p>
<p>To fulfill all these needs from businesses, applications and corporate we – together with our partners – came up with an multi region - multi hyperscaler architecture.</p>

  <p>Non-human identities are getting more and more important. IAM has the challenge to manage them with the same standards as human identities. Over the last years many tools and best practices have been developed to improve the situation. However, the more those identities mimic behavior of humans the harder current concepts work without reducing security and governance. An example is Robot Process Automation (RPA), which aims to automate processes done by humans, often for application which do not offer APIs. Subsequently those tools are using UI automation to achieve this goal. However, zero trust and identity controls like MFA or least privilege will interrupt this business processes automation.

<p>In this session, we will consider the ways in which AI will affect the subset of human interactions associated with financial transactions. The reliability and predictability that is required of systems operating in the general area of “finance,” and the large scales over which it is conducted, depend heavily on more formal, objectively measurable system performance parameters than is the case in many other domains of human behavior.</p>
<p>In the 20 minute presentation by James Garza, the transformative impact of artificial intelligence (AI) in finance will be discussed, particularly focusing on quantitative analysis and reinforcement learning, a subset of AI. Reinforcement learning can be more consistent than human traders, and this reliability allows for consistent and stable returns. Furthermore, reinforcement learning’s ability to rapidly process vast amounts of data helps identify patterns and insights humans might miss. Reinforcement Learning operates as a decision-making agent, learning from the consequences of its actions to maximise long-term rewards while minimising risks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI-powered information elements introduce both helpful and potentially harmful variables into the financial space. Also, the ways in which AI is integrated into finance can offer reproducible patterns for AI implementation in other domains, as well as lessons to be learned about potential system harms.</p>
<p>The session will offer just a glimpse of the potential AI holds for the future of finance. By harnessing AI responsibly, we can create a more inclusive, efficient, and secure financial system for all.</p>
<p>Let’s explore together:</p>
 
 
 
 Future of Personalized Finance: How might AI systems act as financial advisors that know you better than you know yourself? AI-powered algorithms can analyze your spending habits, financial goals, and risk tolerance to create personalized investment portfolios, budgeting plans, and even predict future financial needs. How will AI democratize access to financial advice, previously reserved for the wealthy. 
 Frictionless Transactions: The reliability of finance has historically been associated with endless paperwork to generate auditable paper trails for interaction accounting. AI-powered chatbots can handle routine tasks like account inquiries, fund transfers, and even loan applications, making financial transactions seamless and available 24/7. 
 Enhanced Fraud Detection AI will help to identify patterns of fraudulent activity in real-time, by analyzing massive datasets of transactions to help curb and prevent costly criminal activity. Greater reliability and confidence is a pathway to greater trust in financial systems. 
 Algorithmic Trading: With lightning-fast analysis and the ability to execute trades in milliseconds, AI-powered algorithms are already powering high-frequency trading. In the future, their impact could extend beyond Wall Street, potentially making automated investment management commonplace for individual investors. However, ethical considerations and potential market manipulation risks need careful attention. 
 Democratizing Access to Capital: AI can open doors for those traditionally excluded from traditional financial services. By assessing creditworthiness based on alternative data sources beyond credit scores, AI can enable lenders to extend loans to underserved communities, promoting financial inclusion and economic growth. This also comes with challenges, like ensuring fair and unbiased lending practices. 
 
 
 
<p>By the end of our session, attendees will have a broader perspective on the role of finance among a broad array of information systems, and how financial institutions and processes, and the many processes that are affected by finance, can be changed – for better and worse – with AI.</p>

   The statement that “to know you is to love you” has never been more true or relevant as we face more and more challenges from synthetic identity and AI-driven threats. Identity is no longer just an IT security issue but a key business enabler as businesses work to delight their consumers, partners and employees with frictionless user experiences that also improves the security of access to the data and resources IT works to protect. 
 
 We all know security is a choice people make, and if we make it difficult, people will not choose it. But if we make security seamless and put the control of what personal information can be shared, we can build trust over time and in the end get to know more about our users as we recognize them each time we engage with them.&nbsp; 
 
 In this session, I’ll introduce how IAM practitioners can establish trust through decentralized identity, leverage threat detection and mitigation tools to seamless engage users, and balance frictionless experience and security by implementing an adaptive trust model for governing access entitlements. 				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/evolution-of-identity-trust-eic24"></a>

<p>As organizations strive to harness the power of AI while controlling costs, leveraging anything as a service (XaaS) models emerges as a strategic approach. In this blog, we’ll explore how businesses can use both on-premises and cloud XaaS to control budgets in the age of AI, driving financial sustainability without compromising on technological advancement.&nbsp;</p>







 Embracing the power of XaaS&nbsp; 



<p>XaaS encompasses a broad spectrum of cloud-based and on-premises service models that offer scalable and cost-effective solutions to businesses. From software as a service (SaaS) to infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and beyond, XaaS enables organizations to access cutting-edge technologies and capabilities without the need for upfront investment in hardware or software.&nbsp;</p>



 Harnessing flexibility and scalability&nbsp; 



<p>One of the key advantages of XaaS models is their inherent flexibility and scalability, whether deployed on premises or in the cloud. Cloud-based XaaS offerings provide organizations with the agility to scale resources up or down based on demand, enabling optimal resource utilization and cost efficiency. Similarly, on-premises XaaS solutions offer the flexibility to scale resources within the organization’s own infrastructure, providing greater control over data and security.&nbsp;</p>



 Maintaining cost predictability and transparency&nbsp; 



<p>Controlling budgets in the age of AI requires a deep understanding of cost drivers and expenditure patterns. XaaS models offer organizations greater predictability and transparency in cost management by providing detailed billing metrics and usage analytics. With granular insights into resource consumption, businesses can identify opportunities for optimization and allocate budgets more effectively.&nbsp;</p>



 Outsourcing infrastructure management&nbsp; 



<p>Maintaining and managing on-premises infrastructure for AI workloads can be resource-intensive and costly. By leveraging both cloud-based and on-premises XaaS offerings, organizations can offload the burden of infrastructure management to service providers. Cloud-based XaaS solutions provide scalability, flexibility and access to a wide range of AI tools and services, while on-premises XaaS offerings enable greater control over data governance, compliance and security.&nbsp;</p>



 Accessing specialized expertise&nbsp; 



<p>Implementing AI initiatives often requires specialized skills and expertise in areas such as data science, machine learning and AI development. XaaS models provide organizations with access to a vast ecosystem of skilled professionals and service providers who can assist in the design, development and deployment of AI solutions. This access to specialized expertise enables businesses to accelerate time-to-market and achieve better outcomes while controlling costs.&nbsp;</p>



 Facilitating rapid experimentation and innovation&nbsp; 



<p>In the age of AI, rapid experimentation and innovation are essential for staying ahead of the competition. XaaS models facilitate experimentation by providing businesses with access to a wide range of AI tools, platforms and services on demand. This enables organizations to iterate quickly, test hypotheses and refine AI solutions without the need for significant upfront investment. Embracing a culture of experimentation helps businesses drive innovation while minimizing financial risk.&nbsp;</p>



 Managing budgets effectively&nbsp; 



<p>As organizations navigate the complexities of AI adoption and strive to control budgets, leveraging both on-premises and cloud XaaS models emerges as a strategic imperative. By embracing the flexibility, scalability, cost predictability and access to expertise provided by XaaS offerings, businesses can optimize costs, drive innovation and achieve sustainable growth. Whether deployed on premises or in the cloud, XaaS serves as a catalyst for success, empowering organizations to unlock the full potential of AI while maintaining financial resilience in an ever-evolving business landscape.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The average lost business cost following a data breach was USD 1.3 million in 2023, according to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/E3G5JMBP">IBM’s Cost of a Data Breach</a> report. With the rapid emergence of real-time payments, any downtime in payments connectivity can be a significant threat. This downtime can harm a business’s reputation, as well as the global financial ecosystem.</p>



<p>For this reason, it’s paramount that financial enterprises support their resiliency needs by adopting a robust infrastructure that is integrated across multiple environments, including the cloud, on prem and at the edge.</p>



 Resiliency helps financial institutions build customer and regulator confidence 



<p>Retaining customers is crucial to any business strategy, and maintaining customer trust is key to a financial institution’s success. We believe enterprises that prioritize resilience demonstrate their commitment to providing their consumers with a seamless experience in the event of disruption.</p>



<p>In addition to maintaining customer trust, financial enterprises must maintain regulator trust as well. Regulations around the world, such as the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/digital-operational-resilience-act">Digital Operational Resilience Act</a> (DORA), continue to grow. DORA is a European Union regulation that aims to establish technical standards that financial entities and their critical third-party technology service providers must implement in their ICT systems by 17 January 2025.</p>



<p>DORA requires&nbsp;financial institutions to&nbsp;define the business recovery process, service levels and recovery times&nbsp;that are acceptable for their business across processes, including payments. Traditionally, this has caused covered institutions to evaluate their cybersecurity protection measures.</p>



<p>To meet customer and regulator demands, it is critical that financial institutions are proactive and strategic about creating a cohesive strategy to modernize their payments infrastructure with resiliency and compliance at the forefront.</p>



 How IBM helps clients address resiliency in payments 



<p>As the need for operational resilience grows, enterprises increasingly adopt hybrid cloud strategies to store their data across multiple environments including the cloud, on prem and at the edge. By developing a workload placement strategy based on the uniqueness of a financial entity’s business processes and applications, they can optimize the output of these applications to enable the continuation of services 24/7.</p>



<p><a>IBM Cloud</a>®&nbsp;remains committed to providing our clients with an enterprise-grade cloud platform that can help them address resiliency, performance, security and compliance obligations.

The new design emphasizes simplicity and ease of use. In parallel with the UI enhancements, the security framework of the bridge service has also received significant upgrades to safeguard user assets and&nbsp;data.</p><p>Final Note for the recent Aergo Swap FDS&nbsp;issue</p><p>Please refer to the previous report for more detailed information.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-bridge-incident-report-317244a55b0c">Aergo Swap Incident Report (Updated-Final)</a></p><p>Since the transactions are on-chain, providing detailed information about transaction parties becomes challenging once a normal transaction is confirmed through a multi-sig wallet. However, with the bridge’s reopening today, we are gearing up for an external security audit. This audit, planned alongside the Aergo Bridges’ reopening, will include a thorough examination to address this&nbsp;issue.</p><p>Additionally, we are preparing for a major network update to seize new market opportunities which will include a security audit to ensure compliance. This audit, conducted by a reliable third party, aims to address many of the community’s concerns. Given the extensive Aergo codebase compared to other projects, this process will be both expensive and time-consuming. We are currently discussing the size and scope to ensure a comprehensive review. Once finalized, we will announce the&nbsp;details.</p><p>We will promptly share any issues or improvements identified during the audit to ensure the community can understand and discuss our response. Following the completion of this audit, we plan to undertake additional work based on the audit report.

<p>This blog has been written as an explainer to support the wider <a href="https://lee.darkmatterlabs.org/">Life-Ennobling Economics conversation</a>. It is focused on the LEE aspiration of moving beyond colonising capital and explores how this could be applied to financing a FreeHouse. The work is part of a collaborative initiative between Dark Matter’s Next Economics Lab and Radicle Civics&nbsp;Arc.</p><p>In our work at Dark Matter Labs we talk a lot about the need to respect and steward the shared commons. Whilst a Commons framing is frequently associated with governing communal resources such as grazing land and fishing stocks, it can also be applied to less tangible value flows. Real estate prices are an interesting example. Driven by diverse contributions, from local businesses and schools to parks and improved transport links, the shared value generated is largely captured by privately owned assets. Put another way, public investment is driving private wealth. A logical intervention is to bring land and buildings into common stewardship, rendering embedded dynamics such as price speculation and extractive rent obsolete.</p><blockquote>So far so good but there is a giant elephant in the room: how can we bring a house or a piece of land into common ownership in the first place? Why would an existing property owner give up their rights to receive future benefits? If we need to borrow money and generate future financial returns to secure the initial site, are we simply perpetuating the status quo in the name of a new economy? If the transfer is funded by philanthropy or gifted, how will this translate into shifts in the ‘real’&nbsp;economy?</blockquote> Setting a strong intention for practical action <p>Recently we have received feedback questioning whether this kind of discussion is adding anything of value. There is a rising and palpable sense of frustration. Rhetoric and provocations are one thing, but are they really doing anything to help? Are they of any practical use to those at the frontline of the housing crisis? Actually we agree, but from a yes / and perspective. We absolutely need practical action, but let’s not forget that the actions taken in response to the 2008 financial crisis are a big driver for the mess that we find ourselves in today. Perhaps if more inclusive conversations had taken place, involving diverse voices, things would have evolved differently. We can’t know for sure, but demystifying topics such as finance and governance is core to our&nbsp;work.</p><blockquote>So here we are wondering what to do about the entrenched dynamics of housing and the financial system. Where should we start? Probably with a few obvious yet difficult questions: how can we interact with finance to bring a house into common ownership? In doing so, what would be the least extractive way possible? If we manage, what kind of financial setup would ensure that regenerative and equitable intentions sit at the heart of its operations? Critically, how can we test our ideas on the&nbsp;ground?</blockquote><p>We are using the following principles to develop non-extractive pathways for bringing a house into the commons. The aim is to apply these examples to a FreeHouse demonstrator that <a href="https://radiclecivics.cc/">Radicle Civics</a> intend to start work on later this year. We also hope to connect with mainstream financial actors who are innovating in this field to test our assumptions. If you are working in this field and would be interested to join a conversation then please do get in&nbsp;touch:</p><p>Financing principles for a FreeHouse:</p>  No economic rent (generated by the set up funding or in the ongoing operation);  Utilise multi-sensory, ‘buffer’ metrics (to reduce unintended value extraction);  Minimise new money creation (to reduce future claims on finite resources);  IOE — Infinite Outcome Exchange¹ (remove capital from the current extractive, overshoot economy in exchange for infinite economic outcomes e.g. solidarity, knowledge)  Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@journosousa?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Aaron Sousa</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a>  No economic&nbsp;rent  <p>Economic rent = income derived from ownership or control over a limited asset or resource. Such income is attained without any expenditure or effort on behalf of the resource holder OR the income is in excess of their opportunity cost i.e. the minimum the asset holder would accept to transfer or invest&nbsp;it².</p><p>In the context of a Freehouse, we want to protect against two sources of economic&nbsp;rent:</p>  Re-commoning the House: to begin the Freehouse journey we need to transfer the ownership of the House from the market to the Commons. This involves making a capital payment to the current holders of the property rights. We want to design this initial funding agreement so that the provider of financial capital does not receive any economic&nbsp;rent.  Financing the Commons: once the House is under commons stewardship the intention is that it will generate value to support itself, via activities such as community energy and user contributions. The goal will then be to direct any unused financial surplus to align with the no-rent principle. One example of this would be to create a fund for future house projects to reduce the external capital required on start-up. Surplus above a set percentage could be automatically redistributed to this&nbsp;fund.  <p>2. Utilise, multi-sensory ‘buffer’&nbsp;metrics</p><p>Where measures of success are required to secure funding, we will strive to incorporate indicators that respect the intrinsic and entangled values that are generated by living systems. This principle aims to avoid the erosion of often unnoticed stocks and flows of value in pursuit of a defined one. For example, if outcomes based financing is secured for planned community solar panels, we might unintentionally disrupt vital pollinator habitats in the area surrounding the house whilst striving to meet this singular target. If multi-point and multi-sensory indicators are used to validate outcomes and improve the learning capacity of governance systems, misaligned incentives can be&nbsp;reduced.</p><blockquote>The Rumsfeld Matrix of knowns and unknowns:</blockquote><blockquote>“Reports that say that something hasn’t happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns — the ones we don’t know we don’t know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tends to be the difficult ones” — Donald Rumsfeld, US Secretary of Defence,&nbsp;2002</blockquote><p>3. Minimise future&nbsp;claims</p><p>This principle will keep the amount of new credit used (i.e. commercial bank loans) to a minimum. Where a loan is deemed the most appropriate financing instrument, we will strive to find a product that is linked to existing savings (e.g. Credit Union loans). By doing this, the intention is to take a stand against unsustainable future claims on the environment and increasing fragility of the global financial system. When new money is created, this credit (together with its associated interest) creates a future productive liability, which equates to a future claim on the energy and materials that will be required to settle it. The physical claims are coded into fiat money³ creation and at current levels are essentially a fatal contract with the future of the&nbsp;Earth⁴.</p><p>4. IOE (Infinite Outcome Exchange)</p><p>Here the house will playfully subvert the concept of Outcomes Based Financing. The aim is to provide infinite returns such as reciprocity, trust and knowledge in exchange for non-returnable financial capital. The principle is based on an aspiration to remove fiat money from circulation and thus in a small way weaken its extractive power. In its current form fiat money converts complex, entangled values into an abstract and highly liquid exchange medium. If you wanted to, you could exchange a Canadian lynx for a barrel of oil, potentially even making a profit in the process⁵. Incredibly, you could do so from such an emotional and physical distance that you wouldn’t even need to question the morality of your actions. Our current monetary system rewards the exploitation and pollution of everything that we need to thrive (and even survive), whilst money itself self-perpetuates, creating an ever increasing cycle of destruction.</p><blockquote>How could this work in practice? Perhaps the European Investment Bank (or a development bank) could step up to invest in the non-specific benefits of city transitions? By doing so it could set a precedent to shift outcomes based financing to a new level for other transition initiatives. If the benefits are achieved then the surplus could even be paid-forward to a public trust to improve other local services.</blockquote> Using speculative case studies to test the edges of what might be&nbsp;possible <p>The four speculative case studies described below have been designed to match the motivations of capital holders with the principles outlined above. They might seem far-fetched at first, but for each case study we have included some potential pathways that align with existing organisations and financial motivations. The next step will be to socialise them with people working in these areas for critical feedback.</p><blockquote>We are genuinely curious and open to be challenged. What are we missing? What are we getting wrong? Are there similar or adjacent innovations being developed?</blockquote>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@lunarts?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Volodymyr Hryshchenko</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a><p>1Layered economy&nbsp;approach</p><p>This will involve looking at the different economies that the House will be part of (e.g. land, materials, energy generation, right-of-use) and matching them to appropriate funding streams. This could take the form of a portfolio of investments, loans and grants which have differential interest rates depending on the activity supported. The idea would be to create a matching platform to work out where differential interest rates, grants or preferential loans terms that are already on offer can be matched with elements of the House’s economy. For the model to remain non-extractive each funding stream will need to be carefully assessed in terms of fair effort or opportunity cost (for example an ultra low interest rate would be a significant opportunity cost for the investor).</p><p>As an example, a three way split could be proposed as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Right-of-use economy: for the areas of the House that are designated for residents, an ultra long-term loan (10 years +) could be used to secure a fixed monthly cost. This might suit a private impact investor or local pension scheme interested in supporting just transition outcomes.  Creative economy: for paying guests (accommodation and events), a more flexible shorter-term loan could be arranged based on forecast guest income. Potentially, paydowns could be planned to align with the busy visiting periods i.e. immediately after summer. For this type of funding to meet the ‘no economic rent’ principle the lender could commit to developing pathways to make it easier for other mixed housing models to access preferential loan rates. An example would be to use the <a href="http://www.positivemoney.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021_Building-Renovation-TLTROs.pdf">ECB’s TLTROs</a> (targeted long term refinancing operations) as an onramp for other alternative housing&nbsp;models.  Generative systems: grants or incentivised green loans could support the installation of renewable energy systems. The surplus generated would provide additional income to paydown the other loans further in the&nbsp;future.  <p>Potential applications:</p>  Financial actors: private impact investor, local pension fund, business lenders, government matched funding for green initiatives.  Motivations: reputation, ESG compliance, political pressure for banks to play their part in a just transition.  Proposed agreement: mixed contracts via a central platform.  Potential partners / collaborators: Positive Money Europe has been<a href="https://unlock.green/about/"> campaigning</a> for commercial banks to play their part in green home renovations by leveraging European Central Bank (ECB) monetary policy instruments. One suggested pathway is to channel preferential interest rates offered on TLTROs (targeted long term refinancing operations) towards sustainability loans. These loans can be at extremely low or even negative interest rates. A coalition of German development banks recently co-issued <a href="https://www.imug-rating.de/en/news-en/first-german-social-community-bond-wins-environmental-finances-bond-award-2023/">a social bond</a> linked to affordable housing provision and might be interested in providing low interest finance (Investitionsbank des Landes Brandenburg<a href="http://www.ilb.de/"> (ILB)</a>, <a href="http://www.ifbhh.de/">IFB Hamburg</a>, <a href="http://www.isb.rlp.de/">ISB&nbsp;Mainz</a>)  <blockquote>Terms like targeted ‘long term financing operations’ and ‘central bank monetary policy instruments’ can seem technocratic and removed from everyday life. In reality, they are not as complicated as we might be led to believe. For example, TLTROs are simply long-term loans made by the European Central Bank to commercial banks, at low or even negative interest rates, to stimulate lending to customers⁶. Organisations like Positive Money are doing a brilliant job of debunking and opening these topics up for conversation. In fact, central banks exist in service of economic stability so their role in addressing the public housing crisis would seem a logical extension of their current&nbsp;remit.</blockquote><p>2Resilience investment mortgage</p><p>This proposal is based on the risk exposure of mortgage providers. Tighter ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) reporting requirements are forcing lenders to openly state their strategies for hedging against cascading climate and social risks. We see this as an opportunity to design a new class of mortgage, where the provider makes an advanced purchase order for future resilience as part of the agreement. In practical terms, this would mean that a proportion of the mortgage loan would not be repayable. Initially this would be a direct cost to the mortgage provider, based on the risk of future weather damage or defaults due to the rising cost of living. The remainder of the mortgage would be a standard arrangement where the House would make regular repayments plus interest. However, the advance resilience discount would in effect reduce the interest paid compared to a regular mortgage.</p><p>For example:</p><p>If the cost of the property was EUR 200,000 and the future risk was assessed at&nbsp;15%</p>  Risk cost = EUR 16k (15% *&nbsp;200,000)  Base mortgage = EUR 184 (residual value)  <blockquote>We appreciate that not everyone is interested, familiar or comfortable with accounting. This is actually something we would like to address. Why should the inner workings of professions like accountancy remain out of reach? Given their impact on decision making at the highest levels, it seems a missed opportunity to leave it in the hands of a small sector of society. For anyone that is interested the accounting entries on the mortgage providers books could work as&nbsp;follows:</blockquote><p>Potential applications:</p>  Financial actor: a mortgage provider with a high volume of mortgage loans in a specific&nbsp;area.  Motivation: protecting against the future risk of mortgage defaults (e.g. caused by extreme weather, cost of living pressures).  Proposed agreement: Part advance purchase order, part mortgage.  Potential partners / collaborators: Mortgage providers who are innovating in the field such as <a href="https://www.lloydsbank.com/business/corporate-banking/specialist-teams/sustainability-and-esg-financing.html">ESG Financing at Lloyds&nbsp;Bank</a>.  Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@lg17?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Lance Grandahl</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a><p>3Strategic co-investment</p><p>This proposal looks at stakeholders providing a non-returnable financial investment and becoming partners with the House for mutually beneficial activities. The motivation for the investor would be having access to the House to test innovative technologies or to become part of its creative infrastructure. For example, a private company could co-invest (with The House) in the opportunity to test computational value mapping tools. A university might partner with the House to look at the links between collaborative living and sustainable outcomes. The capital would not be repayable and the house would be investing itself as an innovation catalyst.</p><p>Potential applications:</p>  Financial actor: private tech company, university, performing arts&nbsp;group.  Motivation: innovation potential, reputation, ESG.  Proposed agreement: time bound generative use of the house in exchange for a non-returnable financial investment.  Potential partners / collaborators: universities who are focused on exploring new economic thinking in urban environments, for example the <a href="https://www.tu.berlin/studieren/studienangebot/gesamtes-studienangebot/studiengang/urban-management-m-sc">Urban Management Programme at Technische Universität Berlin.</a>  <p>4Joint ownership linked to pay-it-forwards mortgage</p><p>Here the suggestion is for a lender to become a co-owner of the House, and for the House to gradually purchase the lender’s share until it owns itself in full. This type of arrangement allows for a better alignment of shared risk at the outset. Over the period of co-ownership the House would pay rent to the lender for using the part that is still under their ownership. The principle is similar to Islamic Diminishing Musharaka Financing Products (DMFPs) which are designed to avoid income being generated via interest.</p><p>With existing DMFPs the rent is normally fixed, but there is potential for the rent to be linked to the surplus generated from the house’s activities. In this case, the mortgage agreement would stipulate that the principal repayments are based on a percentage of the surplus generated by the house. If there is no surplus nothing is due and no ‘rent’ accrues. This idea could be extended into a pay-it-forward solidarity mortgage. For example, a proportion of any surplus could be used to repay the principal and a percentage placed into a protected account for future house projects.</p><p>Potential applications:</p>  Financial actor: credit union, progressive mortgage provider.  Motivation: strengthening lender balance sheet positions, political pressure.  Proposed agreement: co-ownership and rent linked to surplus generated being paid for use of the non-owned space.  Potential partners / collaborators: <a href="https://www.syndikat.org/en/">Miethäusersyndikat</a> for their expertise on solidarity forward funding, value aligned investment platforms such as <a href="https://urban.partners/">Urban Partners.</a>   Next steps <p>As a collaboration between Dark Matter’s Next Economics Lab and the Radicle Civics Arc, we are currently developing a proposal to begin practical work on a FreeHouse Demonstrator later this year. In the meantime, we are looking to convene some focussed discussion groups to test the viability of alternative financing ideas.

  <p>With the growing exposure of digital services and assets through application programming interfaces (APIs) and the emergence of the API Economy, entire business models are starting to be built around APIs. Increasingly, APIs are designed to be used externally as part of an organisation’s service delivery model.</p>
<p>The adoption of the OAuth protocol has allowed consumer-to-business (C2B) integrations to authorise access to APIs in a standardised way. However, business-to-business (B2B) integrations using OAuth are now rapidly growing, and as API ecosystems become more complex, there is an urgent need for further standardisation. Although OAuth supports direct B2B integration, there is no standard way to implement delegated B2B authorisation because OAuth delegation was primarily designed for C2B integration where the resource owner is an individual consumer.</p>
<p>There are use cases where, for an online business to provide services to their customers, they need authorised access to resources owned by the customer organisation at third-party resource providers.</p>
<p>In this session, we will explore how OAuth and its extensions, such as rich authorisation requests and token exchange grant types, can be used to allow a resource owner client to dynamically delegate access to its resources to another client using delegated B2B authorisation.</p>
<p>The presentation will cover the following topics:</p>
 
 Business use case for B2B delegated authorisation 
 Brief overview of the OAuth 2.0 protocol 
 Proposed enhancements to the OAuth 2.0 standard to achieve interoperable B2B delegated authorisation 
 Security considerations

However, AI agents are often hampered by the lack of necessary context to complete critical tasks. Sharing unrestricted access to personal data with an AI agent leads to serious privacy concerns. <br> <br> This presentation seeks to address these challenges by introducing a novel approach utilizing verifiable credentials and identity wallets to give an AI agent selective access to personal data in a privacy preserving manner. Trinsic’s CEO, Riley Hughes, will share a never-before-seen demo of how a user can create a trusted identity in the form of a verifiable credential, then utilize the identity attributes to allow an AI agent to act on his behalf in a personalized manner. While the actions are performed by the AI agent, there will be a trusted link back to a real human who has given verifiable permission to the AI agent to access their data.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/preserving-privacy-data-sharing-eic24"></a>

While Identity and Access Management systems have improved greatly with the increased usage of MFA, PAMs, federated identity, AD &amp; Azure AD, and detection and response systems such as EDR, SIEMs and XDR, successful, massive breaches leveraging identity still are occurring regularly. Why? How? In many organizations there are major vulnerability and detection gaps between primarily preventive IAM controls and increasingly common attacker tools and techniques that circumvent them. This is most evident post initial compromise where more sophisticated attackers show off their skills in the middle of the attack chain to move laterally and escalate their privileges on their way to the organization’s crown jewels. As with every attacker move there is a defender counter move. This has led to the emergence of identity threat detection and response (ITDR) solutions. Can ITDR solutions and associated security processes break the middle of the attack chain?</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/cybercriminals-after-all-these-years-eic24"></a>

   Have you ever wanted to control a powerful AI?  Now you can, with prompt engineering!  Prompt engineering is the art of using specific instructions, or prompts, to tell large language models (LLMs) what you want them to do. By carefully crafting prompts, you can direct LLMs to produce specific results, such as writing a poem, translating a document, or answering a complex question.  In this talk,

  <p>The continued growth in global trade and e-commerce, remote working and travel means that global interoperability is front of mind for public and private sector organisations looking to provide privacy and convenience to their citizens and customers. This session will examine the three major considerations for achieving this important cross-border interoperability.</p>
<p>The in-depth presentations are based on the findings and exploration of an international working group spear headed by DNP, the multinational pioneering a new identity network for Japan and beyond. DNP brings 150 years of innovation through combining their unique technologies cultivated from the print industry together with the strengths of partners to forge new opportunities, reduce emissions, and create a more vibrant world for all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Each focus area under consideration will describe the problem to be solved, the solution that the working group adopted and the rationale for the adopted approach across:</p>
<p>Governance&nbsp;– different digital ID schemes have specific rules determining who can participate in the network and the obligations on those participants. The session will explore the key points required to ensure that global participants have confidence in the system.</p>
<p><br> Technical interoperability&nbsp;– it is important that a credential issued by an organisation in one country can be verified by an organisation in another country. The session will take a deep dive in the options and choices made to ensure technical interoperability, including the design and operation of a conformance service.</p>
<p>Commercial&nbsp;– compensation for service providers delivering the infrastructure is a key part of the commercialisation model. The session will compare the different models and outline how international alignment can be achieved.</p>
<p>The session will include the opportunity for the audience to ask the presenters questions about the choices and challenges along the way.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/multi-stakeholder-cross-border-identity-eic24"></a>

We'll try things like adding new role-based access controls to an application and evolving it to fine-grained attribute-based access controls. Along the way, we will run into typical blockers and try out ways to solve them. We'll also look at best practices for authorization (role management, policy evolution, the filtering problem, etc.) and when to just use the most obvious solution.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/uncomplicate-authorization-maintenance-eic24"></a>

  <p>Is securing your cloud security different from securing other forms of IT? You would think so from the alphabet soup of acronyms around the subject.<br>Organizations are exploiting cloud because they help to accelerate business changes without the need for capital expenditure or lengthy procurement delays to obtain hardware. However, the dynamic nature of cloud services creates new security challenges that need a dynamic approach to governance and security controls.<br>In addition, the responsibilities for security and compliance are shared between the CSP (Cloud Service Providers) and the cloud customer and it is up to the customer to ensure that they use the cloud in a secure and compliant manner. On top of that each cloud service provides its own proprietary tools for security. KuppingerCole Leadership Compass on CNAPP will help you to make sense of this.<br><br>How can an organization be sure that it is using cloud services securely and in a way that meet its compliance obligations and its appetite for risk? This presentation will provide an overview of the risks and how these tools can help.<br>After attending this presentation, you will be able to:</p>
 
 Describe the major risks related to the way organizations use cloud services. 
 Explain why cloud services need dynamic rather than static controls.

  <p>From what used to be a purely technical concept created to make developers’ lives easier, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) have evolved into one of the foundations of modern digital business. APIs are now powering the logistics of delivering digital products to partners and customers. Almost every software product or cloud service now comes with a set of APIs for management, integration, monitoring, or a multitude of other purposes.<br> <br> This evolution only continues to accelerate. As new digital transformation initiatives across various industries emerge, diverse business models are reshaping the technical requirements for API development and operations dramatically. New standards, technologies, and development methodologies introduced by the need to support numerous use cases have also introduced additional complexity to existing API management platforms.<br> REST APIs are still commonly used today, but they are increasingly augmented or displaced with a variety of alternative protocols and standards, such as GraphQL or gRPC. In fact, the industry is evolving so fast that API management solutions in their traditional sense, like API gateways, can already be considered IT legacy products.<br> <br> In a sense, API security has long become an industry of its own; with the scope of risks and challenges the industry confronts growing exponentially, API security solutions have to expand their coverage and grow in complexity themselves. Providing comprehensive protection against the broad range of API-specific threats and doing it consistently throughout the whole lifecycle of an API is complex. In this session, the results of our latest market research will be presented, helping you to understand the critical capabilities and to select the right solution for your specific problems and requirements.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/api-security-and-management-eic24"></a>

  <p>With the European Union's Network and Information Security (NIS2) directive being in effect in October 2024, it is estimated that 40000 German companies do not realize they must comply with the directive. One of the big questions is how companies could prepare for the NIS2 Directive, especially if they are using cloud-native infrastructures. The talk will discuss on what are the steps needed to make the clouds to be ready for NIS2.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/is-your-cloud-nis2-ready-eic24"></a>

  <p>Sign-on standards, such as SAML and OpenID Connect (OIDC), have paved the way for an interoperable identity fabric that has propelled the industry forward. It’s time for authorization to have its “OIDC moment.”<br> <br> <br> Over the past few years, we’ve seen the rise of a new architectural pattern - externalizing authorization logic out of applications, and treating it as a separate concern. Google, Netflix, Airbnb, Carta, Intuit, and others have shared their experiences around how they’ve built their internal authorization systems, helping seed a growing movement around modern authorization.<br> <br> Most organizations, however, don’t have the luxury of building these systems from scratch. Fortunately, a new generation of authorization vendors have created innovative solutions that promise to democratize modern authorization. With that said, each of these solutions defines its own APIs. In much the same way identity standards such as OIDC brought about “single sign-on for the web”, authorization standards promise to reduce barriers to adoption, increase reusability, and mitigate risk for organizations that want to take advantage of this innovation.<br> <br> To get this off the ground, a group of authorization practitioners and vendors, including those represented on this panel, submitted a charter proposal to the OpenID Foundation for the establishment of the AuthZEN working group. The charter was accepted shortly after IIW 37 in October 2023. Since then, the group has been developing use cases, cataloging authorization patterns, and drafting proposals such as an interop spec for a PEP-PDP protocol. These efforts will unify a set of disparate ecosystems into a larger authorization community, which will create a rising tide for the industry at large.<br> <br> Join us to discuss the current state of modern authorization. We’ll also describe the progress we’ve made defining authorization patterns, documenting use-cases and how best to accomplish them, and reviewing the interoperability standards we have drafted.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/panel-standards-for-modern-authorization-eic24"></a>

  <p>Whether you are excited about the possibilities of AI in your workplace or concerned about the overall privacy risks implementing the technology with a mind of its own - you can’t deny that AI is here to stay. It is bound to impact several facets of the world of access control and authorization. Take policies for instance: as humans, we seldom excel at implementing every single requirement into policy. Just typing in that employees are not able to access certain data in a time frame but not including time zone, relationship to employer, country access is coming from, etc., can lead to incorrect access. Integrating AI to ask relevant questions regarding a policy, work in sandboxes to share clear meanings, and provide coaching along the way allow for faster fine-tuning of the overall restrictions. David Brossard will dive into the opportunities AI has when it comes to authoring and employing the most accurate and precise policies all along the process of employing trustworthy and efficient access control.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/deliver-better-and-stronger-authorization-eic24"></a>

  <p>In the last 10 years machine learning has become ubiquitous and touches all lives in ways that was unimaginable before. The machines can make decisions that required considerable human effort at a much faster speed and reduced cost with a little human oversight. As a result, machines don’t just have a higher than before influence in shaping our lives but are also under increased scrutiny by both regulators as well as user rights advocates.</p>
<p>The adage “with great power comes great responsibility” has long been used – from French revolution to superhero comics. It has never been truer as the great power that machine learning wields is now in the hands of almost anyone making a software product. It ranges from giving people access to the funds that can alter their lifepath, medical diagnosis that can increase their life expectancy or reduce it dramatically to their social media feed that cannot just provide them the content that keeps them engaged, but also polarise their beliefs by feeding them information that reinforces their existing notions.</p>
<p>Given this, it’s important to look at AI from lens of Responsible and Ethical AI where the talk will go through Fairness (discrimination-free algorithms), explainability (from data, model, business, risk and counterfactuals), Privacy (design and algorithms), accountability, sustainability. The talk will give real life examples from different domains and suggestions on implementation methods of RAI. And extend the concept of RAI to much talked about Gen AI (ChatGPT, BARD etc) as well.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/will-ai-be-a-good-neighbor-eic24"></a>

GLEIF is committed to making concrete and lasting improvements to the process of identity verification by leveraging the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) in digital tools. GLEIF has made the LEI verifiable by creating the vLEI (verifiable LEI) with digital credentials that deliver decentralized identification and verification for organizations as well as the persons who represent their organizations either in official or functional roles. GLEIF has developed the governance, credentials and infrastructure since introducing the vLEI in 2020, will share an update on progress and will provide a pilot example addressing the identification, authentication, authorization, security and management of users in charge of submitting mandated supervisory reporting.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/organizational-identity-in-the-private-eic24"></a>

  <p>When it comes to implementing a Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) system, many organizations often focus solely on selecting a product or vendor and negotiating the associated licensing costs.</p>
<p>While this method may indeed be the correct one, making the right technological choices in a business context requires a more nuanced approach and more careful analysis. Purchasing a product is not the only option available. The necessary analysis includes evaluating factors such as time-to-market, total cost of ownership, and the level of control and flexibility needed to integrate into the existing business and technology setting. Additionally, there are also questions about support for open standards and how quickly and cost-effectively future requirements can be addressed. Large organizations with extensive internal and external integrations, particularly those in regulated sectors like financial services, may have additional unique requirements.</p>
<p>In this session, we will explore various strategies for implementing an enterprise-level CIAM platform. These strategies include purchasing and deploying an off-the-shelf product, building a custom solution from scratch, and adopting a blended approach that combines both approaches. Each of these options presents its own set of advantages, drawbacks, and trade-offs.</p>
<p>The presentation will cover the following topics:<br>- Brief introduction to Customer IAM and how it differs from Workforce IAM.<br>- Main business use cases and importance of the customer identity today.<br>- Introduction of the three main approaches that organizations can use to implement the CIAM solution.<br>- Detailed evaluation focusing on advantages, drawbacks and trade-offs of each approach.<br>- Summary and recommendations.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/customer-identity-and-access-management-eic24"></a>

  <p>In IAM parlance, a "first party" context is when a single organisation owns both the identity provider as well as the relying party applications that are connected to it. <br> <br> There is little doubt that OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 are great standards and have done much to enable federated identity ecosystems across the globe. While there is a tendency for IAM professionals to argue for the use of these protocols in virtually any situation, the reality is that they were designed and built with the third-party use case in mind, and there can often be significant obstacles to delivering an elegant customer experience in a first-party context.<br> <br> In this session, Rob will explore some of the obstacles and objections he has faced when proposing OpenID Connect and OAuth 2 for real-world CIAM deployments, with particular focus on <br> - brand experience<br> - multi-channel interoperability<br> - developer productivity, and<br> - session management</p>

  <p>In an era dominated by digital connectivity, Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) stands as the gatekeeper of user interactions and data access. However, despite its proclaimed prowess, CIAM solutions are failing customers and businesses alike.</p>
<p>This presentation looks into the glaring gaps in identity management solutions, unraveling the reasons behind their failures, and proposing a paradigm shift in approach.<br>We will explore the systemic flaws plaguing CIAM solutions, highlighting their inability to cater to evolving user needs and safeguard sensitive data.</p>
<p>The conventional reliance on passwords as a primary security measure has become a glaring vulnerability. Moreover, the myopic focus of current vendors on technical functionality neglects the critical aspects of user experience and the profound business impacts of fractured identity management.</p>
<p>This session aims to dissect the broken facets of identity management, showcasing how passwords have outlived their efficacy and why the status quo of CIAM solutions is untenable. By examining real-world scenarios and industry trends, we'll illustrate the growing dissonance between user expectations and the capability of existing CIAM frameworks to meet those demands.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/rethinking-ciam-and-identity-management-eic24"></a>

  <p>The rapid evolution of AI has grabbed attention, including a focus on its impact on human needs and aspirations, and on potential harms. AI, is, however, not the only recent digital information technology that affects the human condition. The focus on AI offers a prompt for examination of the human condition generally and its relationship to the social interaction and information environment, and the potential for impact of digital information technologies – beyond AI systems - on human rights.</p>
<p>We’ve all heard of “Secure-by-Design,” “Privacy-by-Design,” “User-centered Design,” “Human-centric Design” and other similar invitations to consider human-related elements at the inception of information system initiatives. Building off of the “Human-Centric Digital Identity” whitepaper recently published by 13 non-profits, Elizabeth and Henk&nbsp; argue that many well-intentioned identity solutions – including many designed with “user-centric” or “human-centric” principles at their core - have had unanticipated and unintended negative human rights consequences.</p>
<p>While such consequences may be understandable in the context of such fast-moving technologies like biometrics, AI, and growing server capacities to deliver change at pace and at scale, the potential for rapid erosion of human rights, which reflects the human condition generally, is also accelerating. In these high-pace, high-uncertainty environments, it is imperative that Human Rights and human values underpin design (and implementation) decisions. Helpfully, the core of human rights aspirations are shared globally, so the attention to such broadly shared rights has the potential to help us identify corresponding global standards for “duties” to which parties across the species will voluntarily self-bind, and by so doing breathe life into aspirational “rights” to make them realities.</p>
<p>This session will discuss some of the tensions that practitioners grapple regarding project and product life-cycles, and suggest approaches to help manage the paradoxes. The discussion will explore the human rights impacts of quickly-evolving technologies and the challenges of predicting and managing future outcomes of complex digital information network systems, the organization and operation of which, reflect myriad business, operating, legal, technical, and social goals and aspirations.</p>
<p>In these high-pace, high-uncertainty environments, it is imperative that Human Rights and human values underpin design (and implementation) decisions. Building on their talks at EIC 2023, the panelists delve deeper into how we can manage the many variables and support human rights goals and expectations in digital systems.. They will highlight various new industries to consider emerging best practices and discuss how Human Rights can be most effectively operationalized by governments and private entities.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/panel-design-for-a-fast-changing-world-eic24"></a>

Businesses generate data about themselves and other natural and legal persons, and they are the authentic source of the attributes they generate. Hypervault (<a href="https://hypervault.com/">https://hypervault.com/</a>) and Trust Agency (<a href="https://www.trust-agency.eu/">https://www.trust-agency.eu/</a>) are collaborating on a study to explore the use of attributes generated in business entities, the impact on business processes, and the requirements for issuing, distributing, and validating trustworthy attributes. This presentation will disseminate some of the outcomes of that study, including what businesses need to do to tap into the potential of these authentic business attributes. We will also discuss how eIDAS 2 can help exploit the potential of these attributes to improve automation, strengthen security, and even open up new business processes that were previously impossible.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/authentic-source-for-attributes-eic24"></a>

  <p>In the digital era, the security and privacy of personal and sensitive information have become a critical concern. Digital identity wallets have been introduced as a result of the new European regulation known as eIDAS 2.0. The digital identity wallet offers a practical and secure method for individuals to manage their personal data across various online platforms through a decentralized digital identity management model, without the reliance on centralized identity providers. However, since the model is relatively new, the security and privacy threats are still not fully known; this makes it difficult to prevent data breaches, unauthorized access, and violations of user privacy.<br>This session will delve into the emerging threats by providing a high-level overview of potential threats applicable to the digital identity wallet, derived from academic literature, technical specifications, and relevant regulations (including eIDAS 2.0).</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/digital-identity-wallets-eic24"></a>

  <p>The concept of building trust relationships is an integral part of a decentralized ecosystem. A verifier must trust the identities of issuers to ensure the authenticity and integrity of data and a wallet must trust the identities of verifiers to ensure data is only sent to identified and authorized parties. The other important trust relationship is in the identity of the wallet and assures both issuer and verifier that they are communicating with a genuine, verified and unaltered wallet. Especially in the environment of eIDAS 2.0, this trust becomes all the more important, as highly sensitive and regulated use cases require a secure environment in the wallet. Among other things, device binding, user binding and wallet authenticity must be proven and issued in a wallet attestation in a technology-neutral and interoperable manner. In this presentation, the general concept of wallet attestations is explained, followed by the current state of discussions in the eIDAS process and the Architecture Reference Document (ARF). Furthermore, I explain the technical realization using the IETF Draft Attestation-Based Client Authentication and how it integrates into the omnipresent OpenID4VCI protocol.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/mechanisms-for-the-decentralized-ecosystem-eic24"></a>

  <p>The success of decentralised digital identity is dependent on a solid, self-sustaining, privacy-friendly business model. The more credentials will be available, the more use-cases will be generated. Making available verified and reusable data will act as a flywheel to both the uptake among end-users and the adoption among service providers. After all, the more credentials, the more use-cases, the higher the value for all users. However, to make available credentials, organisations need to be rewarded. Most credentials under discussion today can be issued by (semi-)governmental organisations, such as a mobile drivers license, social security cards, diploma's, or professional attestations. Making available this data is typically a public task. Private sector organisations, however, will not be so keen to make available data. They have gone through costly, cumbersome procedures to verify user data, for example for KYC purposes. They will want to see a reward for making available this data, as well as assurances on liability for further use. <br> <br> This talk will discuss possible business models for decentralised identity and the European Digital Identity Wallet (EUDIW) in particular, for the different roles involved such as attribute providers, wallet providers, and relying parties. We will look at examples from existing implementations, and compare what works - and what does not. We consider monetisation models, governance, and prerequisities. This presentation will lead to options and scenarios that may provide input to the architectural reference framework (ARF) and EUDIW implementation.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/business-models-for-decentralized-identity-eudiw-eic24"></a>

However, an unintended side effect of this growth is an ever-expanding attack surface that legacy identity verification systems can’t stand up to. Couple that with easily accessible and criminally weaponized generative artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning tools, and there is an increasing need for highly secure remote identity verification. <br> <br> iProov’s Security Operations Center threat researchers observe unique evidence of large-scale, multi-platform remote identity verification system attacks that are easier than ever for even novice threat actors to launch. Supported by data from iProov’s threat intelligence research, Dr. Andrew Newell reveals how bad actors are using advan<br> ced AI tools, such as highly convincing face swaps in tandem with emulators and other metadata manipulation methodologies, to create new and widely unmapped threat vectors to attack remote identity verification systems. <br> <br> This session is a critical primer for identity and cybersecurity professionals looking to preempt the next generation of attacks.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/battling-ai-driven-digital-injection-attacks-eic24"></a>

  <p>As businesses embrace Digital Transformation and become increasingly cloud-native, mobile, and interconnected, the corporate network perimeter is gradually disappearing, exposing users to malware, ransomware, and other cyber threats. Traditional perimeter security tools no longer provide adequate protection from these threats. Unlike traditional perimeter-based security models that assume trust within the network, Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) adopts a more granular and identity-centric approach.<br> <br> ZTNA is an alternative approach rapidly gaining popularity that essentially replaces the notion of a rigid single, usually hardware-based perimeter of a corporate network with the ability to create multiple dynamic perimeters around individual systems or applications deployed across multiple environments and managed from a centralized control plane. Often expressed as "Never trust, always verify", ZTNA is an embodiment of the principle of least privilege, and at its core mandates that every access request be properly authenticated and authorized.</p>
<p>This session will not only explore the basic principles of ZTNA but will also provide a comprehensive exploration of the ZTNA market segment based on our expert analysis. Attendees can expect an in-depth examination of the relative market share among key players in the ZTNA landscape, identifying the industry leaders and the innovative approaches they employ.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/zero-trust-network-access-market-overview-eic24"></a>

  <p>This session features an odyssey across the landscape of conceptions and practices of “Identity” starting from the pre-internet history, through early digital identity approaches of the Internet´s insular inception, the abstractions of institutional identity centralization and leading to today’s decentralized identity innovations.&nbsp; All of this sets the stage for anticipating radically distributed interaction and identity futures for an Upgraded Reality where hybrid digital and analog forms support functional identity.</p>
<p>Panelists and participants will offer multiple practical perspectives on identity to help guide you through the historical developments of Digital Identity.&nbsp; The historical perspective reveals at least 4 main periods.&nbsp;</p>
 
 The earliest simplified forms at the inception of the Internet reflected data-centric identity patterns derived from human relationships in pre-Internet physical spaces.&nbsp; 
 A second stage saw identity structured to address the needs of powerful but siloed commercial and governmental institutions and the rise of centralized Identity &amp; Access Management Systems.&nbsp; 
 A third (and current stage) is driven by the recognition and realization of the scalability benefits of user-centric and community-based forms of “Decentralized Identity.”&nbsp; 
 Finally, we will explore potential Identity futures that may see radically distributed and localized identity forms of identity supported by various forms of powerful AI and computational intelligence. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all periods, “identity” systems have been designed, developed and operated to provide&nbsp; highly reliable and adaptable systems through which we all recognize, remember and respond to each other and other entities.&nbsp; This next stage of digital identity will help foster the mutual hybridization of people with AI systems and host the systems of spatial computing, where analog and digital worlds merge to an upgraded reality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Engage with us as we analyze how current and future forms of Decentralized and Distributed Identity are gaining adoption in global standards in various business, operating, legal, technical and social domains. These historical trends will help reveal interventions through which we can all work towards reliable, predictable, trustworthy, user-centric, and privacy-aware practices and ensuring robust protections of individual rights in a future dominated by AI and other forms of computational intelligence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Let’s explore together: 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 The Foundations of Digital Identity: Examining the initial structures of digital identity in the early internet era and the business, operating, legal, technical and social (BOLTS) factors that drove its evolution. 
 Centralized Identity &amp; Access Management Systems: An evaluation of centralized frameworks, their advantages, and the associated challenges related to control, privacy, and security. 
 Decentralized Identity – Unleashing a New Era: Exploring the mechanics, potential, and critical role of Decentralized Identity in creating a more secure and user-centric digital world. 
 Extending Identity and Safeguarding Privacy in the AI Era: Discussing how Decentralized Identity will evolve radically distributed forms that will be pivotal in protecting privacy and empowering individuals in a world increasingly influenced by artificial intelligence. 
 Envisioning the Future - The Global Impact of Functional Distributed Identity Infrastructures: Looking ahead, understanding how these privacy-aware standards are transforming into fundamental rights in our interconnected digital society. 
 
<p>&nbsp;We hope that you will join us and contribute to this journey of exploration tailored for innovators, thought leaders, and advocates of a high integrity, functional, secure and private digital future. Uncover the complexities, challenges, and untapped opportunities of Digital Identity with KuppingerCole Analysts, guided by the provocative inquiries of Dr. Scott David.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/from-digital-evolution-to-ai-integration-eic24"></a>

The main challenge for banks is not the implementation, but capturing business opportunities around those regulations rather than seeing them as constraints.</p>
<p>In this talk, I will describe an Open Finance architecture which allows:</p>
 
 Anticipating future regulations by structuring services that are secure and provide useful data, including strong customer authentication to confirm one's identity out of the box 
 Setting up the right API management tools that can be used internally, for regulatory APIs and bankable APIs 
 Providing additional services to consumers through extensible web interfaces

  <p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of identity and access management (IAM), the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) brings forth both unprecedented opportunities and significant challenges. This talk examines the critical importance of trust and transparency in AI systems, particularly in the context of IAM. We explore how AI decisions are made and communicated, emphasizing the need for Explainable AI (XAI) to demystify complex processes and foster user confidence.</p>
<p>We begin by exploring diverse real-world scenarios where AI's pivotal role in access management is demonstrated. This includes examining how AI systems are employed to make automated access decisions, while highlighting the challenges and successes in building trust through transparency. Detailed attention is given to XAI models and techniques such as LIME and SHAP, which are used to make AI's decision-making process accessible and understandable to all users.</p>
<p>The talk then transitions to innovative ways XAI can enhance user experience in IAM systems. We discuss how XAI not only clarifies AI decisions for users but also contributes to creating more intuitive, personalized, and user-friendly interfaces. Through examples and case studies, we showcase how XAI has been instrumental in reducing user frustration, increasing system adoption, and improving overall satisfaction.</p>
<p>Attendees will gain insights into the practical applications and benefits of transparent AI systems in identity governance, the significance of XAI in bridging the gap between complex AI algorithms and user-centric experiences, and how these elements collectively contribute to more secure, efficient, and trustworthy IAM solutions.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/ai-driven-identity-and-access-management-eic24"></a>

  <p>The Ramones took the boredom out of Rock&amp;Roll. They played it faster and with more fun. And they invented a new genre. Three fresh ingredients will reshape IAM as we know it today like the Ramones did with R&amp;R. Graph DBs, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Temporal Graph Networks will reshape IGA, addressing the complexity and lack of temporal insights. This session will provide a practical understanding of how these three new ingredients will reshape the way we think about IGA and make our current nightmares (high costs, business dissatisfaction, and poor UX) a thing of the past.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/the-day-old-iam-died-eic24"></a>

  <p>The glitzy and very convincing diagrams of IGA processes and architectures demonstrate what happens during the provisioning, deprovisioning, access request, and attestation stages using one key assumption… that everything will go according to plan. But what happens if something goes wrong? As an example: what happens if an access request process gets stuck because a dynamically calculated approver is on long-term leave or has left the organization? Ask IAM operations professionals, and they will tell you many stories of what went wrong and how tough it is to be in emergency mode fixing issues. IAM departments spend almost 80% of their time handling the results of something going wrong. So, it’s not about “if” something goes wrong, but “when”, and how to deal with it.</p>
<p>In the session, we will discuss practical steps to predict and handle situations when something doesn’t go according to plan. This is based on real-life examples from day-to-day IGA business. We will go over several use cases and show the cause, issue, resolution, and the prediction methodology for reducing the probability of it happening again. We will cover business, technological, and human factor aspects of handling possible standard process deviations and propose a model for predicting and mitigating such issues. This topic is important not just for IAM/IGA professionals, but also for COOs and CFOs because it impacts operational efficiency and cost.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/real-world-iga-stories-eic24"></a>

  <p>If governments or enterprises want to implement digital identity systems (eID/eIDAS2), they need to decide on a lot of technical topics with a high degree of uncertainty. One goal is to be interoperable across Europe or even on a global level and with the private sector. Moreover, existing and established eID systems and schemas further complicate the decision-making process.<br> <br> The art of timing:<br> One key question arises in this scenario: when is the right time to initiate the implementation of eID/eIDAS2 systems? For governments, timely adoption of the eIDAS2 regulation is imperative, ensuring compliance and unlocking economic advantages associated with an advanced eID infrastructure. On the corporate front, companies face similar challenges delaying implementation until the eIDAS2 compliant eID is in production, which may result in losing ground to competitors who are quick to adapt.<br> The risk of making incorrect decisions leading to a protocol lock-in situation looms large, jeopardizing the long-term viability and adaptability of the chosen eID solution.<br> <br> How to solve the dilemma?&nbsp;<br> But how can you avoid being too early and making the wrong technical decisions?<br> In the presentation we will show you an approach how to start with an eID implementation and avoid protocol lock-in and highlight a way how to integrate in existing eID schemas.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/the-protocol-challenge-and-the-art-of-timing-eic24"></a>

  <p>A significant trend in cybersecurity breaches is the shift from targeting endpoints to hijacking user identities. This evolution marks a significant change in attack vectors, emphasizing the need for robust Identity Threat Detection and Response (ITDR). The presentation will dig into the dynamics of this trend, explaining the mechanisms through which attackers infiltrate systems by exploiting identity vulnerabilities instead of traditional hardware or software loopholes.</p>
<p>In response to the increasing focus on identity-based threats, there has been a paradigm shift in organizational structures and workflows. Identity &amp; Access Management (IAM) teams are no longer siloed entities; they are increasingly integrated with Security Operations Centers (SOC). This presentation will explore the multifaceted implications of this integration. Attendees will gain insight into how the fusion of IAM and SOC functions is reshaping security strategies, fostering a more resilient, proactive defense against identity-based attacks.</p>
<p>Topics covered will include the evolution of ITDR tools and techniques, the role of artificial intelligence in predicting and mitigating identity threats, and the critical importance of fostering a culture of security awareness throughout the organization.</p>

  <p>In this session we will consider various emerging forms of Artificial Intelligence in the context of the evolution of intelligence generally and the accelerating effects of combining human intelligence and AI.</p>
<p>The rapid spread of LLM-fueled information affordances has stoked human imagination regarding the nature of “intelligence” itself as a phenomenon, and the nature and role of human intelligence in relation to other forms. This session will set the stage for the upgrade reality track. In our journey of life and learning, how we think and understand the world around us plays a huge role. We often think of human intelligence as our inner voice and identity compass. Intelligence is central to our defining our sub-species as “Homo Sapiens Sapiens” (those who know that they know). Our individual and collective intelligence has changed and grown over time[, much like how we grow from children to adults]. In this session we will explore what happens when we blend our natural thinking with both modern technology and age-old wisdom from around the world. The "Upgrade Intelligence – Synthesizing with AI toward Meta-Knowing" session will open a treasure chest of insights into the evolution of intelligence. We will explore the value of synthesizing what we know naturally, what we've learned over time, and what modern tools like computers can teach us, aiming to help us achieve a deeper level of understanding. The umbrella term “AI” covers many different sorts of computational intelligence systems that help humans to process information and interactions in ways that we have never been able to do before. Better awareness of the variety of intelligences, both computational and otherwise, will help us to better manage the risks and leverage the benefits of integrating these rapidly proliferating “AI” systems with more traditional human intelligence systems (such as shared communities, organizations, languages, markets, etc.), and to manage how they will change us. Let’s explore together:</p>
 
 Our Thinking Journey: A simple look back at how humans have thought and learned over the ages, from basic instincts to deep thinking. 
 Brain Adventures: Exploring the wonders of our brains, like its ability to adapt and learn new things throughout our lives. 
 Computers as Brain Boosters: How technology and artificial intelligence can help us think better and solve problems in ways we never imagined. 
 Timeless Wisdom: Embracing valuable lessons from cultures around the world, mixing feelings, intuition, and logic to truly understand things. 
 Mixing it All for Deeper Understanding: Combining all these insights to see the world more clearly and make sense of complex ideas. 
 Dreaming of Tomorrow: Imagining a future where our natural smarts and technology come together, helping us make even better decisions. 
 
<p>By the end of our session, you'll leave with a refreshed view of intelligence and exciting tools to think smarter and deeper. So, whether you're a curious learner, an information worker, a risk professional, a teacher, or just someone looking to understand the world a bit better, come aboard! Let's discover the magic of mixing old wisdom, natural smarts, and modern tools to truly upgrade our intelligence.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/synthesizing-with-ai-toward-meta-knowing-eic24"></a>

<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/field-programmable-gate-arrays">Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/microcontroller">microcontroller units (MCUs)</a> are two types of commonly compared integrated circuits (ICs) that are typically used in embedded systems and digital design. Both FPGAs and microcontrollers can be thought of as “small computers” that can be integrated into devices and larger systems.</p>



<p>As processors, the primary difference between FPGAs and microcontrollers comes down to programmability and processing capabilities. While FPGAs are more powerful and more versatile, they are also more expensive. Microcontrollers are less customizable, but also less costly. In many applications, microcontrollers are exceptionally capable and cost-effective. However, for certain demanding or developing applications, like those requiring parallel processing, FPGAs are necessary.</p>



<p>Unlike microcontrollers, FPGAs offer reprogrammability on the hardware level. Their unique design allows users to configure and reconfigure the chip’s architecture depending on the task. FPGA design can also handle parallel inputs simultaneously, whereas microcontrollers can only read one line of code at a time. An FPGA can be programmed to perform the functions of a microcontroller; however, a microcontroller cannot be reprogrammed to perform as an FPGA.&nbsp;</p>



 What is a field programmable gate array (FPGA)? 



<p>First introduced by manufacturer Xilinx in 1985, FPGAs are highly valued for their versatility and processing power. As a result, they are a preferred choice in many <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/hpc">high-performance computing (HPC</a>), digital signal processing (DSP) and prototyping applications.<br><br>Unlike traditional application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), FPGAs are designed to be configured (and reconfigured) “in the field” after the initial manufacturing process is complete. While customization is the FPGAs greatest value offering, it should be noted that FPGAs not only allow for programmability, they require it. Unlike ASICs, FPGAs are not “out-of-the-box” solutions, and they must be configured prior to use with a hardware description language (HDL), such as verilog or VHDL. Programming an FPGA requires specialized knowledge, which can increase costs and delay deployments. While some FPGAs do offer non-volatile memory that can retain programming instructions when powered off, typically FPGAs must be configured on start-up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 FPGA benefits 



<p>Despite these challenges, FPGAs remain useful in applications requiring high-performance, low-latency and real-time flexibility. FPGAs are particularly well suited for applications requiring the following:</p>



 
 Rapid prototyping: FPGAs can be quickly configured into multiple types of customized digital circuits, allowing for expedited deployments, assessments and modifications without the need for costly and time-consuming fabrication processes.&nbsp; 



 Hardware acceleration: Demanding applications benefit from the FPGA’s parallel-processing capabilities. FPGAs may offer significant performance improvements for computationally intensive tasks, such as signal processing, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cryptography">cryptography</a>, and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a> algorithms. 



 Customization: FPGAs are a flexible hardware solution that can be easily optimized to meet specific project requirements.&nbsp; 



 Longevity: FPGA-based designs may benefit from a longer hardware lifespan as FPGAs can be updated and reconfigured to meet evolving project demands and technology standards.&nbsp; 
 



 FPGA components 



<p>To achieve reconfigurability, FPGAs are composed of an array of programmable logic blocks interconnected by a programmable routing fabric. The main components of a typical FPGA are as follows:</p>



 
 Configurable logic blocks (CLBs): CLBs provide compute functionality and may contain a small number of primitive logic elements, such as logic gates, small look-up tables (LUTs), multiplexors and flip-flops for data storage.&nbsp; 



 Programmable interconnects: Made up of wire segments joined by electrically programmable switches, these linkages provide routing pathways between the various FPGA resources, allowing for different configurations and the creation of custom digital circuits.&nbsp; 



 I/O Blocks (IOBs): The interface between an FPGA and other external devices is enabled by input output (I/O) blocks, which allow the FPGA to receive data from and control peripherals&nbsp; 
 



 FPGA use cases 



<p>Versatile by nature, FPGAs are common among a wide variety of industries and applications:</p>



 
 Aerospace and defense: Offering high-speed parallel processing valuable for data acquisition, FPGAs are a preferred choice for radar systems, image processing and secure communications.&nbsp; 



 Industrial control systems (ICS): Industrial control systems used to monitor infrastructure—like power grids, oil refineries and water treatment plants—use FPGAs that can be easily optimized to meet the unique needs of various industries. In these critical industries, FPGAs can be used to implement various automations and hardware-based encryption features for efficient cybersecurity. 



 ASIC development: FPGAs are often used in the prototyping of new ASIC chips.&nbsp; 



 Automotive: Advanced signal processing also makes FPGAs well-suited for automotive applications, including advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), sensor fusion and GPS. 



 Data centers: FPGAs add value to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-centers">data centers</a> by optimizing high-bandwidth, low-latency servers, networking and storage infrastructure. 
 



 FPGA features 



 
 Processing core: Configurable logic blocks 



 Memory: External memory interface&nbsp; 



 Peripherals: Configurable I/O blocks 



 Programming: Hardware description language (VHDL, Verilog)&nbsp; 



 Reconfigurability: Highly reconfigurable, reprogrammable logic 
 



 What is a microcontroller? 



<p>Microcontrollers are a type of compact, ready-made ASIC containing a processor core (or cores), memory (RAM), and erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM) for storing the custom programs that run on the microcontroller. Known as a “system-on-a-chip (SoC)” solution, microcontrollers are essentially small computers integrated into a single piece of hardware that can be used independently or in larger embedded systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consumer-grade microcontrollers, such as the Arduino Starter Kit or Microchip Technology PIC, can be configured using assembly language or common programming languages (C, C++), and they are favored by hobbyists and educators for their cost-effective accessibility. Microcontrollers are also capable of handling more complex and critical tasks and are common in industrial applications. However, decreased processing power and memory resources can limit the microcontroller’s efficacy in more demanding applications.&nbsp;</p>



 Microcontroller benefits 



<p>Despite their limitations, microcontrollers offer many advantages, including the following:</p>



 
 Compact design: Microcontrollers integrate all necessary components onto a small, single chip offering a small footprint valuable in applications where size and weight are a priority.&nbsp; 



 Energy efficiency: Designed to operate on low power, microcontrollers are well suited for battery-powered devices and other applications where power consumption is a concern. 



 Cost-effective: Microcontrollers offer a complete SoC solution that reduces the need for additional peripherals and components. Low-cost, general-purpose microcontrollers can greatly reduce overall project expenses.&nbsp; 



 Flexibility: Although not as versatile as FPGAs, microcontrollers are programmable for a wide range of various applications. While they cannot be reprogrammed on the hardware level, microcontrollers can be easily reconfigured, updated and optimized on a software level.&nbsp; 
 



 Microcontroller components 



<p>When reprogrammability is not a priority, self-contained microcontrollers offer a compact and capable alternative. The following are the key components of a microcontroller:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Central processing unit (CPU): Colloquially referred to as the “brain,” the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/central-processing-unit">central processing unit (CPU)</a> serves as the core component responsible for executing instructions and controlling operations.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Memory: Microcontrollers contain both volatile memory (RAM), which stores temporary data that may be lost if the system loses power, and non-volatile memory (ROM, FLASH) for storing the microcontroller’s programming code. 



 Peripherals: Depending on the intended application, a microcontroller may contain various peripheral components, such as input/output (I/O) interfaces like timers, counters, analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and communication protocols (UART, SPI, I2C). 
 



 Microcontroller use cases 



<p>Unlike FPGAs, small, affordable, and non-volatile microcontrollers are ubiquitous in modern electronics, frequently deployed for specific tasks, including the following:</p>



 
 Automotive systems: Microcontrollers are used in engine control, airbag deployment and in-car infotainment systems.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Consumer electronics: Microcontrollers are critical to smartphones, smart TVs and other home appliances, especially devices that integrate into the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/internet-of-things">Internet of Things (IoT)</a>. 



 Industrial automation: Microcontrollers are well-suited to industrial applications, such as controlling machinery, monitoring systems and process automation.&nbsp; 



 Medical devices: Microcontrollers are often deployed in life-saving devices, such as pacemakers, blood glucose monitors and diagnostic tools.&nbsp; 
 



 Microcontroller features 



 
 Processing core: Fixed CPU 



 Memory: Integrated RAM and ROM/Flash&nbsp; 



 Peripherals: Built-in I/O interfaces for 



 Programming: Software (C, Assembly)&nbsp; 



 Reconfigurability: Limited, firmware updates 
 



 Key differences between FPGAs and microcontrollers 



<p>When comparing FPGAs and microcontrollers, it is important to consider a number of key differences, including hardware architecture, processing capabilities, power consumption, and developer requirements.&nbsp;</p>



 
 Hardware structure
 
 FPGA: Highly configurable programmable logic blocks and interconnects, allowing for reprogrammable and custom digital circuits.&nbsp; 



 Microcontroller: Fixed architecture with predefined components (CPU, memory, peripherals) integrated into a single chip.&nbsp;

 How can Liminal analyze the passwordless authentication space in different verticals to create a tailored GTM strategy that identifies key metrics, use cases, and ideal customer profiles? 



 







 



 Introduction 



<p>As the CIAM and authentication market spaces evolve, new vendors enter and compete against one another. Liminal was tasked with a Go-to-Market Strategy engagement with a prominent, large-scale digital identity vendor client as they launched their passwordless platform. The project aimed to develop actionable playbooks that the client’s salesforce team could leverage when working with its global customers with significant presence across key identified verticals, such as financial institutions and eCommerce. To achieve this goal, the Liminal team of skilled consultants and strategists worked closely with the client to refine a GTM strategy that tasked Liminal with creating playbooks specific to the client’s key verticals that outlined the buyer’s journey. It increased their ability to grow their customer portfolio.&nbsp;</p>



 Challenge 



<p>While the client’s product portfolio boasted innovative capabilities and features, developing tailored sales materials that differentiated the client from its competition proved difficult. Liminal wanted to ensure the vendor could leverage unique insights into different verticals aligned with other industries’ various goals, personas, and metrics. Specifically, Liminal wanted to identify these key elements:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs): Who are the personas with whom the sales team would interact across different verticals?&nbsp; 
 



 
 Key use cases: Which use cases most apply to the respective vertical the sales team is targeting?&nbsp; 
 



 
 The buyer/customer journey: What is the timeline for each vertical and ICP’s buying process? What questions or roadblocks might the potential customer raise along the way?&nbsp; 
 



 
 Tailored sales metrics: How can Liminal provide the client with quantifiable sales metrics that differentiate their product from other vendors while specifically targeting each vertical?&nbsp; 
 



<p>To tackle the challenge, Liminal leveraged market research, extensive customer interviews, and the creation of a dynamic ROI Calculator for each vertical. Through our analysis of the identity market, we landed on two key verticals that the client could focus on in its sales efforts: Financial Services and e-commerce.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From there, Liminal pursued a long list of customer interviews to collect key insights about what customers seek in an identity vendor. Our research helped us identify the key use cases relevant to each vertical, such as Account Takeover Fraud in Financial Services or Cart Abandonment in e-commerce. We met with various personas that also led us to pinpoint which roles our client would interact with when selling. Our interviews provided information regarding the buying journey, helping us to identify how long the client could expect to engage with potential customers and who these customers might be.&nbsp;</p>



 Solution 



<p>The knowledge we gained during our extensive research led to developing two vertical-specific GTM Playbooks for our clients to leverage in their sales efforts. We used our four main takeaways from the research (ICPs, key use cases, buying journey, and sales metrics) to differentiate the playbooks so that our clients knew how to approach different sales scenarios across verticals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using our resources, we created ICP profiles in each vertical to provide insights into the different industries. We also made sure to weave in the key use cases we identified from our research so the sales team could understand which use cases applied more directly to the two verticals. This information allowed us to create specific sales enablement strategy materials, such as questions to ask the customer, key points to make, or categories where the customer wants to save money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We combined the work in our vertical playbooks to transfer into dynamic ROI Calculators for the client to use in each vertical. The goal was to make the vertical playbooks go hand-in-hand with the ROI Calculators so our client could further their sales efforts with tailored metrics to the customer and their industry. This would allow our clients to avoid any industry-knowledge gaps in the sales process and expedite the sales process without conducting initial discovery or research into the industry. The goal was to enhance our client’s sales efforts as their products launched.&nbsp;</p>



 Outcome 



<p>Liminal successfully provided the client with two actionable GTM playbooks and two dynamic ROI Calculators, each tied to a unique vertical. The playbooks combined all of our key findings and presented them in a logical flow that followed the client’s specific sales framework and methodology. We hosted training sessions with the client, walking them through the playbooks so they could understand how to&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most unique outcome of the engagement was the two ROI Calculators we provided to the client. The calculators allowed our client to walk through a potential deal with a customer, selecting the use cases they were most interested in and the products they wanted to purchase. From there, the calculators also had customizable options, allowing the salesperson to work closely with their customers, tailoring specific metrics to their needs. This helped our client calculate savings categories across industry pain points, making the data digestible to the potential customer. Our ROI Calculators predicted an average of a 7x ROI for customers with a million end-users, providing the client with a metrics breakdown.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The client was able to target unique personas in different verticals, understand their wants and needs in the market, and provide uniquely differentiated metrics from competitors.&nbsp;</p>



 Conclusion&nbsp; 



<p>As a result of our engagement, the client walked away with actionable GTM vertical-specific playbooks and a customizable ROI Calculator to leverage in sales efforts. The engagement was successful from the client’s perspective, along with Liminal’s, and proved our ability to enhance a client’s sales process. Additionally, the engagement materials demonstrated tangible results, where the client could convert perspectives to customers and increase their revenue. As one of the first major GTM Strategy engagements, this project promoted our ability to leverage industry knowledge and combine it with feedback from customers we spoke to turn it into easily comprehensible deliverables. Overall, the engagement highlighted the team’s ability to successfully leverage our data-driven research and turn it into practical sales materials for a company to utilize in its sales strategy efforts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Two months ago, we launched a new part of the Dark Matter Labs ecosystem: Property &amp; Beyond Lab. Since then, we have expanded our portfolio of <a href="https://www.darkmatterlabs.property/">strategic property provocations</a>; we have launched a <a href="https://www.darkmatterlabs.property/tool">digital platform</a> that maps the connections between global systemic risks and property; and we have co-hosted the conference “<a href="https://www.notion.so/what-and-how-we-own/What-How-We-Own-The-Politics-of-Change-0755201b081549bfa8ff8426c1fdeb0f">What and How We Own: The Politics of Change</a>”, where we gathered with over a hundred experts to explore the intricate workings of property systems, their extensive impacts on our everyday lives, as well as promising ideas, case studies, and methods that can seed different futures.</p><p>If there is one thing that has become unmistakably clear at our conference and through this work, it is that the time of tinkering at the margins is over. In a similar way that we cannot address the biodiversity crisis by simply planting additional trees, we are seeing that we cannot address the micro-massive impacts of failing property institutions — such as rising inequality, growing numbers of unhoused peoples, and concentrations of power — by tweaks to surface level codes such as taxes, regulation, and contracts.</p><p>The global real estate market (which includes commercial and residential real estate and agricultural land) is the <a href="https://www.savills.com/impacts/market-trends/the-total-value-of-global-real-estate-property-remains-the-worlds-biggest-store-of-wealth.html">world’s biggest source of wealth at $379.7 trillion</a>, yet much of that is owned by the <a href="https://www.ubs.com/global/en/family-office-uhnw/reports/global-wealth-report-2023.html">global top 1% whose wealth share rose to 44.5%</a> in 2022. While the planet is headed for at least 1.5C of heating — with disastrous results for people and ecosystems — control over the critical minerals necessary for our green transitions has been highly concentrated, with<a href="https://www.oecd.org/trade/topics/global-value-chains-and-trade/documents/clean-energy-supply-chains-OECD-G7-202305.pdf"> only 3 companies owning 49% of global lithium production in 2020.</a> Meanwhile, our housing crisis puts us in a tight double bind, with our need to house people contributing heavily to even more carbon emissions and biodiversity loss (our own research suggests that <a href="https://www.irresistiblecircularsociety.eu/news/invitation-paper-a-new-european-bauhaus-economy-designing-our-futures">Europe can afford to build only 176,000 new homes a year </a>to remain within the carbon budget set by the Paris Agreement, which is far below the housing supply required to meet&nbsp;demand).</p><p>Governments have been dealing with these emerging and evolving risks and impacts by shoring up flaws in policies or trying to course-correct. Yet we believe it is time to ask the more fundamental question of whether property and ownership in its current form, with its hierarchies of control and worldview of separation, is in fact the right framework to deal with the challenges at hand. Or to put it simply, it is becoming clear that without innovating the deep code of property and the cultural norms that surround it, the scale of the transitions ahead of us feel out of&nbsp;reach.</p><p>This blog is an attempt to dive deeper into the complexities of the property problem space, by starting to unpack two of its most pressing yet knotted challenges: housing and&nbsp;data.</p><p>Part 1: In this first part, we will start to peel back the layers of the multifaceted crisis of housing looking at its intertwined economic, social, and ecological impacts.</p><p>Part 2: A second part on data ownership will follow, in which we will look at the need to transition away from governing data itself to governing access to data and what it is used&nbsp;for.</p><p>These blogs are intended both as an exploratory journey and a rallying cry to policymakers and strategic risk holders to deepen their commitment to systemic innovation and invest in compelling visions for the future to be able to overcome political and institutional lock-ins and match the necessity of the contexts we&nbsp;face.</p><p>HOW A DIFFERENT LENS ALLOWS US TO SEE PROPERTY&nbsp;ANEW</p><p>At Dark Matter Labs, we have found it increasingly helpful to get a better picture of property’s complex problem landscapes by looking through the lens of affordances and disaffordances: what do our property systems allow us to do, see, be and imagine? And consequently, how could its redesign recast our relationship with each other, with ecosystems, and with the planet and build a pathway to systemic thriving?</p><p>Affordance is a concept that was originally developed in the late 1960s by the ecological psychologist James Gibson, who defined affordance as what an artifact “offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes, either for good or ill” (<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs137/2017/readings/Gibson-AFF.pdf">Gibson, 1979</a>). It was later popularized in design by Donald Norman’s book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things">The Design of Everyday Things</a>, where he defined it as the “perceived and actual properties of the thing, primarily those fundamental properties that determine how the thing could possibly be used.” Affordances can be both positive and negative, which is to say beneficial and injurious depending on the context. A fire can afford both the warmth necessary to life, but it can also cause destruction.</p><p>What is interesting in adopting the lens of affordances is that it allows us to see our legal designs as not just socially-constructed, but as having ontological effects: what we design designs us back. Our legal designs mediate our understanding of perceptions of the world and what is possible to do. Our individual and collective sense of agency is mediated by these designs, and so too is our understanding of ourselves and the world co-constituted through the lens of that mediation.</p><p>When we apply this lens to our property rights frameworks, what becomes very clear is how it allows for a very specific, narrow range of behaviors and actions that are increasingly misaligned with our changing material reality (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VUCA">VUCA&nbsp;world</a>).</p><p>Through its legal coding, property rights have turned the world into abstract objects and things, and subsequently a world of capital assets. Land is no longer a source of social and cultural value, a sense of belonging and group identity, or existential and ecological rootedness, but an object that can be mortgaged and sold for the extraction of profits. The prism of property as it currently stands stamps out any different modes of relating to land other than through the lens of financial value. Property detaches ‘things’ from their social and ecological relationships, resulting in absurdities like timber being valued as a resource more than the forest as a living ecosystem.</p><p>Property tends to create competing interests of the individual owner versus society. As Blackstone famously formulated, the “sole and despotic dominion which one man claims and exercises over the external things of the world, in total exclusion of the right of any other individual in the universe” (<a href="https://oll.libertyfund.org/pages/blackstone-on-property-1753">Blackstone, 1753</a>). It generates an artificial distinction between first and third parties, and then systematically structures relationships in service of property-owners at the expense of non-owners and that which is ‘owned’. In this process of optimizing for individual rights and interests, it purports to provide security — as if somehow the world is made up of a series of individual parts, rather than recognizing that everything happens out of the coming together of complex wholes (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA5GV-XmwtM">Iain McGilchrist</a>, 2023).</p><p>Property affords only a reductive mode of information processing and organizing in which complexity and entanglement is reduced to systems of low information burdens. Boundaries are drawn, fences put up, to communicate the limit of where rights apply, from which the world and their interests are excluded. Definitions of what counts as “property”, “property damage” and externalities limit actions that can be taken to mitigate distributed risks and impacts, or acknowledge multiple value creation, as is becoming increasingly pressing with copyright and other forms of IP in the context of machine learning systems which extract private value from the availability of vast amounts of public training data and the “<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763">collective intelligence</a>” of humanity.</p><p>Where Friedrich Hayek recognized that “liberty and responsibility are inseparable” in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Constitution_of_Liberty#:~:text=Hayek%20highlights%20the%20decline%20in,guides%20individuals%20in%20their%20choices.">The Constitution of Liberty</a>, our current forms of property have failed to balance the freedoms of rights with the burdens of responsibilities, especially when those consequences fall on non-individualized and non-human, such as the social and ecological commons.</p><p>Seeing property and ownership through the lens of affordances — by looking at how it shapes our ways of being and relating, the incentives it creates, the priorities it assigns, the asymmetries it creates — allows us to lift our gaze from the micro-institutional or domain-specific level where impacts are felt, one case or transaction at a time, towards the wider system-level operation of property and the logic and norms that define and sustain&nbsp;it.</p><p>THE HOUSING CRISIS: A KNOTTED PROBLEM&nbsp;SPACE</p><p>By diving deeper into the deep codes of our systems, we get to see our problem spaces more clearly. The housing crisis, often portrayed as a singular issue, starts to quickly reveal itself as a complex web of challenges and deeply intertwined with and restrained by the disaffordances of our dominant systems of property and ownership.</p><p>New York, Toronto, London, Amsterdam, and Seoul, indeed nearly every urban center faces a housing crisis. In 200 cities studied across the world, <a href="https://www.lincolninst.edu/sites/default/files/pubfiles/kallergis_wp18ak1.pdf">90% were found to be unaffordable to live in</a>. <a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/press-releases/new-report-shows-rent-unaffordable-half-renters-cost-burdens-surge-record-levels">Nearly half of all renters in the US spend more than 30% of their income on rent</a>, and a quarter spend more than 50%. Houselessness is on the rise and not just limited to major cities:<a href="https://www.security.org/resources/homeless-statistics/"> the number of people without access to housing climbed in every type of setting</a> — including a 10% increase in rural areas. Globally, UN-Habitat estimates that <a href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-11-01-01.pdf">1.6 billion people live in inadequate housing</a>, of which 1 billion live in slums and informal settlements; numbers which are likely to only increase with growing displacement by conflicts and climate-related impacts like water scarcity, crop failure, and rising sea&nbsp;levels.</p><p>Meanwhile, real estate lobbyists, policy makers, and some housing experts have portrayed the housing crisis as simply a problem of supply. If we build more housing, the argument goes, people will have more choices, and rents will be lower. The problem with this supply-side argument is that it is not the full picture. In fact, research shows that there tends to be a surplus in virtually every urban area. New York, for example, has an <a href="https://jacobin.com/2016/10/housing-crisis-rent-landlords-homeless-affordability">excess of a quarter-million units</a> beyond what is necessary to house its current population. Not to mention its vacant office and commercial space — 74,582,671 square feet to be precise, or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/05/10/opinion/nyc-office-vacancy-playground-city.html">26 Empire State buildings</a> worth — that could potentially be retrofitted for housing and community-serving uses.</p><p>Simply building more homes won’t solve the problem of affordability. The crisis is much deeper than that: it is rooted in a cluster of dysfunctions of property and ownership. In order to craft effective solutions, we need a new approach that unpacks how our legal coding, institutional logics, and cultural norms around property all play a complex, entangled role in creating this multi-faceted problem space. This means developing a new understanding of how property as a framework has articulated and captured social imaginaries as to the goals we set around housing, how it has enabled the privatization of benefits while commoning costs to society and the environment, and how it has built a systemic lock-in for NIMBY solutions. This is especially critical because pathways to democratizing access to housing as we currently understand it are becoming increasingly unavailable, through rising costs, carbon constraints, material affordability, and declining public investments.</p><p>UNTANGLING THE&nbsp;KNOT</p><p>So what are the different strands of this knotted problem space? What actions, behaviors, and imaginaries does property and ownership afford us when it comes to our&nbsp;homes?</p><p>Homes are seen as a financial asset, rather than a place to live&nbsp;…</p><p><a href="https://www.savills.com/impacts/market-trends/the-total-value-of-global-real-estate-property-remains-the-worlds-biggest-store-of-wealth.html">Housing has become the world’s most valuable asset class</a>, worth US$379.7 trillion or three times global GDP. Owning property is viewed as a secure pathway to long-term financial stability for individual and institutional investors alike. Residential real estate has become an investment of choice for private equity firms, pension funds, and insurance companies, who have turned to real estate looking to diversify and hedge against market volatility, driving up housing prices — and financial volatility for individual residents — as a result. This prioritization of housing as a financial asset over its social value or human right is problematic, but the reality is presently essential to the economic models of our cities and countries.<a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-do-state-and-local-property-taxes-work"> Property taxes account for over 60% of township/municipal revenue in the US</a>, while also being an essential part of the financial health and sustainability of the pensions of our nurses, teachers, and firefighters. We are facing deep institutional lock-ins that make dealing with any systemic change a political hot&nbsp;potato.</p><p>… where security of tenure for some comes at the expense of that of&nbsp;others</p><p>By perceiving and treating housing as just another commodity, we fall into a persistent analytical error. At the heart of this error is that land, on which housing is built, is a fixed resource. We cannot produce more of it. Especially highly desirable land — be it downtown building lots or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/16/arizona-colorado-river-water-rights-drought">arable farmland</a> — are scarce, giving those who own it the upper hand. In addition, housing is immobile and has high transaction and construction costs (<a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/rethinking-the-economics-of-land-and-housing-9781350374270/">Ryan-Collins et al. 2017</a>). These features are not market failures, but fundamental properties that limit how the housing system is able to behave. They mean that increased demand invariably translates into upward spirals of housing prices, rent-seeking and hoarding, rather than increased supply as in real commodity markets. Housing increases in value over time, incentivizing someone to hold on to an empty apartment, to keep land lying dormant, or to buy an additional investment property. The result is that the security of tenure and investment by some deprives others, accelerating and externalizing the costs of insecurity.</p><p>Home ownership allows for the privatization of public value&nbsp;…</p><p>What would your home be worth if you were to move it to McCarthy, Alaska? (one of the most isolated places with a population of a mere 107 at the 2020 census) This might be a strange question, but not if you consider tha<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1376634/land-price-as-a-share-of-property-value-in-selected-cities-in-the-us/">t most of what our homes are worth is made up of the value of the land on which it is built</a>, sometimes over two-thirds. In matters of real estate, it really is location, location, location. The majority of current property value is derived from what is called “unearned increment”, the financial value that is captured by homeowners, landlords, and speculators of the non-financial value generated by our social and ecological commons. These are the things that make a place desirable, such as access to schools, safe streets, the amount of sunlight, or ecological integrity. Property rights have enabled homeowners to systematically gain an unfair dividend of our shared public goods and investments. This private enclosure of public goods is nowhere more evident than in the example of the <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/a-smart-commons-528f4e53cec2">NYC High Line</a>. A US$187 million investment (of which 77% from public funds from a mixture of NYC, federal and state government) led to a US$3.4 billion surge in surrounding property values. Individual homeowners reaped most of this benefit, whilst property tax revenue only went up by US$103&nbsp;million.</p><blockquote>“Roads are made, streets are made, services are improved, electric light turns night into day, water is brought from reservoirs a hundred miles off in the mountains — and all the while the landlord sits still. Every one of those improvements is effected by the labor and cost of other people and the taxpayers. To not one of those improvements does the land monopolist, as a land monopolist, contribute, and yet by every one of them the value of his land is enhanced.”</blockquote><blockquote>— W. Churchill</blockquote><p>… and the externalization of&nbsp;costs</p><p>Whenever we build a house, we create social and ecological impacts that reach well beyond the construction site, impacts that are seldom factored into the overall costs. This includes environmental degradation, depletion of resources, and both direct and indirect displacement of communities — costs that society bears rather than them being included in the price of construction. In 2020, the<a href="https://globalabc.org/sites/default/files/2021-10/GABC_Buildings-GSR-2021_BOOK.pdf"> built environment accounted for 37% of annual global greenhouse gas emissions</a> and the use of <a href="https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/introducing-retrofirst-a-new-aj-campaign-championing-reuse-in-the-built-environment">25% of all plastic</a> worldwide. Construction is spending our sand ‘budgets’ faster than it can be produced naturally and responsibly, leading to pollution, hoarding, price gouging and even the<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sand-mafias-are-plundering-the-earth/"> rise of “sand mafias”.</a> All these forms of lifecycle costs are rarely taken into account, never mind priced in for investors, developers or builders, and the impacts accumulate. As the necessity to internalize these costs grows, we are likely to see a significant decrease in housing affordability for the majority. This will also challenge the supply-side approach to solving the housing crisis, potentially leading to an erosion of the housing market’s capacity to meet demand affordably.</p><p>CRAFTING PATHWAYS TOWARDS NEW AFFORDANCES</p><p>Untangling the knot of the housing crisis shows that if we were to meaningfully take on its interwoven challenges, we would have to reimagine and recode the problematizing structures of property and ownership. We would need to build new institutional mechanisms that provide a wider scope of affordances, allowing for (re)new(ed) ways of relating to our homes, the land it is built on, the materials it is drawn from, the ecologies it supports, and the public goods it relies on. It would involve unhooking homes from both control and extractive dynamics in favor of stewardship, mutual care, and responsibility.</p><p>On our journey so far, we have begun to progressively craft some of the blueprints for instruments, institutions, and interfaces that allow for new ways of relating to our&nbsp;homes.</p><p>What if building materials of a house were rented and not&nbsp;owned?</p><p>This might involve a system where materials are not owned but are part of an<a href="https://cdn.sanity.io/files/gg6r1tfm/production/e2d01e567642a433f4eb812cf19ab5c20f2aa0e2.pdf"> Open Chain Digital Trust. </a>This idea reflects the philosophy once expressed by the Indigenous peoples of Taiwan: “I will borrow the stones and give them back once I’m done.” Such a system is now feasible digitally and enables a fully circular material economy — designed to remove incentives for waste, rent-seeking and hoarding and encourage maximum utility and sustainability. Open Chain Digital Trusts are one way in which new technologies are creating affordances that surpass the qualitative affordances of not just property rights but law as such, allowing us to dynamically and transparently manage multiple entangled risks, interests, and values and distribute power in unprecedented ways.</p><p>What if a house could generate value for the&nbsp;commons?</p><p>Community Land Trusts have long been around as a promising way of removing housing from the speculative market to create stable, affordable housing options that are controlled by the community and stewarded by the residents that live in them. The <a href="https://www.theguild.community/peoples-community-land-trust/">People’s Community Land Trust in Atlanta</a> is an inspiring example of leveraging housing to build community wealth. Yet regulatory barriers and long and expensive development trajectories have meant that CLTs are still not widespread: there are an<a href="https://www.policylink.org/resources-tools/tools/all-in-cities/housing-anti-displacement/community-land-trusts#:~:text=Today%2C%20there%20are%20an%20estimated,close%20to%2020%2C000%20rental%20units."> estimated 225 CLTs in the US that provide only around 10,000 homeownership units</a> and 20,000 rentals. That’s why we have been contemplating what kind of additional pathways are opened up when a house is not just put in the hands of the community, but removed entirely from property structures and is made self-owning. Liberating a house from its extractive rent-seeking logic allows it to be put fully in the service of both the ecological and social commons. It could unlock (re)generative returns currently unavailable within housing policy, such as savings in healthcare or ecosystem restoration. We are looking to demonstrate this with <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19cSm8Wj0N5DrOXNwOSfsAOt3--O73mP4/view?usp=drive_link">FreeHouse Toronto</a>, where we aim to build regenerative housing on ravine land, where residents carry out land stewardship under the leadership of Indigenous stewardship stakeholder groups.</p><p>What if our contract would not be with a landlord, but with our neighbors?</p><p>Rent-seeking behavior has largely undermined property’s classical justification as a means of securing future returns on labor and contribution and has instead led to increasing waste and inefficiencies of use. Previously we have written about how our Proof of Possibility <a href="https://bloombergcities.jhu.edu/news/city-putting-its-people-charge-public-space#:~:text=They%27re%20doing%20so%20by,billboards%E2%80%94in%20the%20people%27s%20hands">Permissioning the City</a> with local government in Daegu, South Korea seeks to overcome the inefficiencies and barriers of centralized management and regulation by unlocking vacant and underutilized spaces for creative use via a digital peer-to-peer permissioning system. Yet distributed permissioning systems could open up many other new pathways for commoning, for instance by using it to create a <a href="https://www.landcommission.gov.scot/downloads/655b1bb264fac_SLC-DML_Discussion-Paper_for%20publication.pdf">partial commons layer over privately-owned properties</a> to facilitate the development of shared green spaces or joint renewable energy projects.</p><p>OUR CALL TO&nbsp;ACTION</p><p>Addressing the knotted problem spaces of our housing crisis demands a deep-code perspective. Solutions so far have focused too often on single, isolated aspects. Whether it is by boosting public and private housing supplies or establishing CLTs, these solutions individually fail to address the deep-rooted asymmetries, distributed harms, and underperformance plaguing the housing system — dysfunctions that can be traced back to the narrow range of affordances of our axiomatic property and ownership institutions. By diving deep into the deep code, we can start to see how seemingly discrete challenges are in fact interrelated and interdependent, and idiosyncratic for a wider system that optimizes for control, single point optimization, and financial value. A meaningful transition for the housing sector demands we recognize the need to build truly new option spaces. We are in need of new institutional capabilities — governance instruments, cultural norms, technical infrastructures, and legal contracts — that allow us to relate differently to housing as a critical infrastructure and its effects on our shared economic stability, social wellbeing, and environmental thriving.</p><p>Did this blog resonate with you and are you interested in getting involved?

				  Indicio Proven® adds support for OpenID protocols and the SD JWT credential format for interoperability with a wide variety of existing and emerging solutions and specifications, including the European Union’s digital identity requirements.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Ken Ebert, CTO</p>
<p>We at Indicio have been closely monitoring the European Union’s <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age_en">eIDAS 2.0</a> (electronic IDentification, Authentication, and Trust Services) regulation and the associated <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-digital-identity-wallet-architecture-and-reference-framework">EUDI</a> (European Digital Identity) wallet specification. We are excited to announce that Indicio Proven® supports the OpenID protocols required for both.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means that our government and business customers can more easily build verifiable credential solutions and digital wallets that work with emerging EU digital identity wallet specifications in anticipation of the EU’s requirement that all member-state citizens have access to a digital identity wallet by 2026.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This follows Indicio’s implementation of OpenID for <a href="https://indicio.tech/open-badges/">Open Badges 3.0</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>OpenID</p>
<p>The OpenID communication <a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/">protocols</a>, consisting of OpenID4VCI (Verifiable Credential Issuance) and OpenID4VP (Verifiable Credential Presentation), are required by the European Digital Identity Architecture and Reference Framework and are included in the EUDI specification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These protocols enable verifiable digital identity credentials to be issued to a digital wallet and then be presented from that digital wallet to a relying party for verification. Through these mechanisms, European citizens can use digital identity credentials to access government services, prove their age, hold mobile driver’s licenses, and cross borders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Selective disclosure and EUDI</p>
<p>In addition to our ongoing support for selective disclosure in AnonCreds, Indicio now also supports the new SD JWT (Selective Disclosure JWT) credential format. Selective disclosure is a feature that allows credential holders to present specific information in a credential for verification (instead of having to disclose all the information in the credential at once). This feature is key to meeting the European Union’s <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EUDIGITALIDENTITYWALLET/Security+and+Privacy">requirements</a> for data minimization and privacy in eIDAS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio Proven: One solution, many options</p>
<p>We understand the first-mover advantage. And we understand the cost and worry of having to adapt to new specifications, standards, and customer needs. It’s why Indicio ensures our customers have the best and most flexible technology. They can deploy today with the confidence that they can quickly evolve as new specs roll in and stay ahead of the competition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adding support for OpenID and SD JWT to Indicio Proven doesn’t just mean satisfying EU requirements; it also means customers satisfy EU requirements and get a host of more advanced features to satisfy business needs, such as the ability to issue KYC credentials, Digital Travel Credentials, and Open Badges 3.0.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By offering the widest possible selection of credential formats and protocols, Indicio Proven is the most capable verifiable credential solution in the market and the only complete verifiable credential solution available in both the <a href="https://indicio.tech/google-cloud/">AWS</a> and <a href="https://indicio.tech/amazon-web-service/">Google</a> marketplaces.</p>
<p>But there’s more…</p>
<p>EUDI is still a work in progress, and Indicio’s CEO, Heather Dahl, is now serving on the European Commission’s Ad-Hoc Technical Advisory Group for the European Digital Identity Wallet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it’s not the only emerging digital identity solution. Indicio Proven will also support the emerging Mobile Driver’s License (mDL) ISO 18013 specification, which is currently being piloted in various states and countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the first company to successfully implement a <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/sita-takes-the-lead-in-indicio-series-a-funding-round-cementing-a-partnership-delivering-trusted-digital-identity-for-travel/#new_tab">Digital Travel Credential</a> based on the International Civil Aviation Organization’s specifications for a digital equivalent of a passport and to develop effective <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcu76JEaqwI">liveness and biometric binding to personal data in a verifiable credential</a>, we are excited to incorporate land travel into Indicio Proven’s portfolio of options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, with all these different credential formats and implementations, how do you choose which to build to, especially as some are still very much works-in-progress?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re serious. It really doesn’t matter. You can have the best of everything. We have built Indicio Proven to act as a credential bridge. This means you can wrap an existing credential format with the features of a more advanced credential while retaining the original credential’s functionality and verifiability. It’s a lock-in buster, meaning you don’t need to worry about being stuck with an underpowered solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That means —&nbsp;get building now. You can create dynamic deployments that do amazing things right now and be compatible with whatever comes along in the future. That’s the magic of this technology and Indicio Proven.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of Identity Governance and Administration (IGA), this keynote delves into the revolutionary impact of large language models (LLMs) as autonomous agents in software development. This presentation unveils a paradigm shift from traditional static software and user experiences to a dynamic, AI-driven approach where LLM agents independently think, plan, and execute, bringing a new level of intelligence and adaptability to IGA.</p>
<p>However, with great power comes great responsibility. The autonomous nature of these LLM AI agents, while groundbreaking, introduces a level of unpredictability and complexity. This talk addresses the critical need for dynamic, real-time authorization as flexible guardrails, essential in steering these agents safely and effectively within the vast and intricate landscape of IGA.</p>
<p>We will explore how dynamic real-time authorization can be seamlessly interwoven with these AI orchestrations, acting not just as a security measure, but as an integral component that enables LLM agents to operate within a controlled yet adaptable framework. This integration is crucial in ensuring that the revolutionary capabilities of AI are harnessed responsibly, maintaining compliance and security without stifling innovation.</p>
<p>Attendees will gain insight into the cutting-edge integration of LLM AI agents in IGA, understanding the challenges and opportunities presented by this new paradigm. The session aims to provide a comprehensive perspective on managing the dynamism of AI with robust and flexible authorization techniques, paving the way for a more secure, efficient, and forward-thinking approach in identity governance. Join us in exploring how we are setting the course for the future of IGA, where autonomy meets accountability.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/navigating-the-new-iga-frontier-eic24"></a>

  <p>We, as an industry, have been working on identity management for quite some time. But, from some perspectives, we haven’t made progress. We have solved many of the problems of user account management, but we have yet to solve the problems of identity management to the same extent. The magical future where I can put the supercomputer on my wrist to work in a way that delivers real value and not just interesting insights and alerts feels both disappointingly far away yet tantalizingly within our grasp. In this talk, Ian Glazer puts forward the concept of counselors: software agents that act on one’s behalf to make introductions of the individual to a service and vice versa, perform recognition of these services and associated credentials, and prevent or at least inhibit risky behavior, such as dodgy data sharing. Counselors are a way to both humanize online interactions and make meaningful (as in meaningful and valuable to the individual) progress on solving the challenges of digital identity management.</p>
<p>In this session you will learn:</p>
 
 Why solving for user account management is only part of the story 
 How the notion of counselors fills the remaining gaps 
 What is required to make counselors real 
 Steps you can take today towards identity management

  <p>In an era where misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation flood our digital channels, discerning truth from falsehood has become a formidable challenge. The implications are profound, stretching from individual trust to societal cohesion and impacting everything from public health through individual safety and security to democratic processes. DIACC (Digital Identification and Authentication Council of Canada) President Joni Brennan aims to unravel the complex web of false information that pervades our digital and physical worlds. Joni will explore the role digital identity plays in both perpetuating and mitigating the spread of these harmful narratives. She will address how the misinformation crisis has eroded public trust, and more importantly, how technology, policy, and community engagement can be harnessed to restore it.</p>
<p>Key points of discussion will include:</p>
 
 The Anatomy of Misinformation:&nbsp;Understanding the differences and intersections between misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation. 
 Digital Identity at the Crossroads:&nbsp;Examining how digital identities can be manipulated to spread false narratives, but also how robust digital ID systems can help verify sources and information integrity. 
 Crisis of Trust:&nbsp;Investigating the impact of false information on public trust and how this crisis extends beyond the digital realm into societal fabric and governance. 
 Building Resilience:&nbsp;Strategies for individuals, organizations, and governments to foster resilience against false information through digital literacy, critical thinking, and technological solutions. 
 Policy and Governance:&nbsp;Insights into how policymakers and digital identity leaders can collaborate to establish frameworks that promote truth and transparency in the digital landscape. 
 
<p>Joni Brennan's keynote promises to be a thought-provoking journey through one of the most pressing issues of our time. Attendees will leave with a deeper understanding of the misinformation crisis and practical insights into building and maintaining public trust in a world shaken by crises.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/how-to-build-public-trust-eic24"></a>

  <p>Around the globe countries and continents are taking practical steps towards digital identity infrastructure. Alongside these government initiatives standards bodies and working groups have been mapping a landscape for interoperability and scalability beyond borders.</p>
<p>The “Wallet” is emerging as a new citizen and customer channel replacing apps with more connected digital services. However, unlike payments, the international rules and technical specifications don’t yet exist to enable identity and data sharing beyond the enterprise or seamlessly across borders.</p>
<p>Will this new channel be won by the major operating systems from Google and Apple, building on familiar user experience? Or will important initiatives such as the Open Wallet Foundation and the vision for a digitally connected European Union create the benchmarks for interoperable and scalable services.</p>
<p>This keynote will explore these questions through the lens of a cross-border use case connecting continents, service and identity network providers, all united by overcoming the technical, legal, and commercial challenges to enable digital customers without borders.&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/into-the-wild-and-beyond-the-enterprise-eic24"></a>

  <p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of software development and deployment, the prominence of microservices and Kubernetes, allied with the Policy as Code paradigm, has significantly influenced the direction of authorization strategies. This surge in popularity brings to the forefront a critical question for this workshop: Can the agile, scalable solutions offered by Policy as Code effectively meet the nuanced requirements of traditional business application authorization, or are we trying to fit a square peg into a round hole?</p>
<p>This question does not presume a one-size-fits-all answer but opens the floor to a robust debate on the compatibility and potential gaps between these modern authorization practices and the enduring needs of business applications. The workshop will explore whether the principles of Policy as Code, celebrated for their seamless integration with contemporary cloud-native technologies, can be adapted or extended to serve the distinct, often more static, requirements of enterprise applications.</p>
<p>By inviting diverse perspectives from industry experts and analysts, we aim to dissect the strengths and limitations of Policy as Code within the broader context of application authorization. This exploration will not only shed light on the current state of authorization strategies but also encourage a forward-looking dialogue on how organizations might navigate the divergence between cutting-edge and traditional authorization needs. Can a harmonious solution be engineered to bridge this divide, or do we need distinct approaches to cater to the different landscapes of microservices/Kubernetes and business applications?</p>
<p>Attendees will leave this workshop equipped with a deeper understanding of the ongoing debate, better positioned to evaluate the suitability of Policy as Code for their own organizational needs and the broader implications for the future of authorization strategies.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/workshop-versus-traditional-business-needs-eic24"></a>

<p>In today’s competitive business environment, firms are confronted with complex, computational issues that demand swift resolution. Such problems might be too intricate for a single system to handle or might require an extended time to resolve. For companies that need quick answers, every minute counts. Allowing problems to linger for weeks or months is not feasible for businesses determined to stay ahead of the competition. To address these challenges, enterprises across various industries, such as those in the semiconductor, life sciences, healthcare, financial services and more, have embraced <a href="https://www.ibm.com/high-performance-computing">high-performance computing (HPC)</a>.</p>



<p>With HPC, enterprises are taking advantage of the speed and performance that comes with powerful computers working together. This can be especially helpful amid a steadily growing push to build AI on a larger and larger scale. While analyzing massive amounts of data might feel impossible, HPC enables the use of high-end computational resources that can perform many computations rapidly and in parallel to help businesses get insights faster. At the same time, HPC is used to help businesses bring new products to market. It is also used to better manage risks and more, which is why an increasing number of enterprises are adopting it.</p>



 The role of cloud in HPC 



<p>Most commonly, enterprises that run workloads with surges in activity are finding that they exceed the <a href="https://community.ibm.com/community/user/cloud/blogs/terry-fisher/2024/02/28/achieving-the-impossible-rightsizing-your-hpc?CommunityKey=74d589b7-7276-4d70-acf5-0fc26430c6c0">compute capacity</a> available on-premises. This is an example of where cloud computing can augment on-premises HPC to transform the business’s approach to HPC with cloud resources. Cloud can help address peaks in demand during product development cycles, which might last from a short duration to a longer duration, and enable organizations to get access to the resources and capabilities that they might not have a need for around the clock. Businesses using HPC from the cloud can take advantage of the benefits of greater flexibility, enhanced scalability, better agility, improved cost efficiencies and more.</p>



 Cadence uses IBM Cloud HPC

 Taking a hybrid cloud approach to HPC 



<p>Traditionally, HPC systems were built on-premises. However, the large models and large workloads that exist today are often not compatible with the hardware that most companies have on premises. Given the high up-front costs of obtaining GPUs, CPUs and networking, as well as those of building the data center infrastructures needed to efficiently run compute at scale, many companies have used cloud infrastructure providers that have already made massive investments in their hardware. To realize the full value of public cloud and on-premises infrastructures, many organizations are adopting a hybrid cloud architecture that is focused on the mechanics of transforming portions of a company’s on-premises data center into private cloud infrastructure.</p>



<p>By adopting a <a href="https://community.ibm.com/community/user/cloud/blogs/john-easton/2024/02/13/the-what-and-why-of-hpc-and-why-hybrid-matters?CommunityKey=74d589b7-7276-4d70-acf5-0fc26430c6c0">hybrid cloud approach to HPC</a> where cloud and on premises are used together, organizations can use the strengths of both, allowing organizations to achieve the agility, flexibility and security required to meet their demands. For example, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/high-performance-computing">IBM Cloud® HPC</a> can help organizations flexibly manage compute-intensive workloads on-premises. With security and controls built into the platform, IBM Cloud HPC also allows organizations to consume HPC as a fully managed service while helping them address third- and fourth-party risks.</p>



 Looking ahead 



<p>By using hybrid cloud services through platforms like IBM Cloud HPC, enterprises can solve many of their most difficult challenges. As organizations continue to embrace HPC, they should consider how a hybrid cloud approach can complement traditional on-premises HPC infrastructure deployments.</p>

 What is a CPU? 



<p>The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/central-processing-unit">central processing unit (CPU)</a> is the computer’s brain. It handles the assignment and processing of tasks and manages operational functions that all types of computers use.</p>



<p>CPU types are designated according to the kind of chip that they use for processing data. There’s a wide variety of processors and microprocessors available, with new powerhouse processors always in development. The processing power CPUs provide enables computers to engage in multitasking activities. Before discussing the types of CPUs available, we should clarify some basic terms that are essential to our understanding of CPU types.</p>



 Key CPU terms 



<p>There are numerous components within a CPU, but these aspects are especially critical to CPU operation and our understanding of how they operate:</p>



 
 Cache: When it comes to information retrieval, memory caches are indispensable. Caches are storage areas whose location allows users to quickly access data that’s been in recent use. Caches store data in areas of memory built into a CPU’s processor chip to reach data retrieval speeds even faster than random access memory (RAM) can achieve. Caches can be created through software development or hardware components. 
 



 
 Clock speed: All computers are equipped with an internal clock, which regulates the speed and frequency of computer operations. The clock manages the CPU’s circuitry through the transmittal of electrical pulses. The delivery rate of those pulses is termed clock speed, which is measured in Hertz (Hz) or megahertz (MHz). Traditionally, one way to increase processing speed has been to set the clock to run faster than normal. 
 



 
 Core: Cores act as the processor within the processor. Cores are processing units that read and carry out various program instructions. Processors are classified according to how many cores are embedded into them. CPUs with multiple cores can process instructions considerably faster than single-core processors. (Note: The term “Intel® Core™” is used commercially to market Intel’s product line of multi-core CPUs.) 
 



 
 Threads: Threads are the shortest sequences of programmable instructions that an operating system’s scheduler can independently administer and send to the CPU for processing. Through multithreading—the use of multiple threads running simultaneously—a computer process can be run concurrently. Hyper-threading refers to Intel’s proprietary form of multithreading for the parallelization of computations. 
 



 Other components of the CPU 



<p>In addition to the above components, modern CPUs typically contain the following:</p>



 
 Arithmetic logic unit (ALU): Carries out all arithmetic operations and logical operations, including math equations and logic-based comparisons. Both types are tied to specific computer actions. 



 Buses: Ensures proper data transfer and data flow between components of a computer system. 



 Control unit: Contains intensive circuitry that controls the computer system by issuing a system of electrical pulses and instructs the system to carry out high-level computer instructions. 



 Instruction register and pointer: Displays location of the next instruction set to be executed by the CPU. 



 Memory unit: Manages memory usage and the flow of data between RAM and the CPU. Also, the memory unit supervises the handling of cache memory. 



 Registers: Provides built-in permanent memory for constant, repeated data needs that must be handled regularly and immediately. 
 



 How do CPUs work? 



<p>CPUs use a type of repeated command cycle that’s administered by the control unit in association with the computer clock, which provides synchronization assistance.</p>



<p>The work a CPU does occurs according to an established cycle (called the CPU instruction cycle). The CPU instruction cycle designates a certain number of repetitions, and this is the number of times the basic computing instructions will be repeated, as enabled by that computer’s processing power.</p>



<p>The three basic computing instructions are as follows:</p>



 
 Fetch: Fetches occur anytime data is retrieved from memory. 



 Decode: The decoder within the CPU translates binary instructions into electrical signals, which engage with other parts of the CPU. 



 Execute: Execution occurs when computers interpret and carry out a computer program’s set of instructions. 
 



<p>Basic attempts to generate faster processing speeds have led some computer owners to forego the usual steps involved in creating high-speed performance, which normally require the application of more memory cores. Instead, these users adjust the computer clock so it runs faster on their machine(s). The “overclocking” process is analogous to “jailbreaking” smartphones so their performance can be altered. Unfortunately, like jailbreaking a smartphone, such tinkering is potentially harmful to the device and is roundly disapproved by computer manufacturers.</p>



 Types of central processing units 



<p>CPUs are defined by the processor or microprocessor driving them:</p>



 
 Single-core processor: A single-core processor is a microprocessor with one CPU on its die (the silicon-based material to which chips and microchips are attached). Single-core processors typically run slower than multi-core processors, operate on a single thread and perform the instruction cycle sequence only once at a time. They are best suited to general-purpose computing. 



 Multi-core processor: A multi-core processor is split into two or more sections of activity, with each core carrying out instructions as if they were completely distinct computers, although the sections are technically located together on a single chip. For many computer programs, a multi-core processor provides superior, high-performance output. 



 Embedded processor: An embedded processor is a microprocessor expressly engineered for use in embedded systems. Embedded systems are small and designed to consume less power and be contained within the processor for immediate access to data. Embedded processors include microprocessors and microcontrollers. 



 Dual-core processor: A dual-core processor is a multi-core processor containing two microprocessors that act independently from each other. 



 Quad-core processor: A quad-core processor is a multi-core processor that has four microprocessors functioning independently. 



 Octa-core: An octa-core processor is a multi-core processor that has eight microprocessors functioning independently. 



 Deca-core processor: A deca-core processor is an integrated circuit that has 10 cores on one die or per package. 
 



 Leading CPU manufacturers and the CPUs they make 



<p>Although several companies manufacture products or develop software that supports CPUs, that number has dwindled down to just a few major players in recent years.</p>



<p>The two major companies in this area are Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Each uses a different type of instruction set architecture (ISA). Intel processors use a complex instruction set computer (CISC) architecture. AMD processors follow a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) architecture.</p>



 
 Intel: Intel markets processors and microprocessors through four product lines. Its premium, high-end line is Intel Core. Intel’s Xeon® processors are targeted toward offices and businesses. Intel’s Celeron® and Intel Pentium® lines are considered slower and less powerful than the Core line. 
 



 
 Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): AMD sells processors and microprocessors through two product types: CPUs and APUs (which stands for accelerated processing units). APUs are CPUs that have been equipped with proprietary Radeon™ graphics. AMD’s Ryzen™ processors are high-speed, high-performance microprocessors intended for the video game market. Athlon™ processors was formerly considered AMD’s high-end line, but AMD now uses it as a basic computing alternative. 
 



 
 Arm: Although Arm doesn’t actually manufacture equipment, it does lease out its valued, high-end processor designs and/or other proprietary technologies to other companies who do make equipment. Apple, for example, no longer uses Intel chips in Mac® CPUs but makes its own customized processors based on Arm designs. Other companies are following this example. 
 



 Related CPU and processor concepts 



 Graphics processing unit (GPUs) 



<p>While the term “graphics processing unit” includes the word “graphics,” this phrasing does not truly capture what GPUs are about, which is speed. In this instance, its increased speed is the cause of accelerating computer graphics.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/gpu">GPU</a> is a type of electronic circuit with immediate applications for PCs, smartphones and video game consoles, which was their original use. Now GPUs also serve purposes unrelated to graphics acceleration, like cryptocurrency mining and the training of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/neural-networks">neural networks</a>.</p>



 Microprocessors 



<p>The quest for computer miniaturization continued when <a href="https://www.ibm.com/history/computer-science#:">computer science</a> created a CPU so small that it could be contained within a small integrated circuit chip, called the microprocessor. Microprocessors are designated by the number of cores they support.</p>



<p>A CPU core is “the brain within the brain,” serving as the physical processing unit within a CPU. Microprocessors can contain multiple processors. Meanwhile, a physical core is a CPU built right into a chip, but which only occupies one socket, thus enabling other physical cores to tap into the same computing environment.</p>



 Output devices 



<p>Computing would be a vastly limited activity without the presence of output devices to execute the CPU’s sets of instruction. Such devices include peripherals, which attach to the outside of a computer and vastly increase its functionality.</p>



<p>Peripherals provide the means for the computer user to interact with the computer and get it to process instructions according to the computer user’s wishes. They include desktop essentials like keyboards, mice, scanners and printers.</p>



<p>Peripherals are not the only attachments common to the modern computer. There are also input/output devices in wide use and they both receive information and transmit information, like video cameras and microphones.</p>



 Power consumption 



<p>Several issues are impacted by power consumption. One of them is the amount of heat produced by multi-core processors and how to dissipate excess heat from that device so the computer processor remains thermally protected. For this reason, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/hyperscale">hyperscale data centers</a> (which house and use thousands of servers) are designed with extensive air-conditioning and cooling systems.</p>



<p>There are also questions of sustainability, even if we’re talking about a few computers instead of a few thousand. The more powerful the computer and its CPUs, the more energy will be required to support its operation—and in some macro-sized cases, that can mean gigahertz (GHz) of computing power.</p>



 Specialized chips 



<p>The most profound development in computing since its origins, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> is now impacting most if not all computing environments. One development we’re seeing in the CPU space is the creation of specialty processors that have been built specifically to handle the large and complex <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/workload">workloads</a> associated with AI (or other specialty purposes):</p>



 
 Such equipment includes the Tensor Streaming Processor (TSP), which handles <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning (ML)</a> tasks in addition to AI applications. Other products equally suited to AI work are the AMD Ryzen Threadripper™ 3990X 64-Core processor and the Intel Core i9-13900KS Desktop Processor, which uses 24 cores. 



 For an application like video editing, many users opt for the Intel Core i7 14700KF 20-Core, 28-thread CPU. Still others select the Ryzen 9 7900X, which is considered AMD’s best CPU for video editing purposes. 



 In terms of video game processors, the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D features a 3D V-Cache technology that helps it elevate and accelerate game graphics. 



 For general-purpose computing, such as running an OS like Windows or browsing multimedia websites, any recent-model AMD or Intel processor should easily handle routine tasks. 
 



 Transistors 



<p>Transistors are hugely important to electronics in general and to computing in particular. The term is a mix of “transfer resistance” and typically refers to&nbsp;a component made of semiconductors used to limit and/or control the amount of electrical current flowing through a circuit.</p>



<p>In computing, transistors are just as elemental. The transistor is the basic building unit behind the creation of all microchips. Transistors help comprise the CPU, and they’re what makes the binary language of 0s and 1s that computers use to interpret Boolean logic.</p>



 The next wave of CPUs 



<p>Computer scientists are always working to increase the output and functionality of CPUs. Here are some projections about future CPUs:</p>



 
 New chip materials: The silicon chip has long been the mainstay of the computing industry and other electronics. The <a href="https://medium.com/@starcompseo/the-future-of-processors-emerging-technologies-and-trends-560f54ac0998#:~:text=The%20future%20of%20processors%20will,as%20autonomous%20vehicles%20and%20healthcare.">new wave </a>of processors (link resides outside ibm.com) will take advantage of new chip materials that offer increased performance. These include carbon nanotubes (which display excellent thermal conductivity through carbon-based tubes approximately 100,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair), graphene (a substance that possesses outstanding thermal and electrical properties) and spintronic components (which rely on the study of the way electrons spin, and which could eventually produce a spinning transistor). 



 Quantum over binary: Although current CPUs depend on the use of a binary language, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/quantum-computing">quantum computing</a> will eventually change that. Instead of binary language, quantum computing derives its core principles from quantum mechanics, a discipline that has revolutionized the study of physics. In quantum computing, binary digits (1s and 0s) can exist in multiple environments (instead of in two environments currently). And because this data will live in more than one location, fetches will become easier and faster. The upshot of this for the user will be a marked increase in computing speed and an overall boost in processing power. 
 



 
 AI everywhere: As artificial intelligence continues to make its profound presence felt—both in the computing industry and in our daily lives—it will have a direct influence on CPU design. As the future unfolds, expect to see an increasing integration of AI functionality directly into computer hardware. When this happens, we’ll experience AI processing that’s significantly more efficient. Further, users will notice an increase in processing speed and devices that will be able to make decisions independently in real time. While we wait for that hardware implementation to occur, chip manufacturer Cerebras has already unveiled a processor its makers claim to be the “<a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/the-fastest-ai-chip-in-the-world-gigantic-ai-cpu-has-almost-one-million-cores-cerebras-has-nvidia-firmily-in-its-sights-as-it-unveils-the-wse-3-a-chip-that-can-train-ai-models-with-24-trillion-parameters#:~:text=Pro-,'The%20fastest%20AI%20chip%20in%20the%20world'%3A%20Gigantic%20AI,models%20with%2024%20trillion%20parameters">fastest AI chip in the world</a>” (link resides outside ibm.com). Its WSE-3 chip can train AI models with as many as 24 trillion parameters. This mega-chip contains four trillion transistors, in addition to 900,000 cores. 
 



 CPUs that offer strength and flexibility 



<p>Companies expect a lot from the computers they invest in. In turn, those computers rely upon having a CPUs with enough processing power to handle the challenging workloads found in today’s data-intensive business environment.</p>



<p>Organizations need workable solutions that can change as they change. Smart computing depends upon having equipment that capably supports your mission, even as that work evolves. IBM servers offer strength and flexibility, so you can concentrate on the job at hand. Find the IBM servers you need to get the results your organization relies upon—both today and tomorrow.</p>

  The minimum threshold for Crypto Travel Rule in South Africa is R25,000 ($1,357).  CASPs must verify and share originator and beneficiary details for regulatory compliance.  CASPs need risk-based policies for handling transactions, especially with unhosted wallets, to mitigate financial crimes.  <p>With the majority of adults in Africa not having access to a bank account, cryptocurrency is widely popular in this continent. In sub-Saharan Africa, crypto adoption is among the highest in South&nbsp;Africa.</p><p>While cryptocurrency adoption is still in its infancy in the country, the authorities have initiated several initiatives, such as declaring crypto a financial product and implementing regulatory measures, including <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule">the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule</a>.</p> ‍Background of the Crypto Travel Rule in South&nbsp;Africa <p>‍In 2020, changes to the Financial Intelligence Centre Act (FIC Act of FICA), which applies AML/CFT laws in South Africa, aligned its cryptocurrency regulatory framework with that of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)’s standards on crypto and exchange regulation.</p><p>This includes enacting the Crypto Travel Rule, which applies to crypto companies operating inside and outside South Africa. It is also imperative to mention that the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) is the one governing the crypto sector in South&nbsp;Africa.</p> ‍Key Features of the Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>‍South Africa’s IFWG <a href="https://www.treasury.gov.za/comm_media/press/2020/20200414%20IFWG%20Position%20Paper%20on%20Crypto%20Assets.pdf">2020 Position Paper on Crypto Assets</a> mandates the Crypto Travel Rule. According to this, originating and beneficiary Crypto Asset Service Providers or CASPs should obtain, hold, and provide accurate information on their customers.</p><p>On April 18, 2024, the FIC <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Draft-Directive-9-Travel-rule-relating-to-crypto-asset-transfers.pdf">published a draft directive</a> regarding the implementation of the “Travel Rule” regarding crypto transfers. The directive’s purpose is to ensure that those who engage in crypto transfer activities implement FATF’s recommendations. Those who fail to comply with this directive are subject to an administrative sanction.</p><p>The compliance requirement includes conducting customer identification and verification (KYC), developing and implementing a Risk Management and Compliance Programme, training employees, conducting customer due diligence (CDD), keeping accurate records, regularly monitoring for suspicious and unusual activity, and reporting any unusual transactions to the&nbsp;FIC.</p> ‍Compliance Requirements <p>‍Crypto asset service providers (CASPs) must report cash transactions over R25,000 ($1,357). They need to provide the following details: For originators:</p>  Full name  Wallet address  Residential address (if available)  Date and place of&nbsp;birth  Identity number for South Africans, or passport number for non-residents  <p>For Beneficiary:</p>  Name  Wallet address  <p>This data must be verified according to the FIC Act and the CASP’s Risk Management and Compliance Programme.</p><p>For cross-border transfers below R5,000 (about $270), CASPs must share the originator’s full name and wallet address, along with the beneficiary’s name and wallet address, without needing to verify the information unless there are concerns of money laundering or terrorism financing.</p><p>CASPs must also identify and vet the receiving CASP, ensuring it can protect data confidentiality and isn’t involved in illicit activities. They should not process transfers that cannot meet these security and verification requirements. Moreover, CASPs should have policies to decide when to suspend or reject a transfer that lacks necessary details, with procedures in place for any follow-up actions.</p><p>Finally, both originating and beneficiary CASPs are responsible for securely storing this information to ensure record accuracy and protection from unauthorized disclosure. Measures like post-event or real-time monitoring are also used to track transfers that are missing required information.</p> ‍Impact on Cryptocurrency Exchanges and&nbsp;Wallets <p>‍In South Africa, CASPs must register as “accountable institutions.” As of March 2024, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/south-africas-financial-conduct-regulator-approves-59-crypto-licences-2024-03-13/#:~:text=JOHANNESBURG%2C%20March%2013%20(Reuters),with%20regulating%20the%20asset%20class.">the FSCA has approved 59 operating licenses</a> for crypto businesses, with another 262 applications under&nbsp;review.</p><p>Exchanges are required to monitor transfers between CASPs and those involving unhosted wallets — where owners control their private keys directly. Following the FIC directive, both the sending and receiving CASPs must develop and maintain risk-based policies for handling transfers to and from unhosted wallets. This includes establishing procedures for gathering additional information on these wallets when there’s an elevated risk of money laundering, terrorist financing, or proliferation financing.</p> ‍Global Context and Comparisons <p>‍As a member of FATF, South Africa was greylisted by the international agency in 2023. Since then, it has been <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/High-risk-and-other-monitored-jurisdictions/Increased-monitoring-february-2024.html">working with FATF</a> to strengthen the effectiveness of its AML/CFT&nbsp;regime.</p><p>‍<a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/almost-70-of-all-fatf-assessed-countries-have-implemented-the-crypto-travel-rule">According to the latest FATF report</a>, South Africa has been labeled as “Partially Complaint,” along with Brazil, Denmark, Estonia, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-hong-kong">Hong Kong</a>, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Turkey, and Venezuela, regarding its implementation of the Crypto Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p> ‍Concluding Thoughts <p>‍To dissuade financial crimes and avoid increased monitoring by the FATF, South Africa has created a robust regulatory <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">AML/CFT framework</a> to govern crypto assets. With citizens’ interest in crypto growing and regulators providing a clear set of rules that are challenging to follow, South Africa believes these measures will help it attract more crypto companies and investor attention while mitigating risks.</p> ‍FAQs  ‍‍Q1: What is the minimum transaction amount that triggers the FATF Travel Rule in South&nbsp;Africa? <p>‍Transactions over R25,000 ($1,357) must comply with the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p> ‍Q2: What information must CASPs exchange under the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule? <p>‍CASPs must exchange detailed information, including the full names and wallet addresses of both the originator and beneficiary.</p> ‍Q3: What requirements apply to transactions involving unhosted wallets under the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule? <p>‍Transactions involving unhosted wallets require CASPs to implement risk-based policies to identify and mitigate potential financial crimes.</p> ‍Q4: What is the best Travel Rule solution for VASPs in South&nbsp;Africa? <p>‍Shyft Veriscope stands out as the best Travel Rule solution for VASPs in South Africa due to its automated counterparty VASP detection, secure peer-to-peer data transfer without third-party servers, and robust compliance features that align with FATF guidelines.</p> About Veriscope <p>‍Veriscope, the compliance infrastructure on Shyft Network, empowers Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) with the only frictionless solution for complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 16th May to 31th&nbsp;May <p>Welcome to the latest issue of the Veriscope Regulatory Recap. This edition unpacks the shifts in the US crypto regulatory landscape as the 2024 presidential elections draw near, highlighting how these changes could impact users and the broader crypto&nbsp;market.</p> Crypto is Now a Major Election&nbsp;Issue <p>With crypto now a hot topic in the US political scene, presidential candidates have reportedly started warming up to&nbsp;it.</p><p>Take Presidential candidate Donald Trump, for instance. Once a Bitcoin skeptic, calling it a “scam” in 2021, the former US President is now promising to protect citizens’ rights to own BTC and “stop Joe Biden’s crusade to crush&nbsp;crypto.”</p><p>He has made several other promises, including supporting the right to self-custody, ensuring the future of BTC remains in the US, opposing the creation of a CBDC, and advocating for the release of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht.</p><p>Additionally, Trump’s campaign has begun accepting crypto donations, and his crypto holdings have now surpassed $10&nbsp;million.</p><p>As a result, Trump’s potential return to the White House is being seen as “broadly positive” for&nbsp;crypto.</p>(<a href="https://x.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1794537413907214356">Image Source</a>)<p>In response, President Joe Biden also made a surprising shift as his re-election campaign began consulting crypto industry players for advice on “crypto policy moving forward.”</p><p>These outreach efforts, however, started just a few weeks ago, shortly after the Biden administration announced it would veto the SAB 121’s repeal, a bill that discourages banks and financial institutions from offering crypto custody services.</p> Change in Voters’ Crypto Perception <p>This growing political engagement with crypto is also shaping public&nbsp;opinion.</p><p>A recent Grayscale survey reveals a shift in how voters view crypto’s role in politics. Conducted by The Harris Poll from April 30 to May 2, the survey polled 1,768 adults planning to vote in the upcoming election.</p><p>The results highlight a cautious approach among potential investors: 44% of US voters who currently don’t own any crypto stated they are “waiting on additional policies and/or regulation” before making a purchase.</p><p>Millennial and GenZ voters, in particular, are strongly interested in crypto, with 62% seeing it as the “future of finance.”</p> SEC Approves Spot ETH&nbsp;ETFs <p>In a surprising move, the securities regulator approved 19b-4 applications from BlackRock, Fidelity, ARK 21Shares, Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, VanEck, Bitwise, and Invesco Galaxy for Spot Ethereum ETFs last&nbsp;week.</p><p>What makes this interesting is that it happened despite the SEC considering Ether security, according to several&nbsp;reports.</p><p>Spot Ether ETFs, however, won’t begin trading yet as they await the necessary S-1 registration approvals. This process is expected to take a few weeks to a few&nbsp;months.</p> Crypto-favorable Bill also&nbsp;Approved <p>Another recent significant development is the approval of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) by the US House of Representatives. This act establishes a new legal framework for cryptocurrencies, aiming to provide regulatory clarity and promote&nbsp;growth.</p><p>The bill also gives the CFTC the regulatory authority to regulate crypto as a commodity when it runs on a decentralized blockchain and clarifies the jurisdictional boundaries between the SEC and CFTC over digital asset&nbsp;markets.</p>(<a href="https://x.com/jessepollak/status/1793400905028547009">Image Source</a>)<p>The bill was approved with a bipartisan 279–136 vote (with 208 Republicans and 71 Democrats voting in favor) despite the SEC Chairman Gary Gensler warning about “new regulatory gaps,” financial risks, and the bill undermining “decades of precedent regarding the oversight of investment contracts.”</p> Wisconsin’s Pension Funds Invests in Bitcoin&nbsp;ETF <p>Another interesting development came from Wisconsin, where the state-owned Wisconsin Pension Fund recently ventured into the cryptocurrency market by investing $180 million in a Bitcoin ETF. This move, constituting 0.1% of its total assets, represents a significant step towards integrating high-risk, potentially high-return investments into a traditionally conservative portfolio.</p><a href="https://x.com/saylor/status/1797535279278072302">(Image Source)</a><p>According to <a href="https://pbswisconsin.org/news-item/david-krause-on-the-state-of-wisconsin-investing-in-bitcoin/">Marquette University’s David Krause</a>, this strategic allocation not only introduces diversification but serves as a trial to gauge public reaction and could potentially act as an inflation hedge, thus redefining traditional investment strategies for pension&nbsp;funds.</p><p>Moreover, this approach might just set a precedent, prompting other US pension funds to consider similar investments in the evolving asset class of digital currencies.</p> Concluding Thoughts: What’s&nbsp;Ahead? <p>As we wrap up this edition of the Veriscope Regulatory Recap, it’s clear that political support for crypto in the US could reshape the industry both here and globally. With key elections coming up and significant laws being passed, the future looks promising for wider crypto adoption. How these changes affect the global market will be something to&nbsp;watch.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/fatf-travel-rule-compliance-guide-for-south-africa">FATF Travel Rule Compliance Guide for South&nbsp;Africa</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-switzerland">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in Switzerland</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-germany">FATF Travel Rule Compliance in&nbsp;Germany</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-mexico">Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in&nbsp;Mexico</a></p><p><a href="https://issuu.com/shyftnetwork/docs/global_crypto_regulatory_outlook_2024_-_shyft_netw#google_vignette">The Visual Guide on Global Crypto Regulatory Outlook&nbsp;2024</a></p> ‍About Veriscope <p>‍Veriscope, the compliance infrastructure on Shyft Network, empowers Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) with the only frictionless solution for complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

 Streamline On-chain Compliance:<br>
Configure and Customize Anytime 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in May 2024.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>I’m thrilled to announce a significant UX enhancement for self-services on compliance settings to our platform, reinforcing our commitment to providing a top-tier on-chain operating system for financial institutions and innovative companies.</p>
<p>Controlling tokenized securities means controlling the underlying token smart contracts. Our latest update simplifies this process, allowing you to streamline the compliance configuration of the smart contracts effortlessly. With easy-to-use interfaces, you can customize compliance rule settings anytime, ensuring your tokens enforce on-chain compliance with great flexibility to meet your needs.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>Here’s how you can benefit from these updated self-service token settings:</p>
<p>Set up compliance on tokens anytime:&nbsp;Unlike other token standards, the ERC-3643 standard allows compliance configurations to be set up during token creation or after deployment, without requiring redeployment. Our user-friendly T-REX Platform makes it easy to deploy tokens and configure compliance settings, including identity eligibility, jurisdictions, supply rules, and transfer rules through simple forms. You can update compliance settings at any time.</p>
<p>Plug additional custom compliance rules to cover any use case:&nbsp;With the modular compliance capability of the ERC-3643 smart contracts, you can add compliance rules over time, ensuring flexibility and scalability. Our platform provides the most commonly used compliance settings and allows you to incorporate additional rules to tailor the setup for any specific use case.</p>
<p>Change tokenization providers made effortless:&nbsp;One of the key advantages of tokenized securities using ERC-3643 is their independent smart contract suite, ensuring no dependency on a software provider. Tokens can be imported from one tokenization platform to another, allowing issuers to switch to solutions that better address their pain points. We ensure that ERC-3643 tokens can be easily imported to our SaaS tokenization platform, making setup simple and efficient.</p>
<p>Our goal is to simplify token management for your operational teams, enabling you and your agents to effortlessly issue, manage, and distribute tokenized securities on your own.</p>

 Introduction to Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) 



<p>If you’re delving into decentralized digital identity (SSI), understanding Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) is crucial. DIDs are unique identifiers that users can create and control without relying on third parties. They use cryptographic elements (public and private keys) to demonstrate ownership. At Extrimian, we provide comprehensive guidance to help you choose the right DID method for your needs.</p>



Source: Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0 | W3C: https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/



 



 Disclaimer 



<p>This article covers only a few of the many points to consider when choosing a DID method. For a deeper understanding, we invite you to watch the following Extrimian Academy Masterclass: <a href="https://extrimian.io/courses/masterclass-what-to-consider-before-choosing-a-did-method/" title="">What to consider before choosing a DID Method.</a></p>



 Understanding DID Documents 



<p>Each DID comes with a DID document. This is a standard file that contains the DID controller’s public key, possibly other keys, and relevant metadata. This document is key for verifying the DID’s authenticity and enabling digital authentication and signing.</p>



 What Is a DID Method? 



<p>A DID method is a technical specification detailing how DIDs and their documents are created, resolved, and managed across systems. DID methods can vary, catering to different functionalities and infrastructure needs.</p>



<p>Learn more about DIDs or Decentralized Identifiers with this: <a href="https://extrimian.io/wikis/decentralized-identifiers-dids/" title="">DIDs Wiki</a></p>



 Key Factors to Consider When Choosing a DID Method 



 Subject of the DID 



 
 Individuals: Data protection regulations like GDPR impose strict requirements that DID methods must meet, including the ability to delete personal data. 



 Organizations: Often require advanced functionalities like managing multiple authorized signatories. 



 Objects (IoT): Need to support a high volume of transactions and secure interactions. 
 



 Legal and Regulatory Framework 



<p>The legal and regulatory environment is crucial when selecting a DID method. Privacy and data protection laws vary across jurisdictions and can influence the choice of method and infrastructure used.</p>



 Required Functionality vs. Technical Complexity 



<p>It’s important to balance the functionality you need against the technical complexity and infrastructure requirements. Some DID methods offer advanced features like key rotation and designated signatories but may be more costly to implement and maintain.</p>



 Regulation Compatibility 



<p>To comply with data protection regulations, it’s essential to choose a DID method that allows for efficient modification or deletion of personal information to respect privacy rights like the right to be forgotten.</p>



 Examples of DID Methods 



 
 DID Web: Uses standard URLs for resolvability via HTTP/S. Ideal for web interoperability. 



 DID Key: Creates DIDs directly from cryptographic keys. Suitable for straightforward setups. 



 DID ION: Based on Bitcoin, it offers a scalable and secure solution. Recommended for high-security needs. 



 DID QuarkID: A decentralized, open, extensible, and multi-chain SSI protocol. Perfect for flexible digital identity management in Latin America. 
 



<p>For more examples, visit the <a href="https://identity.foundation/" title="">DIF documentation</a>.</p>



 Quick Guide: 10 Questions to Choose a DID Method 



<p>Here’s a quick guide from Extrimian with key questions to help you select a DID method that fits your legal, security, and functionality needs:</p>



 
 What type of entity does the DID represent (individual, organization, IoT device)? 



 What are the legal and regulatory requirements in the entity’s jurisdiction? 



 Does the DID method allow for data deletion to comply with regulations like GDPR? 



 What level of security is required for the specific application? 



 What advanced functionalities are needed (key rotation, multiple signatories, etc.)? 



 What is the estimated cost of implementation and maintenance of the DID method? 



 Is it necessary for the DID method to support a high volume of transactions? 



 How critical are ease of resolution and web interoperability for the application? 



 Does the DID method allow for efficient modification or deletion of personal information? 



 How flexible is the DID method to adapt to future needs and technological changes? 
 



 Conclusion 



<p>Choosing a DID method involves a detailed understanding of the subject, legal and regulatory requirements, and specific functional needs against technical complexity and costs. At Extrimian, we can assist you with our expertise in defining and implementing suitable solutions. <a href="https://extrimian.com/contact" title="">Contact us</a> for more information and support.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Technical interoperability refers to the ability of different systems, devices, applications, or components to connect, communicate, and exchange data seamlessly and effectively. This involves adhering to common standards and protocols to ensure compatibility, enabling diverse systems to work together without requiring significant modifications.</p>
</blockquote>
 Introduction 
<p>As more ecosystems look to enable digital trust architectures for their participants, interoperability continues to be deemed important but often misunderstood. If you’re working towards enabling a digital trust ecosystem for B2C use cases, consider the following questions:</p>
 
 What ‘technical interoperability’ strategy should you consider to ensure maximum uptake and value creation for your ecosystem? 
 What technical dependencies exist in outside ecosystems when it comes to credentials and wallets? 
 
<p>In my opinion, it looks likely that Government Wallets and OEM Wallets will dominate the storage of high-value personal identity credentials, both in the short term and potentially in the long term. This means that not only will government credential issuers define their own issuance technical requirements, but they will also place conditions on what wallets their issued credentials can be issued to, what technical stack these wallets support, and even business logic.</p>
<p>This raises an important question for non-government credential issuers, verifiers, and ecosystem governance authorities: Should you invest time and resources in defining new technical interoperability profiles, or what your ecosystem will support? Or is this effort redundant if your goal is to verify high-value personal identity credentials?</p>
 Defining Your Ecosystem Strategy 
<p>When thinking about how to best benefit your ecosystem with digital trust tools, here are some considerations to think about:</p>
 
 Ecosystem Goals: Define your business goals. Define the primary functions and goals of your ecosystem. Define your locus of governance and influence. This helps in understanding the scope and the specific needs of your ecosystem. What ecosystems are you working in, and do they fit together nicely? 
 Bootstrapping: Decide whether or not your ecosystem requires a foundational credential from outside your ecosystem to get started. If so, understand the technical interoperability requirements of that system to know what bridges are needed to first become a consumer of credentials. 
 Wallet: Decide where it makes sense for your ecosystem’s credentials to be issued to. Should there be any conditions on what wallets can receive these credential offers? 
 Consuming External Inputs: Understand what additional inputs your ecosystem needs from external ecosystems and how these can be consumed by your participants. This involves defining the necessary bridges and ensuring compatibility with external profiles to create a frictionless user experience. 
 Providing Outputs Externally: Determine if your ecosystem wants to produce outputs that are usable by other ecosystems. This might involve aligning with common standards and external ecosystem interoperability profiles. 
 
 Interoperability Profiles and Wallet Compliance 
<p>If your ecosystem requires consuming credentials from external ecosystems and their wallets (Bootstrapping), you will need to demonstrate alignment to their technical profiles.</p>
<p>Examples of technical interoperability profiles that Governments Issuers, Government Wallets and OEM Wallet providers are aligning to include the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/concepts/0302-aries-interop-profile#aries-interop-profile-version-10">Aries Interop Profile 1.0</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/concepts/0302-aries-interop-profile/README.md">Aries Interop Profile 2.0</a>, the <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html">ISO mDL profile (ISO 18013-5)</a>, the <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid4vc-high-assurance-interoperability-profile-sd-jwt-vc-1_0-00.html">OpenID4VC High Assurance Interoperability Profile with SD-JWT VC</a>, the <a href="https://dutchblockchaincoalition.org/en/bouwstenen-2/diip-2">Dutch Decentralized Identity Interop Profile (DIIP)</a>, and others. You’ll notice that they all make hard decisions on credential exchange protocols, credential formats, identifier types, signatures schemes, revocation methods and more. Further, some credentials are bound to wallets, others aren’t – this may be valuable for you to know for your own use cases.</p>
<p>If you decide that it’s not important for your ecosystem and its participants to exert any sort of wallet control today, does it make sense to have your ecosystem credentials issued to these government or OEM wallets? A positive aspect of this approach is that your credentials will sit alongside high-value identity credentials and can be used in conjunction with them during verification interactions. A potential downside is the dependency on these third-party wallets, which could pose risks in the future. However, this approach is straightforward, as illustrated in the next section when we discuss practical examples.</p>
<p>If it is important for you and your participants to exert control over wallets, consider whether you are dependent on other ecosystems to bootstrap your use case. If the answer is no, then think about the demand side for your ecosystem’s credentials. Will demand come from external ecosystems outside of your governance, or solely from within your ecosystem?</p>
<p>If the answer is yes, and governments are unlikely to issue credentials to non-government or OEM wallets in the near term, it’s crucial to consider user flows and associated risks. If you’re conducting proofs by accepting credentials from third-party wallets and want to extend a credential offer to participants in your ecosystem-approved wallets, ensure the user experience remains smooth and the risk vectors low. This is particularly important given the difficulty of conducting app-to-app binding for data exchanges on certain mobile phones.</p>
 Practical Examples and User Experience 
 Vancouver’s Digital Credentials Initiative 
<p>A practical example of this concept is the <a href="https://vancouver.ca/news-calendar/vancouver-leads-development-of-credentials-technology-may-2024.aspx">City of Vancouver’s initiative to modernize city services using digital credentials</a>. In collaboration with Technical Safety BC (TSBC), the Land Title and Survey Authority of BC (LTSA), and the Ministry of Citizens’ Services, Vancouver is issuing digital credentials to municipal residents to streamline processes such as permitting and licensing.</p>
 
 Ecosystem Goals: The City of Vancouver, and broader municipal primary function is to modernize city services by reducing manual verification steps in permitting and licensing processes. Their locus of governance is municipal services. 
 Bootstrapping: Vancouver’s initiative relies on foundational credentials issued by provincial partners such as the Ministry of Citizens’ Services (<a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/digital-trust/online-identity/person-credential/">Person credential</a>, and BC Registries (<a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/digital-trust/online-identity/digital-business-card/">Digital Business Card</a>). 
 Wallet: The city has decided that it makes sense for their ecosystem to rely on the provincial wallet as a utility for their ecosystem’s credentials. There’s limited value in them owning the wallet experience as there is a direct dependency between the municipality and the province. 
 Consuming External Inputs: Beyond consuming provincial credentials, the municipality integrates inputs from provincial partners such as Technical Safety BC (TSBC), the Land Title and Survey Authority of BC (LTSA) to enable more modernization of municipal services. 
 Providing Outputs Externally: Vancouver produces digital credentials that can be used by other government ecosystem organizations. 
 
<p>After answering these questions, it’s clear that technical interoperability isn’t a complicated discussion. The fact that the ecosystem is localized makes a difference as well. Therefore, a decision was made to align with the <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/government-id/bc-wallet">BC Wallet</a> (based on Aries Interop Profile 1.0).</p>
 Airlines and Seamless Travel Initiatives 
<p>There are many other efforts underway within the airlines to improve customer journeys through the use of digital credentials and other digital trust tools. Being an IATA Strategic Partner allows Northern Block to have purview over active industry efforts to modernize travel experiences.</p>
 
 Ecosystem Goals: Airlines aim to provide seamless travel experiences through identity management, offer management, payments and fulfillments.&nbsp; 
 Bootstrapping: Airlines may require foundational government personal identity credentials such prior to issuing their own credentials to customers. 
 Wallet: Airlines require direct interactions with their customers, therefore any wallet functionalities must be embedded within their existing channels. 
 Consuming External Inputs: Outside of government-issued credentials, airlines may need to consume credentials from other travel ecosystem participants such as airports for security clearances, loyalty providers for frequent flier benefits, and retailers for duty-free shopping privileges. 
 Providing Outputs Externally: Just like airlines will value the consumption of credentials from third parties, these same third parties will also value airline issued credentials within their business processes. 
 
<p>Airlines must remain in control of their products, money flows and data. This changes the outlook around technical interoperability profiles compared to the first example with the City of Vancouver.</p>
<p>To this end, airlines prefer to integrate wallet capabilities into their existing mobile apps. Their customers are already using these apps, and customer data is crucial for creating personalized travel experiences. Their interoperability story gets more complex considering the ecosystem needs and the global footprint of the industry. Ongoing work is happening to address industry technical interoperability challenges.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>In summary, while evaluating technical interoperability profiles for your ecosystem might seem like a daunting task, we hope this blog has provided valuable insights on how to approach this challenge. It may not be as complicated as you think, and you may not need to overanalyze the short-term implications. As the adoption of digital credentials grows, you can adapt to the evolving landscape.

 We unpack our ‘Challenges in Compliance Survey’ and reveal the different priorities of global and Latin American operators. 



<p>The gross gaming revenue (GGR) of the Latin American (LATAM) gambling market is <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1326686/betting-market-gross-gaming-revenue-latin-america/">projected to exceed $3.4 billion</a> by the end of 2025. Considering the GGR in 2020 was just $1.3 billion, this is a huge leap.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are many reasons for LATAM’s projected rapid growth, including the opening of multiple lucrative markets and simply the sheer number of potential players.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides <a href="https://sbcnews.co.uk/sportsbook/2024/02/12/colombia-2024-gambling-tax/">Colombia</a>, which has had relatively clear regulation since 2016, many Latin American countries are either in their infancy or gestation phases, meaning they have a valuable opportunity to learn from the mistakes and successes that established markets have already made.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To understand the challenges facing gambling operators, new and old, we commissioned the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/online-gambling-top-compliance-challenges-2024/">‘Challenges in Compliance Survey’</a>, featuring insights and opinions from 104 global compliance professionals from the gambling industry. Respondents were a mixture of the old guard, including the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ukgc-plans-uk-gambling-sector/">UK</a>, Malta and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/exploring-black-market-gambling-in-germany/">Germany</a> to the new like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-gambling-license-structure/">Brazil</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/peru-gambling-regulation/">Peru</a> and Chile. In this blog we explore the differences in responses between global players and LATAM operators and consider the reasons.</p>



 Top compliance concerns for LATAM operators. 



<p>In answer to the question, ‘How challenging for your business are the following compliance issues’, there did appear to be consensus on the most difficult issue, with 30% of LATAM operators and 22.73% of global respondents choosing the ‘Source of funds check’ option.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the most interesting, but perhaps unsurprising compliance challenges for LATAM (considering its ever-changing regulatory landscape) was ‘Staying up to date with regulatory changes’, with more than one in five (22.2%) saying it was the most difficult challenge, compared to just 6% of global respondents.</p>



<p>[Read more about the regulatory status of some of the biggest LATAM markets later in the blog.]&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other stark difference in responses was the 22.2% of LATAM respondents that cited ‘Licensing and permissions’ as the most difficult compliance challenge, compared to just 7.58% of global respondents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“With the LATAM gambling market so early in its journey toward regulation, it’s understandable that almost half of LATAM respondents list regulatory concerns and licensing and permission as their most difficult compliance challenges. From rates of taxation and anti-money laundering policies to licensing requirements and responsible gambling measures, each country is approaching issues slightly differently.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>As many LATAM countries are at a similar stage, there is also a very real game of ‘let’s wait to see what our neighbors are doing’ being played out. A game of chicken, if you will, of who’ll move first and what path will they take.</p>Ronaldo Kos, Head of LATAM Gaming at IDnow.</blockquote>



 The global impact of fraud. 



<p>When asked which types of fraud they had been subjected to in the last 12 months, there were negligible differences between responses, with bonus abuse (Global: 65.57% LATAM: 70%) and document fraud (Global: 57.38% LATAM: 50%) the two most common fraud attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interestingly, operators based in LATAM said that they had not been subjected to any money laundering in the last 12 months, whereas almost one in five global operators (19.67%) said they had. Whether this is indicative of fewer Latin American money launderers or less robust AML controls in LATAM gambling platforms is up for debate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding the next 12 months, respondents cited both <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/bonus-abuse-gambling/">‘Bonus abuse’</a> (Global: 54.10%, LATAM: 80%) and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/social-engineering/">‘Social engineering’</a> (Global: 54.10%, LATAM: 60%) as the top areas for concern.</p>



 AI and the different approaches in fighting fraud and optimizing onboarding. 



<p>As gambling operators scale and look for ways to expand their business, especially during periods of increased activity, many have implemented AI-based tools to help in their fight against fraud, but perhaps not as many as you think.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, despite AI’s ability to increase automation, reduce costs and act as an effective fraud prevention tool, just over a third of global respondents (36%), and under a third of LATAM respondents (30%) said they were currently using AI to fight fraud. Interestingly, however, LATAM operators appear to be more forward-thinking regarding the implementation of AI-based tools in the next 12 months, with 50% saying they have plans to implement vs just 37.70% of global respondents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The extensive consultation periods on Brazil’s gambling regulations, and on the technical, payment and security requirements operators must follow (including geolocation requirements) clearly shows that LATAM operators are taking the threat of fraud very seriously.</p>



<p>Operators be warned: if you’re not taking advantage of the benefits of AI-based tools to enhance your identity verification efforts, or bolster your fraud-prevention arsenal, then know that fraudsters are probably using them to attack you.</p>



<p>“While in the past, cybercriminals needed a certain base level of technical skills to produce fake documents or websites, AI-augmented fraudsters can utilize generative AI to create authentic-looking documents, videos, images and audio,” said Lovro Persen, Director of Document and Fraud at IDnow.</p>



<p>Of course, the other major use case for implementing AI tools is to aid with huge volumes of new customers.</p>



 







<p>“Onboarding is the most crucial stage of the customer journey, so it should be as seamless as possible. While the above data speaks to the myriads of different components that operators deem as ‘very important,’ it also reveals some interesting difference between the priorities of global and LATAM operators. </p>



<p>“For example, almost 7 out of 10 global respondents agreed that ‘Security and data privacy’ was very important, but only 37.5% of LATAM respondents agreed. A similar disparity was also seen for ‘Cost’, with almost double the number of global respondents (25.49%) citing it as a very important factor compared to LATAM respondents (12.5%),” said&nbsp;Ronaldo.</p>



<p>Clearly, LATAM operators are prepared to make the necessary financial investment and although concerned about security and data privacy, remain less so than their global counterparts, suggesting they are eager to enter the market and participate by any means necessary.</p>



 Get onboard. Pick-ups and drop-offs. 



<p>While global operators believed there were a variety of reasons that customers abandoned onboarding, including Registration; Document Verification; Selfie Checks and Document Submission, the only area that appears to be a cause for concern for LATAM operators is ‘Document submission.’ In the ‘Challenges in Compliance Survey,’ we separated Document submission into two categories: a) including personal information; bank statements; utility bills (Global: 50.98% LATAM: 62.5%) and ‘b: ID documents (Global: 13.73% LATAM: 37.5%).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two most common other factors that deter players from completing onboarding were an ‘Extensive KYC process’ (Global: 60.78% LATAM: 100%) and a ‘Complex and lengthy registration’ (Global: 54.90% LATAM: 75%).</p>



 All onboard: All eyes on Brazil. 



<p>The grey areas in which many LATAM countries’ gambling communities exist has meant that onboarding processes have historically either been non-existent or light touch; perhaps requiring players to just submit a name and address. As KYC and identity verification is the cornerstone of any trustworthy customer-business relationship within a regulated market, this will change dramatically. In the highly anticipated market of Brazil, for example, onboarding will become more complex than it’s ever been. Practically overnight (likely one night at the end of 2024), operators will be required to perform a three-step identification process, each of which carries a unique challenge.</p>



  Due to each Brazilian region having its own form of identity document, operators will need the capability to process a wide range of different documents<br>  Another requirement for operators is the ability to verify citizens’ Cadastro de Pessoas Físicas (Natural Persons Register) number<br>  Biometric verification will also be mandated, with weekly facial reverifications to become a requirement  



<p>“Although such measures have long been in place for financial services, for many Brazilian gambling operators and players, these onboarding requirements will be completely new, so it’s important that operators are able to comply with regulations while still offering an attractive-enough user experience to ensure players migrate over from the grey market to the regulated market,” said Rayissa Armata, Director of Global Regulatory &amp; Government Affairs at IDnow.</p>



 5 LATAM countries to place your bets on in 2025. 



 Brazil&nbsp; 



<p>Perhaps the LATAM market with the most potential, Brazil&nbsp;will roll out the particulars of its new gaming policies in a series of ordinances released in four phases throughout the coming months.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first phase (featuring the technical, payment and security requirements operators must follow) wrapped at the end of the April. The remaining three stages will be held throughout May, June and July:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stage two:&nbsp; AML/KYC and bettors’ rights;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stage three: Technical and security standards and advertising;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stage four: Industry contributions to social responsibility clauses;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As such, the Ministry of Finance will implement the approved sports betting by the end of July 2024, and operators will have six months to become compliant in order to participate in LATAM’s largest gambling market. Perhaps most eagerly anticipated, Brazil issued an ordinance on May 22 that allows operators to apply for licenses to offer sports betting and online gaming.</p>



 Peru&nbsp; 



<p>Peru has a long-standing relationship with gambling and is one of a few South American countries to have allowed local and international companies to operate online casinos and betting sites. In October 2023, Peru decided to introduce new gambling rules and licenses for local and international operators. Testament to the size of the market is the fact that Peru’s Ministry of Foreign Trade and Tourism <a href="https://igamingbusiness.com/legal-compliance/licensing/peru-receives-145-licence-applications/">received 145 requests for operator licences</a> within the first 30 days. Read more about the gambling market in Peru in our blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/peru-gambling-regulation/">‘Open for business: Understanding gambling regulation in Peru.’</a></p>



 Argentina&nbsp; 



<p>The LATAM country with perhaps the most confusing regulatory environment (and that’s saying something) is without doubt Argentina. The main cause of the confusion is the fact that Argentina does not have one national regulatory body, and instead cedes control to each of its 24 autonomous jurisdictions. As two thirds of jurisdictions have legalized gambling, it makes for <a href="https://www.vixio.com/insights/gc-argentina-enacts-decree-raising-taxes-online-gambling">16 different regulatory regimes</a> throughout the country. Although differences between regimes are negligible, operators need to ensure they comply with each and every requirement to serve different region’s customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that Germany used to have a similar arrangement, with 16 different states offering unharmonized gaming requirements. Now that Germany has a central Gaming Authority operating under one gaming regime, the expectations are high that operators and gamers are moving away from the black market. Of course, it may take time to reap the benefits of a harmonized regime but considering stricter global requirements on Anti-Money Laundering and the roll out of digital identities, new regulations and digital services are here to stay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>[Read more about Germany’s challenge with the black market in our blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/exploring-black-market-gambling-in-germany/">‘Exploring black market gambling in Germany’.</a>]</p>



 Chile 



<p>In Chile, it’s not a question of ‘Will they?’ but more a case of ‘When will they?’ finally pass gambling regulation. Like many LATAM countries, until that happens, offshore operators have stepped into the void, circumnavigating domestic regulatory restrictions to offer gambling services to Chilean players. This will all be set to change when the Senate finally gives the green light to regulations. As said, when that will be is anyone’s guess (it was supposed to be finalized by 2023), but it is likely to be later this year or early 2025. For now, and for Chile’s Senate and National Congress, it’s back to the drawing board to find a resolution, in particular, regarding the <a href="https://casinobeats.com/2024/03/08/developments-continue-for-online-gambling-framework-in-chile/">legal status of operators currently offering services</a>.</p>



 Colombia&nbsp; 



<p>In Colombia, the <a href="https://practiceguides.chambers.com/practice-guides/gaming-law-2023/colombia">GGR generated from online gambling exceeded $56 million in 2022</a>. The industry is regulated as part of the Columbian Gambling Act 2002, which organizes the administration and control of the industry at both national and regional level. In this regard, the gaming industry in Colombia is considered a monopoly.</p>

 A story of debugging, despair and data integrity, where booleans in a DataFrame hold dark&nbsp;secrets  Introduction <p>As part of <a href="http://predictoor.ai">Ocean Predictoor</a>, users are able to make money predicting token price trends. Of course, to enable reliable predictions, our dev team constantly works on improving the toolset. Crafting reliable and fast access to large amounts of data is not an easy task, and often we encounter puzzles like the one I’m about to show&nbsp;you.</p> In the name of&nbsp;speed <p>Recently, our team has started leveraging <a href="http://duckdb.org/">DuckDB</a>, an SQL database management system for fast in-memory data access. Coupled with <a href="https://pola.rs/">Polars</a>, a lightning fast DataFrame implementation, this gives predictoors a competitive edge. But what about tradeoffs? Speed matters, but not if it requires sacrifices to data integrity and precision. Which is why we run regular integrity checks and CI&nbsp;pipes.</p><p>One rainy day, an interesting issue popped up in one of our builds. It was definitely… mysterious. No one could reproduce it locally. But we relentlessly hunted it, cornered it and squashed it, albeit sometimes questioning our own&nbsp;sanity.</p><p>And while no bard will sing about the time booleans turned random and the valiant developers SSH-ed into Github Actions… well, it’s still a story of&nbsp;triumph.</p> A cute, harmless DataFrame <p>I will not use real Predictoor data to demonstrate, since those structures are still being developed. Instead, I will use this regular, vanilla, completely harmless data frame that shows people and&nbsp;apples:</p><p>The schema is inferred automatically from the data itself, so Polars knows that names are strings and ages and update timestamps are ints. It also shows our booleans just as they should be. The Arrow representation is uniform and nothing seems out of the ordinary.</p> To filter or not to&nbsp;filter? <p>Given our vanilla example above, a simple filter can and will change this idyllic situation. Let’s filter our DataFrame by age. And… you know what? I think everyone from Alice to Fiona deserves to stay with us. Everyone’s age is under 100, so filtering should produce an identical DataFrame. Right?</p><p>First, it seems so. Our filtered DataFrame looks identical to our unfiltered one. All its values are the same. But what if we look even&nbsp;closer?</p><p>Well, first, the arrow representation of the data frame is a bit off. You can see some weird grouping for each column, but it shouldn’t be of much concern. But then, we try to see what DuckDB sees, and suddenly most of our false values become true.&nbsp;Ayyyyyy…</p> How does FALSE become&nbsp;TRUE? <p>We must be dreaming. Let’s look at the data again, just to make&nbsp;sure:</p><p>Our Dataframes look the same, each value is equal to its counterpart, but DuckDB seems to think something else. That is because DuckDB uses the arrow representation of the DataFrame, which has splintered our contingous DataFrame into four different chunks. Polars represents its data in memory by contiguous allocation, but when we filtered the data, this left some… scars. Those scars are invisible to the naked eye, but indeed, calling n_chunks() on the filtered dataset gives us four different chunks. Same data, but organised differently under the&nbsp;hood.</p> What is happening under the&nbsp;hood? <p>So, what happens when DuckDB gets a hold of those chunks? The chunks represented by [false] are evaluated as boolean true, i.e. lists containing at least an element. Our “invisible scars” suddenly turn into a critical issue! Boolean values become unreliable, and we could end up saving the wrong value to persistent storage, via&nbsp;DuckDB.</p><p>Much of this is happening “under the hood”, so it’s difficult to figure out. But, luckily, the fix is very easy. After filtering, we simply run a rechunk() to make sure the memory is reallocated and everything is uniformly in&nbsp;place:</p> “Never tell me the&nbsp;odds” <p>Please note that this only happens on some architectures, only if large values are used as part of some columns (like the int64 here), only if chunks happen to contain single [false] values that unexpectedly evaluate to true. Filtering doesn’t always result in chunking, but keep in mind that lazy functions such as chunked reading from a file or vstack-ing DataFrames do have this chunking effect, which is almost invisible.</p><p>Yes, this perfect storm of corner cases is improbable. Alas, in programming, odds are irrelevant. If it can happen, it will happen. Murphy strikes&nbsp;again.</p> Conclusion <p>The moral of the story is to of course always inspect data for integrity, expect the unexpected when it comes to representations by 3rd parties and… keep a level head. Booleans do not go rogue overnight. It’s just a matter of finding out who told them to&nbsp;“rebel”.</p> About Ocean, DF and Predictoor <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>There's a post that hasn’t left your mind since you read it, and now you want to send it to a friend… but you can't find it anymore. We’ve been there before too. Let’s dive into all the tips and tricks for advanced Bluesky search!</p>
<p>Over time, we’ll make these features easier to use directly within the Bluesky app. Think of these as advanced features!</p>
 Find a specific phrase 
<p>Use quotes around keywords, like <code>"hello world"</code>.</p>
 
 Results include posts that use the phrase in its alt text on images as well. 
 
 Find posts with a specific hashtag 
<p>Any term that has the <code>#</code> prefix will show you posts with that tag. For example, if you searched for <code>#hello</code>, you’d see all posts that contain that hashtag.</p>
 Find posts that mention a specific user 
<p>Search for a handle like <code>@jay.bsky.team</code> to see posts that mention that user (in this example, Jay). If the user has changed handles, you may still get posts that mention their previous username too.</p>
 
 <code>to:jay.bsky.team</code> or <code>mentions:jay.bsky.team</code> also show posts that mention the user. 
 <code>mentions:me</code> will show you posts that mention your username, if you’re logged in. 
 If you use quotes around the username, like <code>"@jay.bsky.team"</code>, you will see results that include the text <code>@jay.bsky.team</code>, whether or not it actually tags Jay’s account. 
 
 Find posts from a specific user 
<p>Use <code>from:jay.bsky.team</code> to see posts from that user (in this example, Jay). If you’re logged in, you can use <code>from:me</code> to show your own posts.</p>
 
 You can use a combination of these keywords. For example, <code>to:jay.bsky.team from:me </code>shows my own posts that mention Jay. 
 
 Find posts that mention or are from you 
<p>If you are logged in, you can use the <code>me</code> keyword or search for your own username.</p>
 
 <code>from:me</code> shows your own posts 
 <code>mentions:me</code> shows posts that mention your username 
 
 Find a specific URL 
<p>Paste in a URL to see posts that have also shared that URL.</p>
 
 To see all posts with links from a specific domain, use <code>domain:example.com</code>. For example, searching for <code>domain:npr.org</code> shows you all posts that have linked an NPR article. 
 
 Find posts in a specific language 
<p>Use the keyword <code>lang</code> to search for posts in a specific language.</p>
 
 Use the two-character ISO language code. Wikipedia has a handy chart <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes">here</a> — use the codes under the column “Set 1.” 
 For example, to see posts in English that have the keyword <code>"science"</code>, use the search term <code>lang:en "science"</code>. To see posts in Japanese that have the keyword <code>"science"</code>, use <code>lang:ja "science"</code>. 
 
 Find posts within a specific date range 
<p>Specify your date range with <code>since:</code> and/or <code>until:</code>. You can use full dates (YYYY-MM-DD format), or full UTC timestamps (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ).</p>
 
 This currently does not work for local datetime/date or other time formats. Please use the UTC date. Here is a <a href="https://www.utctime.net/utc-time-zone-converter">timezone converter.</a> 
 
 Searching while logged in 
<p>We can customize your search results for you more when you are logged in, though users that are logged out are also able to search Bluesky.</p>
 
 You can use the <code>me</code> keyword when searching for your own posts or posts that mention you. 
 People that you follow are prioritized in search results when you search for accounts. 
 
 Developer API 
<p>Bluesky’s search API allows HTTP query params for most of these facets and filters. Read more in the developer documentation <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/docs/api/app-bsky-actor-search-actors">here</a>.</p>
